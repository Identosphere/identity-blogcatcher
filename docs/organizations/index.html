<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>My journey has been far from a straight line. I have a BA in political science from the University of Alberta and a masters in African Studies from the University of Oxford. Since finishing my education, I’ve worked in multiple sectors and countries. I started in student journalism, shifted to the non-profit start-up space working on community development with a social justice lens and dabbled in academia for a bit. Eventually, I settled into public relations in Nigeria for 4+ years. Upon moving back to Canada, I spent time in customer experience strategy for a power utility before joining the Saskatchewan government, first as the director for digital citizen services and now for digital ID.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?</p>



<p>I’ve never quite had a dream job but I always knew I wanted to make a positive impact in people’s lives and somehow do my part in making the world a better place. That’s why I am so drawn to the public sector.</p>



<p><br></p>
 
 
 


<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>I’m extremely fortunate to say that I’ve had very few challenges on account of my gender identity. That said, I’ve grown up in professional environments where the gender balance is more prevalent. I have heard enough horrendous stories from other female leaders to know that my experience is not the norm. My barriers have more come from age, especially in my earlier years of leadership. As a young leader people consistently assumed I knew less and could do less. We often undervalue our youth as a society and this is something I consistently remind myself of as I work with the next generation of youth.</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Work life balance is sacred to me, as is my respect for deadlines, and those two things can often come into conflict. My general rules for myself and my teams:</p>



  Work to outcomes. Be clear on your deliverables and get the job done. But in doing so, set boundaries and prioritize.  Ask for help in doing this if you need it. We only have 8 hours in a day and weekends and evenings should be exceptions, not the expectation.  Take your holidays! Payouts and carrying over should be exceptions not the norm.  


 
 
 
<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>Tech doesn’t have to be intimidating (look at my background!) and tech also doesn’t have to mean being a developer. But I do believe that, love it or hate it, tech will continue to grow ever more central to our society. Dig into your passion and spend the time to understand how technology is impacting, shaping and changing that space. If the actual technical details aren’t for you, look to the concepts, outcomes, and impacts that technology has to offer and dig in there.</p>
 



 

 
 
 


<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Lift people up. Lift people up. Lift people up.</p>



<p>This goes for all voices that need more prominence in our organizations, not just women. Take the time on projects, in meetings etc., to give space to those who may not naturally take it themselves. This can come in many forms:</p>



  End meetings with a round table.  Work with a teammate or colleague to help them find professional outlets to develop their passion.  Be a mentor and a coach.  Offer public praise and private – and always constructive feedback.  If you have a hand in assigning resources, prioritize diversity. Diverse perspectives always benefit an organization and provides opportunities to lift people up.  



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you? </p>



<p>Women are a very diverse group and our challenges are not homogenous. For those like me, who have faced very little discrimination on account of their gender identity, the challenge will continue to be to recognize and use that privilege to widen the conversation and create space, not just for other women but for all those along the gender spectrum. We cannot become complacent that equality for some women is equal to equality for all.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Find your passion. Hone your strengths. Dig into the details, stay outcomes focused and curious, and always, always stay open to feedback.</p>

<p>This is a transcript of a keynote originally delivered at the 2021 Stefan A. Riesenfeld Symposium, <a href="https://globalspeechunderpressure.com/">Global Speech Under Pressure</a>. The video of the speech can be viewed&nbsp;<a href="https://globalspeechunderpressure.com/recordings">here</a>.</p><p>Thank you so very much: both for this incredible honour and for these kind words. And thank you to everyone who is joining us today via Zoom or the livecast — I am deeply grateful that you are making the time to engage with us on the many important topics we will be discussing at the Symposium today and tomorrow. To me the honour to kick us off with a few words, so let me do&nbsp;that.</p><p>Freedom of expression is an important right in and of itself. It plays a key role in our societies as an enabler of democratic debate, in holding our leaders to account, and it is crucial for truth finding. It is a fundamental right for us as individuals: expressing our views, convictions and beliefs is a central aspect of our self-determination.</p><blockquote>…expressing our views, convictions and beliefs is a central aspect of our self-determination.</blockquote><p>Freedom of expression also is a basic right for us as we act and organise in groups: it allows us to share information with each other, exchange views and opinions, and debate matters that concern us all. The American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman Frederick Douglass summed up the important role freedom of expression plays by saying that: “To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker. It is just as criminal to rob a man of his right to speak and hear as it would be to rob him of his&nbsp;money.”</p><p>But one of the things that makes freedom of expression so especially important is the way in which it facilitates the enjoyment of other fundamental rights. Here, it is obvious to think of the role of the press in bringing wrongs to light and thereby helping the enforcement of human rights standards. And the press, often referred to as the “lifeblood of democracy”, is indeed crucial. However, what I am getting at is something more all-encompassing. It is the interconnectedness of the different human rights acknowledged in international and national frameworks, and the role freedom of expression plays in that constellation as a facilitator.</p><p>This special role that freedom of expression plays as a supporting right inevitably also has its drawbacks.</p><p>Because freedom of expression underpins and is so closely connected to the exercise of other rights, it is also open to exploitation for the purpose of undermining, abusing or even destroying these other rights. Put very simply: if you can make good things happen, it also offers an opening for bad things to happen. Today, I want to look at some examples of the benefits of freedom of expression in this facilitating and supporting role, and also reflect on some of the challenges it&nbsp;brings.</p><blockquote>Because freedom of expression underpins and is so closely connected to the exercise of other rights, it is also open to exploitation</blockquote><p>In doing so, I want to take a slightly broader view than many of us have the liberty of taking day to day, confronted with a world in which — currently by necessity due to the pandemic — we are living significant parts of our lives online. Much focus is placed at the moment on the challenges that technology and social media bring for freedom of expression — and human rights in general — in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>In doing so, we don’t always properly take into account that the right — which the drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights wisely framed as applying without frontiers and as a right that can be exercised through any means — already has a history of having been tried and tested through a variety of contexts and rapid societal developments.</p><p>When I say this, I by no means intend to downplay the novelty of the developments we are seeing unfold at the moment, nor the speed or scale at which this is happening. But I do want to emphasise that the human rights framework has made it through a lot already and it is my view that it will be able to withstand this,&nbsp;too.</p><blockquote>…the human rights framework has made it through a lot already and it is my view that it will be able to withstand this,&nbsp;too</blockquote><p>Another aspect I want to place squarely within the frame before we enter into the panel discussions today and tomorrow (which I am very much looking forward to), is that the way freedom of expression plays out in different contexts, online and offline, is a manifestation of the choices we make as a society and the power structures that govern it. This is a consideration that I don’t think is always sufficiently taken into account. Too often the focus in our debates about free speech in the digital age lies in dealing with symptoms, rather than reflecting on their root&nbsp;causes.</p><p>To illustrate these points, I want to highlight three contexts in which we’ve seen freedom of expression facilitate other rights in both the offline and online contexts: publishing, protest, and the fight for LGBTQ rights. After that, I’ll conclude with some reflections that we can jointly look at in more detail during the various panel conversations of the Symposium.</p> Examples of Freedom of Expression as a Facilitating Right <p>The Impact of Printing and Digital Publishing</p><p>The ability to express ourselves in writing and to share those writings with others has facilitated a great deal of other rights and advances in our societies over the centuries. It has helped the promotion of freedom of religion, the right to health, the right to rest and leisure, education, culture, and generally allowed us to share ideas and scientific discoveries across frontiers when we were not yet able to text or e-mail each other in&nbsp;seconds.</p><p>To start with its offline variety: the printed word has been referred to as one of the “Four Great Inventions” of ancient China, alongside the compass, gunpowder, and papermaking. When the German goldsmith Gutenberg adapted the technique in the 15th century, it made printing more affordable, easier to use, and more accessible. Historians often note the printing press’ significance as an “agent of change” throughout history, including during the Reformation, Renaissance and Scientific Revolution.</p><p>The printing press also provided more general access to the written word, which in Europe had been the domain of universities and the church. Universities and church institutions managed libraries and if books needed to be reproduced, this was done by making careful copies by hand. These books were mainly written in Latin, which made them inaccessible to anyone who did not master the language, even if they were literate.</p><p>As printing made the production of written texts at scale so much easier and affordable, it became lucrative to start printing works in languages that were accessible to those outside of ecclesiastic and academic circles. By starting to print in languages other than Latin, “regular” languages were standardised. It also facilitated the creation of communities around commonly read works to discuss their&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Of course, this did not mean that anyone was able to get printed whatever they wanted. Governments were able to restrict what did and did not get printed, and the workings of the “market” also made sure that not just everyone was able to see their ideas published and circulated.</p><p>Prior restraint, a form of censorship that allows government to review the content of printed materials and prevent their publication, was, and in some countries still is, a reality. Just like the practise of banning certain books on grounds such as national security, or for being perceived as obscene or blasphemous. Here, it is good to keep in mind that even books we would deem fairly innocent now, such as Alice in Wonderland, Ivanhoe, and Oliver Twist, all have been banned by various governments at some point in&nbsp;time.</p><p>Besides government interference, “access” — a concept I always find hard to define, but which speaks volumes about our ability or inability to effectively get to those with power in our societies — to a large extent determined who got to publish. A lot of power lies in the hands of the publishing industry, whose decisions of what “audiences” will want to read are made by teams and individuals that, according to recent survey data, still are predominantly white, cis-gender, straight and able-bodied. This inevitably has led to an underrepresentation on the shelves of our public libraries and bookshops of authors that do not fit that&nbsp;picture.</p><p>The arrival of digital publishing and online self-publication has shaken up the publishing landscape to some extent, in the sense that the lower barrier for “access” and the lower cost of publishing mean that authors have more options to get their work out in public now that this no longer is the same as getting “printed”.</p><blockquote>The new publishing landscape also allows for marginalised groups to create their own platforms to fill a gap left by mainstream publications</blockquote><p>The new publishing landscape also allows for marginalised groups to create their own platforms to fill a gap left by mainstream publications and reach a wider, more international audience than would be possible with, say a physical “”, the nonconformist, self-published booklets made by&nbsp;hand.</p><p>This does not mean that we’re now, in the digital age, completely free from the power dynamics and censorship at play in traditional printing and publishing. First, the traditional barriers that exist for those who are systematically excluded remain: think of the time, space and resources it takes to write in the first place. The “room of one’s own” and money to support themselves that Virginia Woolf argued women needed in order to write was accessible only to a privileged few.</p><blockquote>…we should all wonder if bypassing a publishing house to directly e-publish on Amazon truly is a win for the free&nbsp;word</blockquote><p>Second, digital publishing brings its own specific drawbacks with it. The website of an online Zine can be geographically blocked, doxxed or taken down; and we should all wonder if bypassing a publishing house to directly e-publish on Amazon truly is a win for the free word, trading traditional publishing houses as gatekeepers for a trillion-dollar capitalist behemoth.</p><p>The Galvanising Effect of Seeing Civil Rights&nbsp;Protests</p><p>Freedom of expression has traditionally been closely linked to the right to protest and the right to assembly. We organise and take to the streets to express our views on matters we believe should change in our societies, to get those in power to listen to us and, sometimes, even to tell them to step down. An important role in this is played by the media, and nowadays by us as citizen journalists and activists.</p><p>Gil Scott-Heron said that the revolution will not be televised, but television did play an important role in advancing the fight for civil rights in the South of the United States. Dr Martin Luther King Jr. understood the role the press and television could play in the civil rights movement by helping make visible to audiences across the United States — where, by the early 1960s, about 90% of households had a television set — what the Black experience in the country was. In their history of television news, Unsilent Revolution, journalists Robert Donovan and Ray Scherer wrote that “The civil-rights revolution in the South began when a man and the eye of the television film camera came together, giving the camera a focal point for events breaking from state to state, and the man, Martin Luther King Jr., high exposure on television sets from coast to&nbsp;coast.”</p><p>This attention from the media is often credited to have helped activists and politicians push for the adoption of key legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in&nbsp;1965.</p><blockquote>…the news we get to see and read about entails editorial choices, as does the way in which it is presented to&nbsp;us.</blockquote><p>There are also some critical notes to be placed here, of course. Not only is who gets to broadcast determined by a licencing system, which is administered by the state; the news we get to see and read about entails editorial choices, as does the way in which it is presented to us. We’ll talk about the theoretical aspect of that in a moment, but I want to note here that the way in which events in the South were covered and the imagery of resistance that was spread was to a large extent shaped by the needs of the then-new television stations and their desire to connect with a wide audience across the US. I think I do not need to make explicit what the makeup of those news stations looked like — today, still, diversity within broadcasting and news companies is lamentable.</p><p>Social activist and civil rights movement leader Julian Bond summed up the media’s approach at the time as follows: “What the media craved was a steady diet of bold mass action campaigns in the streets, ideally faced by violent white resistance, which could dramatize the issues at stake and make good print or electronic copy.”</p><p>The television networks had a clear idea of what their viewers wanted to see, and this resulted in an imagery of Black suffering, combined with extraordinary restraint in not responding in kind to any violence endured. This means that other narratives and perspectives of the fight for civil rights, which was of course a lot more complex than the TV version, did not get a place on prime time television. To come back to Gil Scott-Heron: to the extent that the revolution was televised, it was only a small part of it, curated and made presentable and palatable for a predominantly white audience.</p><blockquote>…to the extent that the revolution was televised, it was only a small part of it, curated and made presentable and palatable for a predominantly white&nbsp;audience</blockquote><p>If television was the medium that controlled audiences at scale in the 1960s, social media platforms perform that function in our current day and age. And of course especially since the COVID-19 pandemic took on a global scale in early 2020. Here, we are not dependent on a state body granting broadcasting licenses or newsroom making editorial choices, but what we do and do not see appear in our timelines is just as curated, and guided by the terms of service on which social media platforms operate and the algorithms that make sure items either end up “trending” or quietly slip out of&nbsp;sight.</p><p>There are many examples of social media playing a role in organising protests offline, of which the street protests against structural racism and police violence against Black people and people of colour last year is a recent and vivid&nbsp;example.</p><p>The Black Lives Matter hashtag and movement was born in the summer of 2013, when labour organiser Alicia Garza responded on her Facebook page to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the man who murdered Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</p><p>Following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, the Black Lives Matter movement swelled in numbers, with protests not only taking place across the United States, but also internationally. Social media facilitated much of the organising and allowed information, images and videos of protests to be instantly shared with millions worldwide.</p><blockquote>The live protests built on social media and after people took to the streets, the violent response to some of the demonstrations was livestreamed for all the world to&nbsp;see</blockquote><p>Another protest that we saw in 2020 was the #EndSARS demonstrations in Nigeria. The movement had started in 2017 to protest against police brutality in the country by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and was reinvigorated in October last year after new abuses were brought to light. The live protests built on social media and after people took to the streets, the violent response to some of the demonstrations was livestreamed for all the world to&nbsp;see.</p><p>This online sharing of information — photos, protest details, livestreaming videos — is also where the greatest vulnerability lies for movement organising. Surveillance becomes easy with so much information at the ready and it is something governments have made grateful use of and, of course, a variety of private companies have been able to monetise. By monitoring messages and images posted on social media, sometimes through the use of fake user accounts, and combining that with other information, it is possible to identify upcoming protests and even individual protesters.</p><blockquote>Surveillance becomes easy with so much information at the ready and it is something governments have made grateful use&nbsp;of</blockquote><p>While the FBI needed to get Attorney General Robert Kennedy’s approval to place wiretaps on Dr King’s home and offices in an attempt to discredit him and destroy his reputation, no such measures are needed when surveilling movements through public social media posts. The same information that helps us mobilise in the streets can be collected and turned against&nbsp;us.</p><p>Supporting the Fight for LGBTQ&nbsp;rights</p><p>Freedom of expression ties in with the fight for equal rights of LGBTQ people in many ways. Amongst others by bringing to light inequalities and calling for them to be addressed; through organising and demonstrating, as we just touched upon; and by supporting the expression of individual identity.</p><p>Just like exposure was important for the civil rights movement to get racial inequalities examined and addressed, it is important for many other rights movements to see their cause featured in the media. But: who decides what makes it into the morning paper and the evening&nbsp;news?</p><blockquote>But: who decides what makes it into the morning paper and the evening&nbsp;news?</blockquote><p>A well-established media theory is that of “Hallin’s spheres”, developed by journalism historian Daniel C. Hallin in the late 1980’s. Hallin divides the world of political discourse into three concentric spheres: the middle circle is the sphere of consensus, which concerns topics on which there is widespread agreement. In the sphere of consensus, journalists assume everyone agrees. There is not a lot of exciting material for them to cover there, but it is also not kept out of the press. The next circle is that of legitimate controversy, topics on which people hold differing views. These topics are the most important to cover for journalists: there will be a lot of interest in them and journalists can help facilitate an informed debate. The outer circle is that of “deviance”, a label we wouldn’t really choose anymore nowadays, and those are the topics that fall outside the bounds of legitimate debate. Journalists are free to ignore these topics in their coverage. What falls within these categories shifts as public opinion shifts, which of course raises a bit of a chicken and egg question on how public opinion can shift if no one is reporting on certain&nbsp;issues.</p><p>For a long period of time, LGBTQ issues were part of the third circle we just looked at: they were not reported on at all in mainstream media or only to a limited degree, and then often negatively. In response to a nationwide demand in the United Kingdom by lesbians and gay men to be able to access news on the gay and lesbian liberation movement, the newspaper Gay News was founded in 1972 in a collaboration between former members of the Gay Liberation Front and members of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality.</p><p>The paper played a key role in the struggle for gay rights in the 1970s in the UK. Described as the movement’s “debating chamber”, the paper reported on discrimination, progress that was made in the fight for political and social equalities, and campaigned for further law reform, including equal rights in employment and the trade union movement. It also published personal ads, even though this was illegal at the time, under the headline “Love knoweth no&nbsp;laws.”</p><blockquote>Overcoming the obstacle of publishing alone is not enough: if you want to also reach your readership, your paper will need to be distributed</blockquote><p>Overcoming the obstacle of publishing alone is not enough: if you want to also reach your readership, your paper will need to be distributed. And this is where Gay News ran into difficulty a number of times. It had repeated clashes with W.H. Smith, which controlled one-third of the newspaper and magazine distribution in the UK at the time and who initially refused to stock the paper due to an alleged “low potential for&nbsp;sales”.</p><p>In countries like the UK, distribution is less of a problem these days for LGBTQ publications. In addition to self-published online Zines as touched upon earlier, big commercial publishers like Condé Nast have started to take on intersectional queer publications like the community platform them. To speak with Hallin’s circles: they are no longer part of the “outer” circle. This is not to say that the playing field is even now, but the landscape is starting to&nbsp;change.</p><blockquote>Social media platforms more generally have served as spaces for community building, information sharing and organising for queer communities</blockquote><p>Social media platforms more generally have served as spaces for community building, information sharing and organising for queer communities. It is not entirely a rosy picture, however. While there is no need to rely on a conservative establishment to get content distributed, like Gay News had to if it wanted to effectively reach its audience, social media platforms bring their own obstacles. Content “moderation” is often skewed against queer expression, and platform policies, such as Facebook’s real name policy, which effectively forces transgender persons to use their dead name if they want to be able to access the platform, are highly problematic. Going online also doesn’t mean it is possible to fully escape government censorship: platforms tend to comply with local “gay propaganda” legislation like we see in, for example Russia, and take down LGBTQ content or suppress related hashtags and search&nbsp;results.</p><p>Freedom of Expression and&nbsp;Power</p><p>We just looked at publishing, protest, and the fight for LGBTQ rights, and how freedom of expression facilitates — and sometimes hampers — other rights both offline and online in those contexts. Now, before we move on to the panel discussions, I would like to share some further reflections on where we are with freedom of expression at the moment and what I believe we should be thinking of as we navigate the digital landscape.</p><p>At the outset of this talk, I said I did not want to downplay the challenges we are facing at the moment, with most of our lives moving online and the exercise of our human rights along with it. And it is of course a reality that the exercise of many of our rights are now taking place on private platforms.</p><p>But: the question how we hold “big business” to account for human rights violations is also something we have struggled with before speech moved online. We are all too familiar with the images of, for example, big oil companies destroying wildlife and the livelihood of farmers through their negligence, as well stories about the use of child slavery in the production of our food, clothes, and smartphones. And while the conversation about corporate social responsibility and business and human rights is still very much ongoing, there are some positive lessons we can draw on for rethinking responsibility and accountability when it comes to corporations.</p><blockquote>…the effectiveness of any of this, whether it is the responsibility of the Shells, Exxons or Facebooks of this world, will depend on political will.</blockquote><p>In the end, though, the effectiveness of any of this, whether it is the responsibility of the Shells, Exxons or Facebooks of this world, will depend on political will. How far are our societies, the governments that we elect, willing to go to guarantee that human rights are upheld, guaranteed and protected?</p><p>The main challenge is of course how the human rights framework is set up, which is state-centric: the state has a number of obligations — to respect, protect and fulfil human rights — vis-à-vis individuals. We are not yet at a stage where direct horizontal effect of human rights, which would allow individuals to seek redress for human rights violations from another individual directly, including from actors like companies, is a&nbsp;fact.</p><p>So for the moment, we will need to work within the framework that we have, which means that human rights enforcement against companies and corporations, including the platforms on which much of our public debate takes place nowadays, will have to go via the&nbsp;state.</p><p>And this brings us back to the question of power dynamics: as individuals, we are dependent on the state and the international systems that states have created to see our human rights respected. Who actually gets to seek redress is a matter of access to justice, which is by no means equally distributed. The quip that “justice is open to all, like the Ritz hotel” still very much holds&nbsp;true.</p><p>This is what often makes me a bit anxious about the discussions on “regulating platform power”. Especially when these discussions point towards putting in place more legislation, I get very nervous. As some of the examples we just looked at demonstrated, and the overall picture around the globe when it comes to protecting free speech and journalism shows, government is often the problem and not the answer when it comes to stifling the free flow of information.</p><blockquote>Especially when these discussions point towards putting in place more legislation, I get very&nbsp;nervous</blockquote><p>Take an example like the NetzDG legislation in Germany, which makes it mandatory for companies like Facebook to remove “hate speech” from its platform or risk hefty fines. Enthusiastically copied by countries across the world, often by countries that do not have a good track record when it comes to protecting free speech, and often modified to expand the type of speech that should be taken down, this type of legislation has been shown to incentivise an overly zealous approach to speech removal. Putting the wrong type of pressure on platforms, and giving governments more power to suppress expression is not the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>If we are talking about regulation, I am much more in favour of thinking in the direction of parallels to the way another powerful private sector, that of banking and finance, is regulated. This would include putting in place stringent transparency obligations: what is taken down and promoted online and why; how are these processes and decisions automated? It would need to be combined with clear and accessible procedures for people to seek redress for perceived violations within an acceptable timeframe (as “justice delayed is also justice denied”…).</p><p>My main qualm with theorising about “solutions” for the conundrum of online speech regulation, however, is that we must ensure to not mistake the manifestation of a problem for the problem itself. Our societies have big, structural problems: power asymmetries that maintain structural inequalities, institutional racism, capitalism. Whatever we create in that setting, including internet platforms, will reproduce that.</p><blockquote>…while it’s nice to think we can “fix the internet”, I believe we should have no illusions of succeeding beyond symptom suppression if we aren’t willing to look&nbsp;deeper</blockquote><p>So while it’s nice to think we can “fix the internet”, I believe we should have no illusions of succeeding beyond symptom suppression if we aren’t willing to look deeper at the root causes of why it’s broken in the first place. If we accept societies in which those whose human rights are routinely violated generally won’t be able to easily seek justice, how do we expect to do better when it comes to safeguarding their human rights&nbsp;online?</p><p>You have heard me be critical of our societies and its power structures and I imagine some of you might be asking the question: “But wait: what about the human rights system itself? This, too, is a product of those same power structures and interests.” This is a very good point, and one I often struggle with, especially when I am reminded of Audre Lorde’s quote that “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s&nbsp;house”.</p><p>Where I stand on this at the moment is a belief that we need to combine a longer-term, aspirational vision with a certain degree of pragmatism. Even if our human rights framework may not be perfect, it is a good place to start to fight for our rights as individuals and as communities. And while we do so, we can work on changing the system itself in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>In doing this, we have to continue to be mindful of the broader impact our work has. Will taking up this particular fight lower barriers for others or increase them? Are we trading individual success for common good? This will entail making difficult choices at times, in which especially those of us who are lawyers and litigators will need to set our egos aside and look beyond short-term wins and ask what structural, systemic change we want to work towards in the longer&nbsp;term.</p><p>Coming back to the right to freedom of expression, and the role it plays in facilitating not only other human rights, but also the very struggle for their realisation, I want to make one final&nbsp;note.</p><blockquote>Progress, especially if we want it to lead to addressing some of the fundamental power inequalities I mentioned before, requires vigorous debate and sometimes fiery disagreement</blockquote><p>And that is that it is important to make sure that, whatever we do, we don’t end up with a lowest common denominator approach or a restrictive interpretation of what a good space for debate is. Progress, especially if we want it to lead to addressing some of the fundamental power inequalities I mentioned before, requires vigorous debate and sometimes fiery disagreement. When I say this, I am not arguing for a right to insult, but rather for a right to provoke. Professor, feminist, and social activist bell hooks expressed this wonderfully in her 1994 essay “Censorship from Left and Right”, and I would like to close with her&nbsp;words:</p><p>“When repression via censorship becomes the norm in progressive political circles, we not only undermine our collective struggles to end domination, we act in complicity with that brand of contemporary, chic fascism that evokes romantic images of unity and solidarity, a return to traditional values, while working to deny free speech and suppress all forms of rebellious thought and action. In recent years, feminist thinkers have fought long and hard to make feminist thinking, theorizing, and practice a radical space of openness where critical dialogue can take place. Much of that struggle has been waged by women of color, beginning with the conflict over whether or not to see issues of race and racism as feminist agendas. Feminist movement, black liberation struggle, and all our progressive political movements to end domination must work to protect free speech. To maintain the space for constructive contestation and confrontation, we must oppose censorship. We remember the pain of silence and work to sustain our power to speak-freely, openly, provocatively.”</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://digitalfreedomfund.org/the-great-facilitator-free-speech-and-power-online-and-off/">https://digitalfreedomfund.org</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-great-facilitator-free-speech-and-power-online-and-off-9651b38c4803">The Great Facilitator: Free Speech and Power, Online and Off</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The 3 properties of the Blockchain&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain is a trust system made possible by technology by removing the human factor, which is always the weak link.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This trust needed within a Blockchain network is made possible by three key characteristics inherent in the technology in question:&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Decentralisation</p>
<p>– Immutability</p>
<p>– Distribution</p>
<p>For each of these three properties of the Blockchain, it is possible to imagine some examples of specific use cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralisation&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Blockchain ledger is shared among multiple participants. This ensures transparency between participants in the Blockchain network nodes without the need to have a central authority controlling it Decentralised trust: all Blockchains are trusted services, this trust does not only apply to transactions but extends to data, services, processes, identities, business logic, terms of an agreement or physical objects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It applies to almost anything that can be digitised as a (smart) asset with an intrinsic or related value </p>
<p>Decentralised infrastructure: Blockchain can also be seen as a software design approach that binds together a number of computers that commonly obey the same ‘consensus’ process to release or record information they hold, and where all related interactions are verified by cryptography.</p>
<p>Decentralised database: Blockchain destroys the paradigm of current proprietary databases. A Blockchain is like a place where you store semi-public data in a space. Anyone can verify that you put that information there, because the container has your signature, but only you can securely unlock what is inside the container, because only you have the private keys to that data.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m very grateful for the opportunities provided to me as an employee of RBC. The bank has created a fast paced environment where I truly learn something new each day. I’m constantly challenged to grow in my role, something I find very rewarding as I know it’s because my team sees potential in me.</p>
<p>This type of environment is something I never thought I’d be able to find in a role that doesn’t require me to travel extensively. I’m very fortunate that I can develop my my career each day while still being home in time for dinner with my family each night.</p>
<p>My work allows me to be my best self in all aspects of my life and that’s what drives me to get out of bed.</p>
 
How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Throughout my career, I’ve been in many different roles – systems administrator, business analyst, technical lead, project manager and project control officer. The wide variety of experiences has really helped me understand how these various functions work together technically.&nbsp; More importantly, I’ve learned many power skills from the people that I’ve worked with. Each person we meet has a story to tell and a lesson to teach.</p>
<p>In one of my first corporate roles, my supervisor was a former submariner, obviously carrying a superhuman level of diligence that I try to incorporate into my own work. There we shared a manager who taught us the importance of being calm and approaching things rationally in every situation.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, I’ve had an amazing manager and mentor, Melissa Carvalho, who has taught me what it means to be agile. Melissa has taught me to always be prepared with facts and data surrounding every situation so we know when to push and when to pivot. This has allowed me to accomplish more and deliver higher quality work than I honestly knew I was capable of.</p>
<blockquote>
 It’s much more important to learn what works for people before learning processes or technology.<br>
What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
</blockquote>
<p>Another mentor I’ve learned a lot from taught me about working with people in unique environments. Every environment is truly unique. As non-unionized employees in a union environment, we needed to learn very quickly how to be aware of and always respectful of the protections afforded to our unionized counterparts. The team had a large workload and needed to comply by certain timelines to ensure they were following their commitments to the union too. With limited time to get to know everyone and learn the roles I’d be helping them with, I found that it’s much more important to learn what works for people before learning processes or technology.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>I want to focus on continue here…Continue setting baselines and benchmarks to ensure we’re all held accountable to providing equitable opportunities. Continue facilitating discussions on how we can build better products that work for all of our clients. Continue cascading these messages into the workforce.</p>
<p>I know we still have so much work to do, but I’m very inspired by the conversations I’ve had in recent months. A lot of questions after previous WiD engagements centered on why diversity matters. In the past year, there’s definitely been a shift. People are now asking how they can be a part of creating diverse teams and providing equitable opportunities.</p>
 
In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>In terms of technology, diverse workforces create better solutions that work for more people. More importantly, diversity brings a richness to our lives that make us all better, stronger, more creative and more compassionate.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>We’ve been looking at a lot of art over the past year- almost like a tour of museums from home. I’m currently reading about Burhan Doğançay (1929 – 2013), a Turkish-American artist probably best known for his works turning graffiti and signs posted on urban walls into modern art. I love that art transcends time and provides a geo-political view of the past.</p>
  
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Work on time management and develop a better understanding of your priorities!</p>

 Tell us a little bit about what you do in the world of identity 
<p>My current role is Director, IAM Business Systems Analysis at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). In this role I oversee a team of Business Analysts who are assigned to work on the various solutions we implement to help centralize the bank’s internal enterprise Identity and Access Management</p>
<p>Another service I oversee is the enhancement process, basically managing requests to enhance and innovate the solutions that support our various objectives. We also manage the Intake process for new capability requests across the many IAM services to ensure they align to our roadmaps and strategic direction.</p>
<p>More recently we have started to focus on Customer IAM (CIAM) and my team will support these initiatives that look to centralize not only our enterprise IAM but also CIAM within the bank. It’s a really exciting development for us as it aligns to such a core focus for our industry.</p>
<p>I can certainly say no two days are the same!! There are so many moving parts. Recently, I have been handling the organizational change management responsibilities for the IAM services we work on, which has added an exciting new layer not only for me but for the wider team.</p>
<p>What I really love most about my role is the combination of self-growth opportunities, the people I work with, the organization as a whole, the great leadership I have experienced,&nbsp; Leading a team of amazing and resilient individuals, I am so proud to be able to support their career growth and development,</p>
<blockquote>
 Diversity helps establish a better sense of community, ensuring everyone has a seat at the table. 
</blockquote>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Firstly I had to remove any self-doubt and trust that I was capable.</p>
<p>Although I have been in the IAM space for 10+ years, I came in with no experience or formal training and that was scary. Much of what I know I learned on the job but I was also fortunate to have had a number of great leaders and mentors. Here I want to call out Melissa Carvalho, Her knowledge and expertise really motivated me. Thanks to her and my other mentors I became a sponge just absorbing everything they taught me. I am convinced that has contributed to getting me to this point, encouraging me to continue to grow and learn.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>To ask questions and encourage questions, feedback, recommendations and input.</p>
<p>We may have always done things a certain way&nbsp; but it does not always mean this is the only way. Being curious allows us to find efficiencies and improvements. It helps build a culture of creativity and thought leadership, driving and seeking change.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>As we focus on identity trends from advancing MFA with adaptive authentication, AI, biometrics or even self-sovereign identity, challenge the status quo.&nbsp; Do not rush into digital identity solutions without the backing of a diverse team who can help address the wide range of issues faced by our users.</p>
<p>Continue to focus on diversity within this space, to make room for different opinions and drive new discussions.</p>
<p>Stop looking for specific, pre-defined skillsets and start and/or continue to provide opportunities for candidates from outside our sector and ‘different’ backgrounds. Different people bring different perspectives which is exactly what we need if the identity sector is to thrive.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Because it broadens our perspective and allows for a variety of viewpoints that inspire me. I see real creativity and innovation come through from our teams but, more importantly, diversity helps establish a better sense of community, ensuring everyone has a seat at the table.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80240086">RBG (Ruth Bader Ginsburg)</a></p>
<p>This documentary is so powerful and moving and gives a real insight into the life and personality of this amazing woman who drove so much change around women’s rights.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>When a plan does not work out the way you envision, don’t let it stop you!</p>
<p>Adapt to change; failure is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Look at the lessons it taught you, rather than the setbacks or discomfort you felt.</p>
<p>And, finally, fall forward and use it to build your resiliency tool kit!</p>

And most importantly, how can the builders of new platforms that also intend to bring the world closer together, give everyone the power to create or organize the world’s information, do it&nbsp;better?”</p><p>BKC fellow <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jad-esber">Jad Esber</a> posed these overarching questions at the start of a Berkman Klein Center <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/hindsight-2020">event</a> that looked back on online platforms over the past 30 years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Fake">Caterina Fake</a>, the founder of Flickr, <a href="http://www.bohnettfoundation.org/david-bohnett-bio/">David Bohnett</a>, the founder of Geocities, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/baym/">Nancy Baym</a>, Sr. Principal Research Manager, Microsoft Research, joined Esber to reflect on early platforms, the state of newer platforms today, and what they could look like in the future. Their conversation covered topics including subcultures, content moderation, and the evolution of technology.</p><p>Fake and Bohnett are themselves founders of early popular platforms, and early in the discussion, the panelists highlighted the significance of founders’ values shaping the platforms, and how that trend continues today.</p><p>“You can do a lot to influence and change and manage how a community grows and develops from the outset,” Fake said. “And so much of it is based on the personalities of the founders: what they value, what they don’t value, how they design the software,” she said, also pointing out the important role of business&nbsp;models.</p><p>“I paid a lot of particular attention to the values of building communities of interest,” Bohnett added, highlighting that founders’ values also play a critical role in the inclusiveness of platforms. “Do the founders and the early settlers or participants in these communities value inclusiveness and diversity through their actions?” he asked. “That’s what helps foster&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Baym, in turn, emphasized that values may be harmful in the long run. “They’re essential but I think that we see platforms over and over kind of lose their way when it becomes about the founder’s values,” she said. “And one of the ways I think that they go really wrong is that early on their users who are different from the founders who were running into real problems with those platforms and the users are going, ‘hello, there’s this really bad thing happening to me here.’ And the founders for whatever reasons are not fully able to absorb what they’re hearing about the dangers their platforms are posing. And I don’t mean to underestimate the technical and human labor demands of trying to deal with all of that adequately. They’re very, very hard problems.”</p><p>The discussants also talked about the shift from free services that run on users’ data towards fee-based platforms and how these business models may shape or inform user behavior and investment in the online communities.</p><p>“I do think that people are evolving into a kind of a paid model in reaction to a lot of the exploitation that they’ve suffered under for a long time. And as a result of that, I think, these are obviously very positive trends,” she said, citing Patreon and Substack as examples. “I do think Internet business models swing back and forth between the paid and the free and it’s a pendulum swing that many of us, I think that work in kind of online social systems actually welcome to a great degree. So, I do think that the behaviors are different on platforms that you pay for for all of the reasons David and Nancy have already kind of explained.”</p><p>But the pay-to-play model is not an option for everyone, Baym noted. “I think the trick with platforms you have to pay for, of course, is that we want people who don’t have excess income to be able to participate in online communities,” she said. “So we have to think through how do you enable that so that people in poverty are not getting a third rate internet while the rich folks get the really good community, which of course exacerbates wealth and&nbsp;equity.”</p><p>A podcast version of the event is available <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/hindsight-2020">here</a>.

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/webinars/future-of-work/"></a>Scotland is facing a population crisis. 
<p>As the <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland-s-rural-communities-to-lose-quarter-of-their-population-1-4709834">Scotsman reported</a> in 2018 Scotland’s rural communities face losing up to a third of their working age population by 2046, losing more than a quarter of their population within the next thirty years, with Western Isles, Argyll and the Southern Uplands among the worst affected.</p>
<p>“A report by the James Hutton Institute found that “sparsely populated areas” – defined as those where fewer than 10,000 people can be reached within 30 minutes of travel – account for almost half of Scotland, but just 2.6 per cent of the population live there.”</p>
<p>It’s not unique to Scotland. In Spain they are selling off whole ‘<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-29/ghost-villages-for-sale-as-spain-fights-rural-desertification">ghost villages</a>‘.</p>
 Workers on Tap – Tapping into the Gig Economy 
<p>The answer is the ‘<a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/gig-economy">Gig Economy</a>‘.</p>
  
<p>These refers to the overall trend of employment shifting more to contracting self-employed freelancers, a trend that the Economist described as <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2014/12/30/workers-on-tap">Workers on Tap</a>.</p>
<p>The Cloud is enabling the ‘<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-on-demand-economy-2014-7">On Demand Economy</a>‘, exemplified by ventures like Uber taxis and Airbnb. These ventures disrupt traditional industries by overlaying a ‘digital mesh’ across cities to better harness their idling resources, like available accommodation for rent or freelance taxi drivers looking for work.</p>
<p>“Every week, new services launch that aggregate and organizes freelancer labor (those with excess time) to help those who have money but not time.”</p>
<p>On Forbes.com <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abdullahimuhammed/2018/06/28/4-reasons-why-the-gig-economy-will-only-keep-growing-in-numbers/#495a263811eb">Abdullahi Muhammed writes</a> how by 2020 half of all American workers will be freelancers. NACo provides a <a href="https://www.naco.org/featured-resources/future-work-rise-gig-economy">detailed report</a> on the same trend.</p>
<p>Sites like <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">Freelancer.com</a>, <a href="https://www.abodoo.com/">Abodoo</a>, <a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/">Peopleperhour</a> and <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a>, among many others, all offer marketplaces where you can hire workers on tap.</p>
<p>For some sectors like tech it’s increasingly becoming seen as the norm for an employed engagement; many leaders recognizing simple ideals like how <a href="https://www.inc.com/brian-de-haaff/3-ways-remote-workers-outperform-office-workers.html?cid=sf01001">remote workers outperform office workers</a>.</p>
 The Future of Work 
<p>It’s not a new idea, also back in 2004 Thomas Malone wrote about the coming <a href="http://ccs.mit.edu/futureofwork/">Future of Work</a>, and long before that the original visionary Charles Handy described how our employment will evolve to become ‘<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/nov/10/economicdispatch.money">portfolio working</a>‘. Malone said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Imagine organizations where most workers aren’t employees at all, but electronically connected freelancers living wherever they want to.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Handy offers a blueprint for how to practically structure such a virtual team that we will implement, describing a ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_organization">Shamrock organization</a>‘.</p>
<p></p>
 Digital Enterprise Centres 
<p>Interestingly the trend does not dictate entirely individualized, work-from-home scenarios, indeed the key point for rural communities looking to attract this work force is that it works best with some office facilities, provided very locally.</p>
<p>Digital Enterprise Centres are ‘Co-working’ places of work, simply offices rented in small units to one person or more at a time, so that they can enjoy the benefits of those facilities but without having to pay for the entire place.</p>
  
<p>Their role as economy enabling hubs is key – While the Gig Economy is inherently about individuals working alone as freelancers, often via online virtual tools and booking methods, there is still considerable value in facilitating physical collaboration.</p>
<p>This is one of the key recommendations made by the Scottish Rural College, to unlock £2.5 billion in growth for the nation through better digitally enabling our rural communities, where they describe them as “Digital Enterprise Centres”, with the recommended action being:</p>
<p>“Establishing hubs in rural towns which businesses can use or visit for better connectivity, start-up workspace, hot-desk space and training.”</p>
<p>A key dynamic is of course connecting to the Digital Economy – These work spaces provide the ‘tools of the trade’, enabling new micro-businesses to participate in a variety of online digital markets.</p>
<p>We can see them as essential foundations for the Gig Economy, when you consider factors such as the challenges for employers looking to utilize them on a large scale, challenges such as <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-create-belonging-for-remote-workers/">helping to create belonging</a>, through a better program of support for how managers can <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-managers-can-best-support-a-gig-workforce/">best support a gig economy workforce</a> remote workers.</p>
<p>Coworking centres can contribute towards these goals as shared office environments are ideal for cultivating mentorship and support environments, and is also a sound business model in it’s own right – The gig economy has been driving an explosion in <a href="https://angel.co/newsletters/cash-is-pouring-into-co-working-100418">demand for coworking office space</a>.</p>
 Conclusion – Quality of Life 
<p>For towns seeking to retain and attract young workers and their families this is how to do it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sharemyoffice.com/blog/item/38-are-rural-coworking-hubs-the-future-of-the-rural-economy">This Sharemyoffice article</a> suggests Rural Coworking hubs are the future of the rural economy, and they’re right, and in her <a href="https://medium.com/remote-office/rural-coworking-is-a-thing-2251e720f943">Medium article</a> describes why:</p>
<p>“Also if you work in a small team, the bonds made in rural coworking spaces tend to be stronger, since in these situations you normally live and work from the same place. Whether that includes, hikes and bike rides, swimming or surfing, skiing or rock climbing, living outside of the cites allows us to reconnect with the nature — which is what most of us need from time to time.”</p>
<p>Thousands are moving out of the cities to <a href="https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/money/how-get-by-800-month-london-netherlands/">enjoy a better quality of life</a>, and with Scotland’s rural areas like <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/scotland/orkney-islanders-best-quality-life-uk/">Orkney offering the very best of this</a> across the entire UK, there is a uniquely powerful perfect storm of opportunity to promote Scotland as the best nation in the world for digital living and working.</p>

<p></p>
 For years now, the way we work has been rapidly digitised and distributed. 
<p>Some have been at the forefront of this trend. However for many, the onset of Covid-19 accelerated this change and organisations everywhere have found themselves facing barriers with on-premise legacy technology as they tried to embrace this new norm.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.cobry.co.uk/">Cobry</a>, we have always encouraged people to work in new, modern ways and push boundaries. As <a href="https://www.cobry.co.uk/what-is-the-cloud/">Google Cloud</a> partners, all of our work takes place on <a href="https://www.cobry.co.uk/g-suite/">Google Workspace</a> (formerly G Suite) – Google’s business productivity platform. Luckily for us and our clients, Google Workspace equipped us with the tools to truly prosper in a work from home setting. This meant that as we had to part ways with our bonnie office in Glasgow almost a year ago, our transition to working from home was pretty seamless.</p>
<p>We have reflected on our use of Google Workspace as a distributed team over the past year and have shared some tips on how your organisation can implement these tools to succeed from any location. We hope that if you are already on Workspace then this article will provide you with ways to enhance your use of the tools; and if Workspace is new to you, then you gain some insight into how great the platform truly is. First though, for those who fall into the latter category let’s discuss what exactly Google Workspace is.</p>
 What is Google Workspace? 
<p>Google Workspace is a cloud based IT system built specifically for business. Its core apps provide you with everything you need to get anything done all in one place. These include Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Chat and Meet, to name a few. All of which are designed to foster communication, collaboration and productivity no matter where you are.</p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/introducing-google-workspace">Google Workspace rebranded itself</a> from G Suite in late 2020 to reflect the transformation that was happening in organisations all over the world. For many, work is no longer a physical place we go to and valuable interactions with colleagues are now largely happening online.</p>
<p>Google’s vision (through Google Workspace) was to create a highly integrated platform that allows people to spend time on what really matters and foster human connections no matter their location. With consistent updates and additions to their core features, it is clear that Google is succeeding in its mission to solve the unique needs and challenges of a broad range of customers.</p>
<p></p>
 Google Workspace – Simple, Secure, Flexible 
<p>Security has never been more important as our world of work becomes ever more digitised. Unfortunately, this want for security oftentimes has resulted in tools becoming unusable and inflexible. On Google Workspace, however, this is not the case. Google is constantly innovating in order to deliver top level security features that help you create flexible and bespoke Workspaces.</p>
<p>No matter your organisation’s device strategy, Google Workspace provides a world of quick and easy security wins that ensure your data will always be safe and secure. For example, Google Workspace operates on a Chrome browser-first approach, meaning that all work is carried out on the browser. As a result of this, there is no need to download tools or data onto your local device.</p>
<p>This, in turn, eradicates the possibility of downloading viruses onto the device. Moreover, Google Chrome’s sandboxing technique will protect your organisation’s data online. This is a technique in which each tab operates in a restricted, isolated environment. Therefore, if a tab is exposed to malware, the other tabs and the rest of the machine won’t be affected.</p>
<p>And this is just one example. Through the Admin Console, there are quite literally hundreds of security settings that you can customise in order to suit your unique business needs. No business is the same, and Google recognises the importance of providing security features that mould to your organisation and use of the tools, not the other way around as is quite often the case.</p>
<p>So, that’s Google Workspace in a nutshell. We’ve made our case for why we believe it to be a secure and flexible workspace platform that enables effective communication and collaboration – irrespective of device or location. But don’t just take our word for it, let us prove it too. Read on to discover just some of the Google Workspace features that make it such an amazing platform.</p>
 Cobry’s Top 5 Workspace Tips 
 Structure your day with Google Calendar 
<p>Setting daily routines creates structure, increases productivity and helps you reach your goals. Although that is easier said than done, especially when we’re mid pandemic and so far away from what was normal only a few months ago. Google Calendar has some great features that will help you structure your day and work better with your colleagues.</p>
 Working hours 
<p>Within Google Calendars settings, you have the option to specify your working pattern. This includes setting start and finish times as well as days. By setting your working hours, your colleagues will be able to see the days and times that you work, and will know not to book meetings or events with you during these times. Therefore, when you are off duty, you can dedicate your full time to relaxing and doing the things you love.</p>
<p></p>
 Time Zones 
<p>If you have colleagues dispersed over different countries, this is a super handy feature for you. In your calendar, you can display a primary and secondary time zone, as well as up to 5 world clocks. This means you can quickly and easily check your colleagues’ local time and plan meetings or catch ups accordingly.</p>
<p></p>
 Collaborate in real-time with Docs, Sheets and Slides 
<p>Each of Google’s productivity apps provides the opportunity to collaborate and communicate with your teammates quickly and effectively. Using the comments feature in each of these apps, you can discuss the work at hand and assign tasks to one another without ever leaving that tab.</p>
<p>Additionally, suggesting mode allows you to edit pieces of work without changing the original content. Your suggestions will appear in green text alongside the original content and will automatically appear as a comment. This allows you to work through edits as a team and provokes discussion which will result in high quality work.</p>
 Work synchronously with Google Meet 
<p>Despite working in what is becoming an increasingly digital and dispersed world, there really is no substitute for face-to-face communication. Google Meet is a video conferencing solution which gives you the opportunity to work and communicate with your colleagues at the same time. Meet is great for initiating projects, working collaboratively and having valuable discussions.</p>
<p>Additionally, Google Meet offers a range of tools and features to enhance your video experience. For example, you can enable captions in a variety of languages to ensure that everyone on the call can keep up with discussion, as well as audience tools such as polls and Q&amp;A which heighten engagement.</p>
 Chat with Google Chat 
<p>Unfortunately, for just now, stretching across the desk to ask a quick question or spontaneous discussion in the office isn’t possible. Instead, communication with your colleagues is now a much more deliberate and thoughtful process conducted through email or video calls as just discussed. These tend to be clunky and time consuming processes with long response times – not always the best conditions for inspiration.</p>
<p>This is where Google Chat comes in. Google chat is an instant messaging service which provides the potential for informal and spontaneous communication. You can chat to an individual, create group chats or even use rooms to communicate and collaborate with larger teams or in departments. At Cobry, we find using chat is the best way to facilitate quick and off the cuff discussion – some of which, we must admit, is not entirely work related.</p>
<p>What’s more, if these conversations quickly spiral and provoke creativity and inspiration, which is often the case at Cobry, you can start a Google Meet call from chat.</p>
 Stay social with the tools 
<p>It’s not all work here at Cobry! We are a close knit group and whilst we miss our epic ping pong battles in the office, we have ensured that our shenanigans somewhat continue in the virtual world.</p>
<p>Each Monday and Thursday morning we jump on a Google Meet call and spend 30 minutes catching up with the rest of the team. During this half hour discussing work is forbidden and patter (Scottish for banter) is mandatory! This is a great way to keep in touch with everyone and get some valuable social time.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>So, by reading this, we hope that we’ve managed to impart some of the things we love about Google Workspace upon you. At Cobry, we have spent over a decade experiencing and working with all of the amazing features of Google Workspace.</p>
<p>The platform and its tools elevates our working lives and has been the solid foundation on which each and every member of our team has been able to prosper whilst working from home. If you’d like to learn more about Google Workspace and how we can help, please don’t hesitate to <a href="https://www.cobry.co.uk/contact/">get in touch</a>.</p>

 Monday morning used to be pretty hectic. From waking up early to make a cup of coffee and to rush for work, we did all of these in a real fast hurry. 
<p>Things are a bit different now. While those of us lucky to be working are now doing so from a spare bedroom or a kitchen table, the Coronavirus has forced a sudden pivot to working away from the office.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the circumstances are unwelcome, there are some benefits to this style of working. Now we have a more content workforce, a more motivated workforce, and also a more productive and efficient workforce as well. So when the Coronavirus is behind us, will our workday ever be the same again? That’s an important question.</p>
<p>We spend a lot of our time traveling to work and for most, the commute is getting longer all over the world. Globally, two fifths of professionals consider the commute to be the worst part of their day. Commuting has been found to be a major cause for stress that impacts on our physiological health and as well, wellbeing.</p>
<p>The total working day gets longer, one gets less time at home also less exercises. When someone have long commutes then that person cooks less healthy food. Before the pandemic, approximately 25 million U.S. workers spent more than 90 minutes getting to and from their jobs every day. In South Korea, one in four workers has a journey that long.</p>
<p>But research claims our commute can also provide us with a means to separate our personal and professional lives. In a world of 10-second bed-to-laptop commutes, that’s a chance for some ‘me time’. But while journey times were already generally on the up, more of people were actually starting to commute less. It’s due to ‘Flexible working’. Increasingly most people have seen people remote working from lots of different locations.</p>
<p>There has been a reluctance to encourage flexible working, perhaps because managers see it as a loss of control, it can be quite difficult to manage people who you don’t necessarily see on a day-to-day basis. There might be concerns around efficiency or productivity.</p>
<p>What researchers have found is that productivity can actually improve as a result of flexible working. There isn’t necessarily any impact upon the business, if it’s managed effectively. There’s quite a lot of benefits. There is an opportunity for workers to have more autonomy over their scheduling, over when they work and where they work.</p>
<p>When people have that degree of autonomy, it does lead to a workforce that is happier.</p>
<p>A two-year Stanford study of 1,000 employees at one company found that working from a home office resulted in a 13% increase in productivity and 50% of them were less likely to quit. Despite this, half of them still wanted to go back to the office nine months later, even though their average commute was 40 minutes each way.</p>
<p>Another survey conducted by Bain and Company on its own employees, found that productivity increased for some due no commute and an ability to focus better at home, but also decreased for others due to a lack of work mindset and a dedicated workspace.</p>
<p>Our changing relationship with work could affect where we live, too. It could accelerate a move to what’s known in urban planning theory as the ‘polycentric city’. Polycentric city would be a place where you can work, you can live, you can recreate, you can have your social life, your family in a more local and distributed way.</p>
<p>In cities like Paris, it’s known as the 15-minute city, where daily necessities are within a 15-minute reach on foot or by bike. One can reduce transit times, GHG emissions and also one can provide more equitable, more sustainable access to services by this more distributed city model. Companies will need to support workers in that externality and it could take many forms.</p>
<p>Does everyone wanna work from home? No, some people like going to a place, commuting. In soon, we are going to see a whole range of new types of work as people have gained confidence in the efficiency of work from home during this time.</p>
<p>Since the virus outbreak, there are many companies are getting positive results. For example, serviced office brand Regus has already seen a surge of more than 40% in activity in New York City commuter hub southern Connecticut.</p>
<p>In the U.K., house builders are seeing developments outside of London driven by a change in home office working. While experiences and jobs vary all over the world, many workers have come to expect change. More than 90% of people in a recent survey said they wouldn’t return to the office full time after COVID. There are reasons for employers to embrace the change too.</p>
<p>Twitter and Facebook have said the switch could become permanent for large parts of their workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic has sent shock waves through the world of work. Having an on-off relationship with the office could make us happier and more productive, while also helping the environment and making our cities more livable.</p>

<p>DIACC is hosting a series of spotlights showcasing our amazing female DIACC members in the digital identity space, noting the importance of diversity. These spotlights will be regularly socialized through DIACC’s LinkedIn and Twitter channels as well as our monthly member newsletters.</p>



<p>If you’re a DIACC member and would like us to feature your spotlight, <a href="https://diacc.ca/contact-us/">contact</a> us today to learn more!</p>


 
 
 
<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>During my 15 year of career, I’ve had opportunities to work for leading firms including Wall Street institutions. My career is shaped by experiences with Aon/Hewitt, Wachovia/Wells Fargo, Fannie Mae, Bank of Tokyo, and Brown Brothers Harriman. I’ve played different roles including Software Engineering, Business Analysis, and Product Owner. Following my passion towards entrepreneurship, bootstrapped blockchain startup vlinder a couple of years ago. It’s been an exciting journey – startup life has given me exponential learning.</p>
 



 

 
 
 


<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?</p>



<p>Technology was gaining significant prominence back then and I wanted to perform a high-tech job (in Silicon Valley) leading to a CIO type role.</p>



<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>Honestly, I have been lucky not to face any significant barrier through my carrier. Personally, I believe such barriers are in the mind.</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>The key is to set family time aside and not think about work during that time. In this connected world, sometimes it is hard to decouple work (e.g. looking at emails, chat channels, linkedIn from smart phone). However, with discipline and drawing the line, balance can be achieved.</p>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>Tech cannot be painted blue or pink. Tech is for the entire population, pick your leader, inspiration, and follow them. If I have to stress a particular point, taking cue from the previous question, good work/life balance can be achieved in Digital ID/Tech space (given that most of the work can be performed remotely).</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Sometimes unconscious bias may exist – it’s important to think objectively and not about why a subset of the population cannot go up the ladder. It’s also important not to pay attention to historical metrics or even how many women are in executive positions in a given organization which is not a reflection of the future that can be achieved.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>I would rather focus on the opportunity ahead of us – enterprises and the world now focus on equality and even have goals on the number of women leaders on the board. Some early indicators linking profitability and number of women leaders on the board are published.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Pursue the dream, strive for excellence, and success will follow.</p>

<p>After about one year of research and development work, the experience linked to the Self Sovereign Identity Essif project of the European Union in the field of anti-money laundering eKYC has been positively concluded.</p>
<p>eSSIF-Lab is an EU-funded project that aims to promote the wide deployment of Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) technology as a third generation, open and trusted digital identity solution for faster and safer electronic transactions via blockchain and in real life.</p>
<p>Commerc.io srl participated in the business program created to accelerate SSI-related businesses and solutions. The program included both business and technical support to integrate SSI technology with market proposals. The business focus was on a very important topic: The anti-money laundering also known as KYC/AML</p>
<p>Know Your Customer&nbsp; or KYC is an expression indicating a recognition process used by companies to verify the identity of their customers and assess potential risks or illegal intentions in the relationship with the customer in order to comply with the anti-money laundering regulations that govern these activities.</p>
<p>Commerc.io srl has developed a prototype (Proof of Concept) of an eKYC solution for the issuance of a verifiable credential on an SSI wallet of a Blockchain and CommercioID based on a bank transfer of a supervised bank.</p>

<p>The Commission on Enhancing National Cyber Security report from December 1st, 2016 emphasized the importance of securing and growing the digital economy. In line with the recommendations from this document, and in compliance with the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada’s (DIACC) <a href="https://diacc.ca/the-diacc/principles/">10 Canadian Principles of a Digital Identity Ecosystem</a>, SecureKey Technologies entered into a multiphase program with DIACC and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) to evaluate, develop, and deliver a solution for enabling distributed privacy enhanced identity ecosystems.</p>



<p>This paper summarizes the work done as part of Phase 3 of the program, concentrating on the “Commercialization of the Verified.Me project,” and building upon the recommendations from the Applied Research completed in Phase 2 which are further described in this <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DIACC_SecureKey_Phase2_White-Paper.pdf">white paper</a>.</p>

 We meet Krista Pawley to find out about her role as a&nbsp; ‘woman in identity’ …. 
<p></p>
 Tell us about yourself and your work as Co-Lead at IdentityNORTH 
<p>We started IdentityNORTH as a small group of 30 people in a conference room and we’ve now grown into a community of over 3000 leaders from all sectors dedicated to working together to build a more innovative, secure, and inclusive digital economy.</p>
<p>What gets me excited about this work is the ability to connect with some of the smartest people in tech, public policy, civil society and business on some of the biggest questions facing our our world.</p>
<p>Over the years that I have been doing this work, I have seen how our conversations have evolved&nbsp; from highly technical discussions focused on IT and workflows to a more user-centric dialogue, focused on people, privacy and leveraging digital Identity.&nbsp; We are much more focused now on how we enable a more inclusive and safe digital economy.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that we have the talent, vision, and community in Canada to lead the world in digital transformation. It’s what gets me up each morning!&nbsp; And I know we can do it in an inclusive, privacy-enhancing way that will benefit all Canadians. The ability to be part of something that makes that kind of positive impact is so exciting to me.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I have had the privilege of working at senior levels across government&nbsp; (on and off Parliament Hill),&nbsp; the private sector (financial services, loyalty, and consumer retail sector leading teams in over 50 countries) and the non-profit world (working with a global leader in education and financial inclusion). Five years ago I decided to take what I had learned over the past 20 years and turn my experience, network, and energy towards building communities of action around the big questions that have the potential to drive positive change in Canada and around the world.</p>
<p>Inspired by the leaders and mentors who guided me throughout my career, I worked with communities like IdentityNORTH, SingularityU Canada, the Atlantic Council Geo Tech Centre, and Equitas to build communities of leaders who believe that we have the tools, the technology, and the responsibility to build a better future together.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seek out the different and invite them to be part of the conversation.</p></blockquote>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>People like to be asked, and they like to be thanked. A political boss taught me that!</p>
<p>If you are looking to build a community, you need to think about who should be part of that community. Don’t go just for those you already know and who look, sound, and think like you. Invite people from different backgrounds and perspectives. Seek out the different and invite them to be part of the conversation. This is how we grow, how we learn. When people feel included, they are more likely to help you and you are more likely to learn.</p>
<p>Oh, and say thank you. Being grateful and expressing that gratitude shows others that you recognize and appreciate them. It also re-enforces your own sense of appreciation for all that is good and constructive around you. That gratitude can help see you through a lot of challenges.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>If you are looking to grow your business in the digital age, digital identity is a vital enabler of that growth. The Pandemic pushed us forward at least five years in terms of customers’ willingness to adopt and demand secure, trusted, convenient, and user-centric digital services. From e-commerce and on-line banking to healthcare and education, every sector has the potential to be transformed through digitisation. The leaders who recognize this and build tools to enable their organisations to adapt will not only survive; they will thrive.</p>
<p>CEOs and Boards need to STOP looking in the rearview mirror and building strategies and business models that imagine a future that looks like our past. They need to START thinking about the exponential technologies that are transforming our world and think about how these might impact their business and sector. This new way of leading will require both courage and imagination. They need to START seeking out truly diverse perspectives to help them imagine the unimaginable future and plan for it – because chances are what is unimaginable is more likely than many believe.</p>
<p>Lastly, they need to CONTINUE building the critical infrastructure that will enable them to seize these opportunities. Working with organizations like DiACC (Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada), Women in Identity, and IdentityNORTH, leaders have the opportunity to move ahead of the competition. Diverse viewpoints from these extended teams helps with understanding and implementing the critical frameworks and tools that will make a real difference.</p>
<blockquote><p>diverse perspectives help to imagine the unimaginable future</p></blockquote>
 
Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the key to learning. If all we ever hear are the voices of those who look, think, and feel like us, we will fail to learn and grow.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>Warren Berger’s A More Beautiful Question.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many of us have lost our curiosity; we are afraid to ask questions for fear of looking foolish. Berger shows us that the foolish thing is , in fact, to stop asking. That learning, wisdom, and growth come from the courage to ask and stay curious.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Seek out the people you admire and ask them for advice. I was too shy as a teen to do this. When I got older, I learned that many of the people I admired were kind, generous people who were happy to help when approached with a thoughtful, clear request.</p>

<p>Digital Identity NZ is entering a new phase of its journey; our superlative inaugural Chair David Morrison is joined by Ben Tairea as Co-Chair and Tamāra Al-Salim as Deputy Chair.&nbsp; You can read more about Tamāra’s and Ben’s stories below.&nbsp; The trio will lead the governance of the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council</a>&nbsp;as we navigate the next period of rapid change.&nbsp; This is also my last newsletter as Executive Director of Digital Identity NZ.&nbsp; Like David, I took on this role upon the formation of Digital Identity NZ in 2019, and after nearly 2 ½ years it is time to hand over the pleasure and responsibility to someone new.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I reflect on the last 2+ years, an overriding theme is one of interconnectedness, both technically and socially.&nbsp; The premise and promise of digital identity is more seamless and efficient ways of interacting online, whilst at the same time improving privacy, transparency, security and choice (solutions that are truly mana-enhancing).&nbsp; The words of the karakia gifted to us by Janelle Riki-Waaka (kaiwhakahaere/advisor and member of our Executive Council) are apt to the journey we are on:</p>



<p>Unuhia te pō, te pō whiri mārama<br>Tomokia te ao, te ao whatu tāngata<br>Tātai ki runga, tātai ki raro, tātai aho rau<br>Haumi e, hui e, tāiki e!<br>&nbsp;<br>From the confusion comes understanding<br>From understanding comes unity<br>We are interwoven, we are interconnected<br>Together as one!</p>



<p>We start and end all of our Council meetings, webinars and working groups with these words as a reminder of our shared past, present and future.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is much work still to be done as we collectively work on a digital identity ecosystem designed for Aotearoa.&nbsp; This is the work of Government, iwi, innovators, advocates, academics, community groups and businesses of all shapes and sizes.&nbsp; My parting challenge to us all is to continue to work in trusted collaboration for the benefit of all people in Aotearoa, and to do so with the core principles of Te Tiriti anchoring the mahi (work); kāwanatanga (honourable governance), rangatiratanga (self determination and agency) and ōretitanga (equity and partnership).</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

 Leverages the Energy Web technology stack, with an initial focus on industrial and home battery&nbsp;storage <p>Brussels, Belgium and Zug, Switzerland — 16 March 2021 — Today<a href="https://www.bebat.be/en"> Bebat</a>, the Belgian battery compliance scheme; <a href="https://over.fluvius.be/nl/thema">Fluvius</a>, the electricity and natural gas distribution system operator (DSO) for the Flemish Region of Belgium; and<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/"> Energy Web</a> jointly announced an open-source solution for decentralized lifecycle battery asset management, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/easybat/">EasyBat</a>.</p><p>Since 2006, the EU’s <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02006L0066-20131230&amp;rid=1'">Battery Directive</a> has required member countries to institute takeback schemes to ensure environmentally responsible recycling and/or disposal of post-consumer batteries. To date, lifecycle asset management for batteries has been cumbersome at best. Before EasyBat, tracking battery assets was essentially non-existent. Currently, in Belgium, the registration of customer-owned assets, such as a home battery, requires a lot of information and burdensome paperwork collection.</p><p>EasyBat aims to greatly simplify that process. The solution is built on the<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/"> Energy Web Decentralized Operating System</a> (EW-DOS) open-source technology stack and focuses on the entire battery lifecycle. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, installers, and accredited inspection and certification organizations issue and verify every relevant asset transaction. The fact that all these entities work together on a shared decentralized ecosystem is an important and never-seen-before innovation.</p><p>“By having created a decentralized digital passport, the entire logistic flow — from put-on-market all the way to reverse logistics for the takeback obligation and waste collection — is digitized on a decentralized digitally trusted ledger,” said Philippe Decrock from Bebat. “This represents a revolutionary, customer-centric solution and affirms a key business case for distributed ledger technology.’”</p><p>In recent years, battery lifecycle management has taken on heightened importance, thanks to the fast-growing adoption of customer-owned distributed energy resources (DERs), including residential batteries and electric vehicles&nbsp;(EVs).</p><p>Just last month, the European Commission<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2312"> announced the first initiative</a> (the EU Battery Regulation) under its Circular Economy Action Plan: making batteries sustainable, high-performing, and safe along their entire life cycle — thus making them consistent with the carbon-neutral ambition of the European Green Deal. This includes minimizing the environmental impact of batteries and repurposing batteries from electric vehicles and industrial batteries so that they can have a second life. The core of this new initiative is the idea of a Battery Digital Passport, which is exactly where the EasyBat solution built on EW-DOS comes into&nbsp;play.</p><p>“We’ve long focused on creating ‘passports’ for assets like batteries. This concept is core not just to our tech stack but to the evolving electricity system around the world. The European Commission’s new initiative on Battery Passports is a strong validation of the concept and sets the stage for market transformation throughout the EU. We’re excited to see it come to life in EasyBat,” said Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer for Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>EasyBat will help Bebat to easily monitor the specific data linked to the legal takeback obligations and/or extended producers responsibility (EPR) of battery manufacturers. They have an obligation to register and report the put-on-market of various batteries (including technical specifications such as chemistry/weight/modules) through the battery’s lifecycle up to the moment of collection at a battery’s end of life. EasyBat makes it possible to holistically manage customer-owned batteries (both private &amp; professional use) participating in Belgian electricity markets — including those on the Fluvius network. EasyBat heavily leverages the open-source EW-DOS technology stack, including EW Switchboard, a new interface for managing decentralized, self-sovereign identities, as well as their associated assets, roles, and permissions.</p><p>Thanks to Switchboard and EW-DOS, customers remain in control of their own identity and the information associated with their assets, such as EV, residential, commercial, and industrial batteries. They create a self-sovereign ‘digital twin’ for any assets, which third-parties such as the manufacturer, installer, and/or DSO can verify. Such a DER Passport — or Battery Passport, in EU Commission parlance — provides a shared state of the asset and its history to any pre-approved energy market participants.</p><p>For example, DSOs like Fluvius and lifecycle management programs like Bebat can monitor batteries throughout their full value chain, from manufacturing to sales to providing energy services such as grid flexibility to secondary re-use (in the case of electric vehicle batteries) to end-of-life disposal (collection, dismantling, and recycling).</p><p>“This approach extends far beyond tracking the history of every DER throughout its lifetime, from manufacturing to operation to end-of-life recycling or decommissioning,” said Bart Coelus of Fluvius. “Creating digital twins of assets, especially DERs at the grid edge, gives grid operators like Fluvius unprecedented visibility into the physical grid they manage. That digital representation of the actual grid will be the core layer of future grid operations. EW Switchboard accelerated our progress on this front, allowing us to move further, faster down the path of digitalization.”</p><p>About Bebat<br>Bebat is a Belgian nonprofit association (vzw) established in 1995 by battery manufacturers — including Duracell, Energizer, Varta and Panasonic — to enable companies to meet the take-back obligation for the Belgian market. Bebat gives new life to used batteries and ranks among the world leaders in the collection of used batteries. Used batteries can be handed in at one of 24,000 collection points, convenient and free of charge. Bebat organises their collection as well as the sorting and recycling process. In 2019 Bebat collected more than 3,600 tons of batteries in Belgium. Over the last five years, Bebat has already collected 10.000 electric vehicle (EV) batteries, which it recycles through the best recycling companies in Belgium and Europe. With the growth of waste industrial batteries, Bebat also measures to make possible repurposing, re-use of waste batteries with still-usable capacity, and responsible end-of-life disposal for spent batteries. Bebat is also part of <a href="https://www.reneos.eu/">Reneos European cooperative</a>, a network of Europe’s top national battery collection systems, including GRS Batterien in Germany, Stibat in the Netherlands, Batteriretur in Norway, and Cobalt in Italy. The Reneos network covers 20 EU countries.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://www.bebat.be/en/homepage">https://www.bebat.be/en/homepage</a>.</p><p>About Fluvius<br>Fluvius is the network operator created on 1 July 2018 by the merger of Eandis and Infrax.

<p>I’m pleased to announce that the OpenID Foundation has <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/12/fapi-1-0-part-1-and-part-2-are-now-final-specifications/">published the Financial-grade API (FAPI) Parts 1.0 and 2.0 final specifications</a>. This is a true accomplishment for open banking initiatives worldwide. The Foundation couldn’t have reached this important milestone with the FAPI specification without the leadership of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> led by&nbsp;Chairman Nat Sakimura, Anoop Saxena (Intuit), Dave Tonge (MoneyHub), and a diverse group of experts with the technical chops, persistence and patience for the painstaking work of open&nbsp;technical standards development.</p>
<p>In many respects this is old news. &nbsp;Hundreds of organizations, large and small, from around the&nbsp;world, have for years adopted FAPI in the most&nbsp;important way, they’ve implemented it. &nbsp;They’ve&nbsp;implemented it after&nbsp;publicly self-certifying&nbsp;their&nbsp;conformance. In doing so they’ve confirmed:</p>
 
 FAPI is good for adoption (A standard is only as good as its adoption) 
 FAPI delivers on its promise of reliability, repeatability and security 
 FAPI is being adopted by others 
 
<p>Ultimately FAPI has reached a tipping point in the lifecycle of a standard where there is positive feedback:</p>
 
 A standard is only as good as its adoption 
 A standard’s adoption is driven by its value of the reliability, repeatability and security of its results 
 A standard’s value is measured by the number of instances of certified conformance extant in the market 
 
<p>Few areas of the increasingly noisy, fragmented global ecosystem demonstrate the importance of a standardized, certified approach better than open banking. Despite the potential, many stakeholders are still struggling to&nbsp;keep to open banking rollout schedules more than two years after the UK Open Banking Implementation Entity and PSD2 came into effect. The lack of a standardized security approach is acknowledged as a key factor in this, and one the&nbsp;OpenID Foundation is trying to right through ongoing collaboration with the American, Australian, Brazilian and European colleagues. And if standardization is essential, certification has a critical role to play:</p>
 
 Ensuring implementations’ interoperability and security, while bringing clarity and stability to a complex functional standards environments 
 Helping enforce the secure data exchanges between banks, Fintechs, and schemes to facilitate meeting the&nbsp;complex and changing regulatory requirements 
 
<p>The best way to celebrate the final publication of FAPI 1.0 is to note its <a href="https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor-fase2/">unheralded but important adoption in Brazil</a>. When visiting “Welcome to the Open Banking Brasil Portal developer area”, the references to&nbsp;Financial-grade API (FAPI) are clear even without the English translation. And there are indications of FAPI adoption in Bahrain and the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>But our collective efforts lack a home. Whether in an OIDF, FDX, Berlin Group or STET Group container there is no single,&nbsp;trusted place where anyone, at any time, at no cost can&nbsp;reliably find an&nbsp;authoritative&nbsp;listing of all open&nbsp;finance technical&nbsp;standards.&nbsp;Simply described we need a database, an online library of libraries, of all the technical standards in the open finance ecosystem. While simply described, it is not without challenges. While modest, it solves a burning&nbsp;business problem and one that requires a solution that best comes from an international collaboration of organizations, perhaps beginning with the OpenID Foundation.</p>

<p>President Biden’s ability to rebuild alliances, restore America’s standing in the world and unite the nation hinges on his ability to reign in tech giants here at&nbsp;home</p><p>By Gus Rossi, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>President Biden’s pledge to restore diplomacy as the United States’ primary instrument of foreign policy is an important and necessary shift away from his predecessor’s destructive America First approach that shunned multilateralism and jeopardized relationships with important allies.</p><p>But diplomacy alone is not a cure-all for America’s diminished standing abroad. To regain the trust of our allies and the American people, the Biden administration must wrest control of international affairs from American technology giants and into the hands of US citizens.</p><p>For decades, America’s foreign and digital trade policies had been guided by the notion that whatever Silicon Valley wanted was good for America — and for the world. That naive assumption is finally giving way to the recognition that unregulated and unaccountable tech giants pose great and literal danger for public safety, democracy, and competitive markets.</p><p>President Biden now has an opportunity to act against these&nbsp;threats.</p><p>The hands-off approach began in an era when the internet promised a free flow of information and ideas around the world. Technology, many believed, brought down autocracies in the Arab Spring with tweets instead of bombs. By unlocking social media’s organizing and mobilizing power, Barack Obama became America’s first Black president.</p><p>Democrats, including the Obama administration, were enamored by the tech industry. It helped that many tech leaders supported the administration’s priorities and gave generously to support those progressive causes. Inevitably, this love affair shaped Democrats’ digital foreign and trade&nbsp;policy.</p><p>But Big Tech has long enjoyed a cozy relationship with the executive branch, regardless of which party occupies the White&nbsp;House.</p><p>Silicon Valley has for decades pressured the US to limit the role of the International Telecommunication Union (the U.N. body tasked with setting internet, telecom, and other technical standards) so that tech companies can operate with as few regulations as possible.</p><p>In the early 2010s, the US Embassy to the E.U. lobbied on behalf of Silicon Valley against Europe’s privacy laws and promoted the APEC privacy framework, an alternative that was both toothless and&nbsp;weak.</p><p>When negotiating trade agreements, the US Trade Representative tried to include the Communications Decency Act (CDA) third-party liability shield that enables tech platforms to profit from disinformation and hate&nbsp;speech.</p><p>Both the Obama and Trump administrations consistently fought European efforts to tax tech companies.</p><p>By doing Big Tech’s bidding, US policies left consumers — and our national interest — vulnerable. The result is waning US influence across the globe and a fraying democracy at&nbsp;home.</p><p>Abroad, the EU has become the de-facto regulator of the tech economy with the 2014 adoption of its data and privacy regime, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It has since threatened to ban American companies from moving data across the Atlantic because the US does not offer guarantees for Europeans’ data. China has also seized the opportunity and is promoting its technology to manage our ally’s critical telecom infrastructure. Meanwhile, Chinese social media companies are collecting reams of American and European personal data through social media platforms.</p><p>Stateside, organized online and in plain sight across a variety of internet platforms, the failed insurrection at the Capitol was only the latest, most shocking example of Big Tech’s perverse incentive to promote disinformation and radicalization, suppress innovation, monopolize markets and other anti-democratic activities.</p><p>Fortunately, there signs that the love affair between Democrats and Big Tech is disintegrating:</p><p>Last year, dozens of Democratic state attorneys general brought antitrust cases against Google and Facebook. Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Facebook of being complicit in adding disinformation to the public debate. California, the heavily Democratic home to Silicon Valley, adopted a second landmark privacy law. The House Antitrust Subcommittee subpoenaed thousands of documents from tech titans, grilled CEOs at hearings, and published a report that outlines how to make digital markets competitive. And many Democratic members of Congress are actively considering bills to curtail the power of tech platforms.</p><p>Now, President Biden can both strengthen US democracy and rebuild relationship with allies by making substantial updates to America’s digital foreign policy including:</p><p>· Collaborate with the EU’s to develop and promote a framework for democratic governance of the tech economy, pro-competitive rules, and accountability principles.</p><p>· End trade agreements that make it harder for third countries to hold platforms responsible for promoting disinformation and hate speech. The CDA should not be exported.</p><p>· Protect transatlantic data flows and consumer data with an international agreement that commits the US to a privacy framework compatible and equivalent to Europe’s.</p><p>· Update global corporate tax rules for online companies to avoid a costly balkanization of taxation to American companies and allow third countries to collect a fair amount of taxes from the profit that companies make&nbsp;abroad.</p><p>· Diversify the State Department’s delegations to international institutions by offering travel stipends to independent academics and civil society experts to ensure corporate interests are not the only ones represented.</p><p>How we approach diplomacy abroad should reflect our values and interests at home. More than ever the world needs to hear that America and President Biden believe in the democratic governance and regulation of the tech economy for the public’s interest, not Silicon Valley. Only then will the US begin its uphill fight to restore its standing in the eyes of the world and its citizens&nbsp;alike.</p><p>About Gus Rossi, Principal, Responsible Technology</p><p>As a principal on the Responsible Technology team, Gus is focused on Omidyar Network’s work on encrypted messaging, platforms and power, and alternative business models, with a vision for technology that underpins greater individual empowerment, social opportunity, and user&nbsp;safety.</p><p>Prior to joining Omidyar Network, Gus was the director of global policy at Public Knowledge, an advocacy-oriented nonprofit that promotes freedom of expression, an open internet, and access to affordable communications tools.

		 Change or Be The Change 
<p>More clearly than before, we are seeing the recent pandemic as a catalyst and accelerator for Digital Transformation, or Dx as the term is now designated. As many higher education institutions have been on a Dx trajectory, there is now no denying that higher education’s future is digital. According to Pearson’s 2015 student mobile device survey1, 42% of college students at that time were using two or more Internet of Things (IoT) devices on any given school day. In the past six years the vast and accelerating proliferation of mobile devices on campuses now indicates that over 11.5 billion devices are exchanging data globally. The collective impact of this phenomena on how students live, work, and learn, combined with the consumerism of education and related motivations and drivers for selecting a particular higher education institution to attend, creates a survival condition across the spectrum of education that can only be met by Dx.</p>
<p>Whereas institutional leaders previously looked at information technology as a necessary cost center, the view of technology and its role in Dx is taking on a vastly different context today.&nbsp; In implementation and practice, Dx is not just about technology and “digitization” or “digitalization”, where digitization involves the transform of analog information, and digitalization involves processes. Dx is vastly more complicated and challenging, but done well results in a higher education institution that grows and thrives in today’s hyper-connected and automated world. In 2020, Educause defined Dx as “a series of deep and coordinated culture, workforce, and technology shifts that enable new educational and operating models and transform an institution’s operations, strategic directions, and value proposition.”2</p>
<p>Success with Dx efforts can have multiple barriers including lack of trained leadership in organizational change management, missing internal skill sets in business process modeling and notational form, gaps in systems thinking at an enterprise level, legacy models involving data silos, or undefined or conflicting business rules.3 The foundation for success in Dx does not involve technology as the ultimate determinant as technology, in and of itself, does not have inherent value; how institutions apply technology as an enabler of mission success is the determinant. Moreover, in today’s cloud environments, Dx transcends internal campus requirements to include network and cyber infrastructure that fully supports current and future needs and changes in information technology architectures. The importance of a defined ecology for the student lifecycle, mapped to and informed by networks and technology, has never been more pronounced.</p>

Dx is primarily concerned with the student experience, thus the importance of a defined student lifecycle ecosystem. In a recent report4, Educause noted that student success and experience was a primary motivating factor behind a majority of Dx initiatives. Six out of seven of the key drivers for Dx involved student success, and 87% of institutional respondents in their survey identified “improving the student experience” as the main driver behind institutional planning and investment in Dx. The roadmap to success with Dx is complex and difficult to achieve. There is no “silver bullet” application or technology architectural configuration that will facilitate the required transformational change. Elements of digitization and digitalization, as previously defined, are a good starting point, but without a comprehensive road map that includes strategy and planning for comprehensive and phased tectonic shifts in institutional culture, workflows, and infrastructure that enable new methods of operation and teaching and learning, most institutions will not achieve sustainable growth and financial health.</p>
<p>Key takeaways from the Dx discussion include: 1) an increasing number of higher education institutions are concerned with and engaging in Dx initiatives; 2) Dx can bring to the institution a renewed sense of optimisim about the future; 3) awareness and keen understanding of Dx most often does not reside in campus IT organizations or any collection of campus operations; 4) the impact of a successful Dx initiative has been demonstrated across a variety of college and university sectors; and 5) the two greatest barriers to success are generally reluctance to cultural change and expense. The case may well be that institutions have two choices with respect to Dx, they can change or they can be the change. Leading pre-COVID prognosticators in higher education point out that “institutions survive the challenges they face and flourish because they had a compelling vision, the ability to recognize and adapt to changing circumstances, and strong, effective leadership. With these elements, any institution can do wonderful things. Without it, institutions in any industry are doomed. Colleges and universities have demonstrated that they have a history of adapting to changing circumstances amid difficult times.”5 Now may very well be those times.</p>

<p>Contributions made by members of the DIACC’s Outreach Expert Committee</p>



<p>One of the nicest things about this pandemic is wearing our sweatpants all day, every day, while working. Right? Wouldn’t it be nice to wear sweatpants to the office, when this is all over?&nbsp;Sure, but that’s unlikely, at least if we want to keep our jobs.&nbsp;So, we choose to forgo our private sweatpants rights, to keep our more public jobs.&nbsp;Privacy and how we protect it has never been more important in our daily lives.&nbsp;Yet, a balance is necessary, between privacy and security, in our ever increasingly digital lives.&nbsp;With that, there is a rather public debate about privacy and the ethical use of biometrics.&nbsp;In particular, face biometrics can be misunderstood and feared with respect to our Right to Privacy.&nbsp;This article is an attempt to create a better understanding of it and, hopefully, reduce fear of such a promising and effective technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our use of biometrics enables our safety. At its most basic level, a biometric is a physiological trait or attribute that is unique to an individual person. When we recognize the faces of our loved ones, friends, and colleagues with our own eyes, we are using biometrics to help us build relationships and trust. Biometrics are, in a way, fundamental to human interaction and society.&nbsp;Today, biometrics can be used in person or automated, to increase convenience and security in various situations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many types of biometrics that we use daily.&nbsp;Face images are, by far, the most common.&nbsp;Any time somebody requests to see our driver’s license, passport, or ID badge, we are using biometrics.&nbsp;Most governments include face biometrics, in the form of a photograph, in their driver’s license, passport, or other national ID databases, as well as on the credential, itself.&nbsp;We use face biometrics, attached to a credential, to establish trust, when we access privileges, like driving a car, government services, commercial air travel and even buying liquor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today there is some confusion and fear about biometrics, what they are, and what they can actually do. There are only two basic functions that a biometric can perform, Identification and Authentication. When we first meet somebody, we may associate their name with their face. When we see that face we can identify that person by accessing the information in our mind. “Hi, I’m Jennifer” associates a name to face and allows us to identify them. When we arrive at a restaurant, we might scan customers to see if we recognize any of them. We identify Jennifer by recognizing their face in the crowd of people. In another instance, we can authenticate Jennifer by recalling information about them when presented with their face. If Jennifer were to knock on our front door, we can authenticate them with our own simple sight. Fundamentally these are the only two functions of a biometric. A properly designed face biometric system should include high confidence liveness checks, to differentiate between a real human face and a photo (for example) and face matching, in order to prove that a person is in fact who they claim to be. Stay tuned for our next blog where we’ll talk about liveness checks, anti-spoofing, and other methods to prevent various types of fraud.</p>



<p>In this age of information hyperbole, perhaps it’s understandable that there is some public misunderstanding of how these important technologies can and should be used.&nbsp;Big Brother surveillance and Privacy are central to debates about the ethical use of face biometrics.&nbsp;However, when examined thoroughly, we find that most, if not all of the ethical debate centers on how the biometrics are used and, more specifically, whether the biometric is used Voluntarily or Involuntarily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We tend to prefer freedom of choice, with our personal privacy.&nbsp;Sometimes we guard it.&nbsp;Other times, we agree to forgo some privacy, to access and enjoy many privileges of our society.&nbsp;For example, when applying for a credit card loan, the bank logically prefers to understand whether or not we are likely to repay the loan.&nbsp;To control its fraud and compliance risk, it requires knowing who it’s lending to and whether we are an existing customer, or potential fraudster, posing as a customer.&nbsp;So, we volunteer to divulge our private identities and backgrounds.&nbsp;We also allow the bank to compare our identity to those of existing customers, to learn if we are an existing customer or a fraudulent account holder at the bank.&nbsp;The bank Identifies us as a new customer (or not), as well as a legitimate customer (or not).&nbsp;It’s our choice to participate in this identification process, or not.&nbsp;It’s voluntary.&nbsp;If we agree, once we are approved, the bank requires us to Authenticate ourselves, every time we try to access the valuable privilege. In this case, we voluntarily relinquish our privacy Right, to get something of value in return.&nbsp;Moreover, the process includes both Identification and Authentication in a safe, productive and ethical way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, in some cases, the privilege we want to enjoy is so valuable (granting it is so risky) that the service provider may be tempted to invade our privacy, without our consent, to protect it.&nbsp;Of course, there are some bad people out there.&nbsp;The problem is that we can’t tell who is good and who is bad, unless we specifically identify them all.&nbsp;To this end, law enforcement may wish to investigate and identify everyone within a certain group, like those walking down the street.&nbsp;The City of London, England, for example, installed CCTV cameras on most city street corners, to survey walkers-by for criminal activity.&nbsp;Moreover, the CCTV system was equipped with biometric facial recognition technology, to learn if any passers-by were in the criminal mugshot database.&nbsp;The City used Involuntary face recognition surveillance to Identify anyone in the field of view.&nbsp;Innocent passers-by had no choice but to submit to such a surveillance investigation and many view this as a clear violation of privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar to any tool, there is nothing inherently ethical or unethical about face biometrics, however these tools must be used responsibly.&nbsp;In a voluntary scenario, both Identification and Authentication can be important functions when used to protect our privacy and enable privileges that could not be offered without the presence of a human authentication method. This can help break down barriers to accessing government services or performing international business (by using authentication to reduce instances of fraud) or even protecting your own assets by granting access to your files via authentication of your unique profile. However in an involuntary scenario, potentially unethical&nbsp;scenarios exist that require deep conversations and eventually regulation about the balance between safety and privacy.</p>



<p>Understanding the difference between Voluntary and Involuntary facial recognition is a foundational issue that is helping us set the boundaries for the ethical use of biometrics by both governments and businesses. How that data is stored and used are all tied into this same problem. While there is nothing inherently ethical nor unethical about face biometrics, understanding and regulating its acceptable use is an important step to building public confidence in this trust enabling tool.</p>

 With necessity being the mother of invention, an <a href="https://summit.digitalscot.live/talks/covid-19-technology-innovations/">upcoming webinar</a> will explore the technology innovations being pioneered in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and what potential for Scottish ventures this presents. 
 Vaccination Passports 
<p>A flagship use case is ‘Vaccination Passports’.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/21/1015353/covid-vaccine-passport-digital-immunity-record/">MIT asks</a> if you will have to carry this on your phone, where it might function like an actual passport, being shown as you arrive at airports, and could also act like a work authorization at your job, or a pass to get into restaurants, bars, and shopping malls.</p>
<p>Highlighting the type of issues that need addressed such as a <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/travelers-using-counterfeit-covid-test-results">booming black market</a> in fake test results that is diminishing trust in printed records and driving demand for cheat-proof digital documents, they define the medical and technology challenges and nature of this opportunity:</p>
<p>“There are a lot of players in the field, including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson-health/health-pass-puts-privacy-first/">IBM</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://thecommonsproject.org/">the Commons Project</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">Covid Credentials Initiative</a>. </p>
<p>They’re coming at the problem from different angles but are ultimately chasing the same goal: let people share required information about their health, while protecting other private information. Yet it’s still too early to rely on any of these for a fast and widespread solution.”</p>
<p>Many governments, as well as airlines and other businesses are trialing or in talks to build “health pass” apps, which let users ask participating labs and health systems to send authenticated test results and other data straight to the app, bypassing verification concerns.</p>
 Scotland’s Opportunity – A Digital Healthcare Ecosystem 
<p>To begin zeroing in on the specific opportunity for Scotland, we can first identify the core technology challenge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Connecting any systems across borders means navigating a patchwork of languages, databases, and privacy laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>This highlights the work of Scotland’s <a href="https://nds.nhs.scot/about/">NDS team</a>, who are building the ‘National Digital Platform’, the technical architecture which ensures that key things are only done in one way across Scotland such as how people are identified and where clinical data is stored.</p>
<p>As they explain <a href="https://nds.nhs.scot/blog/the-national-clinical-data-store/">here</a>, their National Clinical Data Store (NCDS) is storing vaccinations data and being made accessible to healthcare staff, via their <a href="https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/42708/turas-vaccination-management-tool">VMT app</a>.</p>
<p>“Under the bonnet, the VMT sends copies of the records of immunisations to the&nbsp;NCDS. For those that may be interested, this is achieved using a “FHIR API” based on the&nbsp;<a title="Opens new window" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core">UK FHIR Core</a>&nbsp;Immunisation Profile. A FHIR API is essentially an industry standard way of sharing digital health data.&nbsp;The&nbsp;NCDS can then&nbsp;securely share citizens’ immunisation history records to other services, again using a FHIR API.”</p>
<p>As we’ll explore in the upcoming and future webinars, Scotland’s opportunity is to build upon this core innovation through a collaborating community, a Digital Healthcare Ecosystem, to flesh it out in multiple directions including ways to expand user uptake and to enable new scenarios for how users interact with and update data.</p>
<p>This is particularly relevant when we consider the broader context of Scotland’s overall digital agenda. In their just released digital strategy, the Scottish Government describes a key objective of:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Adopt a common approach to online identity where personal data is controlled by the individual.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ll explore how this type of personal data ecosystem can be pioneered in Scotland, with key drivers being a national technology platform equipped to deliver highly effective solutions for tackling crisis situations like Covid-19.</p>
<p>This is a flagship example of the global potential for ‘GovTech’ accelerator programs – Building local solutions in response to needs that are common across the world, creating the intellectual assets that can underpin massive worldwide growth for Scotland’s tech sector.</p>

<p>One of the key principles of DIDAS is that we help experts coming from various industries and professions to work together, learn from each other and bring new ideas on how to apply SSI technology in real world.</p>
<p>To make it happen, we encourage our members to propose topics and explore ideas in dedicated working groups.&nbsp; Working Groups allow us to agree on the goals that the experts will pursue jointly,&nbsp; structure the work and define the results. After all, we want to see SSI become a reality in Switzerland!</p>
<p>We are very happy that more than 15 experts got together to kick off our Onboarding Working Group. This group grew out of the idea that many different activities today require sharing of verifiable information – personal identity, company registration, tax identifiers, addresses, and so on and so forth.<br>
In Switzerland, Financial sector is very strong and so a lot of innovation happens around Fintech.&nbsp; Our original idea, therefore, was to focus on Fintech use-cases around onboarding, KYC and AML processing and similar activities.</p>
<p>As we started to explore these ideas in depth during the session, we understood that not only Fintech, but other Industries ( e.g. Insurance, B2B Supplier onboarding, etc) can benefit strongly from an ability to securely exchange identity and registration data using Verifiable Credentials, which are easy to maintain in the future, including automated invalidation of credentials that were recalled by their issuers.</p>
<p>It is also clear that various use-cases depend on the existing legislation and might be difficult to implement in today’s legal environment.<br>
In recognition of this fact, the group has agreed to catalog various use-cases, examine their legal implications and requirements, explore whether or not it is possible to find solutions and approaches that are compatible with the today’s set of laws, plan technical PoCs and implementations.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Swiss lawyers are among the most creative professionals in the world and are enthusiastic about opportunities to find improvements in the legal system that are required to make Switzerland the best and the most innovative country to do business. The recent legislation on Blockchain Assets in Switzerland is a great demonstration of that fact.<br>
Even in the case that some SSI onboarding use-cases might be difficult to implement within the limits of the current legislation, the group will identify the needed improvements and&nbsp; work with the lawmakers, regulators and politicians to develop and promote the required changes.</p>
<p>This is one of the core missions of DIDAS –&nbsp; drive Thought Leadership and remove barriers to implementation of SSI and Verifiable Claims technology&nbsp;in Switzerland.</p>
<p>If you are interested and want to bring your technical, business, legal and/or creative skills and ideas into the effort, even if you know nothing about the SSI yet, we are looking for you!</p>

<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that ebXML Messaging Protocol Binding for RegRep Version 1.0 from the OASIS ebXML Core (ebCore) TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML) is a family of standards developed through a joint initiative of OASIS and the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT). Five of these ebXML standards, including Collaboration Protocol Profile and Agreement, have been approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as the ISO 15000 standard. ebXML provides an open, XML-based infrastructure that enables the global use of electronic business information in an interoperable, secure, and consistent manner by all trading partners.</p>



<p>The ebXML Messaging Protocol Binding for RegRep v1.0 specifies a messaging protocol binding for the Registry Services of the OASIS ebXML RegRep Version 4.0 OASIS Standard. This binding is compatible with both the versions 2.0 and 3.0 of ebMS as well as the AS4 profile and complements the existing protocol bindings specified in OASIS RegRep Version 4.0.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

 Q&amp;A explores threat actors, early detection, and content moderation Oumou Ly interviews Lisa Kaplan for the latest episode of The Breakdown from the Berkman Klein&nbsp;Center.<p>From 2016 to 2020, research, civil society organizing efforts, industry planning, and national security responses to disinformation centered on the issue from the perspective that malign influence was propagated almost exclusively by foreign adversaries. This thinking was upended to a large extent in 2020 when disinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the presidential election, and other sustained-attention information events exposed the severity of the threat posed by domestic disinformation.</p><p>In this episode of the Breakdown, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/oumou-ly">Oumou Ly</a> is joined by Lisa Kaplan to further unpack what accounts for the shift in focus, whether stakeholders might consider adjusting mitigations already deployed to combat disinformation, and assess how current organizing around the disinformation problem can be reevaluated and repurposed to suit new challenges.</p><p>Read the transcript, which is lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to The Breakdown. My name is Oumou, I’m a fellow on the Berkman Klein Center’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/assembly">Assembly: Disinformation</a> Program. I am recording today from California, and that is why my background doesn’t appear the way it normally does, but I am excited nonetheless to be joined by Lisa Kaplan of the Alethea Group. Lisa founded the Alethea Group to help organizations navigate the new digital reality and protect themselves against disinformation. Thank you for joining us, Lisa. I’m so excited to have a conversation with you about this and many, many other pertinent issues.</p><p>Lisa Kaplan (LK): Thanks so much for having me, excited to be&nbsp;here.</p><p>OL: Yes. So our conversation today centers on a really, really big topic in the disinformation space, and that is the shift in focus among a bunch of different stakeholder groups, including the national security community, academics, civil society, and others, in focusing on disinformation from a national security/foreign policy geopolitics perspective. Can you give us a little taste of your background and talk about what compelled you to found the Alethea&nbsp;Group?</p><p>LK: So I started the Alethea Group in 2019. And prior to that, I was the digital director on a 2018 Senate campaign.</p><p>One of the things about disinformation that I always like to remind people is that it’s not always a foreign government and it’s not always people who are seeking necessarily geopolitical ends. The goals for threat actors really do vary depending on the threat actor. And that’s one of the reasons why the hard work, the attribution that we do at Alethea Group is so important. But it does depend on who the actor is and what their motive is. And once you know that, you can infer what their goal may be and it can help to mitigate a situation before it even starts or we use [it] to mitigate a situation that’s elevated into more of a crisis situation.</p><p>So I was working for Senator Angus King and because he was running against a Democrat and a Republican, we were looking at disinformation narratives from both sides, not necessarily doing the work of attribution, but because we were a campaign, we had limited resources, trying to understand what the narratives were that were out there. And what we realized is the disinformation, it was targeting candidates, it was targeting issues, but at the end of the day, it’s really targeting voters, us as people. And when you think about it as an election context, it’s really straightforward. It’s trying to influence people’s decisions around when, where, and who to vote for. You know targeting those decision points. Are you going to vote? And then if so, for whom are you gonna cast your&nbsp;ballot?</p><p>However, disinformation, it’s not an issue that’s limited to just elections and especially for sophisticated actors. So think foreign adversaries, think for-profit disinformation networks who have built up influence to then sell to the highest bidder or are building up influence to be able to generate ad revenue through clicks, for example. They’re not just talking about one election or one candidate, they’re talking about a variety of different issues. And so I say that because for us, and it’s the proliferation of this, the number of threat actors since 2016 has been exponential. What started as being primarily Russian, we now have, according to Oxford, over 80 countries who are actively engaging in social media manipulation, and that doesn’t even account for all of the individuals who have stood up their own operations. We also see both sides of the aisle to be clear, political consultants engaging in similar behaviors as on social media manipulation tactics. So it really comes down to who is the actor and what is the goal. Now fast forward. One of the things that we saw, unfortunately, and it’s very unfortunate that it took essentially an insurrection attempt at the US Capitol to really catapult this conversation.</p><p>And there are a variety of research organizations including ours that had been beating this drum for several years now. And so people were saying, oh, it’s just a meme, but no, it can really, you know, disinformation really can lead to offline harms. And we know that. We’ve seen that with Pizzagate, We’ve seen that with different events such as the LA Dodgers stadium being shut&nbsp;down.</p><p>So we are seeing more and more offline action happening as a result of disinformation. I think one of the things about what happened at the US Capitol, is it’s a really important case study. And I say that, and I know it sounds clinical but because what happened was obviously a horrible day for our democracy. And I think it affected the research community in a variety of different ways. That was a very tough month for everyone. So I don’t wanna sound overly clinical about it, but in a lot of ways, there are a lot of lessons that can be learned. So for example, we can draw a straight line from some of the narratives that were happening in March saying that the election would be rigged, that there would be political violence, that people needed to start preparing for the worst, to what happened on January 6th. One of the good things to come out of January 6th, though, is that most people get a second chance. Not everybody, obviously there’s a Capitol police officer who died in the line of duty protecting the Capitol, but we’re able to really learn from this moment and move forward so that we’re addressing this threat in a way that does make it so that we’re able to identify these online threats and prevent them from becoming offline&nbsp;harm.</p><p>OL: Thank you for that summation of not only what happened on January 6th but for illustrating that you can draw a through-line between the initial Stop the Steal on narratives and organizing to what ended up happening on the 6th. And what I think is also projected to continue this week on the 4th. Can you talk a little bit about your practice at Alethea Group and how you help organizations navigate through this new digital environment?</p><p>LK: So at Alethea Group, what we do is we detect instances of disinformation, misinformation, and social media manipulation, as well as track other types of online harm such as targeted harassment to be able to help individuals figure out how to navigate this new digital reality. I think that a lot of times people don’t realize how many options they actually have. So for example, if you’re able to detect what a lot of people are doing right now is they’re analyzing something once it’s already gotten onto Twitter, onto Facebook, onto YouTube, for example, and it’s on one of these mainstream platforms and they call the social media platforms and they say, please take it down. That’s one option. But if you’ve gotten to that point, in a lot of ways it may already be too late. So what we do is we practice early detection. So we catch narratives when they start and we’re able to then track them and understand how they may be influencing individuals and seeking to change individual’s behavior. We analyze on the network level. And what that does is it enables us to take more&nbsp;options.</p><p>So for example, let’s take these for-profit disinformation networks. Well, you know, if they’re making a profit off of a potential organization, there could be an opportunity to seek damages. If they’re misappropriating intellectual property such as your name, your likeness, trademarkable or patentable, or copyrighted material, there are legal options that organizations can take to seek recourse. And if there is an opportunity to do counter-messaging, and I’m not talking about fact-checking and our experience fact-checking, while it’s helpful in creating a paper of record or it’s helpful in giving something to point to, to set the story straight, it’s not sufficient. And here’s why. The people who are choosing to believe in a narrative aren’t necessarily going to believe something salacious about — change their mind — and say they no longer believe something that’s totally salacious about you and confirms their biases about you just because you’re the one that said it isn’t true. So we’re talking about really counter-narrative building. And that can be done in an ethical way by creating a greater understanding around an individual or an organization. So what we do is we help through the entire process. So we detect what’s happening, we assess whether or not it’s having an impact on an organization’s goal. And then we help to mitigate any potential impacts, the idea being that we can solve a lot of problems before they become a real issue or a challenge for an organization.</p><p>OL: Along with the expansion of the threat landscape, there has been sort of an uptick in sustained information events, like the COVID pandemic, like Stop the Steal, and just a lot of that, not just disinformation, but chatter around the election. Are there other structural developments or other factors that you attribute to the expansion of the threat landscape and the shifts that you know the shift in focus from foreign disinformation to domestic?</p><p>LK: Yeah. I think one of the things about disinformation and, you know, there was conversation around how this was gonna happen after 2016 because it’s fast, cheap, and easy to do. If you know how to run a good marketing campaign, you can probably figure out how to run a disinformation campaign. And so with that, and then you also look historically, open-source estimates say that the Russian inner attempt to influence the 2016 election cost a million dollars, which is a rounding error to most large organizations or federal governments. So it wasn’t a question of if other organizations were going to start engaging in these tactics, it was a question of when. And I think what we’ve seen is the proliferation of that. It’s the proliferation of the number of threat actors that’s causing an increased number of threats when it comes to the disinformation landscape.</p><p>So going to the COVID-19 pandemic, and these narratives have shifted over time and they vary again, based on the threat actor. So one thing we saw, and again this is all open-source, just Russian state media. You know we did see Russian state media pushing race narratives targeting different communities and trying to pit them against each other. We saw RT put out content that was more focused on, you know, “what’s the big deal with calling it the China virus,” for example, “we called it the Spanish flu.” And RT typically targets one audience. And then we saw it in the NOW, which is, typically targeting younger audiences on Instagram with videos being like, “if you are Asian, you will get attacked in New York City.” And it’s not to say that people haven’t experienced those sorts of attacks. And, you know, as a result of disinformation, going back to the online to offline action, and I don’t wanna make it sound like it’s just the Russian government because there are definitely other actors who are playing in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>But it is I think just providing more opportunities from that perspective. And then, similarly, there’s the financial motivations and the financial perspective. So we’ll see some of these junk domains pushing false information about the pandemic and they’re doing so because they are likely to generate a profit. They have advertising revenue that they’re getting from clicks. So I think it really does depend on who the actor is as to why they’re pushing it, but because it’s so cheap, easy, and potentially lucrative to do as well as it works from a geopolitical perspective. So, and if it’s cheap, why not try it? There’s not really a high cost to people who are executing these sorts of campaigns.</p><p>OL: Not at all. And I would just echo what you said by pointing out that it’s been so interesting that since 2016, you know our own elected leaders see value in exploiting the sort of fissures in society that we have and exploiting them for their own political gain. And as you mentioned, this happens both on the right and on the left. I wanna shift gears and talk about some of the specific mitigations.</p><p>So one of the most significant impediments to legislating on disinformation and engaging on it from a policy or regulatory perspective is that moderation is often criticized as being a brush up against the First Amendment. What is your thinking around how regulation can encourage effective moderation without brushing up against those First Amendment concerns? And then I guess also more broadly, what is your thinking around what the government’s role should be in addressing domestic disinformation?</p><p>LK: Well, I do appreciate and admire a lot of our colleagues in this space who are putting out really important research that can inform eventual legislation. Where I see the opportunity for more immediate action is actually through other means such as our judicial system. And I’ll get to that in a second. When it comes to the First Amendment, that’s an argument that I just don’t really buy. We accept limits to speech in real life. I can’t yell fire in a movie theater — like there will be consequences for me. We’ve accepted that there are some limits on speech in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>And so I think we should be reframing this question to say, how can we make the online conversation more reflective of the conversations that we have offline? I think one of the things that’s become really clear in the pandemic when we’ve all been forced inside and online to a degree is, that that’s not where we’re at right now but there’s no reason why that’s not where we can be. I think what we need to be talking about too, though, is when it comes to content moderation, I don’t think that that necessarily removes the threat altogether. For example, we saw a lot of accounts be deplatformed for breaking the terms of service multiple times. And again, I think that’s a perfectly acceptable consequence. It’s kinda like the “no shirt, no shoes no service” version of social media platforms. It’s like, if you break the rules on multiple occasions you’re not gonna be allowed back in. But where I think we need to be headed and where I think we’re going to see the most progress in the immediate, is enforcing some of the laws that are already on the&nbsp;books.</p><p>So for example the Dominion lawsuit that’s ongoing right now is something that I’m paying attention to. I think that that is a potential avenue. We’ve also seen some successes when it comes to copyright infringements because bad guys aren’t really paying attention to following the laws if they’re spinning up disinformation campaigns. So I think that we can potentially anticipate some actions taken there. I think that the other thing that has been interesting to watch unfold is, the Stop Hate for Profit sort of activism. I think that that is potentially having an impact as well. So all that said, I don’t see this as a speech-only issue. I think that there are very serious concerns especially when we’re thinking about the world outside of the United States and the Western liberal order where sometimes social media is how you evade censorship. And so these are really tough challenges and there are no easy solutions. And I think having these conversations and debates is hugely important because if this were an easy fix, it would be solved by now. But I am confident that this is something that we will begin to see, and we’ve seen progress since 2016 to be fair. But we will continue to see progress. We will continue to see solutions proposed and implemented.</p><p>OL: You had mentioned earlier that you have observed that fact-checking is not necessarily the most effective way to clamp down on some of the bad and false information we see circulating online and certainly not enough to interrupt the cementing of alternate realities that really disinformation is intended to&nbsp;foster.</p><p>LK: Yeah. So I think that fact-checking definitely plays a role but I don’t think it’s something that can be done alone. I think, you know, labeling that sort of thing. These are relatively new features. And so, well, how effective they are — that’s a little bit outside of my purview. And I look forward to reading somebody’s research someday that did a longitudinal study on how effective labels were on any given social media user. But I do think we need to start thinking about this challenge more holistically than we currently are, right? So for example, it’s not just what’s happening on social media platforms, it’s also what’s happening on blogs. It’s how some of these disinformation networks are being financed. It’s through advertising revenue, it’s through, frankly, people who are building influence and then turning around and selling it for profit. Those are all things that I think we can incorporate into part of the solution when we’re trying to figure out, how do we put out the fire that’s happening right&nbsp;now?</p><p>I think when we look towards long-term solutions to figure out, what is it that we can do to really change the equation to make it so that disinformation is not as successful as it is now? There’s all kinds of things we can do but I keep coming back to education. If every single person knew what we knew and likely what everybody who’s listened to these podcasts knew, we’d be in a lot better shape. So how do we make it so that we’re not so special anymore? How do we make it so that the general population is more resilient to disinflation? And a lot of that has to do with education. So when I was in high school we used to do these things where we would basically learn how to read a news article. We would learn how to read a newspaper based on, you know what page was the article on in the newspaper for relative importance. What paper were we reading? Who’s the author? When was the paper published? How do you read the first two paragraphs? How do you read for bias? Why aren’t we teaching that for a digitized world? Because I am still pretty old school and I like physical newspapers, so I get them but I am like the rarest subscriber you will see for my age demographic. Like one of the things we need to consider is how do we modernize our approach to consuming media? And I don’t wanna put it on the social media user to protect themselves from a sophisticated information operation. But again, when you think about it as a holistic solution this can also be a piece of the puzzle that really makes the difference.</p><p>OL: So Lisa, my final closing question for you is, do you have anything that you think about as something that could be maybe a smaller low-intensity effort, but could make a world of difference in terms of moving the needle forward on this&nbsp;problem?</p><p>LK: Yeah, so I think that I always come back to, if every individual just stopped and thought before they hit send, or tweet, or post, or share, or whatever, I think we are all potential threat vectors, for furthering a disinformation or misinformation flow because disinformation and misinformation target us and our biases. And so by not sharing it and spreading it, we’re not making the problem worse. So I think if everybody did that, it would go a long&nbsp;way.</p><p>OL: Thank you so much, Lisa. I really enjoyed our conversation. Thanks for joining&nbsp;me.</p><p>LK: Thanks for having&nbsp;me.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-lisa-kaplan-on-domestic-disinformation-f86bdecf3147">The Breakdown: Lisa Kaplan on domestic disinformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Beth Kanter, Chief Advocacy &amp; Strategic Communications Officer</p><p>The past year has seen working Americans struggle amidst a global pandemic and economic crisis, further exacerbating the deep, structural inequities in our society. Over and over again, the rules, ideas, and power that lie at the heart of our economy and democracy have rewarded the few at the expense of the many. In order to build a truly equitable and inclusive society, these trends must be quickly reversed. President Biden signing the American Rescue Plan into law today moves us one step closer to that&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Because of critical aid in the American Rescue Plan, child poverty in the United States is expected to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/26/970999998/with-one-move-congress-could-lift-millions-of-children-out-of-poverty">drop by half</a>. More than one million unionized working people who faced the prospect of losing their pensions will now receive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/business/dealbook/bailout-pensions-stimulus.html">full retirement benefits</a> for at least the next 30 years. The government will be sending direct <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/1400-stimulus-checks-who-is-eligible-how-soon-they-could-arrive.html">relief checks</a> to the majority of Americans who earn less than $75,000 a year. Unemployed Americans will receive an extra $300 on top of their current benefits through the end of this summer. State and local governments will finally get <a href="https://statescoop.com/senate-approves-relief-package-with-350b-in-state-and-local-aid/">urgently needed aid</a> so they don’t have to make harmful cuts or enact&nbsp;layoffs.</p><p>This $1.9 trillion investment in families will help set us on a course toward an economy that works for all Americans. While there is still much to be done, Omidyar Network welcomes this momentous piece of legislation and we look forward to collaborating with our partners, grantees and policy makers to continue the path forward to a more equitable and inclusive society.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/omidyar-network-applauds-enactment-of-the-american-rescue-plan-5d2b395e90d5">Omidyar Network Applauds Enactment of the American Rescue Plan</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Announcing ELP <p>Today we're excited to announce that we are officially opening applications for the Ceramic Mainnet Early Launch Program (ELP). This program allows a limited number of projects to get early access to the Ceramic mainnet before it is opened to the general public later this year.</p><p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Apply to the Early Launch Program</a> if you want to deploy your <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> and/or <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> project to production in the coming months. </p> FAQs  Who is the program for? <p>ELP is for projects that want to use Ceramic and/or IDX in production ASAP. We created this program so you could get started immediately.</p> When does the program start? <p>Starting today we will begin accepting applications on a rolling basis. For those accepted into the program, mainnet access will begin in approximately 4-6 weeks. We will communicate the official mainnet start date via email. Before mainnet is ready, you can start prototyping your application on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a>.</p> How do I apply? <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Apply using this form</a>. Our team will promptly evaluate submissions and reach out via email when we are ready to onboard your project. Please provide as much detail as possible to help us evaluate your submission.</p> How will you evaluate applications? <p>We have a set of evaluation criteria but generally we will prioritize projects with the most active users, those who have been most active in our community, those who plan to go live with Ceramic/IDX as soon as possible, those with the most interesting use cases, those that deliver the most aggregate value to the Ceramic ecosystem, and those who can commit to providing us detailed feedback.</p> What happens if I'm on the waitlist? <p>While you're waiting, you can begin prototyping and building your application on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a> and contributing in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>. We will accept projects from the waitlist on a rolling basis.</p> What are the program details? <p>Projects that have been accepted into the ELP get early access to Ceramic mainnet nodes running on <a href="https://3boxlabs.com/">3Box Labs</a> infrastructure. For the duration of the program, these will be the only nodes connected to mainnet.</p> Is this a "centralized mainnet"? <p>We like to think of ELP as a mainnet with training wheels. All the primary features of mainnet are there such as a Ceramic mainnet pubsub topic and anchoring document updates on the Ethereum mainnet, but by limiting variables such as the number of nodes on the network and the number of overall participants we can make sure everything works well in a controlled production environment before opening the network to the chaos of the general public.</p> How long does the program last? <p>We have not yet set an end date. We will conclude the program and launch the public Ceramic mainnet when we feel the network has been battle tested enough by applications in production during ELP.</p> What happens at the conclusion of the program? <p>After ELP has concluded, Ceramic mainnet will be released to the general public and anyone can run a node and deploy their project in production.</p> When is public mainnet launching? <p>At the conclusion of ELP.</p> Where can I learn more? <p>Join the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Sign up today <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Complete the ELP application</a></p>

<p>1.What is the mission and vision of  Stonebridge Solutions?</p>



<p>Stonebridge’s primary objective is to establish new mechanisms for identification, privacy and security to enable legitimacy, establish trust between two unknown parties and prevent fraud before it happens.</p>



<p>Our next generation technologies anticipate evolving and growing threats to both consumers and merchants and are designed to prevent these risks and empower users to positively impact their security and privacy as they transact digitally.</p>



<p>Our vision is to reduce the economic impact of fraud by provisioning a secure &amp; private ‘digital last mile’ for payment.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



 <a href="https://stonebridgesolutions.ca">https://stonebridgesolutions.ca</a>/ 



<p>The world is experiencing a social and economic shift at an unprecedented rate. This is driving the growth of new and more sophisticated threat models and legacy systems and technologies that are not easily adapted to address them creating a large gap being exploited by fraudsters and driving a an urgent need for a trusted digital identity.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>One of XUMI’s founding principles it that there is economic value creation through the prevention of fraud and the elimination of risks through the establishment of a trusted digital ID that can be legitimized at the point of interaction.</p>



<p>We also believe that the promotion of digitization in Canada coincident with a Pan-Canadian framework for digital identity will enable greater and more efficient access to banking, government benefits, education, health care and many essential services while facilitating the security of the digital footprint and this will strengthen Canada’s economy locally and its position globally.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada has a significant role to play as a leader in digital identity and trust. We have a demonstrated history of ‘locking arms together’ collaboratively to work towards the common good. When that is blended with best in class technology, banking, government, and healthcare through DIACC we can effect a change and establish a framework for success for others to model.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>We joined DIACC because we understand and share the mission. We believe in the ‘root of trust’ being established and held by a trusted authority and have designed the last mile to extend this in a secure way to consumers and merchants. When we set out 4 years ago we believed that the road to global digital transformation was long, and then suddenly it wasn’t. Our technology is bigger than we are, and it has the ability to change the game, switch things up, have impact. We believe in the power of partnership and collaboration between great teams to solve extraordinary challenges. While working quietly away on our tech we’ve witnessed an unprecedented shift to digital in the last year, and alarming growth in the risks associated with it. We want to help, lend what ever we can to eliminate those risks and feel we can further that objective through DIACC.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Stonebridge Solutions is a small, focused tech company located in Vancouver BC. Our objective of eliminating fraud began with the simple phrase “there has to be a simpler, more secure and easier way”. </p>



<p>We’ve spent 4 years devoting ourselves to eliminating the threat models associated with merchant payment, mobile wallets and mobile devices while designing innovative, intuitive and frictionless experiences for users, and a platform to support it under the brand name XUMI.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to sponsor the Identity, Unlocked podcast. This week’s episode <a href="https://identityunlocked.auth0.com/public/49/Identity%2C-Unlocked.--bed7fada/ad784008">“eKYC with Mark Haine” features host Vittorio Bertocci and special guest Mark Haine</a>. The episode focuses on the work of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">OpenID Foundation’s eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Working Group</a>. Mark Haine is the Director at considrd.consulting and one of the Co-chairs of the eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Working Group. Among the many dots Mark is connecting on behalf of the OpenID Foundation is work with the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, the Open Identity Exchange Trust Framework Initiatives and the Open Banking Implementation Entity.</p>
<p>The working group is named for two processes that are largely the same but represent different industries. eKYC or Electronic Know Your Customer is a process most closely tied to the financial industry, whereas identity assurance is the more generic counterpart present in most other sectors. Identity assurance is the process of establishing the Identity of someone you’re interacting with within a very reliable fashion, and while it was historically often carried out in person, the rapid transition to new technologies and options for remote engagement have created a need to find ways of moving identity assurance online and allowing for it to be done in a standardized fashion.</p>
<p>The working group <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/charter/">charter</a>, in summary, explains the group’s aim to deliver a tech solution that communicates “verified claims” and information about how they were verified. The metadata about the “verified claims” answers questions of how and when claims were established. The working group represents many countries and industries and was launched in the context of the OpenID Foundation because of the natural connections between the foundation and the group’s initiative. Offering further detail on this project, Mark comments on the choice not to mandate but strongly encourage the use of FAPI, the level of adoption of the working group’s spec thus far, and – with regard to deliverables – what specification documents and definitions the group is working with. As the conversation winds to a close, Mark explains the danger of using scope, the benefits of the TXN claim within the working group’s specification, the PKI analogy for the trust framework, and ways listeners can help by fostering awareness of the program and its many less obvious use cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Mark Haine</p>
<p>Mark is an engineer and entrepreneur who has focussed his career on building solutions that enable business and mitigate risk in financial services.</p>

Parties may play multiple different roles in the supply chain. </p> <p>Supply chain </p> <p>A supply chain is a system of organisations and business processes that are involved in the manufacture, distribution and maintenance of a product or asset. </p> <p>Supply chain visibility </p> <p>The awareness of, and control over, specific information related to product orders and physical shipments, including transport and logistics activities and the statuses of events and milestones that occur prior to and in-transit. [Aberdeen Group] </p> <p>Traceability</p> <p>Traceability is the ability to trace the history, application or location of an object [ISO 9005:2015]. When considering a product or a service traceability can relate to:</p> <p>■ the origin of materials and parts;</p> <p>■ the processing history;</p> <p>■ the distribution and location of the product or service after delivery. </p> <p>For practical reasons, “trace” or “track and trace” may be used as equivalent terms to designate the action of ensuring the traceability. </p> <p>Traceability system </p> <p>The system used by an individual party to manage traceability in its supply chain(s). A traceability system includes mechanisms for the identification of objects and for the capture of information about observations of those objects over time as they move between locations or participate in various business processes. </p> <p>Traceability party </p> <p>A party that has been selected to be in scope of a traceability system. Parties in scope of traceability systems may include those that take custody of traceable objects, those that take ownership of traceable objects, those that inspect traceable objects, those that insure traceable objects, etc. End-customers (including consumers and patients) will often not be treated as traceability parties, since they do not necessarily carry a traceability responsibility and very often remain unknown to the other traceability parties.</p> <p>Traceability location </p> <p>A traceability location is a designated physical area that has been selected to be in scope of a traceability system. </p> <p>Traceable object </p> <p>A traceable object is a physical or digital object whose supply chain path can and needs to be determined. </p> <p>Tracing </p> <p>Tracing is the capability to identify the origin and characteristics or history of a particular traceable object upstream (through earlier observations) based on data recorded at defined points of the supply chain. Trace or Tracing backward or ascending traceability </p> <p>Tracking</p> <p>Tracking is the capability to locate or follow the path of a particular traceable object downstream (through later observations) based on data recorded at defined points of the supply chain. Track forward or descending traceability </p> <p>Transparency </p> <p>Transparency refers to the need to ensure visibility and access to accurate information across supply chains (inclusive of consumers), including the provision of relevant traceability data to trading partners and consumers in a spirit of openness. </p> <p>Visibility </p> <p>Visibility is the ability to know exactly where things are at any point in time, or where they have been, and why.</p> <p>Visibility event data </p> <p>Visibility event data are records of the completion of business process steps in which physical or digital entities are handled. [ARCH] </p> <p>Each visibility event captures what objects participated in the process, when the process took place, where the objects were and will be afterwards, and why (that is, what was the business context in which the process took place).</p>

<p>March 10, 2020 – Today, the <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/">Baseline Protocol</a>, part of the Ethereum OASIS Open Project and in partnership with <a href="http://opencollective.com/opensource">Open Source Collective</a>, announced that it has received a grant of $100,000 from the <a href="https://ethereum.foundation">Ethereum Foundation</a> to be used for the purpose of encouraging and accelerating baseline protocol R&amp;D and enablement efforts. This comes on the first anniversary of the community’s formation.</p>



<p><a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/">Launched in March</a> of 2020, the Baseline Protocol uses advances in peer-to-peer messaging, zero-knowledge cryptography, and blockchain technology to coordinate complex, confidential workflows between enterprises without moving company data out of traditional systems of record.&nbsp; Today, hundreds of companies and thousands of individuals are actively participating in the initiative, which coordinates with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.&nbsp; For more information go to <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/">baseline-protocol.org</a>.</p>



 “2021 is stacking up to be a breakout year for Enterprise blockchain usage with more and more projects landing on the public Mainnet,” said Dan Shaw of the Ethereum Foundation. “Baseline has been a key driver of this, since the protocol enables private collaboration between enterprises without putting any sensitive data on-chain.” 



<p>The Baseline Protocol community conducts steering committee meetings every two weeks. Starting in April 2021, these meetings will include a segment to hear proposals for projects seeking funding from the grant pool. Each month, the Technical Steering Committee will allocate a portion of the total grant to selected projects. Allocations are managed by the <a href="https://opencollective.com/baseline-protocol">Open Source Collective</a>. These projects can include technical work such as contributions to open source code and also can include work to contribute enablement content, documentation and outreach programs. For more information on proposing projects for grants and bounties, go <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/news/grants-ef-funding-2021/">here</a>.</p>



<p>It is hoped that this grant will attract other organizations to contribute additional funding to the effort. Organizations interested in contributing can do so <a href="https://opencollective.com/baseline-protocol#category-CONTRIBUTE">here</a>.</p>

<p>Conviction Voting (CV) is a governance mechanism that allows users to signal their preference on various issues by staking their tokens on proposals. A proposal passes if it has sufficient weight allocated to it. The weight of a proposal is calculated based on the amount of tokens that have been staked and the amount of time these tokens have been staked. The <a href="https://medium.com/commonsstack/announcing-the-conviction-voting-cadcad-model-release-8e907ce67e4e">introduction to conviction voting</a> by Common Stack is a great primer if you want to learn more about how CV works. </p><p>Implementations of CV so far have been developed on the EVM, which makes the results and outcomes completely trustless. While there are some deployments like <a href="https://1hive.org">1Hive</a> and <a href="https://cv.commonsstack.org">Common Stack</a>, high gas costs and the sub-optimal user experience of transferring tokens for every vote make this quite problematic. Fortunately conviction voting systems can be securely implemented using off-chain, verifiable data structures. Building CV systems off-chain, as opposed to on-chain, avoids the high gas costs and poor user experience that plagues current implementations while still achieving verifiability and participant trust.</p><p>This article will explain how you can use <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> and <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> as an underlying data structure to build a conviction voting dapp.</p> Intro to Ceramic and IDX <p>Ceramic is a decentralized protocol for verifiable, version-controlled content. Ceramic is used to create mutable documents on IPFS with permanent identifiers, called DocIDs. All document updates are signed and then periodically anchored into the blockchain for time-stamping and consensus. You can think of a single Ceramic document as its own ledger (a doc-chain) which contains all the information needed to reconstruct the state of the document in a completely trustless manner. For more details refer to the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md">Ceramic specification</a>.</p><p>IDX is a decentralized identity protocol built on top of Ceramic which makes it easy to associate data to a user, discover data a user has created, and build user-centric applications. You can think of IDX as a decentralized user table. Each user has their own index which is a map from definitions to records. Definitions are globally-defined descriptions of data created by developers. Each user has their own individual record for each definition which stores their content. For more information have a look at the <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/overview/">IDX developer documentation</a>.</p> System overview <p>The proposed conviction voting system is based on an ERC20 token that is periodically snapshotted. This means that the token balances of all users are not updated continuously but instead on a set interval, e.g. twice a day. Additionally, users can easily change their voting preferences at any time.</p><p>There are three main system components:</p>  User-created content including: 1) proposal documents which contain information for a given proposal, and 2) conviction documents where users set their preferences among all live proposals  A snapshot service that takes snapshots of the balances of all users of a particular ERC20 token, calculates the total conviction weight for all proposals from users' conviction documents, and saves them into a conviction state document  An oracle system that resolves passed proposals on-chain when the conviction state document has sufficient conviction weight for any given proposal   User-created content  Proposal document <p>Any user can create a proposal document when they want to request funds for a project. This document could contain any amount of information, but most important to be included is: <code>context</code> the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-19.md">caip-19 asset id</a> (ERC20 token address) that is used for the conviction voting, <code>beneficiary</code> the receiver of the funds if the proposal passes, <code>amount</code> the amount of funds to send if the proposal passes.</p><p>Example content<br>This example is a proposal to get some funding for a project. Other proposals might include executing a transaction with call data, setting a protocol parameter, or updating some organizational document.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  title: "Develop an off-chain conviction voting system",
  currency: "ETH",
  amount: 200,
  beneficiary: "0xabcdef",
  description: "Fund team X to implement off-chain conviction voting using Ceramic &amp; IDX.",
  url: "https://ceramic.network"
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Proposal document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Convictions document <p>Each participant in the conviction voting system creates their own convictions document when they first interact with the conviction voting dapp. This document contains the convictions the user has assigned to various proposals as a fraction of their entire token holdings. Every time they change their preference the underlying Ceramic document gets updated, signed, and eventually anchored on-chain.</p><p>A conviction voting dapp would create a definition as defined in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">CIP-87</a> and each user would store a convictions document as a record in their IDX.</p><p>Example content<br>In this example we see a single user's convictions document. They have created <code>proposal2</code> and they have allocated different fractions of their token holdings to proposal 1, 2, and 3.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  proposals: ["&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;"],
  convictions: [{
    proposal: "&lt;proposal1-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.2,
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.5,
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal3-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.3,
  }]
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Preference document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Snapshot service <p>The snapshot service performs the task of periodically taking a snapshot of the balances of all token holders of the particular ERC20 being used. Using this information together with individual users' conviction documents, it <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">calculates the total conviction</a> and writes it to a conviction state document. This service is not trusted since anyone could compute the same conviction state by simply grabbing the data from the blockchain. The service executes at a set time interval, for example twice a day.</p> Syncing data &amp; performing calculations <p>Since we are not restricted to calculate the conviction score for all proposals on-chain we can simply use the discrete version of the conviction voting algorithm which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad</a>. On every discrete time interval the snapshot service grabs all token holders and their balances from the blockchain (e.g. using TheGraph). The address of each token holder is used to look up their individual IDX document which should contain their convictions document. The total conviction y_t+1 can now be calculated for each proposal using the formula in Figure 1.</p>Figure 1: How to calculate the total conviction for each proposal j. Source: <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb</a><p>Once total conviction for each proposal is calculated, the snapshot service also calculates the trigger function for each proposal. Finally the service updates the conviction state document with the new state.</p> Conviction state document <p>The conviction state document stores the full state of the conviction voting system. It is created and updated by the snapshot service. It contains two main arrays as well as supply information:</p>  <code>participants</code> - all token holders, their current token balance, and the latest CommitID of their convictions document at the time the snapshot was made  <code>proposals</code> - all active proposals and their total conviction which has been calculated by the snapshot service  <code>supply</code> - the total supply of the ERC20 token that is used for governance  <p>Example content<br>In this example we see that there are two participants who have a token balance and have created their own convictions documents. We also see that there are two active proposals, both of which have not yet been triggered, and have different levels of total conviction.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  supply: 9001,
  participants: [{
    account: "0x12345...",
    balance: 1337,
    convictions: "&lt;convictions1-CommitID&gt;"
  }, {
    account: "0xabcde...",
    balance: 42,
    convictions: "&lt;convictions2-CommitID&gt;"
  }],
  proposals: [{
    proposal: "&lt;proposal1-DocID&gt;",
    totalConviction: 234,
    triggered: false
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;",
    totalConviction: 432,
    triggered: false
  }]
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Conviction state document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Oracle system <p>Once we have the conviction state document it's trivial to check the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BlockScience/Aragon_Conviction_Voting/blob/master/models/v3/Trigger_Function_Explanation.ipynb">trigger function</a> for any particular proposal. When a proposal has sufficient weight an oracle service (e.g. Chainlink) can be triggered to submit the data of the passed proposal on-chain. This would send the requested funds to the beneficiary in the proposal. It's also possible to use conviction voting to set smart contract parameters or proposal ranking (not execution). In these cases we would calculate a dynamic average instead of using a trigger function.</p> Executing proposals on-chain <p>In order to execute the transaction on-chain we can use an oracle system to get the relevant state from the conviction state document on-chain if a proposal has been triggered. Ideally this would be a set of oracles that can independently verify the state of this document before it's committed on-chain. However, in many cases it might be sufficient to use a simpler oracle system such as Chainlink to simply fetch the state of the document from the Ceramic gateway. The main data that needs to make it on-chain is <code>beneficiary</code> and <code>amount</code>.</p> Notes on security  Snapshot trust <p>The main point of trust in this system is the snapshot service. While anyone can independently verify that it has performed the proper calculations, this might not always happen. When implementing this CV system in production there likely needs to be some additional checks and balances that enable the snapshot service to be replaced. Alternatively a system may choose to require multiple snapshot service providers that are operated by independent parties.</p> Proposal manipulation <p>The proposal document could be updated to request a larger <code>amount</code> of funds after it has already started getting a large amount of conviction. In order to mitigate this attack, the snapshot service might require users to reconfirm their conviction for the proposal, without losing the time staked, before it is triggered.</p> Convictions reorg attack <p>Since Ceramic documents currently rely on the "earliest anchor wins" conflict resolution method, a user could perform a <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md#data-withholding-attacks">data withholding attack</a> where their conviction would be counted twice. The attack would involve the user first updating their preference document to proposal A and anchoring it, but withholding this data by not submitting it to the Ceramic network. Then they would set their preference doc to proposal B and publicly submit this to the network. Once proposal B has been passed, they would publish their data about proposal A which would invalidate their conviction on proposal B (because A was anchored earlier) and it would look as if they have staked their tokens on proposal A for a long period of time. This entire problem is solved by the fact that the snapshot service sets the CommitID of the user's preference doc in the snapshot document. So if a user cheats like this it would be simple to see that they have double voted and all of their votes would be invalidated from that point in time.</p> Alternative implementations <p>IDX can be used to store any type of user-related data such as verifications for social accounts (Twitter, Github, Discord, Discourse, ...), a BrightID score, or any other similar information. This flexibility makes it possible to easily experiment with quadratic voting where accounts that are less likely to be sybils can influence the vote more.</p><p>Using an oracle to trigger actions on-chain would be ideal, but as a minimum viable product it might be simpler to just use the off-chain voting system as a way to generate signal. A trusted multi-sig can then be used to execute on-chain actions, similar to how <a href="http://snapshot.page">snapshot.page</a> is used.</p> Get involved! <p>This article outlines a basic framework for how off-chain conviction voting systems can be built, but there are still many details that need to be solved.

<p>Security Tokens are Crypto Assets subject to the same rules that are adopted by financial products offered to the public.&nbsp; In simple terms, they are the intersection of digital assets (Tokens) with traditional financial products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s a new technology that improves on an old product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Bitcoin is considered a digital currency, then we can consider Security Tokens to be the digital shares of a company. This means that any asset whose ownership entitles to an annuity (asset) can and will be tokenized (shares of public companies, shares of private companies, debt securities, real estate, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The European community has a new specific Regulation called MiCA where Security Tokens are defined “Crypto-Assets” here is the Link to preview it:</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593&amp;from=EN">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593&amp;from=EN</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why are Security Tokens important?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security Tokens bring a number of improvements to traditional financial products by removing the intermediary from investment transactions (usually a banker).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removing intermediaries leads to lower fees, faster execution of exchange transactions, exposure to the open market, a larger base of potential investors, automated service functions, and a lack of manipulation by financial institutions. </p>
<p>Lower fees: many fees associated with financial transactions are derived from payments due to intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Competition is an absolute long-term good for financial markets.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<p>By Audrey Stienon, Analyst, Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>This post expands on the first key pillar for building a new economic paradigm as outlined in <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Our Call to Reimagine Capitalism</a>. Read the first post in this series, “An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and Economy”&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">here</a>.</p><p>Five decades ago, our society experienced a seismic shift. Underneath the layers of headlines about the crises of the day — lingering economic stagnation, growing calls for civil rights and racial justice, and the departure of a disgraced president — the values that we used to guide our lives were changing. Old traditions and ideals were being abandoned, and new ones were emerging. <br> <br>One value, in particular, quickly rose to the forefront of our social discourse and crystalized to become our cultural touchstone: individual liberty. <br> <br> Liberty, of course, is a bedrock American value — ranking right in between “life” and “the pursuit of happiness” in the Declaration of Independence. Our country was founded on the belief that a society and economy can only truly thrive when individuals are free to pursue their desires and self-interests, both at the ballot box as a citizen of a democratic nation, and in the free market as an enterprising participant of a capitalist system.<br> <br>For two hundred years, a commitment to liberty was one of the integral pieces of the base on which we sought to construct an ever-larger, ever-more-inclusive American society. In the 1970s, however, this base of diverse values and norms failed to shelter us from the crises of the time, and we chose to prioritize liberty as the base value that could keep our social edifice standing. Meanwhile, we abandoned the other values, norms, and institutions supporting our society as unnecessary constraints on liberty, and through willful neglect if not active undermining, allowed these parts of our social foundations to erode and decay.<br> <br>To build on this new, more sparse, foundation of values, we turned to a set of ideas that described markets as the ideal tool for maximizing liberty. Ideal markets, after all, are ones where anyone is free to buy, sell, work, or trade without interference. We therefore accepted as fact a simple, yet compelling theory: that these free markets, by generating wealth and automatically distributing it from businesses to working people, would create the best possible society for everyone. <br> <br>For the past fifty years, these ideas have been the blueprint we used to design and build our society.<br> <br>We have measured the wellbeing of our society by tracking the wellbeing of markets, and lauded ourselves as GDP, corporate profits, job numbers, and the stock market continued to rise. <br> <br>We have sought to remove government from markets and our lives: lowering taxes, deregulating, and increasingly relying on markets to provide services that had once been the responsibility of government. We worked to weaken labor unions, community leaders, even our own elected representatives — anyone who threatened to challenge the wisdom of markets. <br> <br>At the same time, we have empowered business leaders and trade associations, assured that these job creators knew best how to generate profits that would naturally, and without intervention, trickle down to the rest of society. <br> <br>Have trickle-down economics worked? If we view our society through the narrow frame of profits and growth, we could almost believe that the last fifty years have been a success. Look at the stock market! If it’s reaching record heights, then we must all be richer than we’ve ever been before!<br> <br>But, of course, we all know this view to be a delusion. By so many measures, our economy has failed us. Our growing GDP masks our growing inequality, just as rising job numbers ignore how job quality and wages have been falling, forcing more and more people to work multiple jobs while still being barely able to support their families. Meanwhile, growing corporate profits do not mean this wealth is shared with the working people who made those profits possible — let alone invested to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/windfall-profits-and-deadly-risks/">protect people’s health during a pandemic. </a>Finally, an excess focus on free markets has, if anything made the markets themselves weaker — less innovative, less competitive, less resilient — as businesses used their new freedom to earn profits through monopolies and rent seeking rather than producing services of value to society.<br> <br>If these fifty years have been an experiment of an economic theory, it is time to conclude, based on overwhelming evidence, that it has failed. Freer markets did not create a freer society. In fact, by “freeing” business from having to account for the negative consequences of their behavior, we burdened people, communities, and the planet with the growing weight of these costs, and by “freeing” people from familial, community, and public support systems, we forced people to pay the full price of any accident or mistake they might run into. <br> <br>In doing so, we eliminated the choices people could make. How many of us have been unable to search for a better job, move to a new state, or open a new business because we and our families simply cannot afford the risk? Our living costs are rising, and there is nothing left to catch us if we fall.<br> <br>We have spent too long trying to balance the entirety of our vibrant and complex society on top of a narrow and crumbling foundation. It is time for us to widen our frame of thinking and design a society built using a broader set of values that will be resilient to the growing tremors facing the world. <br> <br>We need values like the dignity of having one’s worth measured by one’s contribution to one’s community, and not one’s wage; like the security and stability that comes from knowing that, even if the worst were to happen — unemployment, sickness, injury, natural disaster, or even a pandemic — you would still be able to keep your family in your home, put food on the table, and receive needed care; like the justice of seeing past harm accounted for, and future harm averted; like the sustainability of a society that can prosper in perpetuity.</p><blockquote>Our definition of success must be more than just a subset of economic indicators. True success is achieved when our families are safe and healthy, when our communities are welcoming and full of opportunity, when our use of our planet’s resources are not unsustainably destructive…and, yes, when our businesses, small and large, can thrive and support our society’s wellbeing.</blockquote><p>Omidyar Network supports a number of organizations that are pushing to expand the range of values and ideas used to understand the economy. Our goal is not to advance any one solution, but rather to generate a multitude of proposals for moving us from a society that prioritizes only profits to a reimagined capitalism which prioritizes human flourishing in all its&nbsp;forms.</p><p>Our search for new ideas led us (unsurprisingly) to think tanks. This is why we are supporting a range of organizations that are elevating human centered perspectives on the social role of our economy and proposing innovative solutions to our collective challenges.<br> <br>The <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/">Roosevelt Institute</a>, for example, advocates for structural economic change through progressive policies. Their fellows are key voices in promoting the pursuit of economic security, more dignity, and, ultimately, more human thriving for more people. As its President and CEO Felicia Wong <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RI_EmergingWorldview_report-202001-1.pdf">notes</a>, “The move to values beyond ‘freedom to participate in a capital-focused marketplace’ is the central pillar of post-neoliberal thinking. If the new progressivism is to thrive, making plain the values inherent in our economic choices will be essential.” One of their recent reports, <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/new-rules-for-the-21st-century-corporate-power-public-power-future-american-economy/">New Rules for the 21st Century</a>, discusses the need to strengthen our democracy by thinking differently about the respective social roles of markets and government; last summer, they released a <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RI-TrueNewDealReport_202008.pdf">True New Deal</a> promoting essential reforms for the COVID-19 era. <br> <br>Meanwhile, <a href="https://americancompass.org/about/">American Compass </a>is working to create a coalition of thinkers drawing on conservative values for family, community, industry, and strong social and political institutions to advance economic ideas that ensure markets are serving people and their communities. Launched in May 2020, they have published and hosted discussions with thinkers from across the conservative and broader political spectrum. In September, they released a <a href="https://americancompass.org/essays/conservatives-should-ensure-workers-a-seat-at-the-table/">joint-statement calling for a renewed conservative labor movement</a> that elevates worker voices in economic and market discussions, which was signed by a number of prominent conservative figures, including Senator Marco Rubio and former attorney general Jeff Sessions.<br> <br>Our second focus is in strengthening the coalition of organizations working to disseminate these new economic ideas and incorporate them into strategic and policy discussions. <br> <br>Although the academic field of economics has developed <a href="http://www.oecd.org/governance/beyond-growth-33a25ba3-en.htm">an array of new branches of research</a> — from behavioral to ecological economics — that deepen our appreciation for the complexity of markets and their impact on society, this new thinking is not reflected in the ways that economics is taught in schools and universities, especially at the introductory level. We are therefore supporting the dissemination of <a href="https://www.core-econ.org/">CORE</a>, a new open-source economic curriculum developed with the collaboration of top economists, which incorporates recent advances in economic thinking. This curriculum is being adopted by schools and universities around the world.<br> <br>To help coordinate and align this growing global field of organizations that are developing and implementing new economic ideas, we are also supporting the <a href="https://www.econchange.org/">Economic Change Unit</a>, which both amplifies new ideas and works to strengthen the groups working around the world to transition us to a more equitable, sustainable, and democratic socio-economic paradigm.<br> <br>We have also turned to the media, given its power to shape how we all understand the economic forces impacting our lives, to help disseminate these ideas and reframe how we think about our economy. To that end, we have supported compelling reporting on the structural economic inequities that have been laid bare by the pandemic by journalists and photographers from new outlets such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/21362321/economy-american-policy-coronavirus-covid-recovery-fix-solutions-mobilization-great-rebuild">Vox</a>, and <a href="https://covid19-biggerpicture.trust.org/">Thomson Reuters</a>. <br> <br>Finally, we know that good ideas do not come from experts alone, and that real change is impossible without a broader cultural shift in how we, as a society, understand and discuss the economy.<br> <br>In addition to supporting a range of local and national organizations that are working to formulate and disseminate new ideas at the grassroots level, we are also working to cultivate the next generation of economic leaders and thinkers. Last year, we collaborated with The <a href="https://prospect.org/essaycontest">American Prospect </a>in a high school essay contest inviting students to read and reflect on one of four books highlighting the interlinking economic and racial justice challenges facing our country. We also partnered with <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/sponsored/story/tell-us-your-plan-to-reimagine-capitalism">Teen Vogue </a>to solicit ideas from young people about how they would redefine economic success in our society. Amongst hundreds of submissions, we heard ideas ranging from educating people to move money in support of racial justice to a worker-owned coffee shop on a mission to end wage theft and democratize the workplace.<br> <br>The ground below our feet is shifting, as it did all those decades ago. It is our mission to ensure that we have a solid foundation of values on which to build, and as many design ideas as possible at our disposal. With these, we can embark on the collective task of making American society as resilient and inclusive as possible.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-grounding-our-economy-in-a-new-ideas-and-values-99596c8dabe8">Reimagining Capitalism Series: Grounding Our Economy in a New Ideas and Values</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What is a digital identity? This is an increasingly topical question, in a world that is becoming more and more digitized every day, passing its services from the physical world to the computerized one. From a technical point of view, a digital identity consists of a set of information catalogued within a computer system and managed by a centralized entity that owns that computer system.</p>
<p>The Self Sovereign Identity &nbsp;is a model of digital identity that gives back to the user who creates it , the full control of his identity and of the information to be shared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The possibilities given by SSI are many, and its market is set to grow exponentially over the next four years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Moving beyond the simple definition of a digital identity, the latter is now part of all of us. A digital identity is how we all identify ourselves within our online interactions, which now make up a large portion of our daily interactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Self Sovereign Identity is therefore a new model of digital identity management that is much more individual-centric.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are mainly three digital identity models that have existed to date:</p>
 
 Centralized Model 
 Federated Model 
 Self-Sovereign Identity Model 
 
<p>Self Sovereign Identity model</p>
<p>A new and completely revolutionary one of digital identity management is represented by the Self Sovereign Identity paradigm. The concept of SSI is completely user-centric: the user is the sole and independent owner of his digital identity and of all the data associated with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Self Sovereign Identity is a model that differs from the previous ones and aims to ensure that the user remains the sole owner of his data (from the term Self-Sovereign), thanks to the use of protocols such as Blockchain. Essential features of a blockchain, such as immutability and resilience (no down time), the Self-Sovereign Identity model boasts greater security to all actors involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commercio.network has created a protocol and the SDK called CommercioID for the management of the SSI and in the next future will release the API on Commercio.APP</p>
<p>&nbsp;The developer documentation is available at https://docs.commercio.network</p>

 Tell us what you do and what it is about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I have been managing the World Bank’s (WBG) Identification for Development Initiative (ID4D) for the last 5 years alongside a sister initiative – G2Px – which we launched end of 2019.&nbsp; Through ID4D, we are helping countries realize the transformational potential of digital identity in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. G2Px focuses on supporting countries on digitizing payments from government to individuals, but in a more holistic way so that it can pave the way for broader outcomes of financial inclusion and women’s economic empowerment. It’s why we have the tagline of “payments that empower”.</p>
<p>These two WBG-wide initiatives are aimed squarely at helping governments and policy makers to reimagine and build the digital rails that underpin the way they transact with individuals. It also can transform the way people engage with their governments and with each other.&nbsp; A digital stack of ID, together with digital payments and trusted data exchange, has the ability to really empower individuals and change the way services are delivered – faster, more transparently and more conveniently.&nbsp; This past year, under the COVID pandemic, we have seen the need for all of this come to light with countries ramping up service delivery digitally, including social assistance to those most in need.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I joined the World Bank Group 20 years ago. &nbsp;I was passionate about international development and eager to contribute.&nbsp; The same passion sustains and energizes me to this day. When I joined, I didn’t imagine I would stay this long, but it’s hard to leave when the Bank provides the opportunity to work both in support of countries and on global public goods around on key development issues.</p>
<p>My earliest support system was generated at home. Growing up, my mother and father always encouraged my sisters and I and set the expectations to try our best and make a difference in any way we could.&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents came to the US in the mid ‘60s from Sri Lanka. At the time, it wasn’t always the norm for parents to push their daughters academically. &nbsp;But my parents certainly did (much to my annoyance at that same time) and that support helped me tremendously. And of course, now, that support system has expanded to include my husband who shares equally with the kids and at home.</p>
<p>The other thing that has helped me tremendously is my wonderful set of colleagues, team members and mentors – both within the Bank and in our wider group of external partners who have been with us since the beginning of these initiatives.&nbsp; We could not have achieved the multi-sector approach we have taken to digital public platforms without a really strong ecosystem of senior management support and hard-working teams who are passionate about this agenda across the Bank and externally.</p>
<blockquote>
 The COVID-19 crisis has shone a spotlight not just on ID, but Good ID, ID that is a gateway to inclusion and the development of digital societies. 
</blockquote>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>One of my favorite quotes is from anthropologist and women’s rights campaigner, Margaret Meade: “”Never doubt&nbsp;that a small group of thoughtful committed individuals can change the world. In fact, it’s the only thing that ever has.”</p>
<p>It’s been a guiding principle for me and I’ve adopted it in the advice I give to all our new team members. &nbsp;“Don’t wait until a system or an individual tells you to do something. Change comes from a group of individuals, not a “system”.</p>
<p>People often think reforms come from “policy” or “a system”. But what I have realized is that behind any policy or any system or organization are people – individuals and groups of human beings just like us!&nbsp;&nbsp; At work, we often will work with senior levels of governments and of course a high-level vision is key. But behind the vision you’ll always find a group of individuals who are shaping that vision and a group of individuals that need to work together to make the vision a reality.</p>
<p>So the advice I give to young professionals joining the Bank or newer team members is to know that you have the capability to be a shaper.&nbsp; An organization like the World Bank may appear to the outside as large and bureaucratic. But you can be quite entrepreneurial. You can shape the agenda – as long as you work hard to bring together different teams and different ideas as part of it. And don’t surprise anyone!</p>
<p>Collaboration is also part of what I do today. I know, for instance, that we couldn’t have agreed the updated Principles for Identification for Sustainable Development we have just published without a strong team of partners and collaborators working together on a shared vision.</p>
<p>It’s summed up in the words of an African proverb, printed on the walls of Gates Foundation HQ. “If you want to go fast, go alone.&nbsp; If you want to go far, go together.”</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>We have been working with governments to shift the identity agenda away from the way it has traditionally been viewed it.&nbsp; Identity is a core element for countries to transform service delivery to people, particularly in the digital age.&nbsp; The COVID-19 crisis has shone a spotlight not just on ID, but Good ID, ID that is a gateway to inclusion and the development of digital societies.</p>
<p>So, to CEOs I would say: “Build greater innovation on top of foundational ID systems, including new applications that will help people transact more seamlessly.&nbsp; There are increasingly ambitious countries all wanting to do digital ID the right way.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the combination of different ways of thinking, different cultures and ethnicities, gender that leads to whole being greater than the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>As a woman in identity, I am proud that about 80% of our team is female!&nbsp; Given the dearth of women in technology and identity space, I feel like we’re making a real contribution towards shaping the next generation of identity and digital development experts.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
Vyjayanti Desai
<p>Amanda Gorman’s poem at the inauguration of Joe Biden, “The Hill We Climb” Not only was it great to have a young woman captivate the entire world but it was hopeful and unifying, while also surfacing some of the very real issues that we face today.&nbsp; And her delivery of it was so inspiring.</p>
<p>I also have grown to really enjoy podcasts this past year. It was one of the things that kept me sane while taking my daily walks during the pandemic. Two podcasts: “It Was Said” and “Hope through History” by Jon Meacham are among my favorites.&nbsp; Each episode centers around a powerful, impactful public speech including Franklin D Roosevelt during the Great Depression, Hillary Clinton’s speech on ‘Women’s Rights are Human Rights’, Robert F Kennedy’s eulogy for Martin Luther King and Ronald Reagan’s farewell address.&nbsp; &nbsp;I’d love to see him expand this podcast and bring in speeches from across the globe.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>I have teenage twin boys, so I get plenty of practice giving unsolicited advice to teenagers!  But the advice I would give to the teenage me is: “Live in the moment; cherish everyone and everything around you because you never know when it may change.” My mother passed away from cancer when I was in high school and that definitely made me change my perspective. I try to ground myself by not worrying about the little things and try to live with a perspective of a glass half full.</p>
<p>And .. “be that change maker!”</p>
<p></p>

<p>DIACC is hosting a series of spotlights showcasing our amazing female DIACC members in the digital identity space, noting the importance of diversity. These spotlights will be regularly socialized through DIACC’s LinkedIn and Twitter channels as well as our monthly member newsletters.</p>



<p>If you’re a DIACC member and would like us to feature your spotlight, <a href="https://diacc.ca/contact-us/">contact</a> us today to learn more!</p>



<p>How long have you worked in your sector, and in your current position?&nbsp;</p>


 
 
 
<p>I have been in the tech industry for over 25 years in a variety of companies providing every type of software solution from graphic signage design tools, to Operating Systems, to 3D instrumentation clusters for avionics, to remote identity and document verification.&nbsp; I joined WorldReach Software, in the role of Director of Marketing, 11 years ago. I’ve loved every minute of it!</p>



<p>WorldReach, for those who have never heard of us, uses innovative processes and technology to verify you are who you say you are. We enable highly trusted digital services through our systems for government (borders, immigration, passport and consular) for digital on-boarding, safe and seamless travel, and digital Identity verification and corroboration.</p>



<p>We are probably best known for the core digital channel solution behind the UK Home Office’s EU Settlement Scheme. This smartphone based digital ID Verification (IDV) and enrolment capability has become the world’s most successful immigration programme of its kind with over 5 million completed applications to date!</p>
 



 

 
 
 


<p>What has your career journey looked like? Have you always worked in the private sector?&nbsp;</p>



<p>My career path has been so varied my general joke is “You can’t get here from there”. My educational background is in Fine Art. In fact, I have a painting in the Parliament Buildings. The short answer (which is not actually that short) is Fine Art led to Freelance Illustration, which led to Graphic Design, which led to Marketing Management in a software company. This opened me up to a much more technical path – first to Strategic Alliance Management for the Embedded OS market, then to Industry Segment Management, then to Product Management, then finally back to what I would term “Technical Marketing”.</p>



<p>I have always worked in the private sector, however for more than the last decade, I have been working exclusively in B2G. This has meant that one of my primary goals today is to understand all the challenges, wants, needs and technical requirements of the public sector. WorldReach clients are Governments from all over the world: Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Immigration and Border Agencies, but also any department with a citizen service role. Therefore, I spend the majority of my time researching Government digital service delivery program requirements worldwide.</p>



<p>When you were twenty years old, what was your dream job, and why?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given my artistic DNA, it likely will not be that surprising to hear that my dream job would have been to be a conservator in a prominent museum – someone who spends all their days cleaning, repairing, protecting and conserving incredible works of art. That would have been the perfect combination of my love of art, art history and my annoyingly anal-retentive detail-oriented skillset. Either that or I would have loved life as a professional soccer player! Even in my early twenties, I did not envision a long career in technology.</p>



<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>


 
 
 

 



 
<p>Externally – being taken seriously. As a woman in the male-dominated tech field over the last quarter of a century, one often hears this. For me personally, also being an openly gay woman adds an additional nuance to climbing the corporate ladder.&nbsp; I have unfortunately experienced homophobia from co-workers and management a few times in a few companies in the past, but I am happy to report that that appears to be in the rear view mirror for me. Still, it is a reminder of why we all need legal protections against discrimination in the work place and employment strategies focussed on diversity and inclusion.</p>



<p>Internally – overcoming the nagging doubt that you do not “belong in the room where it happens”. &nbsp;No matter how much experience you have in a certain industry, women tend towards the infamous “imposter syndrome”. Once you push that aside – and maybe that just comes with growing older and wiser – it really does become far less of a barrier. Belief in oneself goes along way to harnessing your own potential.</p>
 
 
 


<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Early in my career, I had to step away and become the main support for my incredibly ill child. As a mother, of course, that’s would you do, and what you want to do – there was no question. However, it also helps put things into perspective. There are always things in ones’ life that are more important than work. My son is now 33 years old and cancer-free, thankfully.</p>



<p>In the fast moving, highly competitive tech world, one’s work life can easily take over every waking hour – especially now, during COVID, when many of us are working from home. The boundaries can get very fuzzy. Nevertheless, it is still incredibly important to ensure you understand the crucial role of self-care. If you are exhausted, if you work around the clock, every aspect of your life will suffer – and that includes work.</p>



<p>I personally need physical activity. A long walk with my wife, friends and loved ones, working out in my basement gym, playing with my dogs – it all helps this balance ‘dance’.</p>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the tech space?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Women can do anything, but sometimes we need permission to dream big. I think the media can play a big role in this as well. Girls and women need to see people just like themselves succeeding. They need to hear the ups and downs of real-world tech careers. They need to think, “If she can do it, maybe I can too!” Let’s just celebrate all the incredible women in tech much more often!</p>



<p>I also think more needs to be done in our educational system. More female guest speakers to come into classes (virtually or physically) and share their journeys, especially in STEM. Perhaps more mentor initiatives. I know I would have loved to participate in anything that showcased successful women particularly in traditionally male-dominated jobs. To show how fascinating and rewarding delving into technology can really be. To imagine yourself having an effect on the systems that are being built now and in the future. To take pride in creating, in innovating. It took me far too long to discover this on my own.</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Do not be afraid to take up space. Do your homework and use your voice confidently. Be respectful and open, but do not apologize for everything.</p>



<p>A very good friend of mine gave me some great advice when I was in middle Management struggling to climb. She reminded me “perception is reality”. In the corporate world, you can be a wonderful capable worker, quite talented, but if the people in charge do not see it or know it, you will remain in the very same place but just with an ever-increasing workload. So – Volunteer for projects that will “stretch you”, that will require you to grow and learn, that will be seen. Be helpful and kind to all your colleagues, contacts and teammates. Go out of your way to lessen their workload, to be a person of value. Soon, it will be others that will be singing your praises – you will not have to!</p>



<p>If Senior Management do not value you in title, responsibilities and compensation, do not be afraid to leave and find it elsewhere. Have confidence in your own value.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>As the next generation of women begin to earn their way into more and more powerful positions, it will be easy to forget how hard the fight has historically been for the generation before them. Look back and learn. Look to the other successful women in the industry. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.</p>



<p>One of the biggest challenges these women will face is to recognize when their own drive and competitiveness becomes destructive. You cannot sustain being a “superwoman”. We are all human…and this where work/live balance is so important.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>


 
 
 
<p>Use your own natural talents to the best of your abilities; apply it to your passion and cultivated it. Whether that is being detail-oriented, analytical, a problem solver, purely creative, a team player or combinations of all of them. Know there is value in it all.</p>



<p>There is a misconception that there is only one type of person in STEM. An engineer, a scientist, a developer, a mathematician – only a linear thinker. Women often bring a different perspective, a different way of thinking and solving problems. A creativity. This variation, this diversity of thought is a necessity to produce the best most inclusive results – and the most interesting people!</p>

<p>How long have you worked in your sector, and in your current position?</p>



<p>I’ve been the CEO of Outlier since founding the company in 2013.</p>



<p>What has your career journey looked like? Have you always worked in the private sector?</p>



<p>I’ve worked as an employee for very large companies, including banks, investment firms and insurers as well as for consulting firms, but always in the private sector. It’s a running joke on our team that I might “retire” into a public policy or academic role one day.</p>
 



 

 
 
 

 
 
 
  
 



 
<p>When you were twenty years old, what was your dream job, and why?</p>



<p>When I was 20 years old my dream job was probably to be a world-famous DJ…little did I know that I was about to fall into a compliance role and fall in love with unravelling the puzzle that is Canadian regulation!</p>



<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>I think that it took me a long time to truly be authentic in my work roles because authenticity means vulnerability. On my last day as a banker, one of my colleagues and I shared a cab to the airport and he told me that although I was very smart and well-liked, I was always holding myself back and this lack of authenticity would hurt me in the long run. I don’t think that I really understood what he meant until I founded Outlier. At that point, I had the freedom to create the type of environment that I wanted to work in, and to keep building on that vision. It’s something that I’m always working on.</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Anything that I would say here would be disingenuous. I don’t really have a “balance” in the traditional sense, and I’m ok with that. Don’t get me wrong, I cook and workout and do self-care things, but I’ve given up on the idea that there needs to be some sort of clean lines between my work and home lives. My colleagues are some of my best friends. It helps that I love what I do and get really excited about the intellectual challenges. If I didn’t have friends in the industry, who would I have philosophical conversations about ideal policy outcomes with?</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the tech space?</p>



<p>I think it starts early. I’ve bought a few Cubettos (tactile coding toys) for bright young girls in my life. I try to take the time to talk to women, especially those starting out in their careers and to be honest about my experiences. I want my nieces (and my nephews) to choose a career that they’re passionate about. Gender shouldn’t be a barrier to that.</p>



<p>I’m also trying to practice radical honesty with my male colleagues because it helps to build awareness. For instance, a male CEO that unreservedly admire told me that he took a nap on a bench in a quiet spot in a Toronto park between meetings, and I told him how envious I felt that he could do that without really worrying about safety. It led to a really great discussion about some of the hidden differences that exist for men and women in business travel.</p>
 



 

 
 
 


<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>One of the funny things that I’ve noticed running a compliance and tech meetup is that 100% of the people that reach out to me to ask to speak are white men. It’s not that the foremost experts in these fields are all white men. It’s not that the best or most knowledgeable speakers are all white men. It’s that white men have been trained to be very comfortable approaching someone that they’ve never met and asking for stage time. I try to make sure that I’m reaching outside of my usual network and beyond those that are volunteering. I try to keep track of people that I’ve spoken to that have really interesting insights that I want to see on stage, on committees, and in leadership roles. I try not to shy away from the conversations about what we can do better – because we can always do better.</p>



<p>The other thing that I’ve become very cognizant of after working with someone that abused alcohol, power, and people is my responsibility as a leader to ensure the safety of those around me. We’re in a new era where creeps that try to take advantage of their position are starting to be held to account, but there is still a lot of bad behavior going unchecked. When a known offender is at an event, I will warn organizers and suggest measures to ensure the safety of participants. This is uncomfortable but better than the alternative.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>I think that the challenge is always the same – building the best possible world with the tools at our disposal. Someone once told my mom that she would never have a VP title (despite actually doing the VP job for 6 months) because she was a woman. He said it to her face, and there was no recourse. By the time I was the same age, it would be career suicide for someone to say that to my face. By the time my nieces are my age, I’d love for us to be so evolved that no one would even think it.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Sometimes being the only person like you in the room is power. When there are 8 men talking in the same way, I can embrace the fact that my voice is different and able to cut through the din…and when this is the case, it’s also likely that everyone “like you” is going to be judged based on what you say. It’s a lot of responsibility in a sense, and a lot of work but the results are worth the effort. You’ve got this.</p>

<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>I’m a very full scope kind of person. I’m personally never satisfied or feel fulfilled by half measures, so everything that I do – no matter how big or small – gets my full, absolute attention. This thread runs through my entire career journey; I’ve done every job from being a marketing coordinator and graphic designer, to a visual stylist and an event planner all around the globe to where I am now. Regardless of the position, I’ve always been determined to pour my most creative and committed self into it. Flexibility and the willingness to appreciate the nuances of every position help you best understand the whole, while also giving you the perspective to appreciate and take advantage of the opportunities available to you (and the ones you need to fight for).</p>
 



 
  



<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?</p>



<p>I interned at FLARE Magazine and was determined to work in a creative position. I loved that internship because it allowed me start my career in a hugely creative space where I learned to bring passion to everything that I did. I was fortunate to start in an industry that required me to take a close and exacting look at everything that crossed my desk because the final product would be so visible to a huge audience. I continue to pour as much passion into my job as I did on day one and understanding how great things come to fruition from behind-the-scenes has defined my career.</p>



<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>I am fortunate to have extremely supportive and nurturing parents who instilled that girls can do anything each and every single day of my life – even now. I would say the biggest challenge in my career, as any working mother will tell you, is how to balance work and life responsibilities. Being able to work and show my two boys that women are leaders is an immense privilege, but it is one that takes dedication, planning, and sacrifice.</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Being a working mother is a challenge and privilege at the same time. The pandemic has similarly been two-sided: if you’re in a position where you can work remotely from home, you’re able to spend more time with family and children. However, because technology and the demands of work is always right at your fingertips, it’s easy for priorities to be more actively occupied by work. I’ve made a conscious effort to put down the tech and enjoying moments to their fullest. The laundry and work emails can wait until later – they say you only have 18 holiday seasons with your children, and ensuring I’m present during all 18 is my number one priority. Rachel Macy Stafford, who wrote a great book called Hands Free Mama, said, “Being responsible for someone’s childhood is a big deal. We not only create our own memories, but we create our child’s memories.”. This has been a guiding principle as I balance work and life.</p>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>Get involved! There are so many wonderful associations, networking, and advocacy groups that provide fantastic opportunities for women to build meaningful communities in digital ID and tech that will serve them for their entire careers. Participating in these kinds of communities, such as DIACC, Women in ID, and Hyperledger, really reveals how many opportunities there are beyond what we traditionally think. Digital ID and tech permeate every sector and actively engaging in these kinds of opportunities can help open doors you never knew existed.</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Networking and seeking mentors are crucial and have been invaluable strategies for me throughout my career. The more you network, the more meaningful relationships you build, and the better you can learn to advocate through and become a mentor from whom others can benefit. I also strongly recommend finding a career coach to nurture a learner mindset and provide you with resources to further your goals with the added benefit of a third-party perspective.</p>



<p>Key throughout all of these strategies is taking the time to listen instead of merely speaking. I’ve been extremely fortunate to work with a group of women at SecureKey who actively listen, consistently learn from and advocate for each other. By building communities of strong females, we can all help to advance the role of women across every organization.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>I have been blessed to have followed a generation of trailblazing career women and am privileged to follow them and continue their work. I think a big challenge for women in the generation behind me will be to look inward versus outward. The entire world is at your fingertips and every opportunity is yours to take. What the challenge can be in a world of plenty is how to narrow your field of vision to suit your needs. Identify what it is you want to do and push yourself to the next level to get there.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Whenever I’m asked this question, I always give four pieces of advice:</p>



  Always be kind to those around you. People will remember your kindness, your willingness to help, and your ability to go the extra mile every day.  Find networks that support and advocate for you. If you can’t find one, then make one yourself!  Always ensure you practice self-awareness – understand what drives you every day and how that you help others.  Finally, always say “yes” to any opportunity that comes your way. The more you answer “yes”, the more you can learn.

 Indian Farmers’ Protest, Blocking Orders to Twitter, and the Fragile Balancing of Free Speech Amid Abysmal Regulation  Outlining limitations of blocking&nbsp;orders <p>February 2021 has borne witness to a standoff between Twitter India and the Modi Government. In the backdrop of a six-month-long <a href="mailto:https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/indian-farmers-protest-in-delhi-determined-to-stop-modi-s-new-laws">farmers’ protest</a> which has garnered both national and international support, the Indian Government issued blocking orders for Twitter to <a href="mailto:https://thenewsmen.co.in/india/india-directs-twitter-to-block-1178-accounts-in-fresh-notice/33050">remove over 250 accounts</a> linked to the farmer’s protest that were considered a threat to public order. At first, Twitter complied with the order, but within a few hours unblocked the accounts. This led to the government issuing a non-compliance order to Twitter which threatened to impose fines and imprison Twitter executives for up to seven years. As a result, Twitter complied with the order and blocked a majority of the accounts. However, in a <a href="mailto:https://blog.twitter.com/en_in/topics/company/2020/twitters-response-indian-government.html">statement</a> that followed, they clarified that they would not take action on 250 of the accounts, those that belonged to media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians, since removing those would violate their owners’ right to freedom of speech. Further, they stated that they would continue to explore options under Indian law for the accounts that had been affected by the Government’s blocking&nbsp;order.</p><p>The resulting hornet’s nest stems from a combination of the Modi government’s strong-armed will to curb dissent and the inability of current Indian laws to provide a fair balance between restrictions on illegal speech and procedural safeguards to protect freedom of speech. This article will shed light on the flaws with the current procedure laid down for issuing blocking orders, which the Government frequently and arbitrarily uses to seek the removal of content that is entirely legal under Indian law but simply critical of government actions. Some examples of such behavior include the recent blocking of over <a href="mailto:https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/aliexpress-to-tiktok-to-pubg-mobile-full-list-of-all-chinese-apps-banned-in-india-so-far-7064134/">100 Chinese mobile applications</a> and discussing the <a href="mailto:https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/government-may-block-facebook-whatsapp-instagram-in-specific-situations/1271470/">possibilities of blocking Facebook, Whatsapp, and Instagram</a> citing reasons of public&nbsp;order.</p><p>Government blocking orders in India are primarily regulated by Section 69A of the <a href="mailto:https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/1999/3/A2000-21.pdf">Information Technology Act, 2020</a> (“IT Act”) and the procedure for blocking is laid out in the <a href="mailto:https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28%20Procedure%20and%20safeguards%20for%20blocking%20for%20access%20of%20information%20by%20public%29%20Rules,%202009.pdf">Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009</a> (“Blocking Rules”).</p><p>Section 69A of the IT Act provides that the Central Government may block public access of any online information if it is believed to be necessary in the interest of the state, public order, or for preventing incitement to commit a crime. Most of the controversial or speech-restrictive requests for removal are initiated by the Government under this section because of the opacity and flexibility of the accompanying Blocking Rules, which provide the procedure that must be followed for the issuance of such&nbsp;orders.</p><p>The Blocking Rules essentially set up an examining committee with a designated bureaucratic officer acting as its chairperson to consider the legality of blocking requests. There are three main shortcomings of the Blocking Rules, first lack of transparency, second, fundamentally inadequate provisions for allowing a response from recipients, and third, casting a wide net over what qualifies as an ‘emergency’ blocking&nbsp;order.</p><p>The first of these concerns the lack of transparency: the blocking rules mandate strict confidentiality of any requests made for removal of content and the subsequent action which is taken by the intermediary. This not only means that blocking orders are not subject to the public’s right to information but also creates a serious obstacle for an aggrieved party who would want to appeal the decision. Hence, mandating secrecy within the rules renders judicial redressal futile. For instance, Tanul Thakur, the creator of a satirical website, was <a href="mailto:https://www.theleaflet.in/content-takedown-and-users-rights/">not given access to the blocking request</a> even after publicly claiming ownership of the&nbsp;website.</p><p>Next, it is difficult or impossible to successfully challenge an order once issued. The Blocking Rules provide that once the examining committee receives a blocking request, an opportunity may be given to the intermediary or content creator to appear and submit their “reply and clarifications”. However, in reality, this right to reply is hardly ever exercised. No record can be found of this having happened in the past. This may be for two reasons: first, because the designated officer in most cases does not issue a notice seeking an appearance and reply from the relevant party in the first place, and second, because intermediaries cannot be expected to be in a position to defend each of the millions of takedown notices that they receive. Hence, in the off-chance that the examining committee seeks a response from the intermediary, asking intermediaries to appear in front of designated officers to justify the content uploaded by one of its millions of content creators remains a futile exercise. It is even more so if such response is sought from the content creator because they would not have access to the blocking request in the first place, due to mandated&nbsp;secrecy.</p><p>This general lack of awareness of a right to respond to order is evident in the present case of the tweets supporting the farmers’ protest, where the designated officer told Twitter that there existed “no statutory requirement to provide or demonstrate justifications to the intermediary while passing orders under Section 69A”. Further, he stated that it was “astonishing” for Twitter to be commenting on “significant issues of freedom of speech”. This evidences an obvious departure from the due process — a process which, if followed appropriately, could have potentially led to several pieces of important information remaining online.</p><p>Finally, the language in the Blocking Rules providing for the issuance of emergency blocking orders is extremely broad, and confers almost unlimited discretion to the issuer, defining emergency orders only as an order that can be passed when “no delay is acceptable”. By contrast for regular blocking orders, it is required that the examining committee issue directions as a unit and then have the direction approved by the Secretary of the Government’s Department of Information Technology before notifying the intermediary. However, in cases of emergency blocking orders, the Department Secretary can decide on her own accord and retrospectively bring the request to the examining committee. The two disconcerting aspects here are first, lack of any clear definition of what comprises an emergency, and second, the liberty of the government to act as a check on itself without balancing this with sufficient transparency for an aggrieved person to seek judicial&nbsp;relief.</p><p>These shortcomings may very well be the reason that <a href="mailto:https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/ttr-17.html">India ranks in the top five countries</a> that made the most removal requests to Twitter in the first half of 2020. The Blocking Rules’ lack of procedural safeguards protecting freedom of speech makes it extremely easy for the Government to issue take-down orders, and very difficult to challenge those&nbsp;orders.</p><p>The constitutionality of Section 69A and the corresponding Blocking Rules was challenged in the Supreme Court of India in the landmark <a href="mailto:https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/shreya-singhal-v-union-of-india/">Shreya Singhal ruling</a> of 2015. This ruling is famous for invalidating Section 66A of the IT Act which prohibited the dissemination of information causing ‘annoyance’, ‘inconvenience’, or ‘insult’. However, the same ruling reaffirmed the constitutionality of Section 69A and the Blocking Rules on grounds that any violations could be reversed once individuals moved to Court. It seems clear it is time for this position to be reassessed, given the impossibility of judicial review due to the confidentiality provision.</p><p>Withholding information from the public, not providing sufficient opportunity for the aggrieved party to respond, and creating a vaguely defined situation of what comprises an emergency has allowed for a wide net to be cast for the situations in which such orders can be issued. This fear of over-regulation has exacerbated over the past few years and is evident in the severe crackdown on free speech by the Indian Government. For instance, over the past years, the Indian Government has issued several blocking orders for Twitter to remove legitimate content highlighting the <a href="mailto:https://thelogicalindian.com/news/twitter-blocked-kashmir/">human rights violations in Kashmir</a> and the <a href="mailto:https://lumendatabase.org/notices/22220327">Khalistani movement in north-west India</a>.</p><p>There is an urgent need to reform the Blocking Rules and place adequate procedural safeguards within the mechanism of issuing blocking orders. <a href="mailto:https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">Article 19 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights</a>, an international human rights instrument to which India has ratified, lays down a three-part test of legality, legitimacy, and necessity that a law restricting freedom of speech has to be in line with. This test has been applied on several occasions by the Supreme Court of India, including in the Shreya Singhal ruling discussed above. The constructive way forward is through dialogue between lawmakers and civil society to ensure that the Blocking Rules are revised to comply with these tests and to ensure that the legal mechanism for the Government issuing blocking orders is transparent, contains adequate procedural safeguards, and provides for effective judicial oversight through transparency.</p><p>Finally, until these loopholes in the existing laws are fixed and adequate judicial and procedural safeguards are put in place, it is incumbent upon the Indian Government to ensure that such laws are used sparingly and not merely as armor to regulate content that is critical of its practices.</p><p>— About the author: <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/shreya-tewari">Shreya</a> is an Employee Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center, where she works on the Lumen Project.

<p>What are utility tokens is definitely one of the most asked questions to Google in the cryptocurrency and blockchain arena.</p>
<p>It is a non-physical token. Think of a phone token that you can’t touch or hold in your hand, but is credited to you if you hand over money to the provider or its intermediary. This means that the purchaser of a Utility Token has paid the Token issuer so that the company can use the product or service it provides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crowdfunding: an interesting case is Crowdfunding, where a company sells a Utility Token of a product it has yet to develop and the customer buying it provides the company with the financial resources needed to develop the product that the Token buyer will be able to use when that good or service is launched.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://commercio.network">Commercio.network</a> has created an utility Token that is a generic service and therefore subject to VAT. This definition and the relative fiscal treatment has been suggested&nbsp; thanks to our Request&nbsp; that Commerc.io srl has submitted&nbsp; to the Italian Revenue Agency.&nbsp; Answer n 110 of 20/04/2020 on VAT treatment available at the Agency website at this address:</p>

 How the EWT Escrow Model Unlocks the Full Potential of the Energy Web Tech&nbsp;Stack <p>As our <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/its-coming-quality-of-service-guarantees-for-decentralized-technologies-c0e133ebe644">CEO Walter recently explained</a>, service-level agreements (SLAs) are important tools when it comes to widespread commercial adoption of new technologies, especially digital technologies like software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud computing. They give enterprise customers confidence by providing guaranteed performance and availability of service at a fixed cost, and they give vendors clear delivery requirements and stable&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>We intend for <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/">EW-DOS</a> to become a de facto standard for digital identity and infrastructure in the energy sector. For this vision to become reality, we need to figure out how to deliver the guarantees of traditional SLAs and the convenience of “-as-a-service” subscriptions—in the context of a public network operated by many different organizations from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Over the past year we’ve spent hundreds of hours researching technologies, brainstorming commercial and operational models, and speaking with members of our community to identify a solution. The result is an EWT escrow and subscription model for services in the Utility Layer of the EW-DOS stack that combines well-established elements from financial markets and enterprise IT procurement practices with features common in emerging decentralized finance and escrow applications.</p><p>In addition to promoting the physical, commercial, and political decentralization of EW-DOS, this model will catalyze the transition from pilots and proof-of-concept applications to mainstream adoption and commercial implementations. It’s also a triple-win scenario for the three primary stakeholders in the Energy Web community:</p>  Users of EW-DOS—especially enterprise customers like grid operators, OEMs, and energy companies—will gain easy access to performant, reliable services that help them realize the benefits of running applications on&nbsp;EW-DOS.  Operators of EW-DOS, including EWC validators and technology vendors, can build stable, profitable business models around hosting infrastructure nodes in a public&nbsp;network.  The EWT community gains a new way to use their EWT to contribute in the development and operation of EW-DOS infrastructure, which ultimately will accelerate digital transformation across the global energy sector and help to decarbonize the grid&nbsp;faster.  <p>This article describes the key roles, processes, and value propositions of the escrow model at a high level. While the main components are already being developed into a working prototype, some of the fine details have yet to be finalized. Our intent with this article is to elicit feedback and questions from the community, so don’t hesitate to respond in the comments&nbsp;below.</p>How it&nbsp;startedHow it’s&nbsp;going How EWT Escrow&nbsp;Works <p>Just like in proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus models (and in traditional escrow models in financial and energy markets), the purpose of EWT escrow is to incentivize/reward honest behavior and discourage/penalize bad actors. However, instead of being used to achieve consensus in a blockchain, EWT escrow is used to achieve performance guarantees for digital services like key management, data storage, and high-volume messaging in the Utility Layer of the EW-DOS stack. These services are necessary to support all types of applications running on EW-DOS, from <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/catalonian-grid-operator-electra-caldense-energy-web-and-bamboo-energy-announce-grid-flexibility-51c75e5bcc25">distributed flexibility markets</a>, to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/dena-selects-energy-web-to-build-prototype-identity-registry-for-germanys-energy-market-2580f53b2d20">identity registries for energy assets</a>, to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/r3-joins-energy-web-to-provide-enterprise-grade-settlement-services-for-the-energy-sector-d4a6a834da44">enterprise-grade settlement</a>, and even <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripple-and-energy-web-announce-worlds-first-decarbonized-blockchain-5c3cecbff31a">decarbonizing blockchains themselves</a>.</p><p>The EWT escrow model has two primary roles, which anyone in the global community can&nbsp;become:</p>  Service Providers (“Providers”) are organizations that operate Utility Layer service nodes. In order to become a qualified Provider, an organization must pass a basic KYC check and deposit a minimum balance of EWT into an escrow smart contract for a multi-year period. Once qualified, Providers can launch service nodes by depositing an incremental amount of EWT in escrow and passing a performance test for each node. To meet the minimum escrow balance requirement, providers can either acquire the necessary EWT themselves or accept EWT from external Patrons in the wider community. As long as Providers deliver services in accordance with the prescribed rules, they will earn a stable income on their deposited EWT.  Patrons are individuals or organizations that deposit EWT in escrow on behalf of Providers (similar to the relationship between <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-validator">validators</a> and <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-nominator">nominators</a> in Polkadot). Unlike Providers, there are no minimum balance thresholds or lockup periods for Patrons; anyone who holds any amount of EWT can participate. Patrons have the flexibility to withdraw or transfer their EWT from the escrow account(s) of Providers at any time, creating competition among Providers to deliver the most-reliable services (and thus earn the highest and most-stable income) and to offer the most competitive revenue-sharing models (to attract the most Patrons).  <p>There is no limit to the number of Service Providers. In fact, to meet the enterprise performance requirements for applications running on EW-DOS, we anticipate the need for hundreds of Providers operating thousands of nodes globally to ensure sufficient geographic coverage and network reliability for millions of applications and end-users.</p><p>At this time, the expected minimum escrow threshold for becoming a qualified Provider will be in the range of 10,000–100,000 EWT with an additional 1,000–10,000 EWT per service node. The incremental escrow requirement for individual nodes means each node will be judged (in terms of payments and penalties) on its own performance, and it also helps prevent monopolization. The final decision on the threshold requirements will be made based on feedback from the EW-DOS community, and must balance the need to ensure reliability and guarantee trust for enterprise users without creating insurmountable barriers to entry for potential Providers.</p><p>In addition to incentivizing good performance, Provider escrow accounts are used to make the Utility Layer carbon neutral from day one. Each month, the escrow accounts will be drawn down to purchase renewables via <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web&nbsp;Zero</a>.</p><p>Providers will be required to commit to delivering services for ~two or more years from the time of their initial enrollment (two years is a standard contract length for most enterprise IT services). During this period, deposited EWT will remain locked and if the Provider fully ceases delivering services they will forfeit their escrow balance. Providers who commit to a longer service delivery period will earn more each year than those who commit to the minimum duration. This multi-year commitment ensures that Providers are fully dedicated to delivering reliable services, and gives enterprise customers assurances about service availability and quality over a longer time horizon. After the initial commitment period, Providers may exit the Utility Layer service pool and withdraw their EWT from escrow by providing six months advance notice (which allows other Providers to backfill capacity as&nbsp;needed).</p><p>As long as Providers operate reliable service nodes that meet the performance standards (e.g., uptime, throughput capacity, latency) for each Utility Layer service, they will earn stable income through a combination of subscription payments and rewards from the Community Fund. Annual income for a Provider will be in the range of 10–20% of their EWT escrow account&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Initially, Providers’ income will be subsidized by the Community Fund&nbsp;, but over time as adoption (and subscription volume) increases, this subsidy will diminish. We expect that within 3–5 years, the Utility Layer will be driven by a sustainable commercial model where the vast majority of Provider earnings will be derived from subscription payments.</p><p>Patrons should expect to earn similar, if not identical, income as Providers (i.e., at least 10–20% of deposited EWT annually), though exact revenue-sharing arrangements will be determined by each Provider individually. To reiterate, there are no minimum escrow thresholds or commitment periods for Patrons. It is up to each Provider to define their own terms for Patrons, and natural competition encourages Providers to invest in appropriate infrastructure to ensure high-quality services, and to offer favorable terms to attract Patrons and maximize their own earning potential. When evaluating Providers, Patrons should consider not just revenue-sharing terms, but also reputation (e.g., overall historical performance) and individual node&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>In the event that a node fails to deliver services in accordance with the performance standards, the offending node and its Provider each lose a portion of their EWT deposit (similar to slashing in other crypto staking models). Accordingly, Providers are strongly incentivized to invest in appropriate resources and backup systems to ensure that nodes do not experience unplanned outages (especially if they have accepted EWT from external Patrons). If they fall below the minimum threshold, they must replenish their balance to remain eligible to host their node(s). Importantly, Utility Layer services are designed so that the failure of any given node does not materially impact the overall service. Much like electric grids, the Utility Layer is built to withstand the unexpected loss of individual components.</p> What to expect moving&nbsp;forward <p>Our goal is to launch the first Utility Layer services, complete with escrow and subscriptions, in production by Q3&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Here’s what to expect between now and&nbsp;then:</p>  In the next two weeks, we will publish more information outlining the service subscription model and explaining how EW Switchboard is used to manage both escrow and subscriptions.  In April 2021, we will release a series of video demonstrations, technical documentation, and a clickable prototype for the escrow and subscription models.  In May 2021, we will conduct an alpha release of escrow and subscription tools on our testnet&nbsp;Volta.  In June 2021, we will conduct a beta release of escrow and service components on the Energy Web Chain (EWC), with an initial cohort of Service Providers from the EWC validator community.  Throughout the remainder of the year, we will focus on scaling the Utility Layer service network, onboarding additional Providers and Patrons from the wider Energy Web community, adding new Utility Layer services, and integrating the escrow and subscription models with exchanges and other external systems to make it even easier to participate.  <p>We’ll also be publishing a steady stream of articles, tutorials, and demos in the coming months to further explain the operational and commercial details of the escrow model.

 Thriving or Surviving? A Conversation on the Black Informal Economy with Equity and Transformation <p>By Nicole Allred, Strategic Communications, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Richard Wallace- Founder and Director of Equity and Transformation<p>For years, politicians have talked about the need to create economic opportunities that support and expand the middle class in America. On one extreme, the political dynamics and systems of power place the greatest attention on the well-heeled and the well off. However, at the other extreme are those everyday people struggling simply to survive day-to-day within the same system. In this economic system, individuals and families are either thriving or just surviving.</p><p>Richard Wallace, founder of Equity and Transformation [EAT] in Chicago, is an advocate for those working in the Black informal economy — people who are excluded from mainstream sanctioned opportunities to earn a livable wage, and instead, use creativity and community networks to make enough money to piece together a&nbsp;living.</p><p>As we continue our <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">blog series focused on racial justice</a>, we’re speaking with leaders in the field to highlight their perspectives and life journeys that led to their work. EAT [an Omidyar Network grantee] calls out the hypocrisy of our economic system by asking some direct questions: Who has economic privilege in our society, even at more disadvantaged levels, and why? How and why does the state determine which forms of work are sanctioned while others are illegal? In January, EAT issued the <a href="https://www.survivaleconomies.report/">Survival Economies Report</a> which examines each of these dynamics and more as part of the organization’s mission to support those in the informal&nbsp;economy.</p><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-team/nicole-allred/">Nicole Allred</a> conducted this interview with Richard Wallace. A transcript of our conversation is below, edited for length and&nbsp;clarity.</p> Nicole Allred: Richard I want to go back to the beginning to hear about your childhood, your mother’s transition into the ministry, and how that shaped your worldview from the&nbsp;start. <p>Richard Wallace: It was an interesting journey. I grew up in a single-parent household raised by my mother, who often worked two jobs most of her life. I remember when she came home one day and said she was quitting her job for the ministry. We were already poor, but in my mind, it was about to get worse! So, she left her job and began her work in the ministry starting in the church. She wanted to preach, but the male dominated system wouldn’t allow her, so she found solace preaching where no one else was, and that was behind prison walls. This is really where I get introduced to the practice of being accountable to the people you want to help and, in the inverse, who are helping you, and this is how I approach the work&nbsp;today.</p> NA: And you were about six or seven when your mom started the ministry, right? <p>RW: Yeah, she would take me behind the prison walls without a pause. I would go through the searches and be back there with most of the folks we consider “heavies.” They would tell me stories about what they would do in the ’90s in Chicago if they were&nbsp;free.</p><blockquote>“These were genuinely great humans behind bars, and I knew that when I left, they couldn’t&nbsp;leave.”</blockquote> NA: So, what happened next, and talk a bit about your own experience with the system and incarceration. <p>RW: My mom and my family planted seeds, but no matter how deep the seeds are planted, there are still things you have to go through and experience as a young&nbsp;person.</p><blockquote>“My mom moved us into a townhouse in the suburbs, and I was like an ink drop in a glass of&nbsp;milk.”</blockquote><p>I was the only Black person on my block. It was exciting to have a townhouse, but we were poor. Middle class integration has always been the goal for Black families, but the truth is there was a contradiction that exists there. Things that other kids did in our community I would get arrested for. So, what was really a maladjusted reaction to that lifestyle turned into a two and a half year bid at the [Illinois Youth Center] state&nbsp;prison.</p><p>So, I was going to visit these places when I was six and seven years old, and now I’m in this place in my teens. It was a rude awakening for me. It became one of the core experiences that transformed my life. My service to the people began there. Incarceration was horrible, but the lived experience after incarceration was much&nbsp;worse.</p> NA: How was your current work with Equity and Transformation and its mission born out of your experience being incarcerated? <p>RW: There are thousands of collateral consequences to being incarcerated when you come home. Your citizenship has thousands of doors that are no longer open to you. You don’t have access to employment nor college because of your background. What that meant for me is that I had to hustle to&nbsp;survive.</p><blockquote>“Unemployed people are barred from the system on which they depend for subsistence. If you don’t stay in the system, then they dare you to find a means of subsistence for yourself.”</blockquote><p>In my work organizing the temp labor sector around issues of discrimination and exploitation, many of the immigrant workers faced higher rates of exploitation because of their undocumented status. Employers were able to extract higher value labor out of immigrant workers than Black workers. Meanwhile, Black workers would sit for hours before being chosen to go to the jobsite because the immigrant workers were always chosen first. So, there was a lot of tension between Black and Latino workers because of this notion of “privilege.” That said, immigrant exploitive wages of $4-$5 per hour would never have been accepted by Black workers, and that is why these groups need to be in solidarity.</p><blockquote>“Our folks are literally out here working and dying to survive.“</blockquote><p>They are standing in a temp line and often being passed over. Ironically, I can work for a Fortune 500 company in prison making 89 cents a day, but I come home, and I can’t work for that same Fortune 500 company. It’s the same in the temp labor sector. I can’t work for this institution for full pay and a union, but they can garnish my wages and charge me for transportation to and from&nbsp;work.</p> NA: EAT is the only organization working to support the Black informal economy and recently published the <a href="https://www.survivaleconomies.report/">Survival Economies Report</a>. You reveal that policymakers are light years behind in the development of alternatives to formal employment. What do you mean by that? What are people doing to&nbsp;survive? <p>RW: When we started EAT, I definitely thought there was a range of things we could do including building informal workers associations built out by trade. The reality is our people are doing a multitude of activities. They’re hair braiding, scrap metal trade people, and street vending, which is a wide range of activities from selling DVDs to clothes. They’re ride sharing. There’s just a host of activities our people are engaged&nbsp;in.</p><blockquote>“One of the patterns we discovered is that occupations that exist in the informal sector aren’t fixed. They don’t stay there for perpetuity. They migrate from informal to formal, and in that process of migration there is a lack of retention of Black&nbsp;bodies.”</blockquote><p>Let me break that down. Bootlegging alcohol had a high rate of Black activity. People could enter it and leave it at their leisure. Then it is legalized, and it becomes hard to find a Black alcohol manufacturer. People point to celebrities like 50 Cent and P-Diddy, but they own the label. They put the label on the bottle. We’re talking about manufacturing the actual&nbsp;product.</p><p>When you think about ride sharing, you get Uber, but you don’t think about the people who are already doing ride sharing in our communities. It supported people who didn’t have the money to take a cab or to own their own care. So, it was really about shared resources. Then it becomes formalized and makes billions for the owner but very little for the drivers using their own cars. Once again, the pioneers are left out of ownership.</p><p>So, I believe there are innovations galore. This is a pattern when I say our folks are innovative.</p><blockquote>“When you really begin to see informality, you get some of the strongest expressions of Black culture.”</blockquote> NA: There is also a certain level of organization, planning, hustle, and work that goes into these informal activities. The report reveals what goes into someone selling loose cigarettes, for example. You have to be at a certain place at a certain time or you’re going to miss your main morning rush. Come rain or shine you still need to be there. Even buying those cigarettes at the cost that you need so that you can then sell them at the right markup. There is so much that the report broke down that I hadn’t even considered. We then start thinking about COVID and how these activities require people to be close by. How have these activities been impacted by&nbsp;COVID? <p>RW: In mid-March it dawned on us that COVID was here to stay. We immediately took a look at the CARES Act, and there are two provisions that boxed out informal workers from receiving any aid — the child support clause and paying taxes. If they hadn’t paid taxes in the past five years, they were ineligible, and if they owed child support, they were ineligible. So, nine out of 10 Black folks who were informal workers were ineligible when in fact these were the people who needed the resources the&nbsp;most.</p><blockquote>“There is a consistent bifurcation of resources so that these people are said to be deserving and other people are not. What does it mean to self-quarantine when you are homeless? What does it mean to tell someone to self-quarantine in a home that may be more violent than the streets&nbsp;are?”</blockquote><p>We developed COVID 19 life kits to educate people about COVID because we were battling the ghost of Tuskegee and also the digital divide. A lot of our folks don’t have IDs nor smart phones. So, while the average person is watching the news, where are homeless people getting the information that is alarming the rest of the world? So, we developed the kit to myth bust and also provide mutual&nbsp;aid.</p> NA: Thinking about philanthropy and systems of power, what role do you think philanthropy should&nbsp;play? <p>RW: We need philanthropy to get behind us and invest in our experimentations of alternatives. It’s one thing to dismantle the system but invest in us to rebuild. Rebuilding requires experimentation. It requires us sitting in a room with the community, freedom dreaming and then coming out and testing&nbsp;it.</p><p>My experience has evolved from direct action to electoral politics to policy to research and has come full circle.

<p>The OpenID Foundation is a non-profit international standardization organization of individuals and companies committed to enabling, promoting, and protecting OpenID technologies. Formed in June 2007, the Foundation serves as a public trust organization representing the open community of developers, vendors, and users. The Foundation assists the community by providing needed infrastructure and help in promoting and supporting expanded adoption of OpenID.</p>
<p>The strength and viability of the OpenID Foundation is predicated on its ability to earn the active support of both individual members and innovative global organizations. Every member in the Foundation is valued for what they contribute to the larger whole and this is why it is so important that the Foundation strives to maintain long time members while attracting new membership.</p>
<p>As the Foundation continues to grow globally, it requires an increasing investment to support the day-to-day operations while enabling the expansion of the Foundation to include the certification program, driving new outreach opportunities – such as Open Banking initiatives worldwide, and supporting new working groups. The OpenID Foundation has not increased membership dues in over 10 years; the board of directors recently revisited the topic of membership dues and unanimously approved increases to membership fees effective July 1, 2021:</p>



Individual Level
$50


Non-Profit Organization Level
$250


Organization with 1-25 Employees Level
$1,000


Organization with 26-100 Employees Level
$5,000


Organization with More than 100 Employees Level
$20,000


Sustaining Organization Level
$50,000



<p>The Foundation recognizes that individuals and organizations have to make difficult decisions when it comes to both financial and time commitments to organizations like the OpenID Foundation. The Foundation cannot exist without the ongoing support of both long-standing and new members alike so the board of directors would like to thank all members and those considering membership for their support of the increases in membership dues.</p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/04/openid-foundation-announces-increases-to-membership-dues-in-2021/">OpenID Foundation Announces Increases to Membership Dues in 2021</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a>.

 Energy Web and Volkswagen Jointly Investigate the Potential of Blockchains for Energy Market Integration <p>Zug, Switzerland and Wolfsburg, Germany — 4 March 2021 — Today, Energy Web and <a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/group/group-innovation.html">Volkswagen Group Innovation</a>, the research department of one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers, Volkswagen Group, announced a partnership to investigate digitalization and integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure in support of advanced electric vehicle charging programs and markets globally. Under the partnership, Volkswagen Group Innovation and Energy Web will jointly develop and test open-source software to enable seamless end-to-end electricity market participation for electric vehicles. The test will pair Energy Web’s open-source tech stack with existing EV charging standards, including the ISO 15118 Plug &amp; Charge standard in combination with the PKI of <a href="https://www.electrifyamerica.com/">Electrify America</a>, one of the world’s largest EV charging networks.</p><p>EVs are known for their powertrain efficiency, lack of tailpipe emissions, and ability to run on carbon-free renewable energy, making them a crucial component for decarbonizing the transportation sector. But they can also add tremendous value to low-carbon energy systems. With digital infrastructure in place, grid operators can use EVs to avoid electricity network congestion, absorb greater amounts of renewable energy, and increase the resilience of electricity networks. The market for electric vehicles to provide such services is slowly maturing, with <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ferc-orders-grid-operators-to-open-wholesale-markets-to-distributed-energy-resources">regulators increasingly requiring</a> customer-owned resources be allowed to compete in electricity markets on equal footing with traditional centrally managed and controlled thermal power&nbsp;plants.</p><p>“With this partnership, we want to accelerate electric mobility and deliver even more value to EV customers,” explained Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of Energy Web. “One way is to make it easy for EVs to seamlessly participate in energy markets. If we’re successful, the moment an EV rolls off the lot of a dealership that car will be fully integrated into the energy system in the area. Customers can then be paid for their EVs to help balance the grid in near real-time.”</p><p>Volkswagen is a global driver of e-mobility. The newly developed, all-electric ID.3 was launched in 2020, leaping straight to the pole position on the sales chart in many countries in Europe. The ID.4 SUV will follow soon, hitting the market in Europe, China, and the United States. Overall, the Group will be investing about €35 billion in e-mobility in the next five years and launch about 70 all-electric models by&nbsp;2030.</p><p><a href="https://about.bnef.com/electric-vehicle-outlook/">Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) forecasts</a> that annual global EV sales will rise from 1.7 million in 2020 to 54 million by 2040, accounting for nearly 60% of new vehicle sales. As power grids around the world accommodate more and more EVs, dynamic “managed charging” represents today’s state of the art for EV grid integration (such as modulating the timing of EV charging to avoid large spikes in peak energy demand if too many EVs begin charging at the same&nbsp;time).</p><p>“We are keen to explore the possibilities that blockchain technology can have for smart charging applications and how this can have a positive effect on the ecological footprint and thus an increase in value for our customers,” said Marvin Schroeder, the project leader at Volkswagen Group Innovation. “At this early stage of the EV industry we have a great opportunity to shape and improve standards on how EVs like ours integrate into markets around the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>Energy Web has been working with grid operators globally and <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/austrian-power-grid-and-energy-web-foundation-launch-proof-of-concept-to-use-distributed-energy-d9a378f5f5ee">announced a proof of concep</a>t with Austrian Power Grid to use distributed energy resources — especially batteries — for frequency regulation. The same architecture is now being developed by Energy Web to enable any EV to participate in any combination of energy&nbsp;markets.</p><p>For the pilot, a Volkswagen EV and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) will be integrated with the open-source Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) tech stack. The Volkswagen / Energy Web partnership is expected to provide a proof point that EVs and EVSE can be digitized and integrated cost efficiently, securely, and compliant with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to electricity markets and grid operator operational systems.</p><p>About Volkswagen Group<br>The Volkswagen Group, with its headquarters in Wolfsburg, is one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers and the largest carmaker in Europe. The Group comprises twelve brands from seven European countries, including Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, SEAT, ŠKODA, and Porsche. Every working day, 671,205 employees around the globe produce an average of 44,567 vehicles, are involved in vehicle-related services, or work in other areas of business. The Volkswagen Group sells its vehicles in 153 countries. With its Together 2025+ strategy, the Volkswagen Group has paved the way for the biggest change process in its history: the realignment into one of the world’s leading providers of sustainable mobility.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. Our Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) enables any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market.

<p>Working Group approved status</p>
 
 Sidetree is a protocol for creating scalable decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) networks that can run on top of any existing decentralized anchoring system (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, HL Fabric, QLDB) and be as open, public, and permissionless as the underlying anchoring systems they utilize. The protocol allows users to create globally unique, user-controlled identifiers and manage their associated metadata, all without the need for centralized authorities or trusted third parties.

<p>DCMS Trust Framework - UK Govt.<br>
The UK government has published its draft rules of the road for governing the future use of digital identities.  The new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">trust framework</a> lays out the draft rules of the road organisations should follow. It includes the principles, policies, procedures and standards governing the use of digital identity to allow for the sharing of information to check people’s identities or personal details, such as a user’s address or age, in a trusted and consistent way. This will enable interoperability and increase public confidence.  The framework, once finalised, is expected to be brought into law.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport">DCMS</a> are seeking feedback on the trust framework until 11 March, through a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">survey</a> that is available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 banks in the <a href="https://yes.com/">yes®</a> scheme enable online banking customers to prove their identity to 3rd parties with existing bank-managed KYC data. This data can also be used to seamlessly create qualified electronic signatures conforming to the EU’s eIDAS directive.</p>
<p>The banks recently finished the migration of all Identity Providers (IdPs) in the yes® scheme towards OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance (<a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">eKYC &amp; IDA</a>). From a technical perspective, this means over 1,000 different bank IdPs participating in the yes scheme were adapted to support requests for verified claims and are able to assert verified claims in ID Tokens, UserInfo, and Token Introspection responses.</p>
<p>yes partners undertook this major investment because OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance provides all the necessary bits and pieces to support strong identification, including regulated use cases, such as eIDAS or eKYC, while being simple to use, versatile, and privacy preserving.</p>
<p>yes firmly believes that open international standards benefit every industry and they are especially crucial for the fragmented banking market to compete with new entrants.</p>
<p>Since yes operates an ecosystem with multiple implementations of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance, it’s aware of the importance of interoperability and the key role conformance tests play to achieve it. yes therefore decided to provide <a href="https://openid.net/oidf-directed-funding-faq/">directed funding</a> to the OpenID Foundation to develop conformance tests for OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance as part of the <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Foundation Certification Program</a>. yes will also contribute its existing test implementation to the Foundation as part of its contributions.</p>
<p>yes hopes to facilitate the further evolution of OpenID Connect for Identity assurance and its broad adoption in the market. Furthermore, yes is hopeful that other Foundation members that have a vested interest in the success of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance will follow with additional directed funding and contributions to support the development of conformance tests and the expansion of the OpenID Foundation Certification Program.</p>

<p>The community effort to bridge DID methods with a new data model</p> <p>The world of digital identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) is evolving quickly, giving much cause for optimism. Standards are starting to connect and move towards functional interoperability, regulated by testable protocols. Most of this work is happening on the level of VCs. However, DIDs and their infrastructure are also starting to converge and mature as an extensible-yet-interoperable technology.</p><p>Adoption by markets, standards bodies and regulators is largely contingent upon provable security and provable interoperability, so these promising developments cannot come soon enough.</p><p>The Digital Identity Foundation (DIF) is very proud to be hosting one particular research and development project that could prove pivotal in this process. It is currently a work item of DIF’s <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>. However, a charter for an autonomous working group will be available for review at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">#IIW31</a> this week (20–22 October 2020) to facilitate broader participation. The project is called KERI and it is a project that could only be developed in the open, for the public good and for the widest, quickest adoption.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pucelano">Fernando Santander</a> But first, what is&nbsp;KERI? <p>KERI stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. A “key event” is a discrete event in time that involves public/private keypairs, often called blockchain identities or cryptographic identities. These events can be generalized as inceptions (creations), rotations, and signing events: the three kinds of events for which KERI generates and handles receipts. In other words, key events are cryptographic events in the history of an identifier.</p><p>Importantly, everything else a decentralized identifier says, does, or refers to is not a key event. As KERI is deliberately laser-focused on key events only, we can call these other events non-KERI events. The real world consequences of a signature or rotation are out of scope and method-specific to boot. KERI is only interested in the most universal aspect of interactions between keys and cryptographic systems, i.e. the cryptography that allows drastically different DID systems to trust each other’s security guarantees.</p><blockquote>“DID Methods exist to solve a trust issue. This does it in a different way.”<br>Charles Cunningham (Jolocom GmbH, Rust development lead for KERI)</blockquote><p>Each key event produces a receipt containing only checkable signatures of key event information. Nothing more. Receipts are threaded into logs tracking the history of each identifier, which is similar to a traceable audit trail of hashes — useful for confirming but not for deducing the underlying key material. These threads are compiled into logs that are shared and replicated according to a consensus algorithm and a logic of trust thresholds that creates a fabric of shared history between nodes.</p> Is KERI a blockchain or a DLT? No. Does it replace blockchains? Also&nbsp;no. <p>The trust fabric created when KERI nodes share and propagate key material records might</p><p>sound redundant to the blockchains where all of today’s DID methods store their key material chronologically. To a degree, this is true: each log containing the history of one key is a “microledger,” like a blockchain with only one participant. Inception and rotation events in all of today’s DID methods are stored in a chronological distributed ledger which can be crawled to create a log of these key events by DID. So, why the redundancy? Why replicate a subset of the blockchain’s capabilities and features in a distinct blockchain-like infrastructure just for key material?</p><p>The answer is simple and manifold: blockchains enable many features outside the scope of KERI. These features bring with them complexity, diversity, scale costs, and trust issues. Within KERI’s scope, however, only some of a blockchain or distributed ledger technology’s (DLT’s) features are necessary. Total ordering and double-spend protection, for instance, are hallmarks of distributed ledgers, but hardly justify the added complexity here.</p>Subset of blockchain/DLT capabilities required by KERI (<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/KERI2_Overview.web.pdf">Dr Sam Smith</a>, 2019)<p>Working backwards from a short list of security features, KERI infrastructure can be a much more performant, minimalist distributed ledger system. It is still in the family tree of blockchain, DLTs and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), but it is closer to a sidechain or a trans-blockchain interoperability mechanism. In use cases where all that is needed is a self-certifying, widely-portable identifier, KERI can stand alone as a lightweight DID method. In combination with a traditional DID Method, KERI can increase key management options and strengthen security guarantees by raising a red flag at the first discrepancy between the two parallel and redundant systems.</p><p>As a scaling mechanism, KERI can also take away some of the traffic and complexity from the underlying blockchain. In implementations where key management and state maintenance (record keeping about keys that rotate over time) are entrusted directly to the KERI mechanism, these functions can be operated much closer to the edge and replicate after a slight delay. This might be a totally acceptable trade-off of efficiency for latency in many use cases. For example, a roundtrip write-and-wait-for-finality transaction on a global blockchain makes no sense in a low-connectivity Internet of things (IoT) use case, where double-spend is a non-issue.</p> KERI is both an interoperability mechanism and a standardization incentive <p>More importantly for the DIF, however, is another major feature of KERI: it could become the foundation of massive interoperability and portability at the infrastructure layer. What’s more, if adopted by enough major players, it could even speed up the standardization process of DIDs themselves. By offering a minimum level of security guarantees shared across all participating methods, it would simplify the security review process for both individual DID methods and for interoperable DIDs as a whole.</p><p>By abstracting out the universal, minimal set of key functions, a KERI log that spans multiple ledgers or methods is just as verifiable as one that does not. This means that anywhere</p><p>self-certifying KERI identifiers are accepted, an identifier’s history can stretch back further than the existence of KERI. Plus, that history can include so-called “portability events”, where an identifier is deactivated on one ledger and re-activated on another. Method-specific features or records might still need to be exported and imported. The core proof of control function of a DID, however, would be universalized in a way that enabled massive portability.</p><p>This same universalizing effect of sharing a security vocabulary across all participating DID methods has the added benefit of being able to guarantee certain security features in any KERI-compliant system. Since KERI also lends itself to simple compliance tests, and since KERI logs give a benchmark against which to test method-specific and blockchain-specific security, this is a small leap for each DID method and a giant leap for standardization and security engineering.</p> KERI’s history: from whitepaper to community incubation <p>So far we have been highly technical in our explanation of the project. A careful reader, however, may already have caught the community commitment implicit in phrases such as “KERI-compliant” and “participating DID methods.” KERI is only useful if the major DID methods incorporate it, or if the set of participating DID methods becomes congruous over time with the set of major DID methods.</p><p>It is, in a nutshell, a community project of alignment as much as a technological innovation: an agreement on the security model for the common core functionality shared across all DID methods, allowing much variety and extensibility to be preserved by the participating DID methods. Decentralized identifiers have been very decentralized in their design and governance from the beginning, with a high degree of extensibility and flexibility within the fiefdom of each DID method and its governance. KERI has been gathering steam for over a year as a countervailing force, potentially making all DIDs function in an end-verifiable and thus universal way.</p><blockquote>“Investing in KERI is investing in interoperability, standardization, and cross-community security guarantees.”<br><br>Dr. Sam Smith, author of the KERI whitepaper and project lead</blockquote><p>In large part, the roots of KERI lie in debates within the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a>. For years it has been discussing the “shalls” and “mays” that define a W3C-compliant DID method (and thus a DID system). In practical terms, this process specifies what each DID method can and must assume about other DID methods for such a decentralized and open system to make appropriate security guarantees.</p><p>KERI’s creator and the author of its whitepaper is Samuel M Smith PhD., a pioneering technologist in multiple fields, including automated reasoning, distributed systems, autonomous vehicles and blockchain protocol design. Dr. Smith has been refining and experimenting with such a cross-method mechanism since 2019, presenting at every meeting of the biannual Internet Identity Workshop. First came some core principles and requirements of a key infrastructure at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/OffChain_%28PKI%29_Key_Management_%E2%80%93_Revocation_Rotation">IIW28</a>, then at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI:_1_Universal_DKMI_Root%28s%29_of_Trust_Decentralized_Systems_Primitires_%26_DKMI_Last_Mile_of_Trust">IIW29</a> a series of sessions about different aspects of a hypothetical system of witnesses that could replicate logs. For <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_%28C%29_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">IIW30</a>, Dr Smith brought more concrete sessions on finer points and even the roadmapping session that became the DIF working group. Along the way, he has iterated an ever-growing <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">whitepaper</a> describing and explaining all of this.</p><p>Now, however, Dr Smith has moved the project into the DIF under the auspices of its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a> where he sits as co-chair. Asked about the decision, Dr Smith said, “DIF was a natural choice because I wanted the work to happen quickly but in the open, with participation from the greatest number of companies and innovators across various communities.”</p> KERI’s contributors: join&nbsp;us! <p>Foremost among DIF contributors is, of course, Dr Smith, who brings to his KERI design work more than a decade of engineering experience with scale and high-performance systems. Much of this work, focusing largely on AI and streaming/scaling projects, was done through his Python-centric consulting company <a href="http://prosapien.com">Prosapien.com</a>. He has also worked with Consensys, contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/reputage/seedQuest">Seed Quest</a> project among others, soon to be donated to DIF.</p><p>Berlin-based <a href="https://jolocom.io/">Jolocom GmbH</a> has been a major interlocutor in the early development of KERI, since before the creation of the working group at DIF. Jolocom’s Charles Cunningham is the working group’s lead Rust developer, who has written a highly interesting post about mental models of <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/how-keri-tackles-the-problem-of-trust/">How KERI tackles the problem of trust</a> from a developer’s point of view for the Jolocom logbook.</p><p>Representing <a href="https://www.spherity.com">Spherity GmbH are the working group’s lead </a>JavaScript developer and note-taker. Spherity’s founder, Carsten Stöcker, has written a detailed piece for his company’s blog which called KERI “<a href="https://medium.com/spherity/introducing-keri-8f50ed1d8ed7">a more performant ledger for trusted identities</a>.”</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit, has been co-developing on the Rust side as well, working in parallel and providing input on the design considerations. The Human Colossus Foundation has also put substantial energy into promoting and socializing KERI in the Trust-over-IP Foundation, the MyData community and in the Sovrin community, including featuring an hour-long KERI <a href="https://vimeo.com/459348260">session</a> prominently in a half-day <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">mini-conference</a> it organized.</p><p>At IIW31, the KERI developers will be demonstrating their initial work to date while there is still the opportunity to get involved and determine the course of KERI as the project moves from direct mode (two-party) to witness mode (multi-party, distributed consensus). Many sessions are planned for IIW, ranging from introductions to technical discussions to use-case and requirements gathering for KERI-based ideas. Additionally there will be a live demo of the working direct-mode prototype.</p><p>Introductory reading and video materials are collected at the main DIF <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">repository</a>, but even if you don’t watch them in advance (or fully understand them if you do), there are many ways to get involved and make this community project stronger and more diverse.

<p></p>      Now with more focus on growing solutions to deliver privacy, security and trust, CULedger announces company name change. 
<p>Denver, CO (March 3, 2021) – CULedger, an industry leader in privacy- and security-enhanced solutions announces today the changing of its name to Bonifii. This rebranding strategy reflects both the evolution of the company and its vision for future solutions.</p>
<p>CULedger started in 2017 as a research to action project from CUNA’s National Credit Union Roundtable focused on the development of a proprietary blockchain/distributed ledger network and a product exclusively used for call center identification purposes. As the technology evolved, so did the services the company offers. One of the strongest established use cases for blockchain or distributed ledger technology is a decentralized identity that supports the use of best-in-class privacy and security technologies.</p>
<p>Its flagship product, MemberPass(R), is an example of the exchange of verifiable credentials leveraging a combination of distributed ledger, biometrics, and cryptography to protect credit unions’ consumers and small business members. MemberPass is a digital passport that allows members convenient access to their financial accounts while allowing control and privacy of their personal information. MemberPass, powered by Bonifii, will change the way consumers engage and interact with products, services, and information in a digital financial world, and soon in other industries like health care, travel, and government.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Bonifii announced the acquisition of CUFX (Credit Union Financial Exchange) from CUNA’s Technology Council. Under Bonifii, CUFX will be positioned as the exchange of data supported by a systems integration standard and will allow credit unions to increase the speed to become more digital.</p>
<p>“The brand, Bonifii, is a play on the word “bona fide,” which means genuine or authentic and is reflective of our flagship MemberPass product. The “ii” at the end of Bonifii is a symbolic reference to our mission which is to deliver a trusted and verifiable peer-to-peer exchange network,” explains Julie Esser, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bonifii.</p>
<p>Consumers trust their financial relationships. Now financial institutions can invest in and deploy trust-first technologies to give consumers confidence and peace of mind while reducing fraud and improving the member relationships.

<p>A few days ago the news that Christie’s, the well-known auction house, has decided to move with decisive steps towards the emerging market of Crypto art.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entrance in the Nft of the well known auction house Christie’s, which, from February 25 to March 11, will auction Everydays – The First 5000 Days, a work created by Beeple, born Mike Winkelmann, already a recordman of crypto art. This is the first auction of a Not Fungible Token made by a major auction house, an event of historical significance that will certainly affect the development of the digital art market.</p>
<p>But what are Nfts?</p>
<p>Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is the acronym of Non-Fungible Token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does “non-fungible” mean? When something is fungible it can easily be replaced by something identical and is totally interchangeable. A physical example of a non-fungible asset would be an airline ticket. Each ticket looks the same as the other tickets, but each one has written on it the name of the passenger, the destination, the time of departure, and the precise number of seats to go to. Exchanging this ticket with a stranger brings serious consequences, such as ending up thousands of miles away from where you wanted to go, should airport security not stop you first. This all changes with Non Fungible Tokens, many of which conform to a standard called ERC-721.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non Fungible Tokens (NFT) are therefore a type of digital asset registered on blockchain and have 3 characteristics that set them apart: they are unique, rare and indivisible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NFT tokens can represent many different types of digital assets such as: collectibles on blockchain, digital artwork, property in virtual reality, event tickets, gaming items. They can also be used to certify real estate, cars, artwork, and intellectual property of various kinds.</p>
<p>One of the pioneers of non-fungible tokens was CryptoKitties. Co, an app on Ethereum where players have the ability to collect and breed digital cats. If you’ve ever had a cat, you know that they’re not easy to replace because their appearance and personality make them unique. In this case, CryptoKitties has replicated this concept in the Blockchain world with each cat’s digital genetic material stored in an NFT Token. These Tokens/Cats can be bought and sold on Ethereum, and some are rarer than others. In fact, sales in 2017 reached $12 million with the most expensive CryptoKitty selling for $120,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFT market and development is facing a future full of surprises. The potential of this industry is still largely unexplored. There are thousands of use cases for NFT tokens: product warranties, certificates of ownership, certificates of origin and many, many more.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://commercio.network">Commercio.network</a> plans to offer companies a system to generate NFT Tokens quickly and easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine being able to tokenize your receivables by creating an NFT Token of an invoice, and get liquidity quickly by assigning the receivable to a third party on an NFT Token Exchange.</p>

<p>The leading electronic interchange format for business documents enters the 60-day public review that precedes the call for consent as an OASIS Standard.</p> 


<p>OASIS and the Universal Business Language TC [1] are pleased to announce that Universal Business Language Version 2.3 Committee Specification 01 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>UBL is the leading electronic interchange format for business documents. It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes.</p>



<p>The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:</p>



  A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.  A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.  A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.  



<p>Version 2.3 is a minor revision to v2.2 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 91.</p>



<p>The TC has received 4 Statements of Use from IBM, ClearView Trade, the Swedish Procurement Agency, and Philip Helger [3].</p>



<p>The candidate specification and related files are available here:</p>

<p>Standard advanced by Danish Business Authority, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, IBM, Norwegian Agency for Public and Financial Management, and Others</p> 


<p>2 March 2021 — OASIS Open, the global open standards and open source consortium, announced that its members have approved Service Metadata Publishing (SMP) v2.0 as an OASIS Standard, a status that signifies the highest level of ratification. The SMP framework facilitates dynamic discovery and capability matching between participants in a business community and enables addressing and routing in an interoperable and secure network to connect trading partners.</p>



<p>SMP v2.0 describes a specification for publishing service metadata within a 4-corner network, where entities exchange business documents through intermediary gateway services, sometimes called “Access Points.” To successfully send a business document in a 4-corner network, the sending entity must be able to discover critical metadata about the receiving entity, such as which types of documents the trading partner can receive and process automatically and which transport protocols they support. Trading partners make this metadata available to each other in the network, depending on the business processes they implement, always through an SMP service.</p>



<p>“The SMP is a relatively simple, yet powerful specification for registering endpoint capabilities in an eDelivery network that supports many-to-many transactions,” said Professor Dr. Andriana Prentza of the University of Piraeus and member of the OASIS Open Europe Foundation Board of Directors. “It has been proven a very valuable building block in application domains such as eInvoicing and the wider supply chain integration, which require distributed, dynamic discovery and portable registration of end user capabilities.”</p>



<p>“SMP was developed by the OASIS Business Document Exchange TC as part of its mandate to define an open standards framework to support public eProcurement and eInvoicing,” said Kenneth Bengtsson, Chair of the BDXR Technical Committee. “This specification describes the request/response exchanges between a Service Metadata Publisher and a client wishing to discover endpoint information. Once connected, businesses and government agencies can easily and safely reach any other partner on the network. This makes trading partner onboarding a significantly smoother process, and removes a lot of friction from day to day electronic trade.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The international nonprofit association OpenPEPPOL includes the SMP service as a mandatory building block in the architecture of the Peppol Network. Buyers and sellers can publish their receiving capabilities, which facilitate communication in various stages of electronic procurement and other business processes between public and private entities, in a total of 32 countries across the globe.</p>



<p>IBM<br>“As a longtime supporter of both open source and open standards, IBM is proud to support the OASIS BDXR TC to help achieve true frictionless global electronic trade. IBM Sterling’s ongoing contributions to supply chain and e-invoicing technologies like the SMP are instrumental to ensure the needs of our clients and their trading business partners are considered as industry and regulatory standards are developed.”</p>

 Nigeria’s revised Cybersecurity Policy  Codifying Bug Bounty Programs in Cybersecurity practice <p>When Nigeria rebased its <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2014/04/12/step-change">GDP figures</a> in 2013, many observers assumed there would be doubts about the new figures that made Nigeria Africa’s largest economy, after South Africa. Indeed, it was the former figures that were deemed unreliable, because they largely ignored the tremendous contributions made by new sectors such as entertainment, services, and telecoms to the economy. The Economist magazine estimated that the telecoms sector alone accounted for more than <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2014/04/12/step-change">25% of the rebased GDP</a>. Thus, Nigeria began the transition from a monolith petroleum-based economy to a more diversified economy. And with the expansion of the entertainment industry (for example Nollywood, second only to Hollywood), the remarkable growth of the financial services, and the greater integration of digital in the public and private sector, intellectual property and cybersecurity assumed greater importance.</p><p>The increasing importance of cybersecurity in Nigeria is well laid out in industry publications such as Deloitte’s Nigeria <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ng/Documents/risk/ng_nigeria_cyber_security_outlook_2021.pdf">Cybersecurity Outlook</a>, which details what observers of the cybersecurity scene in Nigeria already know — cybercrime has become more sophisticated in Nigeria each passing year. The covid -19 pandemic has also increased the risk and incidence of cyberattacks in Nigeria, as people and organizations are forced to work in remote and less secure environments outside the walls of organizations. The impact of the pandemic which portends some lasting changes to the nature of work and the increasing waves of cyberattacks globally (amongst them the infamous <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/solarwinds-hack-explained-government-agencies-cyber-security-2020-12">Solarwinds</a> hack) makes the recent <a href="https://technologytimes.ng/buhari-inks-national-cyber-security-policy-strategy-nigeria/">signing</a> in February of Nigeria’s revised <a href="https://www.cert.gov.ng/ngcert/resources/NATIONAL_CYBESECURITY_STRATEGY.pdf">Cybersecurity Strategy and Policy</a> even more poignant.</p>Photo: <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/cyber-security-hacker-security-3194286/">Pixabay</a><p>On paper, Nigeria’s Cybersecurity Policy, and its <a href="https://www.cert.gov.ng/ngcert/resources/CyberCrime__Prohibition_Prevention_etc__Act__2015.pdf">Cybercrime Act</a> both specify a detailed and well-thought-out cybersecurity regimen for the nation. Nevertheless, the #EndSars protests of October 2020, which saw hacktivists <a href="https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/10/25/when-govt-agencies-websites-came-under-threat-of-hackers/">compromise</a> a number of government and private digital assets, demonstrate that actual cybersecurity preparedness is different from what is specified in&nbsp;policy.</p><p>To be sure, Nigeria’s Cybersecurity Policy has provisions for a National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre (NCCC) and a Nigerian Computer Emergency Readiness Team (NgCERT) which together have oversight over cybersecurity incident management in different sectors both public and private in the country. Aspects of vulnerability testing and assessment are also codified in the policy (for example initiative 6, page 107, “implementing an Enterprise Application Security Testing regimen’’; initiative 9 page 109 “Developing Blue team and Red team capabilities among cybersecurity actors’’, amongst&nbsp;others).</p><blockquote>Could bug bounty programs improve cybersecurity preparedness in&nbsp;Nigeria?</blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/10/25/when-govt-agencies-websites-came-under-threat-of-hackers/">activities</a> of the #EndSars hacktivists, however, showed just how vulnerable key national cyber-assets are, and perhaps suggests including another layer of defense in the nation’s cybersecurity framework. Could bug bounty programs improve cybersecurity preparedness in Nigeria? Evidence <a href="https://techbeacon.com/security/why-every-organization-needs-bug-bounty-program">elsewhere in the world</a> suggests they are a useful addition to the range of measures nations and organizations implement to strengthen cybersecurity. Bug bounty programs are often initiated to <a href="https://www.stubnet.com.ng/bug-bounty-hof/">supplement</a> internal code audits and penetration tests as part of a vulnerability management strategy. Codifying bug bounties in cybersecurity practice in Nigeria could positively impact the sector and improve cybersecurity readiness particularly in the private&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Despite the promise of bug bounty programs, however, they face at least two hurdles in Nigeria. One is the perceived reputation the country already has as a haven for cybercriminals. This reputation is held not just outside the country, but also within it. This lack of trust will limit the effectiveness of bug bounty programs — which typically work by ordinary citizens with cyber skills unearthing vulnerabilities in digital assets. This lack of trust in Nigeria leads to businesses entrusting cybersecurity penetration tests to other cybersecurity organizations, rather than institute bug bounties. Another hurdle seems to be <a href="https://www.cert.gov.ng/ngcert/resources/CyberCrime__Prohibition_Prevention_etc__Act__2015.pdf">Nigeria’s Cybercrime Act</a>. Part 3 of the Act, “Offences and Penalties’’ has clauses that might criminalize the work of bounty&nbsp;hunters.</p><p>These hurdles notwithstanding, a bug bounty program could invigorate Nigeria’s cybersecurity sector, channel the energy of a new generation of cyber-professionals, and help to plug the holes in Nigeria’s cyber-infrastructure — as so brazenly exposed during the #EndSARS protest of&nbsp;2020.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/nigerias-revised-cybersecurity-policy-codifying-bug-bounties-in-cybersecurity-practice-5a8836c31c46">Nigeria’s revised Cybersecurity Policy: Codifying Bug Bounties in Cybersecurity practice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 2021: A New Year of Hope.. Implementing the Lessons Learned from 2020, the Good and the&nbsp;Bad <p>By Beth Kanter, Strategic Communications and Jessica Kiessel, Learning &amp; Impact, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>2020: The Year of Zoom (and the fatigue is&nbsp;real)<p>We began last year eager to put our freshly minted brand, approach, and teams into action to build more inclusive and equitable societies. AND THEN, <a href="https://youtu.be/gOxh_COf2VY">2020 HAPPENED</a>. In the midst of the twin public health and economic crises, we witnessed a racial justice reckoning and watched as our US democracy came under attack. We found ourselves — like so many others — balancing multiple urgent priorities.</p><blockquote>We focused on supporting staff and grantees through these difficult times, pivoting our work where necessary to meet the moment, and realigning our teams to capture new opportunities.</blockquote><p>Thankfully, even before the pandemic rocked 2020, we had shifted our accountability processes to recognize that contributing toward healthier, more resilient systems is long-term, complex work. Annually, we focus accountability measures on our ability to work with our partners to determine the most promising paths forward, what we have learned, whether we are living our values, and how we steward firm health. Over the long-term, we remain accountable for meaningfully contributions to healthier systems.</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">Reimagining Capitalism</a> <p>The pandemic’s disproportionate impact on frontline and essential workers shined a much-needed spotlight on how our current economic system fails to adequately provide for working families. We were proud to be among one of the first contributors to the National Domestic Workers Alliance Coronavirus Cares Fund, which distributed $30 million in cash assistance to domestic workers in the US who have struggled to get by during the pandemic.</p><p>We also supported the work of Molly Kinder, a fellow at the Brookings Institute, who produced a series of reports that highlighted the stories of working people on the frontlines and the need for “hero pay.” Her research and reporting led to policy changes in several cities to support these working&nbsp;people.</p><p>But even as the cracks in our current economic system’s foundation became glaringly obvious during the pandemic, the residual power structures have remained in place, and overall inequality only&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/pandemic-widens-the-gap-between-the-haves-and-have-nots-report-finds.html">widened</a>.</p><p>Meaningful, structural economic reforms will likely continue to be difficult given political incentives that fuel gridlock and polarization, but we remain optimistic. We launched our <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">POV</a> this year to articulate our vision to Reimagine Capitalism, and we are thrilled to have so many like-minded allies in some states as well as the federal government (so far, more than a dozen of our grantees and close partners have taken positions in the Biden Administration!). We see the possibility of real change on the horizon supported by some members of the business community, and at the local and state levels (like the organizations supported by the <a href="https://carryonthefightfund.org/">Carry on the Fight&nbsp;Fund</a>).</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/responsible-technology-2/">Responsible Technology</a> <p>As many workers left office buildings and students left schools following stay-at-home orders, our deep dependency on technology only increased. As a result, the power of those technology companies grew even more, and became clear and concerning to both the public (<a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/the-film/">The Social Dilemma</a> was a global smash hit and featured several of our grantees) and policymakers.</p><p>Building on our work outlining Big Tech’s <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Omidyar-Network-POV_Platforms-and-Power_2.7.2020.pdf">Unchecked Power</a> earlier in the year, the team released legal roadmaps for antitrust cases against <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Roadmap-for-an-Antitrust-Case-Against-Facebook.pdf">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Roadmap-for-a-Case-Against-Google.pdf">Google</a>. The recent lawsuits by the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and dozens of state attorneys general — along with upcoming legislative hearings — against these dominant tech platforms are critical steps to hold their outsized power to&nbsp;account.</p><p>We’re also seeing success with the Digital Services &amp; Markets Acts in the EU that ensures platforms behave in a more fair and competitive way, as well as the increase in uptake for <a href="https://www.mosip.io/about.php">MOSIP</a> (an open source, multipurpose foundation ID system) in Africa and across the Global&nbsp;South.</p><p>In a sense, the “techlash” came of age at the same time people embraced more tech. As a result, we continue to support developing and strengthening the field of responsible technologists, new constructs for data, and how technology and policy safeguards can strengthen innovation across the&nbsp;world.</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/pluralism/">Pluralism</a> <p>Last year, we committed $500,000 to Black-led organizations on the frontlines fighting for racial equity. Among many organizations doing incredible work, we invested in seven achieving impact in ways that align with our current strategic focus, including those whose work combines economic, civic, or criminal justice reform with narrative shift or movement building towards racial&nbsp;justice.</p><p>We are committed to building true partnerships with these organizations and amplifying their work to a broader audience of both practitioners and funders. As funders, we acknowledge our privilege and we know our investments are only the first step towards our commitment to dismantling white supremacy.</p><p>Our work within pluralism continues to evolve as we refine our strategy and recognize that a global community that bridges divides is a prerequisite for meaningful social&nbsp;change.</p> Turning the&nbsp;Page <p>Many of us looked to 2021 as a light at the end of a dark tunnel. But, in reality, we are still facing many of the same challenges as 2020. We are entering another year of uncertainty, which will require deep care for our staff and our partners. We will be bold, get moving, and seize this transitional moment to put what we have learned into action. Managing this tension between hope and pragmatism will require important, but difficult tradeoffs. It is in this spirit that we set the following learning questions:</p><p>· What are we learning about what it takes to develop an internal programmatic structure that supports dynamic, complex, social change&nbsp;work?</p><p>· What roles and tools are serving us well in our efforts to influence social&nbsp;change?</p><p>· How can engaging and listening deeply to a diverse set of stakeholders lead us to be more effective in contributing to social change? What forms of engagement work more/less well?</p><p>From today’s perch, we believe these questions are critical for us to continue to learn and evolve as an organization in ways that help us contribute to meaningful social change. That said, we are prepared to adapt to whatever 2021 may throw our way, and our first priority will always be the well-being of our staff and partners.</p><blockquote>In 2021, we will continue to evolve as we use lessons from the past year to shape our portfolio. We will also be answering critical questions that will help us to further refine our role and boundaries (e.g., we define and advance <a href="https://omidyar.com/pluralism/">pluralism</a>). These insights will help ensure we invest in partners, systems, and processes that will not only increase our efficacy, but also foster a culture that reflects our values and enables staff to&nbsp;thrive.</blockquote><p>After a year of dramatic shifts and significant organizational transition, our staff is proud of the work we accomplished and grateful for each other, the firm, our board — and especially our partners. We expect challenges to surface, but we are energized by the opportunity to contribute towards long-term change on issues that&nbsp;matter.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/2021-a-new-year-of-hope-ce640aaa3a1c">2021: A New Year of Hope…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has approved <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> as the latest of Hyperledger’s projects to graduate from incubation to active status.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Aries provides reusable, interoperable tool kits designed for initiatives and solutions focused on creating, transmitting and storing verifiable digital credentials. The Aries project grew out of the need for protocols, open source tools and interoperability test suites that leverage networks enabling verifiable credentials, such as those supported by <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy.</a></p>



<p>This major milestone shows that Hyperledger’s technical leadership recognizes the maturity of the Aries community and project. The TSC applies rigorous standards to active projects including code quality, security best practices, open source governance, and a diverse pool of contributors. Becoming an active Hyperledger project is a sign that Aries has grown in both community and code and is a big step forward for the decentralized digital identity community.</p>



<p>“This approval is further evidence that Hyperledger Aries is a breakout success for the Hyperledger community,” said Brian Behlendorf, General Manager for Blockchain, Healthcare and Identity at the Linux Foundation. “Convergence on common libraries for the exchange of credentials will help speed the development of urgently-needed solutions and systems, ranging from education to finance to the fight against the pandemic. Aries is key to that convergence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The TSC’s endorsement of Hyperledger Aries as out of incubation and into active project status is particularly important as the world grapples with finding trusted ways for people to prove their COVID-19 vaccination or test results. Aries’ maturity and protocol-driven approach to issuing verifiable credentials and presenting verified proofs has meant that Aries is a part of every technical discussion in that domain, and a core component of many of the technical stacks being deployed.<br><br>Key components of an Aries solution are:</p>



  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md">Agent</a> Frameworks: In the digital world, humans, organizations and things need a way to store, manage and exchange verifiable data, including the crypto that decentralized identity demands. Agents do this work in a decentralized environment, and Aries Frameworks make it easy for anyone to build agents tied to specific business needs.  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0005-didcomm/README.md">DID communications</a> (DIDComm): Agent-like things have to interact with one another to get work done. How they talk in general is DIDComm. DIDComm was born in the Aries project, and work on the next version continues within a working group at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/README.md">Protocols</a>: The Aries protocols run on top of DIDComm and enable peer-to-peer application-level interactions among&nbsp;agents, and shows how they should be designed and documented. The Aries community has developed an approach called <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/305">Aries Interop Profiles</a> (AIP) that formalizes specific sets of protocols that any agent-maker must use to be interoperable across the community, and a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">test harness</a> that verifies interoperability across disparate implementations using the protocols that make up an AIP.  



<p>A Wallet is a common term for a mobile agent used by a person. Wallets are the important link that enables people to manage their connections, credentials, and other aspects of involvement in the decentralized identity ecosystem. This important area of work has just recently received another boost with the community organization of work around creating an open source mobile agent using the Aries Framework Javascript and React Native.</p>



<p>Aries also has close community ties with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust Over IP (ToIP)</a> project, which is also housed at the Linux Foundation. Both projects are working on the issuing, holding, and presenting of cryptographically-verifiable digital credentials without the necessity of intermediaries. While Aries is focused on the tools required for verifiable credential exchange, the Trust over IP Foundation is a project working to define a complete architecture, or stack, that combines both cryptographic trust and human trust relating to decentralized identity.</p>



<p>The TSC commended the Aries project during the meeting for the project’s highly diverse contributors. Achieving a high number of organizations contributing to a project at Hyperledger is often a challenge. Congratulations are due to those participating in and supporting the Aries Project.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>A headline theme of our <a href="http://digitalnation.scot">Digital Nation webinar series</a> is the inspiring story of E-Estonia, and how Scotland may emulate their success. 
 Lesley Riddoch and filmmaker Charlie Stuart travelled to Estonia in late February 2020 to make a film about this story, about one of the most recent small north European states to become independent. 
<p>Tiny Estonia (pop similar to Wales) sees itself as a forgotten Nordic nation, sharing its language, forest and bog-covered topography and Baltic location with Finland.</p>
<p>And it’s widely regarded as Europe’s Digital Tiger economy, performing an incredible transformation from terrible poverty in the wake of reestablishing independence just 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, Estonia became the latest small European nation to declare independence. Faced with terrible winters, they struggled to even find petrol for ambulances and the supermarket shelves were empty. But today, Estonia is one of the most successful small countries in the EU. How did they do it?</p>
<p></p>
 Video Summary 
<p>The Estonian people were preparing themselves for independence all their lives, and they actually planned a lot of this transformation ahead since they had a firm belief that they would become independent.</p>
<p>A wave of young people took over dismantling everything. So they said those people who have been working for the Soviet Union and have been supporting this kind of things have to leave now. They need to clean the entire state.</p>
<p>And by cleaning the state, it means everything. The first years were tough for this new Baltic nation. They literally had nothing on the shelves of grocery stores in Tallinn or elsewhere in Estonia. They were in a very difficult situation. But Estonia embraced the new digital world, and in just 20 years, its GDP has increased fivefold. It’s nothing short of extraordinary. This transition happened within a generation. The Estonians have adopted their independence day as the 24th of February. It’s a holiday, everyone gathers together on this day.</p>
<p>Estonia first proclaimed independence in 1918 after two centuries of Russian rule, but soon the country was occupied, first by the Soviets, then the Nazis, then the Soviets again, who ruled for almost 50 years. In March 1949, 20000 people were deported, most to Siberia by the KGB. Two thirds were women and children under the age of 16.</p>
<p>In 1986, there was a seismic shift at the Kremlin. President Gorbachev introduced Glasnost to modernize and refresh the communist bloc. But in the Baltic states, the newfound political freedom gave the chance for dreams of nationhood to be rekindled. The Estonian people were preparing themselves for independence, all their lives through whole time in Soviet Union and then especially, intensely, during those three years they had the singing revolution, they were prepared.</p>
<p>Throughout the years of repression, huge singing events continued, the choirs were a symbol of Estonia’s unique culture. As freedom can’t be achieved by only movements, they not only were singing and shouting and streets, but they were undertaking hard legislative work too. In August 1989, the movements of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania combined to form a 400 mile chain of two million people demonstrating their unity for freedom. This was to catch media’s attention to pressurize Gorbachev. After all this, Estonia got its independence.</p>
<p>Estonia set up its own currency pegged to the Deutschmark, but the country had traded almost exclusively with Russia and so the economy collapsed. It was a government in crisis from the start. In 1993, in the midst of a Baltic winter with daytime temperatures below minus 10, the state coffers are empty, businesses face bankruptcy, pensions might not be paid.</p>
<p>There was a struggle to find petrol for ambulances and the shops were empty. Mart Laar became the first formally elected prime minister at the age of just 32. The unemployment rate was 40-50%. No countries were buying anything from Estonia as their production was really bad. The changes were really very, very harsh because they didn’t have money. People were patient, expecting that the country will grow up, will improve. And after this harsh time, there will be better times. The Estonians people had hope that Estonia will again flourish someday.</p>
<p>Very soon help and investment came from Nordic neighbors. There was were even food and clothing parcels from abroad. Very quickly, Estonia began to grow as Europe’s newest democracy. It was a society shaped by a new generation without baggage from the communist era, with new ideas and a blank canvas.</p>
 E-Estonia 
<p>Estonia’s main claim to fame today is the Digital Economy. Estonian education has fueled 20 years of digital innovation, 90 percent of schools deliver subjects using digital technology by choice, not compulsion, and 70 percent of kindergartens have access to robotics. Scottish education was once the envy of the world. Now a different small country is turning educational heads.</p>
<p>The education system has spawned a nation of digital entrepreneurs and innovators. Three Estonian engineers have built Skype with almost 700 million worldwide users.</p>
<p>In Estonia, everyone must have a digital ID. This is a compulsary document for absolutely every person who lives in Estonia. The citizens of Estonia use this smart electronical id card as their driving license also. They also get discounts from various shops by using this id card. This card is also essential for medical care because they need this card at hospitals and health care centre for their medical prescriptions.</p>
<p>This card is also used by the citizens for tax payment system. With the aid of this card it takes only one minute in order to declare citizens’ taxes. The citizens of Estonia have a great faith on their state law authority as they provide their all information of themselves to one institution. Only one percent of entire state budget is used in order to keep up the system. The citizens’ get back two percent of their GDP by using this one single solution.</p>
<p>It took three years after independence for the last Russian military to leave. Now, Estonia has an army of its own and an international peacekeeping role. It has 3000 full time soldiers with 20000 in reserve and the support of its Nato Family since it joined in 2004. Joining the NATO has cultural, economic, social and mostly political consequences on Estonia.</p>
<p>In Estonia 2/3 of the population live in the traditional country. They tried to keep alive their cultural heritage even when they were part of the Soviet Union. The country celebrates its traditions and identity big time.</p>
<p>The country has been criticized for a flat tax regime that leaves the well off paying the same as the lowest earners, just 20 percent. And corporations can skip tax altogether if they reinvest. One man well-placed to make international comparisons is the Estonian TV journalist Johannes Tralla, he is a former EU correspondent.</p>
<p>According to him oligarchy does not exist in the Estonia every taxi driver here is an entrepreneur and the low tax system is really beneficial for the citizens. In Estonia there is no dramatic class gap in society. The taxation framework in Estonia is really appreciable in the whole Europe.</p>
<p>This is the inspiring story of how within a short period of time Estonia grew from the post Independence early challenges to become the world’s leading digital nation.</p>

<p>New Zealand Women in Identity members Tamara Al’ Salim and Andrew Weaver were featured on a panel discussing Contact Tracing and Data Ownership. They spoke to the members of the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS), a nonprofit based in Washington, DC, whose members are vital records professionals across the U.S. as well as other countries. Tamara and Andrew discussed their view of New Zealand’s response to the pandemic and the impact it had on the community’s behavior when it came to contact tracing.</p>
<p>Andrew described how New Zealand took a pragmatic and expert led approach to the pandemic, driven by medical recommendations and based on statistics and scientific data modeling, wrapped up with the message of kindness. With the continuing change in the pandemic’s landscape, and quoting Maya Angelou, New Zealand took the approach of “Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tamara walked the audience through graphs that told a story about the New Zealand COVID-19 Tracer App including how its early inception didn’t have much uptake as New Zealand left lockdown with no community cases. The perception was , no community cases meant no need to keep track of our movements. As travel increased into the country, cases at the border increased as well, still yet, people didn’t feel the pressure to keep track of their movements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara went on to describe how the trend shifted dramatically when a community case linked to a ship at the ports got into the community, with a household of four people testing positive, the whole country had restriction levels changes, and the city the cases were in went into even high restrictions. This saw a significant uptake and a consistent trend of use of the app since then. New Zealand continues to report daily to its community on the number of border and community cases with none in the community since November 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara observed that complacency is natural and will continue to happen as people feel safe and not have the need to keep track of their movements. If there is any trend that is guaranteed, it would be the one when cases are discovered in the community people become more vigilant and keep track of their movements. That is possible the new normal in New Zealand. In the meantime, the message, is that is a collective responsibility, we all want to safe and be able to celebrate holidays safely, act like you have the virus, wear your mask on public transport and stay home if you are unwell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara is one of the Ambassadors for New Zealand and Andrew as an active member and supporter of Women in Identity encouraged the NAPHSIS members and especially many of the men to join the organization and support our work.</p>
<p>In addition, Kay Chopard spoke in the closing plenary about the Women in Identity organization and encouraged the NAPHSIS membership to become part of the organization and the mission. The conference took place virtually on November 30 to December 2, 2020.</p>

 Coming soon: quality-of-service guarantees for decentralized technologies  Why escrow-based service-level agreements (SLAs) are the secret to enterprise adoption of blockchain <p>During my entire career I have been responsible for delivering, operating, and improving enterprise-grade services — telecommunications, IT, banking — to global customers. I have learned two important lessons when operating the services in more than 65 countries around the&nbsp;world:</p>  Although the consistent delivery of platform service levels globally is key, the service experience is always local to the country. What matters is the service experience that happens in the real world, not the virtual one that exists on paper in contracts. The real world is where people live their (working) lives and services are consumed.  Transparency in service reporting, the ability to learn and improve from under / over performance, and a fair penalty / reward system are all essential to a sustainable and successful long-term partnership in the enterprise environment.  <p>For decades, service-level agreements (SLAs) have been central to enterprise outsourcing to IT and network providers, including software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. Managed services in particular come in many shapes and forms: from managing the multi-vendor environment to providing service guarantees on a specific technology stack. Managed services governed by one or more SLAs can be unbundled and agnostic to any underlying tech or they can be bundled with a certain tech platform (in part of boost enterprise confidence and reduce risk in adopting that platform). Both of these approaches matter for blockchain.</p><p>SLAs are understandably popular, because they provide enterprise customers with guaranteed availability and performance at agreed cost levels, and vendors with a stable revenue stream. This is critical when it comes to widespread adoption of new technologies. Being a good vendor is one thing; being a good customer is just as essential. Both are investing and committing to a longer-term relationship, so it has to be fair and balanced.</p><p>Yet the conventional SLA-based procurement model is not without its drawbacks. Contracting cycles often range from months to years, requiring major upfront investment on the part of both customers and vendors into requests for proposals (RFPs), solution engineering, legal, and implementation. Once a contract is in place and services are up and running, customers and vendors frequently face change management processes due to the nature of ever-evolving technologies and business requirements. In the event of contractual disputes, compliance and enforcement also take up significant resources. The biggest challenge I have seen in my career is that often these longer-term contracts can become a burden to staying agile and innovative. With the rapid pace of innovation, it is just not possible to predict how the market will look years from now. At the same time, a provider of the services needs to make a fair return on investment (ROI) too and requires a multi-year lock&nbsp;in.</p><p>Fast forward to 2021. More and more enterprises are exploring blockchain and other decentralized digital technologies and their governance mechanisms. Many are willing to actively experiment with open, public networks for pilots and proof-of-concept applications. But when it comes to deploying business-critical systems in production, they tend to default to existing operational practices and&nbsp;habits.</p><p>I see many companies turn to the larger consultancies and service providers to step in and provide advice and potentially managed services around the technology of choice. It can be a good way to manage risk — career risk mainly, as the operational risks have not gone away. This is of course also true in the energy sector, where reliability is paramount and system failures can impact millions of customers and result in billions of dollars of damages. So availability and quality of service are essential. How to deliver on these requirements with an open-source decentralized platform is the next big challenge that needs to be&nbsp;solved.</p><p>The answer is not to put a third party in between an enterprise customer and the decentralized technology solution to monitor performance and guarantee uptime. Of course this may provide some benefits, but it is an odd way to approach fundamentally new technologies. Indeed, one of many appeals of open-source tech and open architectures is that it reduces or even obviates the need for third-party intermediaries that add cost, process complexity, and opacity to&nbsp;markets.</p><p>In this new dawning era of enterprise blockchain, two big questions are emerging that matter for the sector’s&nbsp;future:</p>  Can decentralized solutions actually deliver enterprise-grade services with high availability and guaranteed levels of&nbsp;service?  Could SLAs that don’t rely on single vendors or require bilateral contracts be the secret to bridging from limited pilots and proofs of concept to full-blown commercial deployments?  <p>At Energy Web we believe the answer is yes, to both questions, but we need to stretch our thinking into a new space though where we enter into decentralized service operations.</p><p>The rise of the escrow-backed decentralized SLA</p><p>Conventional SLAs work well because there is a single counterparty to a given contract. That counterparty is known and contracted (and therefore ‘trusted’) to deliver the services. By contrast, public networks <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/">like EW-DOS</a> run on a distributed network of nodes, operated by multiple organizations, that collectively run services and maintain data integrity via a common protocol. There is no single vendor with which an enterprise user can enter into an SLA contract, but rather a network of vendors that collectively provide services. So how should we rethink the idea of the traditional SLA? How can we make chief information officers (CIOs) of enterprises, including energy companies, as comfortable relying directly on decentralized technologies as they are with existing IT and network&nbsp;vendors?</p><p>The answer lies in a decentralized SLA. And the basis of this new type of SLA — for enterprises and vendors alike — is distributed, multilateral trust that the services will be delivered according to the agreed&nbsp;SLA.</p><p>We expect that engendering that trust in a decentralized environment should involve posting collateral (often called staking in blockchain circles). This idea isn’t new; anyone who has ever rented an apartment has likely experienced the concept in the form of a security deposit. In the context of public blockchains, staking keeps actors honest and provides strong assurances that the blockchain holds a shared truth, not a compromised version of the truth (since staked companies are incentivized to follow the rules to maximize their rewards and simultaneously disincentivized from bad behavior, for fear of losing their staked collateral in&nbsp;escrow).</p><p>When it comes to the idea of a decentralized SLA, a key mechanism is the staking of crypto tokens into a kind of escrow account. Particularly when native tokens are used (such as EWT), this can be easily done via blockchain-based smart contracts. Staking mechanisms are already being used to guarantee trust at the blockchain level. Why not use the same mechanism to define and enforce the terms that are typically found in SLAs at the services layer? While this is an arguably groundbreaking idea for enterprise IT procurement, it’s already becoming a standard practice for blockchain operational and governance mechanisms.</p><p>By extending the concept of token staking beyond the trust layer of blockchains (i.e., the maintenance of the distributed ledger database itself) into the services and application layers of the technology stack, it is possible to provide guaranteed uptime, latency, throughput, and other performance measures that are customarily defined in service levels. This approach has the potential to unlock the full potential of decentralized technologies for enterprise customers and service providers alike.</p><p>For enterprise customers: A decentralized SLA allows you to easily procure IT and network services by opting into a pool of services provided by multiple vendors at once, and automatically enforce contractual terms in a trusted way. Not only would this approach reduce procurement costs, but it can also improve overall performance and reliability relative to the status quo thanks to the inherent resilience of a decentralized network. Just as it’s generally better to invest in an index fund instead of picking individual stocks, why bet on specific companies (with vendor lock-in) when you can hedge your bet across the entire&nbsp;market?</p><p>For vendors: While in some respects an open-source protocol may commoditize certain IT infrastructure services, it also lowers the barrier for customer acquisition and simplifies service delivery. It’s hard to make a profit on managed services today due to the aforementioned upfront contract costs, fierce competition, and commoditization of IT infrastructure. In a decentralized SLA approach, vendors have much wider reach and fewer liabilities (e.g., you can stop any given service and focus on others, while the overall network keeps&nbsp;going).</p><p>Service providers would operate nodes that provision various services to enterprise users. They will get paid for the delivery of the services by the enterprise customers. In return these decentralized service providers would stake tokens against performance guarantees (e.g., uptime, latency) to the enterprises using their services. In the event of performance failures, network and service users impacted by degraded performance or outages would be paid out of the staked tokens through slashing part of the staked&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Bringing the decentralized SLA to the Energy Web tech stack and ecosystem</p><p>Our goal is to put this theory into practice with EW-DOS, starting with the Utility Layer services. This approach will deliver all the benefits of conventional SLAs (i.e., pre-defined performance requirements and penalties), while remaining vendor- and technology-neutral, highly flexible, more resilient, and lower cost (e.g., by reducing complexity and point-to-point integrations, automating compliance and enforcement) than conventional bilateral arrangements. The payment by the enterprise customer and the staking of the services providers will be done with native token EWT, which is seamlessly integrated into the open-source technology stack.</p><p>For example, consider a grid operator who builds an application that enables distributed energy resources (DERs) to participate in an energy market. The application leverages the power of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to not only streamline the enrollment of customers and assets, but also manage permissions and coordinate data exchange among market participants. Depending on the size of the market, there might be dozens to hundreds of asset types, and thousands to millions of customers and assets. In this scenario, the application might require multiple Utility Layer services like the Key Manager (for distributed key generation and recovery) and Identity and Access Management Cache Server (for high-performance data structuring and availability for DID verifiable credentials).</p><p>Instead of locking themselves into a single vendor or product up front (when there is perhaps uncertainty about uptake), the Utility Layer offers a pay-as-you-go solution that allows the grid operator to procure identical services (in terms of cost, performance, etc.) from multiple vendors at once without having to manage separate bilateral contracts — akin to universal roaming for mobile phones, but for enterprise applications.</p><p>A natural skeptic might ask: How is this possible? How do you provide multilateral, guaranteed service levels (in terms of both quantity and quality) without direct engagement and contracts between&nbsp;parties?</p><p>I think it is possible, and when it works it will address the two main challenges I referenced at the start of this article. This new type of architecture will enable very transparent reporting on actual service quality and be delivered extremely close to the customer who consumes the service in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Also remember the famous point that was raised in 1880 by Henry Morton, president of the Steven’s Institute of Technology on the Edison light bulb: “Surely, everyone that is acquainted with the subject will recognize it as a conspicuous failure?”</p><p>And so to those who stay skeptical I would say, join the trials and experience it yourself. Expect to hear more from Energy Web on this&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Walter Kok is the CEO of Energy&nbsp;Web.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/its-coming-quality-of-service-guarantees-for-decentralized-technologies-c0e133ebe644">It’s coming: quality-of-service guarantees for decentralized technologies</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Two AMQP specifications now ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that AMQP Request-Response Messaging with Link Pairing Version 1.0 and Message Annotations for Response Routing Version 1.0 from the OASIS Advanced Message Queuing Protocol AMQP TC [1] have been approved as OASIS Committee Specifications.</p>



<p>AMQP is a vendor-neutral, platform-agnostic protocol for passing real-time data streams and business transactions. The goal of AMQP is to ensure information is safely and efficiently transported between applications, among organizations, across distributed cloud computing environments, and within mobile infrastructures by enabling a commoditized, multi-vendor ecosystem.</p>



<p>About AMQP Request-Response Messaging with Link Pairing:<br></p>



<p>AMQP defines links as unidirectional transport for messages between a source and a target. A common messaging pattern is that of “request-response”, that is, two parties partaking in a bidirectional conversation using messages. This document defines a common pattern for pairing two unidirectional links to create a bidirectional message transport between two endpoints.</p>



<p>About Message Annotations for Response Routing:<br></p>



<p>Large scale messaging networks may consist of multiple distinct sub-networks where addresses visible at one point in the network are not visible at other points. Where messages are transferred across network boundaries, addresses contained within the message (such as those in the reply-to field) may no longer be valid. This document defines mechanisms to allow messages which transit such boundaries to be annotated with sufficient information to allow responses to be directed back to the intended recipient.</p>



<p>These Committee Specifications are OASIS deliverables, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The specifications and related files are available here:</p>

 Revised Charter 



 Section 1: TC Charter 



<p>(1)(a) TC Name<br>Code List Representation (codelist)</p>



<p>(1)(b) Statement of Purpose</p>



<p>Many communities (for example business sectors and public authorities) exchange and process information in which commonly accepted semantic concepts can be expressed using concise mnemonics or abbreviations called “codes”. Choosing a collection of these codes can constrain the expression of information to an agreed-upon set, requiring the exchange to reference one or more members from only a limited list of such codes, variously called “code lists”, “enumerations”, or “controlled vocabularies”.</p>



<p>Code lists then can be defined as controlled vocabularies or coded value enumerations.</p>



<p>Examples of standardized code lists include country abbreviations, currency abbreviations, shipping container descriptors, and airport codes. Examples of nonstandardized code lists used between trading partners include financial account types, workflow status indicators, and any set of values representing the semantics of related concepts known between the parties involved in information interchange. An advantage of using a controlled set of semantic concepts is in localization where the associated documentation for the coded values can include descriptions in different languages, thus not requiring the coded values themselves to be translated, or where translation is desired, the semantic equivalence of values can be described.</p>



<p>Code lists have been used for many years, and they have been published and disseminated in manners that have not been IT-enabled for ease of computer processing. To date no standardized IT-enabled representation exists.</p>



<p>The Code List Representation TC purpose is to develop IT-enabling standards that support the machine expression, interchange, documentation, management, processing, and validation of code lists for use in any information technology context.</p>



<p>Business Benefits</p>



<p>The standards developed by the Code List Representation TC aim to be beneficial for any community that needs to disseminate IT-enabled expressions of code lists for the exchange and processing of enumerated values.</p>



<p>Key stakeholders are standardization bodies that need to specify code lists and their representation for exchange and automatic process, registration and source authorities that publish code lists, business sectors and public authorities that use code lists in their business exchanges, and implementors of software and services that process code lists.</p>



<p>(1)(c) Scope</p>



<p>Define, develop and maintain a semantic library for code lists (genericode) and related syntax bindings to represent code lists in XML and other machine processable formats for their interchange, documentation and management in any machine-processing context.</p>



<p>Develop any related technical specifications to support the use of code lists.</p>



<p>Promote genericode as the international standard for the IT-enabled representation of code lists.</p>



<p>Should the TC decide so, submit genericode and any other standard developed by the TC as publicly available specification to external standard development organizations (SDOs) and, where possible, fulfill their associated responsibilities of being their designated maintenance authority.</p>



<p>The publication of code lists is out of scope of this TC.</p>



<p>(1)(d) Deliverables</p>



<p>The Code List Representation TC maintains the existing genericode Committee Specification and oversees its evolution to the following set of deliverables:</p>



  a semantic model / meta-model of genericode  an XML serialization of the genericode semantic model, with the intent of backward compatibility (or even no changes) to the existing genericode  prepare examples of the use of and the reference to genericode resources  possibly develop new specifications such as operations on a code list e.g. create, add, delete, update  possibly develop new syntax serializations and schemas, such as JSON  possibly include sample non-normative software for transliteration between syntaxes  possibly develop a Schematron value validation script  possibly document the use of genericode as a sparse-table serialization, including concepts such as joining tables and foreign keys  



<p>(1)(e) IPR Mode</p>



<p>RF on limited terms </p>



<p>(1)(f) Audience</p>



<p>Anyone who works with code lists and has a requirement to transmit and process an IT-enabled expression of the code list values and/or their metadata between systems.</p>



<p>Also source authorities and publishing authorities who create, publish, and disseminate code lists, based on specific business sector or public authority requirements, including those with pre-existing or 3rd party code lists.</p>



<p>Users and consumers of code lists, who may also find a standardized IT-enabled deployment format for such lists easier to employ.</p>



<p>Those who are responsible for defining XML vocabulariesvmay be interested in describing a constrained set of values to represent agreed-upon semantic concepts in order to control information items.</p>



<p>(1)(g) Language</p>



<p>English</p>



 Section 2: Additional Information 



<p>(2)(a) Identification of Similar Work</p>



<p>ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32 has developed ISO/IEC 15944-10 that defines the business operational view of and the need for code lists, without the functional services view of syntax serializations that are in scope of this TC.</p>



<p>(2)(b) First TC Meeting</p>



<p>The first meeting under the revised charter will be held Friday, 05 March 2021 at 15:00 UTC/10:00 EST/16:00 CET/02:00 AEDT via Zoom. The meeting will be sponsored by Crane Softwrights Ltd.</p>



<p>(2)(c) Ongoing Meeting Schedule</p>



<p>It is expected a weekly or bi-weekly meeting online and occasionally face-to-face meetings when needed and where a TC member can assume the responsibility for hosting the meeting.</p>



<p>(2)(d) TC Proposers</p>



<p>N/A</p>



<p>(2)(e) Primary Representatives’ Support</p>



<p>N/A</p>



<p>(2)(f) TC Convener</p>



<p>Andrea Caccia, andrea.caccia@studiocaccia.com, Individual member</p>



<p>(2)(g) OASIS Member Section</p>

<p>By Jozette Allah-Mensah and Nicole Allred, Strategic Communications, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Illustration by Superside.<p>“When day comes, we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow we do&nbsp;it.”</p><p>These are the words of 22-year-old Amanda Gorman — the first National Youth Poet Laureate in American history. The opening lines from her poem, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/20/politics/amanda-gorman-inaugural-poem-transcript/index.html">“The Hill We Climb,”</a> were first heard at President Biden’s inauguration and inspired millions around the world. Amanda Gorman was one of several youth who participated in inaugural events that day. They represent the next generation of activists meeting today’s challenges head&nbsp;on.</p><p>This group has experienced and persevered through cataclysmic terrorist attacks, economic disruption, the ever-present threat of police violence against Black and brown bodies, and politics that further divides us with every news cycle. Add to all of this the accelerants of the internet and social&nbsp;media.</p><blockquote>However, young people leading the way is not a new phenomenon.</blockquote><p>In the latter half of the 20th century and the first two decades of the 21st, youth have been conscientious revolutionaries working to ensure the words of our nation’s Constitution apply to all within our borders. Indeed, Martin Luther King, Jr., a 25-year-old Baptist preacher at the time he led the bus boycott in Montgomery, would be considered a member of Generation Z today. King and his generation of civil rights leaders, the people whose names we hear most often during Black History Month, serve as an <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/children-who-marched-for-equal-rights-inspire-a-new-generation">inspiration to the current class of emboldened youth activists.</a></p><p>Viewed from this perspective, the voices of young people must be recognized and actively engaged in our fight for social justice in America and throughout the world. Those voices include the likes of <a href="https://time.com/longform/never-again-movement/">anti-gun activists</a> and Parkland school shooting survivors David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez, global environmental activists <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit">Greta Thunberg</a> and Flint, Michigan native Mari Copeny, known as <a href="http://Little%20Miss%20Flint">“Little Miss Flint,”</a> and now Gorman. It’s not only important to recognize their activism but to appreciate that without it, we will fail to reach the next rung on the ladder of equity, opportunity, and justice in&nbsp;America.</p><blockquote>Without the activism of Gen-Z, we fail to reach the next rung on the ladder of equity, opportunity, and justice in&nbsp;America.</blockquote> Generation Z: The Leaders We&nbsp;Need <p>Against the backdrop of the pandemic and economic devastation, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2020-12-07/us-saw-summer-of-black-lives-matter-protests-demanding-change">the summer of 2020</a> forced us to reckon with the horrific murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, George Floyd, and so many others at the hands of police. We marched, protested for change, and the surge of the Black Lives Matter movement spanned oceans. We called for legislative action to strike down the pillars of white supremacy undergirding the foundation of the United States. We forced the start of difficult conversations. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/06/08/the-nations-racial-justice-protests-are-a-pivotal-moment-for-millennials-and-gen-z/">And at the forefront of this cultural shift was Gen Z. </a><br> <br>This generation has called for expediency in eradicating inequities across the map. They have refused to accept silence from brands that have the platforms to speak up and make a difference, and pushed back against those whose words are solely performative. For Gen Z, a crucial requisite for justice is intention and purposeful action.</p><blockquote>As younger people continue to step up and speak out, we must ask ourselves: How can we learn and leverage their activism to effect change more broadly? What does letting Gen Z lead really look&nbsp;like?</blockquote><p>When we think of <a href="https://omidyarnetwork.medium.com/listening-to-the-future-5d709ea30d7d">dynamic futurism</a> and the forward-thinking solutions to the ever-growing problems plaguing our world, Gen Z voices can be the most powerful ones at the&nbsp;podium.</p><p>And when Amanda Gorman spoke on inauguration day, her words acknowledged the past and inspired future possibilities. In referencing the “shadows” rather than the darkness, she may have been referencing the work of those freedom fighters for justice from generations ago. It’s not completely dark, but there still remains important work to be done. Her final refrain tells us inherently what Generation Z is already doing, and how we can emulate their example to bring about positive&nbsp;change.</p><blockquote>“For there is always light, if only we’re brave enough to see it. If only we’re brave enough to be&nbsp;it.”</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/the-dawn-is-ours-gen-z-the-fight-for-social-justice-9da40f48b54c">The Dawn is Ours: Gen-Z &amp; the Fight for Social Justice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the approval and publication of a new Committee Specification by the members of the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) TC [1]:</p>



<p>XACML v3.0 Related and Nested Entities Profile Version 1.0<br>Committee Specification 02<br>16 February 2021</p>



<p>Overview:</p>



<p>It is not unusual for access control policy to be dependent on attributes that are not naturally properties of the access subject or resource, but rather are properties of entities that are related to the access subject or resource. This profile defines the means to reference such attributes from within XACML policies for processing by a policy decision point.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>There’s a renewed interest in a more contextual, associative, networked future for the internet. One that breaks us from restrictive digital gardens. One that’s healthier, freer and safer. This piece includes a curated set of provocations based on community discussions in a limited working group focused on why the internet is broken and what needs to&nbsp;change.</p><a href="https://www.newrafael.com/weavings/">Weavings</a> by <a href="https://www.newrafael.com/">Rafaël Rozendaal</a><blockquote>Today’s digital public spaces amplify the inequities of physical public space. It’s a game of the top 1% driven by who can generate the most “viral” content. Systems that rely on the virality of user-generated content fundamentally lead to an even more skewed and inequitable future.</blockquote><p>-Jad Esber</p><blockquote>Today’s content platforms have a back-catalog problem. The content is delivered in ephemeral formats and creators lose out on opportunities to monetize their back catalogs. Incentivizing more discoverability and search within the archives will lead to more evergreen content and less content designed for virality or disposability.</blockquote><p>-Sari Azout</p><blockquote>The web is not finished. We have forgotten that the web was built only yesterday by a small, bold group of privileged men. They are not magical men. They are not distinctly different to anyone reading this, despite the grand technological-saviour narratives we spin about them. They had access to the right information and resources at the right time. They were told they had the right to build whatever they&nbsp;wanted.</blockquote><blockquote>If you don’t look, sound, and act like them, it’s likely no one is going to tell you that you also have the right to build whatever you want. You don’t fit into our current cultural narratives. Until we start telling different stories about who gets to edit, revise, and expand the web, the right people won’t show up to do&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>-Maggie Appleton</p><blockquote>Metaphors have a deep impact on the interaction constraints between us and the technology we use. To evolve to more meaningful and equitable digital interactions, we must be cautious in choosing better ones, as a collective.</blockquote><p>-Prakhar Shivam</p><blockquote>Building a better relationship between the internet, computing and people presupposes an inner revolution. As in M. C. Escher’s “Drawing Hands,” the riddle guarding the threshold is: where is the creative agency? The internet is a tool that reflects us, its creators. It is a tool that reflects the current state of our (consensus) knowledge — of, for instance, the nature of the human being, the value and meaning of human existence, the role of institutions vis a vis the individual. Our creations reflect and reinforce a worldview in which the creative faculties of the human being are placed in service of the accumulation of power. Imagine a socio-economic architecture in which the potential of the human being is consecrated as the greatest asset! Our conception of the human being would need to be other than what it is. The creative agency must first be seen, and seen clearly. (“By whom?” asks Escher.) Otherwise, its creations will take on the status of&nbsp;idols.</blockquote><p>-Caroline Nguyen</p><blockquote>Today’s platforms practice UCD (User-Centered Design) — where the user is a consumer, not a creator. Platforms over-optimize around the consumer experience and force creators to adapt their work to cater to the platform. It should be the opposite. Creators often struggle with the extra work on top of their practice: visual artists should not have the burden to adapt their work to perform well on Instagram. We must shift from User-centered Design to Creator-First Design.</blockquote><p>-Kirill Noskov</p><blockquote>The future of the internet has the potential to determine the future of humanity. Our lives are increasingly shifting to digital realms and spaces. VR and AR are set to become mainstream in the coming decade. And so will the metaverse.</blockquote><blockquote>Like their physical counterparts, these virtual landscapes stand to influence and mold all of us. This is a big opportunity in many ways, but it is also a danger. Will the metaverse also be built to exploit our insecurities and promote divisiveness for financial and power gains? What is going to be our guiding principle?</blockquote><p>-Sai Arunachalam</p><blockquote>When Alice ventured into Wonderland, she was asked by a haughty Caterpillar, “Who are you?”. Hesitant in her reply, Alice struggled to explain herself. After consuming several reality-altering potions, she no longer was sure if she was her ‘true’&nbsp;self.</blockquote><blockquote>As venturers of the Internet, we similarly teeter along a shifting sense of our own identity. Our Internet-selves exist within various narrative threads from fake authenticity, herd logic to genuine connections. We oscillate along a precipitous path between being data-driven in the knowledge we find to a form of informational madness. Each byte of information we take in alters our thinking. We should be more careful about what we consume. We must find the equilibrium between chaos and rigidity, lest we find ourselves becoming the Red Queen we didn’t want to&nbsp;be.</blockquote><p>-Daniel Jiang</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/provocations-for-a-better-internet-b5ba53585717">Provocations for a better internet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The increasing importance of certification to global adoption is being shown by the participation of government and regulator representatives in OpenID Foundation working groups and in our membership. It is also quantified in the uptick in certification services. The <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Certification Program</a> continues its success in 2021 with over 500 certifications of almost 200 implementations and counting.</p>
<p>The program’s increase in <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">Financial-grade API (FAPI)</a> certifications in 2020 with banks and fintechs in the UK, Australia and other jurisdictions increasing involvement in how conformance to the FAPI specification is displayed in the Foundation’s listing of certifications. The Foundation anticipates a continued increase of certifications in 2021 with jurisdictions including the US, Canada, Bahrain and Brazil adopting the FAPI standard and leveraging FAPI conformance and certification.</p>
<p>The certification program will continue to expand with the implementation of <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">eKYC &amp; IDA</a> conformance tests and certification in 2H 2021. The evolution is supported in part by <a href="https://openid.net/oidf-directed-funding-faq/">directed funding</a> led by Foundation member, yes.com. The Foundation anticipates other members following yes’ lead to support program extensions and encourages other members to join support for international expansion.</p>
<p>The fifth year of the certification program has seen a significant need for the in depth technical knowledge and experience that is required to process certification requests. The process often includes team members helping many through the conformance testing and the certification process. As FAPI certifications have increased, these requests require additional time as an increasing international set of testers are new to self-certification.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation continues to heavily subsidize the certification program exceeding 70% in 2020. The Foundation’s board of directors understand the strategic importance of the certification program in ensuring robust, conformant implementations. But they also have a duty to ensure the financial viability of the program and the Foundation.</p>
<p>At the OpenID Foundation’s annual board of directors meeting on Thursday, February 18, 2021, the directors reviewed and considered the current state of the program and unanimously approved increases to the certification fees. These increases will go into effect March 1, 2021 with the goal to drive towards a self-sustaining program in 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p>Certification fees will be as follows as of March 1, 2021:</p>
<p>Connect Certifications</p>
 
 Member $700 
 Non-member $3,500 
 
<p>Financial-grade API (FAPI) Certifications</p>
 
 Member $1,000 
 Non-member $5,000 
 
<p>The Foundation will continue to expand its outreach efforts in 2021 via practical technical workshops to provide education and guidance on FAPI conformance and certifications to best reach the community at large. The Foundation successfully hosted a series of these workshops in the UK with the Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE) in 2020. We’ll use these prior successes as templates in hosting workshops in new jurisdictions with partners and sponsors in 2021 with workshops soon to be announced and published on the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/calendar-of-events/">Foundation’s “events” page</a>.</p>
<p>Any questions or comments can be directed to <a href="mailto:director@openid.net">director@openid.net</a>. Thank you for your continued support of and contributions to the OpenID Foundation.</p>

<p>Standard describes the request/response exchanges between a Service Metadata Publisher and a client wishing to discover endpoint information in a 4-corner network</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of its newest OASIS Standard, approved by the members on 14 February 2021:</p>



<p>Service Metadata Publishing (SMP) Version 2.0<br>OASIS Standard<br>14 February 2021</p>



 Overview 



<p>SMP v2.0 describes a protocol for publishing service metadata within a 4-corner network.</p>



<p>In a 4-corner network, entities are exchanging business documents through intermediary gateway services (sometimes called Access Points). To successfully send a business document in a 4-corner network, an entity must be able to discover critical metadata about the recipient of the business document, such as types of documents the recipient is capable of receiving and methods of transport supported. The recipient makes this metadata available to other entities in the network through a Service Metadata Publisher service.</p>



<p>This specification describes the request/response exchanges between a Service Metadata Publisher and a client wishing to discover endpoint information. A client can either be an end-user business application or a gateway/access point in the 4-corner network. This specification also defines the request processing that must happen at the client.</p>



<p>The TC has received four Statements of Use from IBM, Philip Helger, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and Efact.</p>

<p>Technology has the potential to be a powerful and inclusive enabler, if we develop and deploy it with those principles in mind.&nbsp; In that vein our work for 2021 is well underway.&nbsp; We have two active initiatives underway, each supported by working groups of members.&nbsp; One group is tackling the challenge of educating the non-technologists among us about digital identity (work that came out of our annual Trust &amp; Identity research), while the other is looking at making the complex world of trust and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance less so!&nbsp; Each is meeting via Zoom on a fortnightly basis to connect on progress and priorities.&nbsp; You can register to participate here:<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/trust-and-identity-digital-identity-nz-2020-research-findings/2021-02-17/">Education (Trust and Identity Research findings)</a><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/online-dinz-reliance-initiative-2/2021-02-24/">AML Reliance</a>Also on a fortnightly basis we have our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/weekly-dinz-virtual-coffee/2021-02-23/">Coffee Chat&nbsp;</a>– an unstructured drop-in session where you can learn more about what’s happening in digital identity, and/or come with a particular problem or issue you would like to explore.</p>



<p>This month sees the recommencement of our monthly webinar series.&nbsp; Tomorrow we’re delighted to be joined by an expert panel who will share their thoughts on the challenges and opportunities ahead of us in 2021.&nbsp; You can register for the event&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/the-year-ahead-insights-on-the-future-of-digital-identity-in-aotearoa/">here</a>. &nbsp; Our March session will be the Summer edition of our quarterly Member Showcase.&nbsp; We have five slots available for members to share a case study or present a collaborative opportunity.&nbsp; Please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">contact us</a>&nbsp;if you have a story to tell and would like to be featured. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, if you haven’t already, I encourage you to read the update from our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2021/02/11/executive-council-update-and-seeking-a-new-executive-director/">Executive Council</a>.&nbsp; I will be moving on from my role with DINZ at the end of March.&nbsp; I’m excited by the greenfield opportunities ahead for myself, and also the prospect of handing over to the person who will lead the next phase of DINZ’s journey.&nbsp; Details of the role are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.seek.co.nz/job/51507981">here</a>, so please spread the word if it describes someone you know!</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> (GHPC) <a href="https://medium.com/id2020/good-health-pass-a-new-cross-sector-initiative-to-restore-global-travel-and-restart-the-global-8b59eb1050a0">launched</a>. This initiative is intended to define, in the context of test results and vaccination records for opening up borders for travel and commerce, a high bar for implementations of identity and credentialing systems to meet with regards to privacy, ethics and portability. They will also work with the implementers of such systems to converge towards common standards and governance.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>A set of Linux Foundation organizations – <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">TrustOverIP</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a>, <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a>, and its <a href="https://www.covidcreds.org/">Covid Credentials Initiative</a> – have engaged as supporting organizations and were part of the announcement. We did this based on very encouraging signs during formation discussions that GHPC would not only help bring many of the organizations emerging into the self-sovereign identity space into alignment on platforms and standards we have long championed, but would also give us an external reference point for our position on the importance of privacy in the design and implementation of such systems.</p>



<p>Hyperledger has been home to the pioneering digital identity ledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> and agent toolkit <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a>, which form the basis of so many <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/culedger-case-study">production</a> <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/kiva-case-study">privacy-preserving</a> digital identity systems and, now, are serving as the basis for many of these emerging <a href="https://www.evernym.com/travelpass/">health pass solutions</a>. The TrustOverIP Foundation led the formal recognition of the need and role for governance organizations in the digital identity landscape – showing how we can get both optionality and interoperability when we weave global identity and credentialing systems together in a decentralized way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Covid Credentials Initiative, starting way back in March 2020, recognized the potential for credentials of all sorts in the fight against this and future pandemics, and have pulled together an amazing community of technologists and entrepreneurs working together on this. Now, as part of Linux Foundation Public Health, we are working to bring together a set of software projects that can implement credential systems and help accelerate adoption of these globally, centered on the needs of public health authorities.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49XvVxLMTLw&amp;feature=emb_logo">Thursday’s GHPC webinar</a>, Charlie Walton from Mastercard said GHPC is “in the business of describing what good looks like.” We will be working with GHPC to bring our own communities’ views of not just what good looks like, but how we’re already working together to standardize and implement this work. Furthermore we’ll see if our processes can directly support GHPC’s efforts to harmonize this domain.</p>



<p>We recognize there are quite a few of these initiatives now, reflecting just how broadly this issue is felt across society. We can play – we must play – a key role in channeling all this market activity and good-faith sharing of expertise into applications directly in people’s hands, so we can get back to travel and re-opening workplaces and schools in a safe and equitable way. Our key levers to move the world are open source software and open public engagement, and we will double-down on those tools to have a unique and substantive impact.</p>



<p>Look for more on this soon within our communities. We’re incredibly excited to be a part of this global effort.</p>

<p>Papaki kau ana ngā tai o mihi ki a koutou katoa.</p>



<p>As the Kiwi summer rolls on it brings with it a sense of optimism for 2021 and reminds us how truly blessed we are to call Aotearoa New Zealand home.</p>



<p>The year ahead for our digital identity ecosystem and DINZ is one of optimism and progress&nbsp; too – with our focus squarely set on leading a united approach to digital identity for the benefit of all New Zealanders.&nbsp; 2021 will be a significant year of progress as the work to formalise the DIA’s proposed Trust Framework is gathers momentum.</p>



<p>In the spirit of optimism and progress, I would like to let you know that Andrew Weaver will be leaving DINZ as our Executive Director at the end of March.&nbsp; Andrew has been a true rangatira and kaitiaki of DINZ since its establishment.&nbsp; Working together with our members and Executive Council, Andrew has set our association on the path to growth and success and developed significant local and international profile and respect.&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew is leaving us to pursue other opportunities and we sincerely thank him for his contribution to DINZ and the ecosystem and wish him all the very best. Prior to the end of March we will take time to acknowledge his significant contribution to DINZ.</p>



<p>Our mission at DINZ is to create a digital identity ecosystem that enhances Kāwanatanga (honourable governance), Rangatiratanga (self-determination &amp; agency) and&nbsp;&nbsp; Ōritetanga (equity &amp; partnerships) for all people in New Zealand.&nbsp; We are on a journey to become more tiriti-honouring by enhancing our practice to embody Kāwanatanga, believe digital identity is a taonga and we collectively have a great responsibility as Kaitiaki to treat people’s identity with dignity, respect and care.&nbsp; We have started the process of looking for a new Executive Director who will drive this mission and kaupapa at DINZ.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.seek.co.nz/job/51507981">Learn more about the Executive Director role opportunity</a></p>



<p>I would also like to formally welcome our new <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council members</a> who joined in with our first meeting of the year on the 28th January.&nbsp; Welcome and we look forward to your wisdom and guidance on the Executive Council.</p>



  Sat Mandri, JNCTN  John Evans, TSB  Russell Craig, Microsoft NZ  Luke McIntyre, MATTR  



<p>In the Government seat on the Executive Council, the DIA will continue to represent the government and we are pleased to welcome Alan Bell replacing Tony Eyles as the government representative.<br><br>We look forward to engaging with you throughout 2021 as we shape a new future for digital identity in Aotearoa New Zealand.<br><br>He mihi mutunga kore</p>

<p>The US Federal Reserve is participating in a Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) Cross-border Payments Task Force to identify ways to promote cross-border payments that are faster, less expensive and more transparent and inclusive.</p>
<p>With the CPMI’s initiative to improve cross-border payments (and their upcoming conference&nbsp;<a href="https://lnkd.in/dBmT9q6">https://lnkd.in/dBmT9q6</a>), the Institute of International Finance (IIF) and the OpenID Foundation (OIDF) have submitted input on the important nexus of #identity and #payments. The submission details IIF’s collaboration in the Open Digital Trust Initiative, how this fits with the G20 Payments Roadmap, and some important considerations in #AML. The submission is available at <a href="https://lnkd.in/dyMM_Mv">https://lnkd.in/dyMM_Mv</a>, referencing draft Principles for Digital Trust Networks&nbsp;<a href="https://lnkd.in/de59CjU">https://lnkd.in/de59CjU</a>, which all sought feedback. We will further build on this in our upcoming Open Digital Trust Initiative interim report.</p>
<p>The joint Institute of International Finance – OpenID Foundation’s Open Digital Trust Initiative has published Draft Principles for Digital Trust Networks, identifying the high level ‘rules of the road’ that digital trust networks should adopt in order to incentivize a high level of digital trust, user centricity and low cost.</p>
<p>The International Institute of Finance Open Digital Trust Initiative has four policy Work Groups. &nbsp;The Initiative’s two technical Work Groups, the OIDF’s eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance and the Financial-Grade APIs are responsive to the steep rise in the use of fintech apps and services. &nbsp;In that context, the new eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Standard responds to the need for trusted online identity verification alternatives to today’s problematic in-person proofing requirements. The Financial-Grade APIs standard helps secure the portability and privacy of personal data held by banks and used by fintech innovators in new online applications.</p>
<p>As OIDF members know well, technical standards are critical components of an ecosystem’s infrastructure. Identity standards like OpenID Connect are key to validating the commercial viability, facilitating multi-vendor interoperability, securing data portability and privacy protections for customers. Promoting the adoption of these technical standards in concert with the IIF’s focus on regulatory requirements expedites the legal compliance needed for the implementation of innovative technologies. It’s an alternative to wasting resources navigating between competing frameworks. It is a market based approach with open technical standards being adopted on criteria such as effectiveness, opportunity cost and enabling compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The Report points out to its unique contribution to the global identity ecosystem at a critical time. Put simply, the IIF has advanced a diverse global community’s understanding of both technology “tools” and the governance “rules.” The IIF’s Initiative has triggered a virtuous circle coupling the development of open technical standards with policy development in a time of economic, technical and social disruption. The result is a positive feedback loop between the policy and technical working group that initiated a virtuous circle that can inform a global collaboration strategy for years to come.</p>
<p>While the IIF and the OpenID Foundation do not themselves propose to “police” the Principles, or award or allocate trust marks to particular Digital Trust Networks, we encourage identity attribute verifiers, trust framework operators and others to consider offering these services. In concert with the OpenID Foundation’s technical workshops and pilots, the Open Digital Trust Initiative may also road-test the draft Principles in the first half of 2021, through one or more proof of concept projects.</p>

 Why the resignation of the Dutch government is a good reminder of how important it is to monitor and regulate algorithms <p>On January 15, the Dutch government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/15/dutch-government-resigns-over-child-benefits-scandal">resigned </a>amid a scandal in which the tax authorities unjustly accused more than 26,000 families of mainly low socio-economic background of committing fraud. An overtly strict interpretation of government policy led to any minor inconsistency between data, or any <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/world/europe/dutch-government-resignation-rutte-netherlands.html">failure to sign </a>one of the pages of the form, to be classified as fraudulent. The government, which has pursued a policy of zero tolerance for tax fraud, required those families to return to the state huge sums pertaining not only to the period in which the alleged fraud was committed, but up to 5 years prior to when the alleged fraud was committed. It was later revealed that applications from candidates with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-politics-resignation-idUSKBN29K1IO">more than one citizenship </a>were also automatically flagged as suspects, and so most of the families erroneously accused of fraud were lower-class immigrant families, sparking additional controversy about institutional racism. The draconian way of locating cases and collecting debts has led many families to considerable financial difficulties, declaring bankruptcy, and collapsing the family unit under the&nbsp;burden.</p><p>A parliamentary report entitled <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2020/12/17/parents-faced-unprecedented-injustice-years-childcare-subsidy-scandal">Unprecedented Injustice</a>, examined the actions of the government and put the blame on tax officials, politicians, judges, and other government officials. Although the report does not mention the use of algorithms as one of the reasons for the failure, given the reliance of the Netherlands and many other countries on algorithms to determine certain benefits, it is plausible that the default would have happened because of an algorithm, therefore the consequences of such occurrence should be considered.</p><p>Just a few months ago, a court in The Hague <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/welfare-surveillance-system-violates-human-rights-dutch-court-rules">declared illegal </a>one of the algorithms used by the Netherlands Ministry of Social Services to detect and investigate cases of social benefit fraud. The algorithm, named SyRI (which stands for System Risk Indication), was implemented deliberately only in <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/story/syri-netherlands-algorithm/">the poorest neighborhoods </a>of the Netherlands where underprivileged and immigrant populations tend to make up a large share of the demographic. SyRI also incorrectly classified many families as involved in fraud and thus blocked their way to receiving social benefits to which they were entitled. In addition, the Dutch Public Broadcasting Company (NOS), in 2019 <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2286848-overheid-gebruikt-op-grote-schaal-voorspellende-algoritmes-risico-op-discriminatie.html">revealed </a>extensive use of algorithms by many government ministries for determining where criminal offenses are committed, assessing how much social support each person will need and what are the chances a certain student will drop out of school. Government ministries are <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2286880-privacywaakhond-overheid-moet-transparanter-zijn-over-algoritmes.html">not always transparent </a>about the use of algorithms and citizens do not always know that a particular decision in their case has been made by computer software. For this reason, the Dutch Data Protection Authority intends to tighten supervision of the use of algorithms in government ministries due to the danger that those algorithms will discriminate against underprivileged groups.</p><p>As mentioned, the Netherlands is not the only country that makes extensive use of sophisticated algorithms for ranking and evaluating citizens. A <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25156">report </a>written by Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, warns against “stumbling zombie into a digital welfare dystopia”. Alston highlights the fact that technology is often presented as a tool that will increase efficiency, benefit citizens, and provide them with better services. However, in practice, governments use technology mainly to surveil and track citizens, particularly the underprivileged, and also in order to reduce welfare budgets and the number of people eligible for government support.</p><p>When the decision to deny eligibility is made by an algorithm, public officials do not always have the option to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3692792">understand exactly</a> what led to that disqualification and they cannot always intervene and change the decision. Of course, the algorithm directly reflects the policy dictated by the government. So if the overriding goal is to detect as many social benefit scams as possible, the algorithm is calibrated to achieve the same result, and the same decision to tag any failure to sign or fill in a particular field on the form will lead the algorithm to classify the case as fraud, just as tax officials did manually in the Dutch child benefits&nbsp;affair.</p><p>Fortunately, the parliamentary committee that examined the state’s conduct regarding the default of child benefits was able to understand precisely what led to many families being mistakenly classified as involved in fraud. The committee examined the procedures and criteria established for the purpose of classifying each case as a fraud, thus exposing the fact that failure to fill one field in the form in good faith, or lack of one signature among many led to the misclassification. As a result, it was possible to have a public debate on the legitimacy of each of the criteria that should lead to the classification of fraud cases and to come to the conclusion that these do not constitute a justifiable reason for denying the benefit and labeling families as fraudulent. If the decision was made by an algorithm, the concern is that due to the technological ambiguity surrounding the operation of the algorithm it would have been much more difficult to point out the government’s failure and to restore the damages done to the victims of the unjust&nbsp;policy.</p><p>Hence, the Dutch case clearly demonstrates why it is vital to maintain high standards of transparency and supervision in algorithms that influence individuals’ lives. Principles of transparency and control help in maintaining proper governance and particularly help in holding accountable those who decide to adopt a certain algorithm or those who built&nbsp;it.</p><p>This story has been originally published as an <a href="https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001359618">op-ed</a> in Globes Israeli Business Journal, 4 February 2021 (in&nbsp;Hebrew)</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/why-the-resignation-of-the-dutch-government-is-a-good-reminder-of-how-important-it-is-to-monitor-2c599c1e0100">Why the resignation of the Dutch government is a good reminder of how important it is to monitor…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>February 9,&nbsp;2021</p><p><a href="https://ufa.worldbank.org/">1.7 billion</a> adults and millions of organizations do not have access to essential financial services; billions more have bank accounts but are unable to use them. Despite initiatives such as the <a href="https://ufa.worldbank.org/">World Bank’s Universal Financial Access program</a> and governmental and industry encouragement, many remain underserved or entirely excluded from the global financial system. For many, the basic societal need to hold monetary value securely, transact for necessities, and transfer money to friends and family is still out of&nbsp;reach.</p> Regulatory Compliance Is an Enabler for Innovation in&nbsp;Fintech <p>Thankfully, financial services continue to evolve rapidly, providing new avenues for people and organizations to engage in essential services. Alternative financial technologies (fintech) are bursting into the marketplace, offering innovative products and services to banking participants through direct, smartphone-based, non-traditional channels. The digitization of monetary exchange has also experienced explosive growth, often proving to be faster, more convenient, more privacy-respecting, and more secure than physical transactions.</p><p>These trends expand the risk and compliance challenges of money transmission beyond traditional banks to startups, enterprises, and nonprofits/NGOs, which are typically unfamiliar with regulatory scrutiny or essential compliance controls. Global regulators are currently monitoring this transition and looking to ensure existing regulations apply to new fintech players. This transition includes virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and other non-bank financial institutions which act as a conduit for the financially excluded and underserved or those otherwise considered ‘high-perceived-compliance risk.’</p> Financial Inclusion Needs Identity for&nbsp;All <p>According to the World Bank’s ID4D, “<a href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/953621531854471275/pdf/Global-ID-Coverage-Barriers-and-Use-by-the-Numbers-Insights-from-the-ID4D-Findex-Survey.pdf">People with an ID are more likely to own bank accounts and mobile phones, and financial and mobile services are among the most frequently reported uses of one’s&nbsp;ID</a>.”</p><p>Identity verification is at the core of essential financial regulations of Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT). Financial governance leaders are recalibrating their requirements to keep up with the pace of innovation to ensure that bad actors do not exploit the financial system and that intermediaries of all types have adequate financial crime compliance (FCC) programs in&nbsp;place.</p><p>The fundamental right for individuals to participate in society no matter their origins or circumstance has long been at the core of the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>’s vision. The Foundation promotes control of one’s own identity to utilize digitally stored credentials to access and engage daily services. While decentralized identity has been a barrier in traditional banking, fintech and regtech have introduced the constructs to leverage digital and self-sovereign identity to drive financial inclusion for tens of millions of outliers.</p><p>Indeed, these new technologies provide great promise in modernizing finance, payments, and identity management in tandem. But related regulatory compliance is in equal need of modernization. Traditional legal compliance relies on legacy banking infrastructure. Its growth has forced the sector into a false binary choice: provide incentives for universal access or protect financial system integrity with exclusionary compliance controls. This choice has disproportionately impacted those who are in most need of essential financial services, such as low- or moderate-income families, and access to vital services, such as international remittances. The Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the importance of such entry to small businesses reliant on support and financially underserved or excluded households looking for&nbsp;relief.</p> Innovation in Governance, Compliance, and Regulation <p>Since 2019, Sovrin has hosted the Compliance and Payments Task Force (CPTF), an open group of traditional bank and non-bank financial institutions, regulators, policymakers, technologists, ethicists, and legal experts. The CPTF has developed and promoted the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Rulebook</a>, an innovative best practices framework that extends traditional banking compliance and payments guidance to emerging fintech and VASP processes.</p><p>The Rulebook serves to ensure essential global banking compliance while accommodating fintech’s seamless experience and smooth flow of funds for members and reinforcing the application and intersection with traditional banking rails. The Rulebook defines technical standards for end-to-end transaction flows and service-level agreements between parties to reflect the operational realities of an increasingly decentralized and cross-border financial system.</p><p>As part and parcel of regulatory compliance to expand the operational focus of the CPTF to serve the Identity for All mission and advance inclusion, the Group has reimagined into the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0EAHbtr2GFDoK7_WlbrOJO1p8rUv9HrKCFBsPdnaUo/edit">Compliance and Inclusive Finance Working Group (CIFWG)</a>. The CIFWG builds on the tactical efforts of the CPTF, with a robust and ambitious mandate: promoting financial inclusion as a critical enabler. CIFWG will monitor the challenges faced by the financially excluded and underserved, focusing on how economic and regulatory technologies, supported by self-sovereign identity (SSI), can bridge the gap between traditional banking compliance and the associative risks injected by innovation.</p><p>With the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Rulebook</a> as an anchor framework, the Group will facilitate the advancement of financial inclusion and a modernized application of established global banking requirements and the attendant and necessary FCC protocols. CIFWG is also engaging with other international organizations, initiatives, and regulatory-led groups that advance financial inclusion and modern regulatory compliance solutions. Its ultimate goal is to promote access to traditional and non-traditional financial services and highlight the resulting benefits of building economic resilience and prosperity.</p><p>CIFWG believes that SSI is a powerful enabler for security, compliance, and inclusion&nbsp;. “Our bedrock approach recognizes that any institution today can be a financial services provider; our job is enabling their full participation in the global banking system,” says Amit Sharma, CIFWG Chair. “Digital finance is not new, although the cryptographic creation and representation of value show promising applications to democratize finance truly. Innovative and modern FCC approaches must meet market innovation. We encourage all who are interested in joining us in the CIFWG to help facilitate a pathway to a more sustainable economic future for&nbsp;all.”</p><p>For more details about the Working Group and instructions on how to join, please see the Compliance and Inclusive Finance <a href="https://sovrin.org/inclusive-finance/">webpage</a> or contact <a href="mailto:cifwg@sovrin.org">cifwg@sovrin.org</a>.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://sovrin.org/promoting-banking-for-all-announcing-the-compliance-inclusive-finance-working-group-cifwg/">https://sovrin.org</a> on February 9,&nbsp;2021.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>At Equifax, I work with governments across Canada to help them utilize data, insights and analytics to make policy decisions more data driven. We also have fraud and authentication solutions that tend to work well for government departments administering social assistance programs. We are a member of DIACC and I am a Co-Chair of the Outreach Committee this year. We’re focused on getting lots of identity content out, on topics that might need more explaining like facial recognition technology, for example. It gets me out of bed in the morning because I enjoy the people I am working with and these are problems I really enjoy solving.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>That is a long story. My Dad was (and still is) the Mayor of the small town I grew up in, so I quite literally grew up in politics. In university, my desire to understand how governments worked was strong so I started doing internships. I got hired at Queen’s Park as my first job out of university and ended up in the Ministry of Finance. That led me to the financial services sector where I first got introduced to the world of identity and authentication as more transactions started happening online.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>My degree is in Environmental Policy so I always felt like I didn’t belong in financial services or technology. The most important lesson I have learned along the way is that hard work and a strong willingness to learn and execute is just as important as credentials. Work hard, have a growth mindset, and don’t be intimidated.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START /STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>There are a lot of solutions out there today and the sector is evolving so fast. What we are starting to do really well and need to continue to do is collaborate. I have been part of many co-pitches now<br>
and it is really fun.</p>
<p>What we need to start to focus on more is how do we better reach the general public and build trust? That’s not any one person or organization’s role, but it is a focus of the DIACC outreach committee because we believe that education will help adoption.</p>
<p>Communication is so important, and one thing I think we should stop doing is speaking too technically about product benefits and features. Let’s talk instead about values and solving customers problems. Identity solves so many customer problems and it will help people and organizations connect the dots.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>We need different perspectives around the table in order to make informed decisions.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>I recently read The Choice by Dr. Edith Eva Edger. She is a psychologist and one of the last remaining Holocaust survivors. It is one of those life changing books. Although the book is about struggle and suffering, it is an inspiration.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’?

 Good Health Pass: A New Cross-Sector Initiative to Restore Global Travel and Restart the Global&nbsp;Economy <p>Today, <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020</a> announced the launch of the <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> along with more than 25 leading individual companies and organizations in the technology, health, and travel sectors — including the Airports Council International (ACI), Commons Project Foundation, COVID-19 Credentials Initiative, Evernym, Hyperledger, IBM, International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Linux Foundation Public Health, Lumedic, Mastercard, Trust Over IP Foundation, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is an open, inclusive, cross-sector initiative to create a blueprint for interoperable digital health pass systems that will help restore global travel and restart the global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every segment of the global economy, but none as profoundly as<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/industries-most-and-least-impacted-by-covid19-from-a-probability-of-default-perspective-september-2020-update"> travel and tourism</a>. Last year, airlines lost an estimated<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-11-24-01/"> $118.5 billion USD</a> with related impacts across the economy in excess of <a href="https://www.unwto.org/impact-assessment-of-the-covid-19-outbreak-on-international-tourism">$2 trillion&nbsp;USD</a>.</p><p>In conjunction with the announcement, the Collaborative also released its first white paper, entitled, <a href="https://goodhealthpass.org/good_health_pass-a_safe_path_to_global_reopening">Good Health Pass: A Safe Path to Global Reopening</a>.</p> Collaboration Among a New Ecosystem of&nbsp;Players <blockquote>“There’s one thing the world agrees on — we need to address the health concerns today to support a return to normalcy,” said Ajay Bhalla, President of Cyber &amp; Intelligence at Mastercard. “Delivering a global, interoperable health pass system can only happen if we come together in a way that meets the needs of everyone involved. This Collaborative will be critical in helping to define how we connect the pieces that will bring travel back safely, spark job creation and jumpstart the world’s economic&nbsp;engine.”</blockquote><p>Various efforts are currently underway to develop digital health credentials systems — both vaccination and test certificates — for international travel. Yet, despite this race to market, it is unlikely that a single solution will be implemented universally — or even across the entire travel industry. Thus, it is critical that solutions are designed from the onset to be interoperable — both with one another and across institutional and geographic borders.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is not intended to supplant existing efforts but rather to help weave them together, fill gaps where they may exist, and facilitate collaboration among a new ecosystem of stakeholders, many of whom have never worked together&nbsp;before.</p><blockquote>“Fragmentation is a risk we simply cannot ignore,” said ID2020 Executive Director Dakota Gruener. “To be valuable to users, credentials need to be accepted at check-in, upon arrival by border control agencies, and more. We can get there — even with multiple systems — as long as solutions adhere to open standards and participate in a common governance framework. But without these, fragmentation is inevitable, and travelers — and the economy — will continue to suffer needlessly as a&nbsp;result.”</blockquote> Global Travel &amp; Digital Health Credentials <p>COVID-19 test results are already required for entry at some airports and at international borders. But existing paper-based certificates are easy to lose, unnecessarily expose sensitive personal information, and are prone to fraud and counterfeiting.</p><p>By contrast, digital health credentials can be printed (e.g., as a QR code) or stored on an individual’s mobile phone. They enhance user privacy and “bind” an individual’s identity to their test result or vaccination certificate, thus enabling real-time, fraud-resistant digital verification.</p><blockquote>“Our health data consists of the most sensitive personal information, deserving of the strongest privacy,” said Dr. Ann Cavoukian, Executive Director of the Global Privacy &amp; Security By Design Centre. “Release of our health data must be under our personal control. The Good Health Pass does just that: With Privacy by Design embedded throughout, you control the release of your digital health data, and to whom; all de-identified and decentralized. Privacy and functionality: Win/Win!”</blockquote><p>The World Health Organization recently convened the Smart Vaccination Certificate Consortium to establish standards for vaccination certificates, but no analogous effort currently exists for test certificates. Given that it is expected to take years for vaccines to be universally available globally, widespread testing will remain an essential public health tool — and one that must continue alongside vaccination to ensure a safe and equitable return to public&nbsp;life.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative has defined four primary requirements that digital health credential systems for international travel must&nbsp;satisfy:</p>  Cross-border: Solutions must work at airports, airlines, ports-of-call, and borders worldwide and comply with international and local regulations.  Cross-industry: Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors.  Secure &amp; privacy-protecting: Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors. Solutions must comply with all relevant security, privacy, and data protection regulations and must be able to bind the presenter of the credential to the credential itself at the required level of assurance.  Frictionless: Solutions must seamlessly integrate into testing and travel processes, thus enhancing and streamlining the experience for individuals and airlines alike. Solutions must not add new material costs for travelers. Optimally, validation processes will be contactless to maintain or enhance&nbsp;hygiene.  <p>The Collaborative welcomes the participation of policymakers and representatives of government agencies; companies in the health, technology, and travel sectors; and civil society organizations who share a commitment to safely restoring international travel and economic activity while simultaneously ensuring that equity, privacy, and other civil liberties are protected.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more, please visit the Good Health Pass website at <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">goodhealthpass.org</a>.</p> Endorsing Organizations   Affinidi  Airport Council International (ACI)  Airside  analizA  AOKpass  Bindle Systems  BLOK Solutions  CLEAR  The Commons Project Foundation  Covid Credential Initiative (CCI)  Daon  Everynym  Global Privacy &amp; Security by Design&nbsp;Centre  Grameen Foundation  Hyperledger  IBM  idRamp  International Chamber of Commerce&nbsp;(ICC)  iProov  Linux Foundation Public&nbsp;Health  Lumedic  Mastercard  MIT SafePaths  National Aviation Services&nbsp;(NAS)  Panta  PathCheck Foundation  Prescryptive Health  SITA  STChealth  Trust Over IP Foundation  ZAKA   <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/good-health-pass-a-new-cross-sector-initiative-to-restore-global-travel-and-restart-the-global-8b59eb1050a0">Good Health Pass: A New Cross-Sector Initiative to Restore Global Travel and Restart the Global…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>In this video author and tech entrepreneur Mark Logan is invited by Glasgow Talks to provide the audience an overview of his recommendations to the Scottish Government to stimulate and accelerate the maturity of Scotland’s Technology Ecosystem, with a focus on education, infrastructure and funding. 
<p>Commissioned by Kate Forbes, Mark Logan former COO for Skyscanner, has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-technology-ecosystem-review/">published a report</a> identifying how Scotland might accelerate growth of its tech ecosystem. Mark joins the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce to share his thoughts on the strategy.</p>
 What is a technology ecosystem? 
<p>Before summarizing the video, let’s talk about what is technology ecosystem and what does it do?</p>
<p>The term “ecosystem” was first used by British ecologist Arthur Tansley back in 1935 to describe the relationship between organisms and their environment.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight years later, business strategist James F. Moore co-opted the word in the Harvard Business Review article to describe the interconnected business world. Moore suggested that companies weren’t members of a single industry, but rather part of a business ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ecosystems now include communities that use shared, scalable resources to pursue challenging objectives and common interests. Ecosystems are about dynamic interactions between people, software, data, systems and services.</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>The First Minister announced that the people of Scotland must keep pace with digital innovation and by doing so they can help boost economic growth, drive innovation and protect businesses against any future crisis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With over 25 years experience, Mark is focused on helping to nurture the start-up community in Scotland and the UK as an investor, non-executive director and advisor. Mark is also a Professor in the School of Computing Science at University of Glasgow.</p>
<p>He undertook a review of the Scottish tech sector and delivered a blueprint to raise it to world-class status. The people of Scotland are now working to take forward his ambitious recommendations including the establishment of a national network of hubs for tech startups offering world-class training program, intensive monitoring and access to funding opportunities.</p>
<p>The tech ecosystem has inputs and outputs. The inputs are people, infrastructure, education and funding. The outputs are a stream of business and scaled tech business. To increase the rate of startups we can consider that inside the ecosystem box there is a distinct life-cycle of growth, there are pre-startups, startups, small scale ups and large scale ups.</p>
<p>There is an opportunity gap within this ecosystem box. The report is trying to identify the interventions and to support the inner lines to move forward towards the outer maturity. An ecosystem of a country reaches its tipping point where there’s sufficient critical mass of startups and scale ups that certain virtuous network effects start to operate.</p>
<p>There are three main drivers of this. The first one is attracting talent from outside the ecosystem, second creation of opportunities for them and the by-product is more commercial people. After the tipping point there is investment of money and expertise. The government of Scotland is very close to the tipping point as he sees more talent and ambition in the ecosystem.</p>
 Education 
<p>Currently Finland has the most high-tech ecosystem in the world, having been an early adopter of a technology ecosystem approach. In his report he has drawn out three foundations of technology ecosystem success, namely talent, education infrastructure and funding.</p>
<p>By increasing the supply of engineers and by creating potential tech entrepreneurs, the growth of tech ecosystem is accelerated. The education infrastructure relates to two core foundations – One is physical infrastructure and the other is social infrastructure. In the report he explains this through a definition of a market square, a place where people come together in different forums small and large and learn from each other and learn internationally and build a sense of community and identity and ability to find each other.</p>
<p>Funding covers different types of investment through different stages of requirements of a company’s growth. He has made 34 recommendations in his report to build these foundations of a tech ecosystem. Some of these recommendations have huge long-term leverage value.</p>
<p>Another key recommendation is to expand the involvement of children in Computer Science from an early age, so that they can be the potential future tech entrepreneurs. This is like planting the seeds for future growth, and&nbsp;Computer Science should be treated in education the same way that math and physics is treated for the growth of tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>It will take some time to teach students Computer Science at initial level and to increase the number of CS teachers at schools. Upscaling and reskilling of the teachers is also essential because CS changes rapidly. Inviting industry people to teach the classes, making room for programming projects and changing the syllabus will contribute to the growth of tech-ecosystem.</p>
 Incubators and Accelerators 
<p>Incubator and accelerator are the two terms that people have heard of most for startups. An incubator gives indefinite tenure subject to certain criteria and creates like a market square environment where people can learn from each other.</p>
<p>Accelerators tend to be different they tend to be relatively short-lived programs for like 12 weeks to 16 weeks and these tend to have an education element which shares lessons and success stories so.</p>
<p>The primary issue is that the government can do a better job of creating credible high-growth startups that can convince people that Scotland can repeatedly grow global scale up level businesses, and the challenge of education infrastructure, and availability of funding is essential for all stages of the startup life-cycle.</p>

<p>Team FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The second and final day of the Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead: Virtual Policy Forum event on Feb. 5 brought together government officials, tech experts and policy advocates in a packed agenda.</p>



<p>The two-day event was hosted by the FIDO Alliance together with the Better Identity Coalition and the ID Theft Resource Center (ITRC) and had over 1,000 registered attendees. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/identity-authentication-and-the-road-ahead-virtual-policy-forum-day-1/">first day</a> of the event saw sessions that outlined the clear and present need for the government and industry to make identity and strong authentication systems more pervasive, to help protect and serve individuals and businesses alike. The second day in contrast had a strong focus on the need for strong authentication and was highlighted by an expert panel that explained how FIDO authentication was able to help secure the 2020 U.S. election.</p>



<p>The day’s event kicked off with a keynote from Congressman John Katko (R-NY) who emphasized the critical need for secure digital identity.</p>



  



<p>“Our homeland security, national security, economic security and way of life are threatened in unprecedented ways by highly sophisticated adversaries and simply being vigilant is no longer enough,” Katko (pictured) said. “Today’s threat environment demands a posture of unwavering resilience. This is particularly true for ensuring the sanctity and resilience of our digital identities.” </p>



<p>How FIDO Helped to Secure the 2020 Election</p>



<p>The resilience of digital identity and strong authentication was called into question during the 2016 election cycle when hackers were able to infiltrate the email accounts of Democratic party staffers, notably the attack of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s gmail account.</p>



  



<p>The same type of event didn’t re-occur during the 2020 election cycle, in part thanks to FIDO standards and a concerted effort to make sure that both Democratic and Republican party officials had access to strong authentication. In a panel during the event, Michael Kaiser, President and CEO of <a href="https://www.defendcampaigns.org/">Defending Digital Campaigns</a> (pictured) explained that his organization was created to help solve the challenge of political campaigns not having the right cybersecurity resources to defend themselves. As companies cannot directly donate to campaigns, Defending Digital Campaigns was formed to act as an intermediary, that enables political campaigns to get cybersecurity services including FIDO based strong authentication resources, for free or low cost. </p>



<p>Kaiser explained that political campaigns are not like a typical organization in that they are short lived and don’t have long term thinking about a security maturity model. Despite that, political campaigns need to be protected as they sit on incredibly valuable and important information.</p>



<p>“I think we gave away more than 10,000 security keys in the political sector in the 2020 cycle,” Kaiser said. “That’s a lot of people and a lot of accounts as we gave away more than $1 million worth of products to 183 campaigns.”</p>



  



<p>Bob Lord (pictured), chief security officer of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) noted that after the events of the 2016 election, security was clearly under the microscope. </p>



<p>“Security is a real challenge and everybody really understands the importance of it, but the dollar figures really can get in the way,” Lord said. “Making sure that there was a reliable source for things like security keys was really instrumental in moving forward.”</p>



<p>Within the DNC and across campaigns, Lord and his team strictly implemented the use of FIDO based security keys to provide strong authentication capabilities and limit the risk of potential phishing attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Today 100% of the people at the DNC who need to get access to their email and&nbsp; access to their documents, they’re all using security keys – no exceptions, no executive privilege to opt out of this,” Lord said.</p>



<p>The DNC also benefited from Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP) which provides additional levels of protection and assurance beyond what a basic gmail account enables.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re big supporters and real big believers in the combination of FIDO security keys and the APP,” Lord said.</p>



<p>Why DNC Believes in FIDO</p>



<p>Lord noted that there are a number of reasons why he is a big supporter of FIDO standards. For one is the fact that FIDO standards are built into the Google Chrome browser. Lord explained that the DNC was pushing the use of Chromebooks to campaigns and the integrated FIDO capabilities made it easier to deploy strong authentication.</p>



<p>While there are multiple types of two-factor authentication available in the market, for Lord there are really only two categories.</p>



<p>“I think there are really two kinds of multi-factor that are available in the consumer space – I think there are FIDO security keys and then there’s everything else,” Lord stated emphatically. “When I refer to everything else, I refer to those other multi-factors systems as legacy and I do that because I want people to get the mental model that this is something to be contained, minimized and eventually moved out.”</p>



<p>Lord observed that other multi-factor approaches, while better than not using multi-factor at all, have shown weaknesses, which is why in his view as an industry it’s important to really be pushing people pretty aggressively to move down the path of FIDO strong authentication adoption.</p>



<p>While Lord is an advocate for adopting FIDO based strong authentication with security keys, he also noted that there were some usability challenges his team had to work through as well training that was needed to educate and onboard users. The learning from the DNC’s efforts are all now being publicly shared by Lord’s team at<a href="https://democrats.org/security/"> https://democrats.org/security/</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s a non-partisan thing so there’s nothing red or blue about these best practices, but you’ll see in there that we really push pretty hard on security keys and the APP in particular,” he said.</p>



  



<p>Mark Risher, Senior Director of Security and Identity at Google (pictured) emphasized during the panel that in general adding a second factor does still objectively decrease the chances of a user becoming the victim of a phishing attack. That said, he noted that for an attacker, phishing a password, or just phishing a password plus a One Time Password (OTP) PIN code basically just&nbsp; requires basically one more line of code for an attacker. </p>



<p>“It does not require the funding of the nation state,” Rischer said about the ability to bypass OTP for phishing attacks. “So we need to get the world to understand the distinction, and to move into and start requiring these much more stringent hardware based strong authentication technologies and standards.”</p>



<p>How FIDO is Moving Forward to Enable Digital Transformation</p>



<p>The afternoon keynote at the event was delivered by Andrew Shikiar (pictured) the Executive Director of the FIDO Alliance. Shikiar noted that passwordless authentication is an important cornerstone for digital transformation.</p>



  



<p>“The security and authentication aspects of digital transformation came to the fore as everything was accelerated due to the pandemic,” Shikiar said. </p>



<p>Shikiar noted that social engineering had kind of a renaissance in 2020 as phishing continued to be successful.</p>



<p>“Simply put, the only way to break this cycle is to eliminate our dependence on server side credentials and password,” Shikiar said. “Anything on a server can and will eventually be stolen so they’re easy to phish, harvest and replay.”</p>



<p>The need to create stronger authentication is why FIDO was born. Shikiar explained that the FIDO Alliance’s mission is to create open standards for simpler, stronger authentication with public key cryptography and asymmetric public key cryptography, which is something that the average consumer should never have to pronounce, let alone know what it means.</p>



<p>Shikiar also outlined some of the FIDO Alliance’s highlights from 2020 including Apple joining the group. He added that Apple joining served as a powerful signal to the industry that really everyone is coalescing around the FIDO Alliance as the organization to collaborate on the standards based user friendly and strong authentication. Another key highlight from 2020 for FIDO was the level of support across operating system and browser combinations with different transport mechanisms for the authenticator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Over 4 billion devices can support FIDO authentication,” Shikiar said. “So in short, you know, we think FIDO is becoming part of the DNA of the web itself, which is a pretty audacious thing.”</p>



<p>“To summarize, FIDO is very much the present and the future of user authentication.”</p>



<p>The Solarwind #Solorigate Attack as an Identity Authentication Issue</p>



<p>A key topic that resonated throughout the second day of the policy forum was the impact of the recent Solarwinds attack which is also commonly referred to as Solorigate.</p>



<p>During a panel about what policies the Biden Administration should consider with regards to Identity, John Miller Senior Vice President of Policy and Senior Counsel at ITI, commented that the Solarwinds attack has been accurately described as a software supply chain attack but it really is also fairly characterized as an identity attack.</p>



  



<p>“Characterizing Solarwinds as an identity attack presents an opportunity to remind policy makers of how fundamental identity is to not only what we’re doing online as consumers but to, but an enterprise environment,” Miller said. </p>



<p>In the final keynote of the event, Alex Weinert (pictured) Partner Director of Identity Security, at Microsoft, outlined the gory authentication and identity details behind the Solorigate incident and why zero trust principles would help to mitigate many risks.</p>



<p>Weinert noted that the Solorigate attack was a fundamental attack on trust. He also emphasized the clear role that authentication played in the attacks and the need to move to strong authentication.</p>



<p>“What are we doing to encourage explicitly verifiable credentials, we all know passwords are crap, we know they’re incredibly vulnerable,” Weinert said. “Are we doing enough as an industry to push for the end of passwords?”</p>



<p>Today’s sessions (February 5) have been recorded and will be available soon.</p>

<p>MADISON, Wis., and WASHINGTON 02/04/21 – CUNA announced today a transfer of Credit Union Financial Exchange (CUFX) to CULedger.</p>
<p>“CUFX is the result of a grass-roots initiative,” said Chris Seneda, past CUNA Technology Council chair, CUFX steering committee member, and executive vice president and chief operations officer at Virginia CU. “It started with senior IT credit union executives who recognized a need for credit unions as they were trying to get their different systems to work together. The CUNA Technology Council leadership was instrumental in helping to get CUFX off the ground and continued to provide resources as it progressed into its position today. With the transition to CULedger, CUFX will get added support and continue to work with its users and CUNA Technology Council volunteers to assist with future improvements.”</p>
<p>CUFX continues to thrive and meet the necessities of its credit union users. The latest update, which went live this past fall, included the advancement to support non-unique account ID architectures. This newest advancement was driven and reviewed by three core system providers currently implementing CUFX.</p>
<p>“Since its inception, CUFX has been evolving to meet the needs of credit unions,” said David Rohn, vice president of CUNA Councils.</p>
<p>With its transition to CULedger and continued connection to credit union technology experts, we’re confident that this solution will continue to evolve, expand and assist credit unions.”</p>
<p>CULedger delivers a trusted peer-to-peer services network of verifiable exchange for financial cooperatives. Its solutions include MemberPass, a digital ID held by credit union members that protects credit unions and their members from identity theft and fraud in all banking interactions.</p>
<p>“CULedger is proud to incorporate CUFX into our product offerings for credit unions,” said John Ainsworth, President, and CEO of CULedger. “This solution is already being utilized with other solutions within our portfolio, so we understand its value and support its continued advancements.”</p>

 About the Lissi&nbsp;wallet <p>The Lissi wallet is a simple but powerful tool to manage digital interactions. It can be used to establish connections to third parties and to exchange information. You can find a more detailed explanation <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/introducing-the-lissi-mobile-wallet-b2af9bccaf03">here</a> or on <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">our website</a>. It’s currently available as an open beta version for <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">iOS</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta">Android</a>.</p> The importance of multi language&nbsp;support <p>Within the identity community, we spend considerable time to ensure interoperability between different solutions. We engage in conversations in a variety of standardization bodies to enable a seamless user experience on a global scale. Frankly speaking, we are not there just yet. But we are on a good way to enable access to the services regardless of where an entity is based or which social background an individual has. While regulation as well as technical and educational hurdles remain, it’s crucial to increase the accessibility of products to different cultures and languages.</p><p>We have already received feedback from multiple stakeholders from the public and private sector saying that multi-language support is essential for the execution of various use cases. There are several nations, which have multiple official languages. If our end-user facing products are not available in the most common languages, it creates entry barriers so big that not even a piloting of these use cases would make sense. Hence, we took note and worked hard to ensure the Lissi wallet is available in the languages of communities, which currently explore the self-sovereign identity&nbsp;concept.</p><p>The Lissi wallet now supports the following languages:</p>  Arabic  English  French  German  Italian  Korean  Polish  Portuguese  Russian  Romanian  Spanish, and  Turkish.   Challenges remain <p>When designing a wallet, the language is only a small part of the whole user experience. The task is to design a universal cockpit, which people can navigate regardless of their social background. Similar to a dashboard in a car, which doesn’t look too different wherever you go. In order to achieve this, we have to standardize the icons, colours and user-flows to a certain degree. However, on the other hand, they need to be adjusted to the target audience. Let’s take the colour red as an example. In western cultures, red is associated with excitement, danger, urgency and love, whereas the same colour evokes danger and caution in the middle-east. In India, it’s associated with purity, while in China it symbolizes luck and happiness. Finding the right balance between standardization and necessary adjustments for the target audience will require knowledge about the cultural differences, feedback and time. When it comes to language it creates its own set of difficulties. Differences can be observed in the usage of genders, the left-to-right or right-to-left reading, the information density or the usage of tenses, just to name a few. Furthermore, there isn’t a common terminology used within the community, which makes a translation into different languages even more challenging.</p><p>Hence, our translation won’t be perfect. While we worked with native speakers, the context is often difficult to explain without demonstrating the user-flow and an actual use-case. Languages also change depending on the use-case or the subject in question. Nevertheless, we are looking forward to making the Lissi wallet even more accessible by adding additional languages and improving our current translation with your feedback. What language would you like to have us support next? We are always looking for translators for additional languages, so reach out to us to get our winter 2021 edition of Lissi Merchandise!</p><p>Cheers. The Lissi&nbsp;team.</p>

<p>Team FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The intersection of identity and authentication and how it can help to improve business as well as people’s lives was a core topic of conversation on the first day of the Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead: Virtual Policy Forum event on Feb. 4.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance joined together with Better Identity Coalition and the ID Theft Resource Center (ITRC)&nbsp; to host the two day event running on Feb. 4-5, which has over 1,000 registered attendees who are gathering to learn more and discuss the current and future state of identity and authentication. The first day of the event had a strong focus on things the U.S. can and is doing to help improve the state identity, while recognizing the many challenges on the road ahead.</p>



<p>Identity is a National Security Issue</p>



  



<p>In the opening keynote, Michael Mosier (pictured), Deputy Director &amp; Digital Innovation Officer at the U.S. Treasury departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/">FinCEN</a>), outlined what’s at stake when it comes to digital identity. </p>



<p>“I view identity as a national security issue, and it will take the intellectual power and creativity of all of us to figure out how to secure identities and keep people from harm,”&nbsp; Mosier said.</p>



<p>Mosier emphasized that digital identity solutions are a key factor to help prevent fraud and financial crime. He added that in order to get payments right, there is a clear need to first get identities done right. The right way in his view, is an approach that preserves privacy while ensuring integrity in the system.</p>



<p>“The ability to detect and address risks is only as good as the ability to determine with whom you’re engaging,” Mosier said. “So the real question for identity related risk is, do you have the information necessary to reliably assess the risk of your counterpart or your customer.”</p>



<p>A key challenge FinCen is seeing is at the account opening stage, with identity proofing and verification. A July 2020 advisory from FinCen highlighted the issue reporting that criminals are undermining identity verification processes, through identity theft and synthetic identity fraud.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing a lot of identity authentication compromise, leading to account takeovers, as&nbsp; a lack of multifactor and multi step authentication is too prevalent across the financial sector,” Mosier said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The costs of those takeovers is far from trivial. FinCEN is seeing around 5,000 account takeover reports each month, reaching approximately $400 million per month over the last two months.</p>



<p>“The bottom line is that many account takeovers and fraud are occurring because of failures to enforce stronger levels of assurance and identity verification in authentication processes,” Mosier said.</p>



<p>Phishing is Top Source of Identity Theft and Cybercrime</p>



  



<p>The Identity Theft Resource Center (<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">ITRC</a>) is seeing the same trends as FinCEN with phishing and credential theft being the leading source of identity theft, according to the groups recent release 2020 Data Breach Report. In a keynote session, Eva Velasquez, President and CEO and James Lee, Chief Operating Officer (pictured) of the&nbsp; ITRC outlined the high level findings of the report and its impact. </p>



<p>“Credentials are the coin of the realm today, as opposed to what we have traditionally thought of as being the kind of information that threat actors wanted to collect.” Lee said.</p>



<p>While other failures and vulnerabilities including unpatched software can and do lead to data breaches, Lee emphasized that the majority of the root causes of cyberattacks rely primarily on user logins and passwords</p>



<p>How the Pandemic has Accelerated the Need for Strong Authentication</p>



<p>With tens of millions of Americans looking to the U.S. government for help during the pandemic, there has been a clear need for strong authentication and identity technology.</p>



<p>During a panel, Sanjay Gupta, chief technology officer for the US Small Business Administration (SBA) noted that the SBA has been able to ramp up during the pandemic thanks in part to the deployment of a strong authentication based single sign on technology that makes use of FIDO Alliance standards. The SBA uses the <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> platform from the U.S Government’s General Service Administration (GSA).</p>



  



<p>In a keynote session, Congressman Bill Foster (D-IL) (pictured) stated that the COVID crisis has laid bare many of the inadequacies of the identity system in the U.S. </p>



<p>Just to pick one example, Foster noted that over a million stimulus checks were sent to dead people and for millions of others, the stimulus checks were delayed because of challenges in verifying who is eligible based on where they live. While there are challenges, Foster noted that there has also been a lot of relevant technological progress, independent of government action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The use of a secure enclave on a modern cell phone as a FIDO second factor device is a huge step forward,” Foster said.&nbsp; “The increasing use of privacy preserving biometric sensors on smartphones as a means of providing digital online authentication for human identity is going to be transformative.”</p>



  



<p>In a panel following the keynote on where the government can help with identity and authentication, Paul Rosenzweig, Resident Senior Fellow, Cybersecurity and Emerging Threat at the R Street Institute commented that good identity is clearly one of those common public goods that economic theory teaches us, is best provided at a governmental level. That’s an idea that panelist&nbsp;Phil Lam (pictured), Executive Director of Identity for the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) agreed with. </p>



<p>“I think that we as a government are providing a lot of benefits to Americans today and in order to facilitate providing that benefit, we kind of need to know who you are and&nbsp; are you eligible for a benefit,” Lam said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lam re-iterated that the FIDO-enabled <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> portal is a critical part of the U.S. government’s authentication strategy and now serves over 25 million users.</p>



  



<p>The final panel of the day tackled the socially important topic of equity and inclusion when it comes to identity and the individual. Among the panelists was Reverend Ben Roberts (pictured) who runs the ID Ministry, which is an effort to help the underprivileged get their identity so they can qualify for government assistance or even just to get a bank account. </p>



<p>Roberts detailed a number of heart-breaking cases of individuals that have had extreme challenges in getting some form of verified identity. He had a strong message for government policy makers and technology developers alike for how to enable strong authentication and identity systems.</p>



<p>“As we’re bringing things online and as new policies and new systems come into play, really do your level best to ensure that people are not getting left behind,” Roberts said.</p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee and Atsuhiro Tscuhiya, APAC Market Development Team</p>



<p>The reason to put passwords in the rearview mirror is more evident than ever. Our recent survey on consumer behavior says that 58% of abandoned online purchases are due to the difficulty of managing passwords. The Gartner Group’s research indicates that 20-25% of all helpdesk calls are password reset requests. The World Economic Forum (WEF) assessed that cybercrime costs the global economy $2.9 million every minute; about 80% of the attacks targeted passwords.</p>



<p>But the tide is turning. During our inaugural Authenticate conference, which took place in November 2020, Microsoft announced that they now have more than 150 million people are using their passwordless sign-in each month. That is a 50% increase from last year’s report at Microsoft Ignite back in November 2019.</p>



<p>We have all seen how the global pandemic has drastically accelerated the willingness of and the need for organizations to embrace passwordless FIDO Authentication. It is now a matter of how and with whom, instead of when.</p>



<p>Updates from APAC Marketing Forum</p>



<p>We are happy to share meaningful progress since the first FIDO AllianceAsia Pacific Marketing Forum (AMF) in July.&nbsp;Here are some updates from our members across the region:</p>



<p>Taiwan</p>



<p>Mentioned in our previous post was&nbsp; the introduction of FIDO’s standards in official documents developed by Taiwan Association of Information and Communication Standards (TAICS) and SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) Taiwan, as well as FIDO’s logo on the app of Taiwan-Cathay United Bank.</p>



<p>Recently, the government of Taiwan has also adopted FIDO’s authentication method for the purpose of citizen’s tax filing, a government service that supports more than 200,000 users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India</p>



<p>FIDO2 is now accepted by the CCA (Controller of Certifying Authorities), under India Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, as an alternative to SMS OTP.&nbsp; The guidelines have been published on the CCA website (<a href="http://cca.gov.in/eSignAPI.html">http://cca.gov.in/eSignAPI.html</a>).</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance member Singular Key’s FIDO Certified authentication service is being used by ReBIT, the cybersecurity subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India.</p>



<p>Additionally, a whitepaper on FIDO authentication for banking space has recently been submitted to ReBIT. Webinars designed to educate the public on FIDO’s standards are also in the works. These efforts will no doubt help to drive up FIDO awareness amongst the India population.</p>



<p>Hong Kong</p>



<p>In Hong Kong, the passion for horse racing continued even as people stayed home and betting branches closed because of the global pandemic.</p>



<p>For the first time ever, the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) kicked off the horse racing season with all-digital betting. Punters had to log on to HKJC’s mobile betting app, provided by FIDO Alliance member Tradelink.</p>



<p>The betting channels, which are secured by FIDO via biometric authentication on users’ mobile devices, provided a user-friendly and safe experience that helped to secure a record HK$1.376 billion turnover – 6.83% higher than the previous record set in the 2017/2018 season! This was made possible, despite the record low number of attendees at the races in year 2020.</p>



<p>Separately, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government rolled out a new initiative powered by Tradelink’s FIDO Certified authentication – the “iAM Smart” initiative, which enables Hong Kong citizens to authenticate their identities using mobile devices for access to financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Malaysia</p>



<p>There is a clear transition towards a passwordless future in Malaysia.</p>



<p>The FIDO Certified authentication service from SecureMetric is recently being adopted by a number of public services in the country as part of the government’s Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024. This means that FIDO authentication will play a role in services such as Malaysia Central Bank’s (Bank Negara) Electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC), the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) National Technology as well as Innovation Sandbox (NTIS) from the Ministry of Science.</p>



<p>Vietnam</p>



<p>In Vietnam, the shift away from passwords is accelerating. Currently, there are 32 licensed e-Wallet providers all vying to lead the charge to facilitate the country’s shift to a more cashless society. There is also a major focus on smart city, digital signatures and electronic ID developments.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, FIDO member VinCSS became the first company in the country to develop FIDO2 Certified authenticators. Since then, it has met the FIDO2 standard for the second time, announcing its achievement of FIDO2 Certification for its strong authentication server named VinCSS FIDO2 Server.</p>



<p>This achievement also means VinCSS is currently one of only 13 companies globally with a FIDO2 certified server that can accept any FIDO certified authenticator, irrespective of its manufacturer – an amazing feat!</p>



<p>Other Notable Updates in Asia</p>



<p>Additionally, Japan-based telecommunications operator KDDI recently deployed FIDO2 for its “au ID” and started FIDO authentication service. Instant messaging app LINE, introduced biometric authentication that utilizes FIDO standards for iPad users, eliminating the need to key in passwords. The FIDO Japan Working Group Chair was invited as an expert by the Japan Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication on their discussions using My Number Card capabilities on smartphones.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in Korea, the Blue House, the executive office and official residence of the president of the Republic of Korea, deployed TrustKey’s login solution powered by FIDO’s standards for remote work and internal security access.</p>

<p>The 3Box Labs team will be back to EthDenver this year, though a lot is different this time around. EthDenver is virtual for 2021, of course, but our team will be manning the digital booth and roaming the virtual halls to meet and mentor hackers. We love this community and can't wait to see you and your projects, whether that's in the Sports Castle or GamerJibe.</p><p>The tech we have for hackers has changed too. Last year at EthDenver, our CTO Joel huddled in a corner of the castle to build the first POC of <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>. Almost exactly a year later, Ceramic Network has just <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">moved into beta on a live testnet</a>. <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>, the open identity protocol built on Ceramic, is also in beta and ready for use. And 3Box is now <a href="http://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a>, with our full focus on <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/p/6c8da552-3900-472e-ad68-ded95ce3cbe0/">bringing these protocols</a> to builders across Web3.</p><p>Ceramic and IDX offer a massive improvement on previous 3Box products, and EthDenver hackers are the first to get a crack at the beta versions. To celebrate, we've got lots of content, tons of ideas, and nearly $10,000 in bounties up for grabs.</p> Workshops and Talks <p>We'll be all over the virtual stage over the next week talking about decentralized identity and data. (Add to your calendar from the <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/schedule">full schedule</a>).</p><p>Workshop: Using open identity with IDX <br>Saturday 2/6 at 9am MST/5pm CET</p><p>Tech Talk: Standards for encrypted and mutable data on IPFS <br>Sunday 2/7 at 11am MST/7pm CET</p><p>Evolution of Decentralized Identity: A history<br>Thursday 2/11 at 4pm MST, 12am CET</p><p>Identity Legos Panel: The composable Web3 identity stack <br>Thursday 2/11 at 4:30pm MST/12:30am CET</p><p>We'll also be on stage during bounty presentations and opening ceremonies to share more about our prizes and products, and we'll have an informal office hours at 10:30am MT each of Monday-Thursday for hackers who want to drop by with questions.</p> 10,000 DAI in bounties <p>We've got a huge trove of bounties to celebrate the beta release of 2 protocols: <a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> is a peer-to-peer dataweb for publishing, linking, and querying verifiable information on the open web. <br><a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX (identity index)</a> is an open identity protocol built on Ceramic that makes it simple to store, use, and manage decentralized identities and data across any network, platform or application.</p><p>We've split the 10,000 DAI in rewards across 5 categories.</p>  Best overall use of IDX (identity index): 3000 DAI across 4 winners  Best overall use of Ceramic Network: 3000 DAI across 4 winners  Best new tools for Ceramic Network: 1500 DAI to 1 winner  Best use of Ceramic for social features: 750 DAI to 1 winner  Partner bounties: use Ceramic with Textile (1000 DAI) and with NEAR (1000 DAI) – or go for all 3 together!   <p>The <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/post/ceramic-network">full bounty details are here</a>. We'll be looking for submissions that tackle an original project idea, use Ceramic/IDX well and deeply, provide a wow-worthy demo, and contribute value to the Web3 ecosystem.</p> Hack ideas we'd love to see <p>If you are looking for a great idea or a good way to use Ceramic or IDX, here are a few things we know we'd love to see.</p> Use IDX to manage user identities and data <p>🧩Cross-chain profiles and identities</p><p>If your hack uses an L2 or non-Ethereum chain, make sure you aren't splitting users across multiple accounts. IDX lets you <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/default/#3id-keychain">link multiple keys</a> to the same identity and profile, from any chain!</p><p>⚙Backup and sync DeFi settings on IDX</p><p>In most apps and exchanges, user settings including watched addresses, tokens, currency preferences, and contact lists are stored in local storage. A new device, browser or even cleared cache means everything is gone. Storing these in a user's identity index assures backup, multi-device support, and reusability across applications!</p> Use Ceramic as an open and auditable content store <p>🐤Mirror of Crypto Twitter onto Ceramic Network</p><p>Our community <a href="https://twitter.com/StefanDGeorge/status/1347861734716035074">has put up $15,000</a> (so far) in donations for a tool that mirrors tweets onto Ceramic Network, paving the way for a new Web3-native social conversation without the need for a mass migration off Twitter. Get started towards this at EthDenver!</p><p>🎨Mutable metadata for NFTs</p><p>NFTs are unique, but do they have to be static? Mint NFTs with metadata stored on Ceramic and the owner of the Ceramic document can change the properties of the NFT over time. &nbsp;An artist could keep updating the NFT metadata after it's minted, creating a unique evolving piece.</p><p>📝DeFi Annotations and Comments</p><p>Create a commenting system with Ceramic that lets users add notes to contracts, addresses, trades or anything else in DeFi. Managed by users directly, these notes could be accessible across any DeFi app. This could be a javascript library for apps to integrate, or a browser extension for users to add themselves.</p><p>📤Auditable discussion forums</p><p>Use Ceramic documents to create discussion forums that are auditable, flexible and decentralized. Each user can post to their own Ceramic document, with each aggregated and referenced to create the full forum. No server needed, and easy paths to a censorship resistant foundation with moderation layered on.</p> Use with other dweb tools to open up new use cases <p>✉P2P chat or comments</p><p>Use IDX with <a href="https://github.com/textileio/js-threads">Textile's js-threads</a> or another messaging protocol to build fully P2P social features that authenticate directly with a user's key and identity. You could create an embedded support bot, a DeFi trollbox, team chat tools, a "decentralized disqus", or a notification service.</p><p>🗄Ceramic as a CMS for content on IPFS, Textile or anywhere else</p><p>Ceramic's mutable documents with persistent doc IDs makes it great for managing dynamic information that is stored on IPFS or elsewhere. Use Ceramic to catalogue, index or generally manage the data used in your hack., wherever it's stored. You can publish the definition (schema, etc) of data stored in Textile or other DBs to make private data discoverable and interoperable.</p> Create tooling for decentralized identity and data <p>🗺Ceramic document explorer</p><p>Create a way to visualize and explore the documents that exist on Ceramic. This could focus on the available <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/glossary/#definition">definitions</a> that have ben created, all Ceramic documents, individual user identity indexes, or anything else. We'd love to see how you'd like to explore the network!</p><p>🖇New crypto or social account links</p><p>The 3Box Labs <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/identitylink-services">IdentityLink service</a> provides verifications for Discord, Twitter and Github. Add one for Telegram, Matrix, Discourse or a KYC provider.</p><p>Or add support for a new blockchain. Ceramic can currently be authenticated by Ethereum, Filecoin, EOS, NEAR or Cosmos keys. It's <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">simple to add support</a> for your preferred chain.</p><p>🚛Import of Web2 social data to use on Web3</p><p>Many large Web2 apps now have APIs to export user data (with users' permission). Build a mass-export tool that puts valuable data into users' hands by adding it to a their identity index.

<p><br>
<a href="http://digitalgovernment.scot"></a>David McKinney, Managing Director of Local Government at Servelec, maps Scotland’s progress towards fully integrated health and social care, and discusses putting community at the heart of the country’s digital care journey.</p>
<p>In 2016, the Scottish Government legislated to bring together health and social care into a single, integrated system.</p>
<p>The legislation created 31 integration authorities who are now responsible for £8.5 billion of funding for local services. This brought about the most significant change to health and social care services in Scotland since the creation of the NHS.</p>
<p>Integration aims to ensure that services are provided in a seamless and co-ordinated way. Ultimately, it’s about securing better outcomes for people in Scotland, and the best way to achieve that is to make sure that everyone has access to the right information, in the right place, at the right time.</p>
 Serving the community needs 
<p>Public services are complex, so it’s important we work together to provide the best solutions. The very best digital care starts from a deep rooted interest in what communities need – the requirements of their citizens and the professionals and organisations who provide care for them. We must commit to joining up communities digitally by enabling connectivity between health providers, social services, education and charities, an approach with interoperable digital solutions at the heart.</p>
<p>Systems need deep domain knowledge, must be intuitive and easy to use and increasingly be as useful to citizens as they are to the professionals and organisations providing care. We need to strike the right balance between enabling access and protecting data, with a best of breed approach in an open environment where systems can talk to one another.</p>
<p>We’re pioneering this with the current implementation of the National Child Health Record in Scotland using our Rio platform. Our Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system for secondary care can be tailored to an organisation’s specific needs and supports the vision of every patient having one, fully integrated, health record. It operates across child health, mental health and community care settings and interoperates easily with other systems.</p>
 Support at a local level 
<p>The pandemic has required a rapid response from across Government, and has resulted in one of the most challenging years on record for local authorities. I’ve spent a lot of my time this last year meeting (albeit virtually) with local authority customers – learning about their challenges and common goals. It’s been remarkable to hear from teams who have implemented significant transformational change at record speed, in order to continue providing core public services during the pandemic.</p>
<p>We already provide social care systems to a number of local authorities in Scotland, via Mosaic, our case management software designed to give professionals the time and data they need to achieve more positive outcomes for people in their care. We’ve also been proud to support some of those authorities through our social value work – running digital skills workshops for young people in Dundee for example, as we recognise the importance of making a bigger societal contribution.</p>
<p>We’ve continued to support social workers by developing systems that provide them with all the information they need, at the point of care. Our Mobilise app provides the flexibility to update care records while in the community, providing frontline workers with the tools they need, wherever they are. It enables social workers to make more informed decisions, faster, helping to improve the overall quality of care and outcomes for vulnerable people. This way of working reduces duplication of effort and minimises unnecessary travel, by allowing social workers to complete work steps and update records wherever they are.</p>
 More effective digital channels 
<p>This last year, we’ve continued to work with clinicians and other care professionals in looking for improvements to health and social care systems to support communities. Especially solutions that enable citizens to increasingly take responsibility for their own care and wellbeing.</p>
<p>We’ve been developing person-centred, self-service systems, designed to help social care teams shift communication and engagement to more effective digital channels. Mosaic Portal allows people to engage with services more effectively, and offers a personalised, digital approach to social care delivery.</p>
<p>It’s a long and uncertain road ahead, but we’re excited to be part of Scotland’s digital care journey and we are committed to making integrated health and social care real by providing joined-up solutions that place people at the heart of public service provision.</p>

 Tell us a little bit about you and your role in identity?&nbsp; 
<p>I’m responsible for Identity and Access Management at GRTgaz the leading gas distribution company in Europe. As a product owner. I lead 2 teams: one for digital identity, looking after passwords, access controls, all that sort of thing. The other team works on active directories – whether it’s on premise or in the cloud. In total, we have about 5,000 people working for the company. We’re a business to business seller so our customers then distribute gas to their own customers. The global conversation about optimizing use of energy is really important, so we have a lot of innovative projects on going as we work out how to tackle climate change and become more efficient.</p>
 How did you end up in the world of identity? 
<p>I studied at university at Telecom Sud Paris. There were only a few girls in my year as, at that time, cybersecurity didn’t attract many women. I am so happy to see more and more women working in this field. Since then I’ve always worked in cybersecurity. I started out assisting our cybersecurity officers with IAM, and then got super interested in the technical side of Azure AD and how SAML and OIDC work. So I dived in and got to grips with them so I could then simplify it to teach back to my non-technical colleagues!</p>
<blockquote><p>At work, the most important thing is the people, the culture and how everyone works together, rather than the technology that you’re using to build your organisation</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone I worked with had a contagious enthusiasm for IAM. So, 4 years later here I am! When I started out here, there were loads of smaller teams that specialised in different areas of IAM – from multi-factor authentication to customer support to architecture. &nbsp;Everyone had their own objectives so it was hard to break down the silos and work together. My role was to get everyone to cooperate in delivery in order to get the maximum value for our customers. Introducing self-service was super challenging as we had to change user behaviour stopping them from always contacting the Service Desk! When I was offered the opportunity to lead a team here, I thought “Why Not??!” There are always new challenges, whether it’s new protocols or technologies, to keep me interested and busy.</p>
 What does a normal week look like? 
<p>Working across two teams I have a good mix of work. A big part at the moment is the global strategy to migrate to cloud from our on-premise infrastructure so I’m working out how to adapt our current processes, documentation and environments. I also create a lot of training videos for users and colleagues to help them use our products more efficiently. It also helps business leaders make informed decisions when investing in IAM.</p>
 Why is Women in Identity important to you? 
<p>Women are as competent as men so it’s not really a question why women are important in this field. We think through details in different ways and can challenge assumed user needs. Women in Identity provides a great opportunity to gather many voices and listen to the diverse range of experiences that women have in the IT and identity space. It’s so important to support girls to get access to training in IT – it enables them to take advantage of opportunities they wouldn’t have otherwise.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you most recommend to readers? 
<p>Whenever I have a problem I read this book 1 more time – 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey. It really helps with personal development and being more efficient in everything you do, whether it’s work or relationships. It’s not just about relations with colleagues but also maximising your time in all elements of your daily life. At work, the most important thing is the people, the culture and how everyone works together, rather than the technology that you’re using to build your organisation. You’ve got to understand that to be successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 If you were CEO of a company, what one thing would you make compulsory? 
<p>Aside from making Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) compulsory and banning shared accounts (they’re super risky!) I’d make sure I didn’t introduce change until I was sure we had explored all the alternatives. I would rather introduce changes progressively to end users. Covey’s habit “Seek first to understand than to be understood” would be my mantra: e.g. WHY do teams use shared accounts so that before banning, an alternative could be suggested.</p>
 And where would we find you when you’re not working? 
<p>Paris is such a beautiful city. I feel very lucky to live . I love cooking (and eating ). When we are allowed to do so again, I can’t wait to chill with friends in the many great bars and restaurants here in Paris. We can literally try food from kitchens from all over the world.</p>

With Ceramic and IDX, now all developers (not just ETH devs) get much more powerful and robust infrastructure that opens up a whole new set of use cases for decentralized identity and dynamic data management.</p> Evolving our approach <p>3Box was a simple, out-of-the-box solution to decentralized identity and data management. Our SDK bundled existing Web3 technologies such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, <a href="https://orbitdb.org/">OrbitDB</a>, and <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> into an opinionated, but developer-friendly API that worked with users' existing Ethereum wallets for authentication.</p><p>We always knew that abstracting existing solutions at the API layer and not solving the problem at the base protocol layer would have its inherent limitations. Over time these limitations became bottlenecks to growth, decentralization, flexibility, and performance:</p>  Performance: "Why are data syncing and load times slow?"  Persistence: "How can I guarantee my data stays available?"  Decentralization: "Why are identities stored on 3Box Inc. servers?"  Consensus: "How can we anchor identities and data on-chain?"  Multi-DID: "How can I use a different DID method?"  Multi-chain: "How can I authenticate with a non-Ethereum account?"  Multi-account: " How can I connect multiple accounts to my DID?"  Flexibility: "How can I use a different database provider?"  Customization: "How can I extend the API to do custom things?"   Moving to the Ceramic Network <p>To address the questions above and support many new capabilities, we realized we needed a completely new technology stack from the ground up. This 18-month journey led us to develop <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> to be a much more robust and flexible combination of protocols for decentralized identity and dynamic data management. </p> Ceramic: A decentralized network for mutable content <p><a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> is a public, permissionless, censorship-resistant network for managing mutable content on the open internet. By combining IPFS, libp2p, blockchain, DIDs, and authenticated data standards, Ceramic gives developers the ability to build completely serverless applications using dynamic, verifiable, decentralized data. </p><p>Ceramic functions like a global-scale, permissionless NoSQL document database, but guarantees data integrity and ensures strict ordering of document updates by anchoring these updates in a blockchain. Ceramic does not require DB servers or trusted third-parties to host data and perform mutations on content.

 IDX: A protocol for cross-chain decentralized identity <p><a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a cross-chain protocol and SDK for decentralized identity and interoperable user data. IDX allows developers to attach any kind of data to a user, discover all of a user's data in one place, and share data between applications. </p><p>Unlike 3Box which only offered OrbitDB storage and Ethereum-based authentication, IDX can be used with any kind of datastore such as Ceramic, Textile, OrbitDB, Filecoin, IPFS, Sia, Arweave, blockchain registries, or even centralized databases and supports authentication from any kind of Web3 wallet. </p><p>IDX is great for associating user profiles, portable social graphs, reputation scores, verifiable claims, user-generated content, application data, settings, domain names, blockchain addresses, and social Web2 accounts to a user in a decentralized way. </p><a href="https://idx.xyz">  IDX: Identity protocol for open applications  IDX is an open source multi-platform identity protocol that allows users to build up a unified digital identity and freely share their data between apps.      </a> Available on Testnet now <p>You don't have to wait to get started building on all of these new tools. Last week Ceramic officially <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">launched the Clay Testnet</a> and at the same time, IDX went into beta.</p><p>Mainnet will be progressively rolled out over the coming months, beginning with a soft launch for interested projects and then proceeding to a full public release some time after that. If you're interested in deploying your project on the Ceramic mainnet as part of the soft launch, <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">reach out on Discord</a>.</p> Supporting the Ceramic ecosystem <p>Ceramic and IDX are decentralized protocols which are independent from 3Box Labs. However 3Box Labs is committed to supporting the Ceramic ecosystem along three key pillars:</p>  Core protocol development  Standards, developer tooling, core applications  Ecosystem development   Core protocol development <p>3Box Labs develops and maintains the Ceramic <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">JavaScript implementation</a>. If you're interested in writing a client in a new language, reach out in the <a href="https://discord.gg/GXPrjW3qvF">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Standards, developer tooling, and core applications <p>The use cases for Ceramic are virtually endless. While this is a positive for the long-term prospects of the network, it is important that a few key use cases are built out early on so developers can immediately use Ceramic without needing to wait for use cases to organically emerge. 3Box Labs is committed to developing decentralized identity tooling on Ceramic, and here's what we've created so far.</p>  <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">IDX SDK</a>: 3Box labs maintains the IDX JavaScript SDK which makes it easy to add IDX to your application. The IDX SDK is the replacement to the 3Box SDK.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-method">3ID DID method</a>: A W3C-compliant DID method that uses Ceramic documents as decentralized, mutable DID documents. 3ID is great for end-user IDs. Ceramic-based 3IDs are the decentralized replacement to current 3Box 3IDs stored on 3Box servers.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-provider-or-wallet">3ID Connect</a>: An authentication system for Ceramic that works with all blockchain wallets. 3ID Connect currently supports Ethereum, Cosmos, Filecoin, Polkadot, and EOS with others such as Near and Flow coming soon. This version of 3ID Connect is the cross-chain, Ceramic-compatible replacement to the 3ID Connect currently used in 3Box.  Community infrastructure: 3Box Labs provides free and open access to hosted Ceramic nodes so developers can interact with the network during prototyping and development without needing to run their own node. The <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/#setup">endpoints</a> for these nodes can be found in the Ceramic documentation.  Self.ID (coming soon): A web UI that allows users to manage IDX records for their DID, such as a basic profile, Web2 account links, and Web3 address links from different blockchains. Self.ID will be the sequel to the <a href="https://3box.io/login">3Box profiles hub</a>.   <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/identitylink-services">IdentityLink</a>: A service that issues verifiable credentials which link a user's DID to their Web2 social accounts. 3Box Labs has funded the development of IdentityLink, and will run an instance of the service for anyone to use. Alternatively, you can also run your own IdentityLink.  <p>If you're interested in building out standards and tooling for identity or new use cases, reach out in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Ecosystem development <p>As a nascent protocol, Ceramic needs a lot of support in developing a vibrant ecosystem. 3Box Labs is committed to: developing strategic partnerships, use cases, and collaborations between Ceramic and other projects and ecosystems; funding community development work in the form of bounties and grants; providing Ceramic with financial support until there are self-sustaining token economics on the network; supporting developers through documentation, examples, and educational materials; engaging web standards bodies (i.e. W3C, DIF, IETF, blockchain foundations); and of course, memes and marketing. 😻</p><p>If you're interested in any of the opportunities above, reach out in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Migrating from 3Box <p>If you're currently using 3Box in your project, you'll want to skim through this related post which outlines various upgrade paths for migrating to Ceramic and IDX.</p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/migrating-from-3box-to-ceramic-and-idx/">  Upgrading from 3Box to Ceramic and IDX  3Box Labs is sunsetting its current line of 3Box products. Learn how to migrate your integration to Ceramic and IDX.  The Ceramic BlogMichael Sena    </a> FAQs  How will Ceramic be governed? <p>Ceramic is already 100% open source, peer-to-peer software and anyone can participate in the network by simply running a Ceramic node. Formal governance of the network will progressively decentralize over time, eventually exiting to the community and a standalone foundation once a token is introduced.</p> Will Ceramic have a native token? <p>Ceramic does not currently have a native token, and one will not be present upon mainnet launch. In time, it is reasonable to assume token economics will be added to the network.</p> What is the relationship between 3Box Labs and Ceramic? <p>While 3Box Labs are the original inventors of the Ceramic Network and have been integral to bootstrapping the Ceramic ecosystem, we're committed to migrating Ceramic to an independently-governed foundation and stepping back to play a reduced role over time. In a way, 3Box Labs is just like any other contributor to an early stage protocol.</p> What is the corporate structure of 3Box Labs? <p>3Box Labs is a US corporation registered in Delaware with employees and contractors located across the US and Europe.</p> What is the business model of 3Box Labs? <p>There is no charge for the software that we produce. The 3Box Labs organization is able to sustain ourselves and fund development of the Ceramic ecosystem through the generous backing of some of Web3's most active and committed investors, including <a href="https://placeholder.vc">Placeholder</a>, <a href="https://www.coinfund.io/">CoinFund</a>, <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/crypto/">Collabfund Cryptocurrency</a>, <a href="http://consensys.com">Consensys</a>, <a href="https://dcg.co/">Digital Currency Group (DCG)</a>, <a href="http://venrock.com">Venrock</a>, <a href="http://northzone.com">Northzone</a>, <a href="https://underscore.vc/">Underscore</a>, <a href="http://protocol.ai">Protocol Labs</a>, and many more who have made equity investments into 3Box Labs. Once Ceramic has a token, 3Box Labs will maintain a modest percent of network tokens. Investors with equity in 3Box Labs will retain a proportion of the 3Box Labs allotment of network tokens. To date, there have been no direct investments in Ceramic Network but there may be an upcoming opportunity for that.</p> How can I get involved? <p>There are many ways to get involved.

<p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/3box-labs-a-future-on-ceramic-network/">3Box Labs is sunsetting 3Box products</a> in favor of the new and more powerful combination of <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>. In this post we provide a timeline and various upgrade paths for projects currently using 3Box. </p><p>To learn more about Ceramic, IDX, and the reasons behind the transition, read our previous post:</p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/3box-labs-a-future-on-ceramic-network/">  3Box is now 3Box Labs – A path forward on Ceramic Network  In this big announcement, we share that 3Box is becoming 3Box Labs to reflect a new focus on the development of the Ceramic Network ecosystem.  The Ceramic BlogMichael Sena    </a> Timeline <p>Ceramic and IDX are currently live on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a>, but since it's a testnet they're not yet suitable for production deployments. In the next month or two, we will open a soft launch of the Ceramic mainnet to select partners that require more immediate production deployments. This would include current 3Box integrations. Some time after that, mainnet will be opened to the general public.</p><p>We encourage all 3Box developers to begin their setting up and testing their migrations to Ceramic and IDX on the Clay testnet as soon as possible, and reach out to us on the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> if you would like your project to be included in the mainnet soft launch.</p><p>Starting today we will begin formally deprecating 3Box products, but we won't immediately turn them off. Some reasonable amount of time after Ceramic mainnet is opened to the general public, we will disconnect the 3Box servers to complete the transition. Your application will need to be migrated to Ceramic and IDX by that date (TBA) or risk losing access to current 3Box data.</p> Upgrade paths by 3Box product  Profiles API <p>All 40,000+ 3Box profiles will be migrated to IDX. Standard 3Box profile data will now be stored in three different <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/overview/#record">IDX records</a>. Basic profile fields such as those available in the 3Box Profiles app (<code>name</code>, <code>image</code>, <code>background</code>, <code>emoji</code>, etc.) will be stored in a <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/default/#basic-profile">basicProfile</a></code> record. Social verifications (<code>twitter</code>, <code>github</code>) will be stored in an <code>aka</code> record. Links to blockchain accounts will be stored in a <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/default/#crypto-accounts">cryptoAccounts</a></code> record.</p><p>If your application is only reading data from the 3Box profiles API, your migration is very simple. The existing 3Box profiles API will continue to work for both legacy profiles stored on 3Box and also for new and/or migrated profiles stored on IDX with no change needed. Eventually though, you will want to upgrade to <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">js-idx</a></code> and use the <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/reading/">idx.get()</a></code> method for reading basic profiles, social verifications, and crypto account links stored on IDX. This pattern will be mandatory once we disable the 3Box API service.</p><p>The migration of the three profile data sets mentioned above will automatically occur behind the scenes the first time a user logs in to any application that uses <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-provider-or-wallet">3ID Connect</a>. For this reason, we recommend adding 3ID Connect to your sign-in flow even if you do not need to write data to IDX. This will ensure that the profiles for all of your users are migrated during the migration window.</p><p>If your application is setting or modifying standard data in a user profile, then you should upgrade from <code>3box-js</code> to <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">js-idx</a></code> and use the <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/writing/">idx.set()</a></code> method to write to any of the profile data sets mentioned above.</p><p>If your application is storing custom, non-standard data in a user profile or if you created an app-specific profile in a 3Box Space, you will need to manually perform a migration for this data set. First, you need to create a <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/creating/">custom definition</a> for your data set. Then, the next time a given user logs in to your site (ideally using <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-provider-or-wallet">3ID Connect</a> so their standard profile data gets automatically migrated), you need to query their profile from the 3Box API, extract your custom data from their profile, then store this data in an IDX record using <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/writing/">idx.set()</a></code>.</p> Profiles App <p>The <a href="https://3box.io/login">3Box Profiles app</a>, which provides a simple UI for creating and managing profiles, will eventually be replaced by Self.ID built on Ceramic and IDX. In the meantime, 3Box Hub can continue to be used since all data will be migrated to IDX. Once Self.ID is live on Ceramic mainnet and using 3ID Connect for authentication, we will launch a marketing campaign to get users to sign in which will migrate their standard profiles to IDX.</p> Spaces and Threads APIs <p>Projects using 3Box spaces and threads APIs for storage and messaging will now need to replicate this functionality in their application using a combination of IDX for identity and either Ceramic documents or other datastores (such as Textile, OrbitDB, SkyDB, etc.) for content storage. </p><p>If you are storing simple JSON content in your space, then we recommend creating a <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/creating/">custom definition</a> for your data model, and using the <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/writing/">idx.set()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/reading/">idx.get()</a></code> methods for interacting with it. For migrating existing data, you should query the data using the 3Box spaces API, then write it to an IDX record after the user has authenticated.</p><p>If you are storing large volumes of data in a space, have high transaction throughput, require encryption, or are using messaging, then there are many nuances and directions your integration could take depending on your specific use case. We'd recommend joining the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> for assistance with your migration.</p> Plugins <p>3Box UI plugins including Comments, Chatbox, and Profile Hover will be deprecated without replacement. We understand this is less than optimal for existing projects, but we as a team have limited capacity to continue maintaining these with a high bar for quality. Since these components are just a thin UI, these functionalities can easily be replicated by adding IDX and Ceramic to your project and coding some simple HTML/CSS.</p> Hosting <p>3Box Labs has provided free hosting and persistence for data stored in 3Box. Moving forward, things will be a bit different due to the decentralized nature of Ceramic.</p><p>For historical 3Box data, 3Box Labs will continue to host and persist this content until some reasonable amount of time (TBA) after Ceramic mainnet has launched. This gives you a chance to upgrade your application and replicate the data of your users to Ceramic and IDX. After the migration window is over, we will be turning off our 3Box servers.</p><p>For new data stored in Ceramic and IDX, 3Box Labs will offer a few free hosted node options:</p>  3Box Labs node: A full Ceramic node that persists the profile data of users who automatically perform their profile migration via 3ID Connect (from any app) and users who manage their profile data in the Self.ID app.   Community gateway: A read-only Ceramic node.  Community dev node: A full Ceramic node used for prototyping and development, but does not guarantee data persistence. It will be wiped from time to time beginning at mainnet launch.  The endpoints for the gateway and dev node can be found in the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/#setup">Ceramic</a> and <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/#set-your-ceramic-node">IDX</a> docs.  <p>If you are building a production application and need to persist data on Ceramic and IDX, it is recommended that you either run your own Ceramic node or utilize a third-party node hosting service for persisting your data. We are engaging with various hosting providers to offer Ceramic nodes, and we expect these to be available over time.</p> What to expect from 3Box products during this transition <p>We are quickly working towards a mainnet release of Ceramic so you can begin to utilize this new powerful infrastructure as soon as possible. However it is likely that you may experience various issues with existing 3Box services in the meantime, such as slowness, loading, syncing issues, or log-in/browser compatibility. We deeply apologize for these inconveniences. The reality is many of these issues are out of our control and are caused from underlying technology dependencies. Normally, we would be working to fix these as soon as possible, but in this case the most impactful thing we can do is ship Ceramic mainnet faster. These are some of the reasons we're excited to move to this new Ceramic-based architecture.</p>  Questions or support? <p>We're always available to answer any questions and help you through this transition. Reach out to us in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> for assistance.</p>

		<p>Growing up in New Jersey, Lora Billings always had a passion for math and physics, viewing the subject matter as fun puzzles to solve. She carried that interest into her higher education and was the first in her family to go to graduate school, and then later receiving her Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics. “I studied chaos theory and dynamical systems,” shares Billings, Dean of the College of Science and Mathematics, and Professor of Applied Mathematics, Montclair State University. “These disciplines gave me the foundation to develop new mathematical tools and modeling complex systems that helped me understand and predict real world questions.”</p>
<p>Billings later became a National Science Foundation (NSF) Program Director where she gained a deeper knowledge of grants and best practices from other institutions. “The NSF is a unique and fantastic place to work,” says Billings. “The organization is filled with brilliant people dedicated to advancing the sciences. I was immersed in a consensus-building culture that identifies areas with high impact potential and choosing the most promising people to conduct research.” Through her NSF experience, Billings received a crash course in administration, specifically in the areas of policies, transparency, and ethics. “As a leader of any institution, these three areas are essential. While at the NSF, I learned how to manage people, budgets, and challenging workloads with short deadlines. That experience helped me later build a fantastic team at Montclair State with the same determination to do right by the University and support our mission of empowering students and faculty. Since Montclair State is growing in research status, we are continuing to build the necessary infrastructure to fully realize our potential. My experience at the NSF gave me the perspective of how to accomplish the impossible and identifying the potential in people who can help you get there.”</p>
<p>Paving the Way<br>
As the first woman to hold the position as Dean of the College of Science and Mathematics in Montclair State’s 110-year history, Billings says she has always worked to remove the stereotypes surrounding mathematicians and scientists. “We need increased professional development in academia and improved infrastructure. I am truly inspired by our University president, Dr. Susan Cole.&nbsp; Especially in the last six months, she has demonstrated how important providing steady confidence and informed decision-making is for leaders. She has shown us that we will persevere and emerge from this pandemic a bit different, but we will be stronger.&nbsp; While some people like Dr. Cole are natural leaders, others may need a push. Studies have shown women often need that extra encouragement to step into a leadership role.” Billings says organizations need to create a supportive and inclusive environment for all leaders where confidence and vision are built into academica. “We must move beyond gender and promote people from a variety of backgrounds and experiences; I am proud that Montclair State has broken these barriers and allows people, no matter their demographics, to come together and accomplish great things.”</p>
<p>As a proud partner of the NSF Program, the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP), Montclair State has long been a promoter of diversity in STEM and advocating on behalf of underserved populations. “The University has a history of prioritizing access to education and was recently designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI),” shares Billings. “We recruit a diverse student population, including first-generation, economically disadvantaged, and urban students. These graduates can help enrich the faculty pipeline and later serve as role models and mentors for other students.”</p>

		<p>Promoting STEM<br>
Helping students succeed by guiding their trajectories is a core part of Montclair State’s mission. Along with faculty members, both undergraduate and graduate students conduct groundbreaking research across multiple disciplines. “Since math is a universal language, I’ve had the privilege of working with students from a variety of backgrounds,” shares Billings. “Along with math majors, I’ve worked with physicists and biology students. One of my most successful students started as a high school math teacher. He returned to Montclair State to earn his master’s degree and worked with me on my first epidemiology research in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University. He was able to explore mathematical biology and how data can impact real-world modeling. This student later received his Ph.D. from the University of Arizona and now works for the Critical Path Institute’s C-Path quantitative medicine team to streamline research to produce new and improved vaccines and treatments for rare diseases.”</p>
<p>Two years ago, Billings was invited to the U.S. Embassy in Brazil to speak to mathematical biologists and promote STEM. During this trip, she toured universities and the cities of Rio, São Paulo, and Recife to encourage underrepresented youth to attend graduate school and become scientific leaders and innovators. “I am dedicated to increasing the involvement of students from all walks of life in STEM research,” says Billings. “These future generations will continue to make life-changing discoveries and propel research forward.”</p>
<p>Billings’ most recent research focuses on modeling stochastic complex systems in ecology and epidemiology and studying uncertainty in systems that can cause unexpected or rare events. “My colleague, Eric Forgoston, who is in the Applied Math and Statistics department, is currently working with me in ecology,” says Billings. “We have an NSF grant through the Division of Mathematical Sciences’ Mathematical Biology Program. Our joint project includes colleagues from the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, and we are looking at extensions in ecology and population extinctions, which is a confluence of events where things can die out in an unexpected way.&nbsp; The research measures the robustness of a model system that has unexpected change.”</p>
<p>In her current research, Billings hopes to create a way for scientists to predict the risk of of a major event and get the word out to society, similar to an early warning system. “Just a prediction is not enough, we need to carefully communicate and understand how people accept this type of information,” explains Billings. “The goal is to understand the risk of unexpected events, like climate change for example, and the interconnectedness of certain environments and species. If we predict how a species can either die out or conversely, invade another population and thrive; society must then be willing to act in a way to change that pathway of that food web.”</p>
<p>Advocates for Science and Research<br>
Collaboration in academia and research is a key force behind actionable science and determining how to translate theoretical results into achievable actions. “Partnering with other institutions, both inside and outside our industry, helps us identify what problems we’re facing, what the needs are outside of academia, and how academia can help provide needed solutions,” says Billings. “Like my fellow members of the EdgeDiscovery Advisory Council, I hope to serve as an ambassador in advancing EdgeDiscovery initiatives by bringing my own experience and insight to the group and helping create a community where we can learn and grow together.”</p>
<p>From providing educational tools for researchers and students to offering access to advanced computing resources, EdgeDiscovery is delivering the next generation of research technology to empower institutions both large and small. “Colleges and universities can create programs to train students in the skillsets that are most needed in the workforce,” says Billings. “In academia, we need to help guide students to their careers and make these opportunities known.” EdgeDiscovery offers testbeds for experimentation and training and shows member institutions how to integrate technology, like virtual labs, into their curriculum—preparing the next generation of researchers. “We need to find a better way to communicate research initiatives and the importance of science to the greater community,” says Billings. “The Advisory Council is providing a platform to get the word out and not only creating an impact among students and researchers, but allowing our voices to be heard across the state; helping us influence positive change on a grander scale.”</p>

		<p>Joining Forces to Advance Institutional Research<br>
Computing is an essential component of research and education across a variety of fields, especially those involving data-intensive science. Many small, mid-sized, and under-resourced campuses have compelling science research and education activities that would benefit from better access to advanced cyberinfrastructure (the combination of advanced computing and data storage systems with knowledgeable people, all connected by fast networks). However, they lack the necessary in-house expertise to make use of it. Without this expertise, researchers at these institutions must navigate a complex and daunting set of choices and decisions without guidance, particularly when the required resources are outside of their campus environments.</p>
<p>Networks and regional collaborations, such as the Eastern Regional Network (ERN), aim to simplify multi-campus collaborations and partnerships that help advance the frontiers of research and innovation. Through a partnership of educational institutions, research facilities, regional network providers, and Internet2, the ERN is committed to providing layered and transparent access to shared data and computing facilities. “Regional network providers play a significant role as facilitators and user support for the smaller institutions,” says Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, Edge. “For example, Edge uses a collaborative network to enable conversations across member institutions to leverage existing relevant shared resources to support researchers and help identify joint funding opportunities.”</p>
<p>Helping to Bridge the Gap for Research Computing Expertise<br>
As researchers become more reliant on the use of massive amounts of data and sophisticated computing techniques such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, the demand for experts who can wield these tools effectively has grown considerably. “The Cyberteam to Advance Research and Education in Eastern Regional Schools (CAREERS) program, led by Yale University, is a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant for approximately $1.4 million that is convening seven institutions around initiatives to strengthen the research computing career pipeline,” shares Ghahramani. “The goal is to increase the availability of Research Computing Facilitators (RCFs) who can collaborate with researchers and provide this support to underserved institutions.”</p>
<p>RCFs play an important role in the research community and are critical to the successful utilization of cyberinfrastructure.&nbsp; Equipped with expert knowledge and experience, RCFs help improve the performance of scientific workflows, assist projects that require large scale computer systems, and offer guidance to researchers who are adopting new software tools. Unfortunately, RCFs are in short supply. Programs like CAREERS are trying to solve this problem, while also raising awareness and interest regarding this rewarding career path.</p>
<p>Dr. Andrew H. Sherman serves as the lead Principal Investigator for CAREERS and works with researchers to address their computing needs. “As an RCF, I help bridge the gap between computing resources and tools and the scientists conducting the research,” says Sherman, Senior Research Scientist and the Director of Arts &amp; Sciences Computational Research Support at the Yale Center for Research Computing (YCRC). “My group helps researchers in a variety of disciplines, including physical and social sciences, engineering, and forestry. A significant challenge for high-performance computing (HPC) on a national and international scale is the lack of facilitators. Often, researchers who are excellent theoreticians or laboratory scientists may lack the computing expertise that would allow them to take full advantage of advanced cyberinfrastructure to accelerate their research.”</p>
<p>Along with Yale, CAREER’s anchor institutions include the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC), Penn State University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Rutgers University, University of Delaware, and University of Rhode Island. “The genesis of this program was to identify ways to not only increase the number of RCFs, but address diversity and inclusion,” shares Sherman. “CAREERS aims to promote the field as a potential career to students with an interest in both computers and the sciences, particularly focusing on finding potential RCFs at small-to-medium sized schools, where there hasn’t been as much exposure to advanced research computing.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		        
	 
		    
			 
				
 
	 
		 “Our hope is to find ways for schools, both large and small, to access the kind of computing expertise they need, without having to invest in full-time positions. I think this is an important model for the future and allows for more institutions to leverage facilitators to meet a broad and diverse research need.”

		<p>Advancing Computing Education<br>
The CAREERS Cyberteam is collaborating closely with the Northeast Cyberteam. Launched in 2017 with NSF funding, the Northeast Cyberteam aims to make advanced computing more accessible to researchers at smaller institutions in Northern New England that do not have critical mass to support these resources on campus. Both the Northeast and CAREERS Cyberteams are addressing the need for qualified support staff by building a pool of RCFs and a process by which they can be shared across institutional boundaries. “The regional networks—for example Edge in New Jersey—can advance the missions of programs such as the Northeast and CAREERS Cyberteams in at least two ways. First, they can raise awareness among their member institutions of local, regional, and national research computing resources, including not only high performance computing centers, but also organizations like the Cyberteams that provide training, mentoring, and consultation. And, second, they can help identify research projects at smaller, less research- oriented institutions that may benefit from the Cyberteams’ activities,” explains Sherman.</p>
<p>Anchored by MGHPCC, University of New Hampshire, University of Maine, and University of Vermont, the Northeast Cyberteam is working to advance academic research and create new opportunities for students and faculty. “When we started to make computing resources available to research and education programs outside of the MHGPCC consortium, we quickly found that a key ingredient for success was the research computing facilitators who bridge the space between the scientists and the technology. The Northeast Cyberteam has proven to be a very effective way to meet that need,” shared John Goodhue, the Principal Investigator for the Northeast Cyberteam and Executive Director of MGHPCC. The MGHPCC is a data center and consortium that serves more than 20,000 researchers, students, and educators at Boston University, Harvard University, MIT, Northeastern University, the University of Massachusetts, and other institutions in the Northeast. “The Northeast Cyberteam launched forty-two projects over the last three years at small and medium sized institutions in northern New England,” shares Julie Ma, Program Manager, Northeast and CAREERS Cyberteams. “For each of these projects, we found a student facilitator to pair with a researcher that had a problem that needed to be solved. Students do not necessarily need to be versed in the particular domain. Instead, a mentor with domain expertise is paired with the student to provide subject matter expertise and also model how to be an effective facilitator. We want students to be able to jump between domains and learn how to use their computational expertise to help move the science forward.” Through this process, the student will learn to be an advisor to help the researcher understand what computational resources are available and how to use these tools on their project.</p>
<p>“Students can train to be a facilitator at a small institution, but pair with a mentor at one of the MGHPCC or anchor institutions,” says Ma. “The mentor will help the student learn about the domain science, as well as teach them the skills needed in the RCF profession. Like CAREERS, our mission also included an emphasis on increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion, by recruiting students with diverse backgrounds.” Leveraging the Northeast Cyberteam’s model for giving students hands-on RCF experience, CAREERS is pairing RCFs with students to offer guidance in effectively working and communicating with their researchers. “In the beginning, student facilitators do not have all the information they need,” says Sherman. “The mentor role brings in people who are professional RCFs from the anchor institutions and pairs them with students working on research projects. The students not only help the researcher advance their research projects, but they also learn about advanced computing and hopefully get excited about the field—later becoming RCFs themselves.”</p>
<p>Along with the Northeast Cyberteam, CAREERS is working to develop a network of RCFs of varying specialties throughout universities in the region, creating a comprehensive and cost-effective RCF program for a large network of institutions. “Our hope is to find ways for schools, both large and small, to access the kind of computing expertise they need, without having to invest in full-time positions,” says Sherman. “I think this is an important model for the future and allows for more institutions to leverage facilitators to meet a broad and diverse research need.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		        
	 
		    
			 
				
 
	 
		 “We wanted to expand our portal to support groups like CAREERS, and simultaneously grow the network of mentors that were registered in the portal,” says Ma. “As a result, the Northeast Cyberteam also invited other cyberteams from the NSF-funded Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program to use the platform as a management tool for their related programs.”

		<p>Increasing Access to Cyberinfrastructure Resources<br>
As part of their operations, the Northeast Cyberteam built the Cyberteam Portal to help keep track of project workflows, and all the facilitators and their associated expertise and skillset. In spring 2020, the Northeast Cyberteam Steering Committee came to a realization that the portal could be a useful tool to connect other groups with similar goals. “We wanted to expand our portal to support groups like CAREERS, and simultaneously grow the network of mentors that were registered in the portal,” says Ma. “As a result, the Northeast Cyberteam also invited other cyberteams from the NSF-funded Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program to use the platform as a management tool for their related programs. In July 2020, we rolled out a pilot program where seven cyberteams, each with a personalized view into the database, began to explore the use of the portal to manage their workflows, while building a common network of mentors that stretches across the country. We recently added the Campus Champions community of practice to the mix, and added features to support affinity groups which connect individuals throughout the community with common goals and objectives.”</p>
<p>Moving forward, the Northeast Cyberteam is working to make the expanded portal, now dubbed Connect.Cyberinfrastructure.org, available to other members of the research computing community.</p>
<p>Supporting Inclusion and Equity<br>
Building upon the success of the NSF-funded Internet2 Broadening the Reach: A Cyberinfrastructure Program for Non-Research-Intensive and Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Institutions, the ERN has formed a Broadening the Reach (BTR) working group, co-led by Forough Ghahramani and John Hicks, Network Research Engineer at Internet2. “This group is focused on learning from the community about the challenges faced by institutions and to identify the necessary support needed,” shares Ghahramani. “An ERN BTR workshop scheduled for later this fall will bring together representatives from the small, mid-sized, and under-resourced schools in the Northeast, including Minority Serving Institutions (MSI), Hispanic-serving institutions (HSI), and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), along with regional and national cyberinfrastructure experts. The goal is to improve the ERN’s understanding of how best to support under-resourced academic institutions in the region.” The ERN BTR workshop is one of several workshops planned as part of the ERN’s NSF-sponsored CC* CI-Research Alignment (CRIA).</p>
<p>As the complexity of societal challenges continues to grow, the need for advanced cyberinfrastructure and collaboration will increase as well. Finding new opportunities to support the people, resources, networks, and data that make up the connective cyberinfrastructure fabric will be essential to keeping innovation and discovery in motion. Through a unified commitment across the education community to help each other learn and grow, future generations are given the strong foundation they need to enter the workforce and drive positive change throughout the world.</p>

		<p>Dr. David Belanger’s background in research runs deep, with extensive experience building and maintaining exceptional research organizations. For 15 years, Belanger was Vice President of Information, Software, and Systems Research at AT&amp;T Labs. As Chief Scientist, he led research in computer science, data management, and analysis and visualization of data. Belanger’s career also includes 17 years at Bell Labs and 10 as head of research in software systems and engineering. This impressive experience has helped Belanger in his current role as Senior Lecturer at Stevens Institute of Technology and has allowed him to make a significant impact in helping Stevens grow a very small data analytic organization into a first-class program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Belanger has also explored applications among the areas of fraud, service/network operations, marketing, and mobility, and uses these insights to enrich the program at Stevens. One aspect that has most defined Belanger’s career, both industrially and at Stevens, is scale. “The research we conducted in software engineering at Bell Labs was about large-scale software and how to do that in a better way,” shares Belanger. “The research conducted in software systems and information was determining how to deal with very large-scale data and obtaining the maximum value of that information. The primary course I teach at Stevens, called Big Data Technologies, is chiefly about the various aspects of dealing with large amounts of data and creating a process that works day in and day out.”</p>
<p>From his many years in the research industry, Belanger has recognized the significant importance of data. “Currently, I am trying to put together a very complete set of data that students can use from the time they enter Stevens, through the time they leave. This early availability of data will give students a complete feeling of how you collect and use data, from acquiring, cleaning, integrating, and managing this information, as well as incorporating artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and putting data into production. Data goes beyond learning the algorithms. The real insight lies in understanding the entire data pipeline and lifecycle and creating value from data.”</p>
<p>Creating More Value from Data<br>
While at AT&amp;T Labs, Belanger created the AT&amp;T Research InfoLab, with a mission of creating more value from data and interactively analyzing and visualizing AT&amp;T’s communication networks and services. “In 1995, the company concluded we had immense amounts of data and that data could be used to gain value in a variety of ways, not only in managing the network and the various services we had, but in looking at fraud, security, and marketing,” explains Belanger. “Two of the key learnings from this mission are the importance of solving the right problems and gathering a broad array of data. In many ways, our early exploration in the InfoLab was a precursor to what much of the data world looks like today.”</p>
<p>Belanger’s rich research experience has also revealed the importance of having the right thought process. “Both my training as a mathematician and my experience as an industrial researcher have taught me a certain type of thought process: sitting down and determining how you should think about a problem before actually diving in. This approach has served me well and I try to pass this advice on to my students.” In addition to technical skills, Belanger emphasizes that soft skills are equally essential for students entering the workforce. “Organizations hiring graduates not only expect data analytic skills, but are looking for how these individuals interact in teams, work with management, and are involved in the governance of data. I know the abilities that I have liked to see in the people I hired, so I try to instill those skills in my students.”</p>
<p>Promoting Student Engagement<br>
Through state-of-the-art laboratories, world-renowned faculty, and cutting-edge research programs, Stevens offers a hands-on learning environment for the next generation of innovators. Belanger says students who intend to become data researchers, analysts, or engineers must first love the process of data analysis and the life cycle. “Since they will be fully immersed in this field for several years, students need to enjoy the data process and be inquisitive about the cycle and how to improve this process. I try to engage students in as many actual experiences as possible. Most courses will include extra-long team projects where students work on either a problem that has been introduced to us by a company, perhaps with data from that organization, or using other real-world data to solve problems. This provides the most realistic view of the data cycle from beginning to end.”</p>
<p>Stevens also provides students access to facilities that are close to real-life situations that they will encounter in the workforce. Over the last several years, Belanger’s courses have incorporated using cloud facilities, specifically AWS Educate, to give students access to the Cloud. “Students can access the latest in modern software systems and hardware systems for use with clusters of computers, for instance,” shares Belanger. “They are not only expected to use these resources, but most importantly, look at high-performance computing with a critical eye and measure performance under various conditions and scales.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to new advances in data and analytics, the financial industry is quickly changing, with fintech becoming an exploding field. The Hanlon Financial Systems Center at Stevens is helping researchers and students explore the complex global financial system and conduct calculations, modeling, and future-oriented research that can provide real-world applications in business. The technology within the Hanlon lab facilities gives students hands-on experience with the tools that will continue to drive change in the world of finance.</p>
<p>Through Edge, Stevens has access to a server with Edge network flow data—providing a test bed for Belanger and his students. “Edge has provided access to real data that comes from a real network in close to real time,” explains Belanger. “Through this opportunity, we are able to expose students to this data and show them how to use streaming data. We’re showing students how to understand what data is actually saying before applying several powerful algorithms. Secondly, student teams will spend their graduate school career looking at this data and see what information they can draw through analysis. This server access will be an incredible resource for both academics and research.”</p>
<p>Diving into the Framework<br>
The rapid pace of technological advancement has sent a ripple effect across many industries, causing the world of research and innovation to significantly grow and transform. “As technology evolves, the tools you might learn in school may not be the tools you’re using a decade later,” says Belanger. “Because of this evolving dynamic, we teach our students four things: (1) learn how to use the best of current technology, (2) learn the framework of why that technology is the way it is, how the technology was developed, and what the limitations might be, (3) learn management of the data ecosystem, including the software system that goes around all of these technologies and tools, and (4) understand theory and the evolution of technology in this area.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Belanger says we are in a time where there are many new tools and technologies constantly entering the market, where some will become market leaders and others will disappear or become niches. “For students, the real skill is not learning a list of fifty tools that roughly do the same thing; the key is to be able to put together a framework that understands how these tools fit into what you ultimately need to do to create value and try to understand whether these tools will be crucial in this space going forward.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping an open mind about a new tool is also essential, even if there are features or capabilities that may seem unnecessary at the time. For instance, in regards to Big Data, Belanger tells his students that this area is all about doing things that people previously thought were either too hard, too expensive, or just plain impossible. “We need to look at new tools and technologies with a mindset of whether they can allow us to accomplish things that we never thought possible.”&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Giving a Voice to Computing and Engineering<br>
Belanger is co-chair of the IEEE Big Data Community and leads the IEEE DataPort project. The IEEE is the world’s largest technical professional organization for the advancement of technology and aims to be a trusted global voice for computing, engineering, and technology information. “The IEEE DataPort project comes from my belief in the central role of data and the need for researchers and engineers to have more quality data that would be beneficial not only in analytics, but is helpful to society,” says Belanger. “IEEE is the leading technical professional society in the world, with a global reach. To support the exchange of technical knowledge and information, IEEE Dataport is connected to over 100 IEEE technical journals and the IEEE DataPort platform provides a way for researchers and data analysts to retain, manage, and share valuable research data.”</p>
<p>The IEEE DataPort platform currently has over 500,000 global users and over 1,600 datasets, offering free uploads of any dataset up to 2TB. “A crucial advantage of this platform is that the IEEE DataPort allows research reproducibility, where researchers can test and possibly extend the research of another person,” shares Belanger. “Another unique advantage is we have an editor in charge of the metadata for the IEEE DataPort who ensures the quality of the metadata being contributed is consistent with what would go into a technical journal. We’re treating data much like a publication, so if you put a dataset on the IEEE DataPort, you will receive a digital object identifier (DOI), giving you credit for producing papers and quality data and providing you with global exposure.”</p>
<p>Stevens Institute of Technology, IEEE, Edge, and Belanger are all members of the New Jersey Big Data Alliance (NJBDA) which helps foster collaboration among state academia, industry, and government and aims to advance computing and data analytics capabilities and expertise. “Edge and NJBDA have very deep roots in the various technical communities of New Jersey, with Edge providing the network services and parts of the infrastructure,” says Belanger. “In parallel, IEEE has both global reach and local chapters in New Jersey. All NJBDA members want to expand the range and access of technology and offer more career opportunities to a wider variety of people, both in New Jersey and beyond.” Belanger currently leads NJBDA’s entrepreneurial section activity to identify how the alliance can help support entrepreneurs and startups within the New Jersey area. “Edge is an important part of this mission, with Dr. Forough Ghahramani being very active in this entrepreneurial activity,” says Belanger.</p>
<p>Increasing the Momentum of Technology<br>
As an active member of the EdgeDiscovery Advisory Council, Belanger helps to increase the momentum of technology by promoting collaboration and inspiring excitement in New Jersey’s technical community. “Since the Council is able to be very close to the grassroots, the group has the ability to be a crucial social force in engaging more of our population,” says Belanger. “New Jersey is a reasonably large state and the impact of this group is broad enough to have critical mass, but also focused enough to actually change things on the ground, which is very exciting. This movement will help more people from underrepresented communities become involved in technology, help increase entrepreneurial activity within the state, and create a more informed, highly-skilled population in New Jersey.”</p>

<p>Declaring that blockchain has “gone mainstream,” Forbes today released its 2021 “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2021/02/02/blockchain-50/">Blockchain 50</a>,” featuring companies that have at least $1 billion in revenues or are valued at $1 billion or more and “lead in employing distributed ledger technology.” And, once again, half of the companies on the list are using Hyperledger technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twenty five companies on the list name at least one Hyperledger technology as part of their solution platform. Hyperledger Fabric, specifically, is cited as a platform by 24 of the companies, topping the list as the most widely used technology. Hyperledger Aries, Indy, Grid and Sawtooth are all also deployed by companies on this list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The annual list, now in its third year, reflects the growing global impact of blockchain technology with 25 members from the U.S., 13 from Europe and a record 12 from Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. All in all, there were 21 companies that were new to the list, and 15 of them, including ones from Australia (BHP), India (Tech Mahindra) and Africa (Sappi), use Hyperledger-based platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the 12 companies that have made the list every year, six (Ant Group, Cargill, DTCC, IBM, ING and Walmart) use Hyperledger technologies.</p>



<p>More than just a basic list of companies and technologies, the Forbes Blockchain 50 provides a snapshot of the market-changing deployments these blockchain leaders have deployed. Accompanying <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2021/02/02/forbes-releases-3rd-annual-blockchain-50-list-of-companies-paving-the-way-using-blockchain-technology/?sh=32e070482e63">stories</a> add even more analysis and context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This annual look at the market is a good reflection point for the traction our technologies have in the current market but also a guidepost to what needs to come next. The increasing global adoption of blockchain – public, private, hybrid – and coming shifts in currency adoption and payments as well as uptake in markets as diverse as mining, telecom, pharma and shipping all point to the growing reach of distributed ledger technology. And, in the face of such challenges as the pandemic, climate change and income equality, it is important to put the focus on what we can accomplish building on blockchain as a cornerstone.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>The technological changes affecting the academic science community are happening at a rapid pace, causing the roles of advanced cyberinfrastructure and big data to evolve on a global scale. As the Senior Director of Advanced CyberInfrastructure, Office of the Vice President for Information Technology, and Senior Research Scholar, Department of Computer Science at Princeton University, Dr. Jack Brassil is witnessing this extraordinary shift in scientific research. “The cyberinfrastructure and collaboration that researchers need to conduct their work is an important driver of this change. The role of commercial cloud technologies is growing. Work that is conducted at a relatively modest scale in laboratories or in campus research facilities is shifting to include larger collaborations between many universities with increased reliance on shared infrastructure and access to massive datasets.” The transition from an older model of scientific research to a new model is occurring across the academic community, including Princeton, with many opportunities arising to leverage the Cloud to advance innovation and discovery.</p>
<p>Expanding the Reach of IT<br>
Princeton is home to world-class facilities that are available to researchers across many departments and disciplines. Throughout his career, Brassil has worked at many top-notch institutions and says his role at Princeton is both an honor and a privilege. “Princeton has a commitment to excellence and advancing teaching and research. My position is unique to this institution in that the role bridges both Advanced CyberInfrastructure and the Department of Computer Science. I’m able to expand the reach of the IT organization deeper into the departments and elevate the boundaries of the service that is normally provided. Through this hybrid role, I’m embedded within various departments as they explore new programs, research infrastructures, and instruments.”</p>
<p>Brassil says closing the gap between an IT organization and academic units is vitally important to an institution. His dual-role at Princeton allows him to see university operations from both vantage points and helps him gain a better understanding of university-wide thinking, including how that aligns with the institution’s goals and objectives. Brassil spent 25 years in industrial research, primarily working with universities and start-ups, and came to Princeton three years ago from the National Science Foundation (NSF).“This experience was instrumental in preparing me for the kind of innovative work I’m doing at Princeton,” shares Brassil. “I was able to learn more about the overall national and international research enterprise and the inner workings, including policy development and fundraising associated with science research. This experience gave me a greater understanding of not just a single university, but the vast differences between universities. Now at Princeton, I’m helping the University meet the growing needs for complicated infrastructure and instruments that academics are increasingly calling for to complete their research.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		        
	 
		    
			 
				
 
	 
		 “Edge created a community that facilitated collaboration and helped New Jersey create a top-tier statewide network. GigaPOP is a tremendous opportunity to consolidate resources in the state, which in the long run, will lead to better economic development and help facilitate more collaboration between universities and community colleges and the State.”

		<p>The Future of Cloud Technology<br>
With extensive knowledge of cloud technology and the future of cloud-based research facilities, Brassil was approached by NSF to conduct a workshop at Princeton. The NSF-1934704, Workshop on Next Generation Cloud Research Infrastructure, brought together members of the academic community and industry from around the country to investigate the future of cloud computing research infrastructure. Academic members of the workshop use clouds to conduct their research, publish papers, and study datasets. The group also included service providers and cloud platform developers.</p>
<p>“Cloud research platforms have multiple uses, but the underlying intent is to allow researchers to think about how we build clouds and guide the development of future commercial clouds,” explains Brassil. “Existing commercial clouds, like Microsoft® Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS), are designed to provide services to enterprises who want to expand their offsite computing needs. They do a great job at this, but they are not perfect vehicles for academic research. Institutions need sandboxes to determine what future commercial cloud technology should look like and try to pinpoint the specific services that are required of an academic cloud.”</p>
<p>An additional project Brassil is involved in is NSF-1923692, CloudJoin: Migrating CISE Computing Research Infrastructure to the Cloud, which investigates the integration of novel architectures into campus research computing and commercial cloud platforms. Like the workshop, this project focuses on how to build cloud computing infrastructure that is tailored to academic scientific research. “Academic research institutions host a central IT research computing organization to provide researchers with the campus tools, storage, and computing requirements they need to do their job,” says Brassil. “Those services struggle to meet&nbsp; the demands of today, especially with the need for massive computing jobs and datasets.”</p>
<p>“Academics are at a place of transition,” Brassil continues, “Moving from using extensive, local equipment on campus to shared instruments, shared computing, and commercial cloud resources.” CloudJoin is exploring hybrid clouds, which integrates on campus computing resources with commercial cloud resources. “A hybrid model provides researchers with the comfort of working with familiar, local tools, combined with the scale, reach, and collaboration opportunities of a commercial cloud.”</p>
<p>Supporting Education and Innovation<br>
Princeton, in conjunction with Edge and Rutgers University, created New Jersey’s first Internet2 GigaPOP access point earlier this year. Internet2 is the nation’s premier backbone for conducting research that supports education and innovation. The Internet2 GigaPOP is the first in-state connection to the national and global research infrastructure. “Edge created a community that facilitated collaboration and helped New Jersey create a top-tier statewide network,” shares Brassil. “GigaPOP is a tremendous opportunity to consolidate resources in the state, which in the long run, will lead to better economic development and help facilitate more collaboration between universities and community colleges and the State.”</p>
<p>With the creation of this access point, Princeton, a long-time Edge member, is now connected to an advanced technology community. “This opportunity ties back to Princeton’s desire to be fully connected and engaged in local communities,” says Brassil. “As seen in other regional networks in the country, I think the potential impact on both workforce and economic development is fantastic and will help further drive innovation and discovery. This collaborative environment also creates a center of knowledge for institutions to call upon for support as they develop new cyberinfrastructure.”</p>
<p>Princeton, Rutgers, and Edge are also key participants in a NSF-funded network research infrastructure called FABRIC. The four-year project is intended to support exploratory research in computer networking, distributed computing systems, and next-generation applications. FABRIC involves network elements that are equipped with large amounts of compute and storage that are interconnected by high speed, dedicated optical links. Connecting several testbeds and high-performance computing facilities, FABRIC provides access to cutting-edge network technologies and aims to advance cybersecurity, integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence, and help train the next generation of computer science researchers.</p>
<p>EdgeDiscovery Advisory Council<br>
Edge is dedicated to forging pathways for innovation and engagement among researchers and other stakeholders in the scientific discovery domain. Through EdgeDiscovery, members can pursue their research goals by accessing the advanced computing, support, training, and community engagement they need for success. The EdgeDiscovery Advisory Council was created to bring together fellow forward-thinkers and visionaries and provide a forum for supportive and informative collaboration. “Edge taking a leadership role is terrific. My hat is off to Dr. Forough Ghahramani for having the vision and insight to bring together people from different institutions to lead collaborations between universities and the State,” says Brassil. “Council members will help inform each other of what’s going on at the different institutions in New Jersey. By doing so, we’ll gain a collective understanding of group economic development and important technologies and how we can help support each other in our teaching and research missions — driving success for all.”</p>

 Arup Chatterjee &amp; Puthiya Purayil&nbsp;Sneha  Session <p>The last decade has seen a slow but steady emergence of online literary spaces in India, marked by the ubiquitous nature of the internet and digital technologies, growing mobile phone penetration and increased access to devices such as tablets and e-readers. By literary spaces we refer to online journals, magazines and blogs, as well as reading groups and discussion spaces focused on writing in English and Indian languages. These range from those exclusively focusing on contemporary literature to others that feature writing on news, culture and arts. These spaces raise some intriguing questions about the growth a new online or digital literary culture, which may be mapped through the evolution of reading and writing practices as very explicitly technologized practices, and the changes in the notion of text and textuality, scholarship and pedagogy, among other&nbsp;things.</p><p>Some examples of such spaces that have come up in the recent years are The Little Magazine [1], Muse India [2], Kritya [3], Coldnoon: Travel Poetics [4], Kindle [5], Almost Island [6], The Indian Quarterly [7] and among several others. Many of these journals have both an online and print presence, while some are purely online and seek to reach a diverse audience featuring different genres of writing. While many carry an eclectic mix of creative and critical writing, perceptions about readership on the internet often dictate the form and manner of writing that is featured. The much anticipated and debated ‘disappearance’ of long form writing is one of the questions that may be asked of the emergence of these literary journals, which have in some way re-imagined this form in the digital sphere and have been instrumental in its growth. So even as there are books on twitterature [8], there are interesting ways in which online literary journals have tried to define the space of contemporary writing on the internet in&nbsp;India.</p> Plan <p>This panel discussion proposes to examine this phenomenon of the growth of online literary journals to understand the imagination of the ‘digital’ in their practices of writing and publication, whether as medium, content or context, as a way to explore how writing and reading practices today have been shaped by these changes. This also includes questions on methods of literary analysis that may have changed with the advent of the digital, and from a broader perspective, the production of literary scholarship and pedagogy in India. Some questions that could be points of discussion are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  What is the pedagogical role, if any of digital/online journals? Are they simply cost-effective modes of production of knowledge or are they indicative of some other form discrimination? Perhaps a discrimination between what gets read and what does not? Is a voluminous archive of nineteenth century writings of the same pedagogical merit as a list of 100 Hollywood romantic comedies? If the former is arguably much more educational, why then is the latter the source of the greatest traffic? Is pedagogy then a misnomer, and a non-entity in the world of online magazines?  Can the rise of online magazines be related with the rise of print culture and the subsequent rise of the novel? The novel was educational and, while English was still a very evolving language in the 17th and 18th centuries, the form helped both shape the language and educate the masses, bourgeoisie, and the aristocracy about the nuances of the still-nascent English language. Can a similar function be said to have been fulfilled by online journals? Or have they failed in playing this radical role of disseminating new language and new vocabulary, which is required to articulate new modes and conflicts within modernity — sexualities, queerness, televised elections, middle-eastern (Syrian, Palestinian, Israeli, Iraqi) mayhem in times of democracy, globalization, urbanization, travel, genocide, partition, terrorism, and so on? Are there any exceptions among the journals in being able to somehow fulfil the criteria of engendering a new language? What are the examples, if any? How popular are&nbsp;they?  Is online literature less literary than print? Is it more amenable to news, while print continues to be literary? Or is this only a misconception? Is online literature prone to non-serious, or populist sources of pedagogy, which serve more to titillate through trolling, humour, half-baked information, gossip, or is it playing a serious role too in portions? Apart from those newspapers and journals/magazines which also have print components, which are possibly the portals that create viable, meritorious, and universal categories of knowledge? Or, invocation of ‘merit’ and ‘universal’ essentially a flawed mechanism to judge online literatures?  <p>Addressing some of above questions through a study of two or more online journals, this session will attempt to open them up to a broader discussion on the nature and growth of an online literary culture in India, and the need for and significance of research in this&nbsp;area.</p> Readings <p>None.</p> Notes <p>[1] See: <a href="http://www.littlemag.com/">http://www.littlemag.com/</a>.</p><p>[2] See: <a href="http://www.museindia.com/">http://www.museindia.com/</a>.</p><p>[3] See: <a href="http://www.kritya.in/">http://www.kritya.in/</a>.</p><p>[4] See: <a href="http://coldnoon.com/">http://coldnoon.com/</a>.</p><p>[5] See: <a href="http://kindlemag.in/">http://kindlemag.in/</a>.</p><p>[6] See: <a href="http://almostisland.com/">http://almostisland.com/</a>.</p><p>[7] See: <a href="http://indianquarterly.com/">http://indianquarterly.com/</a>.</p><p>[8] See: <a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307055/twitterature-by-alexander-aciman/9780143117322/">http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307055/twitterature-by-alexander-aciman/9780143117322/</a>.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day3.LiterarySpaces">IRC 2016: Day 3 #Literary Spaces : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Arup K Chatterjee is a doctorate in English from the Center for English Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University.

<p>The ID2020 Alliance is delighted to welcome U.K.-based Nuggets as the newest member of its vibrant community. The Alliance is made up of public and private sector organizations who share a common commitment to good ID for&nbsp;all.</p><p>The Nuggets proposition could not be clearer, proclaiming boldly that “privacy is a fundamental human right” and signaling an immediate alignment with the ID2020 Manifesto — the statement of principles that guide the Alliance’s work.</p><blockquote>“We are always excited to welcome organizations who so wholeheartedly embrace our values,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “When we talk about complex issues, such as identity and data ownership, we know that transparency is essential to building trust — with customers, partners, and users. We could not be more excited to welcome Nuggets to the Alliance as we work together toward a future with good digital identity for&nbsp;all.”</blockquote><p>Nuggets offers a robust decentralized self-sovereign ID and payments platform, that enables consumers to retain control of their personal information and businesses to protect their customer’s data. Their solution leverages biometrics for verification, strong customer authentication, and cryptographic proof of identity to facilitate customer onboarding (KYC &amp; KYB), single sign-on with biometrics, omnichannel payments, age verification, contactless delivery and verified two-way communication transactions through a scalable, decentralized digital&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Founded in 2016 by Alastair Johnson and Seema Khinda Johnson, Nuggets is available in Europe and Australia and is expanding its platform into new verticals including financial services, which has been advanced by a significant partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions, one of the largest protectors of private and confidential data in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Nuggets has already won numerous awards for its industry-leading FinTech offerings, including most recently from Deutsche Bank. As part of their recent growth, Nuggets has established commercial partnerships with global companies such as LexisNexis Risk Solutions, LatPay, QFPay, and a variety of other organizations.</p><blockquote>“Frustratingly, 2020 was the worst year on record for data breaches, signaling a seismic shift in consumer attitudes towards privacy,” said Alastair Johnson, CEO &amp; Founder of Nuggets. “On this Data Privacy Day — held annually on January 28 to create awareness about the importance of respecting privacy, safeguarding data, and enabling trust — it feels particularly timely for Nuggets to join forces with ID2020 and the other brand leaders that are helping to make protecting customers’ data a top priority in this increasingly data-driven digital&nbsp;world.”</blockquote><p>The ID2020 Alliance also continues to grow at a healthy pace, welcoming organizations from the public and private sectors that share our commitment to user-managed privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID. As an Alliance, we are only as strong as our members and we are thrilled to add Nuggets to the partnership as we move — together — towards providing good ID for&nbsp;all.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p>About Nuggets</p><p>Nuggets is an award-winning, decentralized, self-sovereign identity and payment platform. It helps organizations to protect customer data while giving customers a frictionless, seamless experience. Nuggets is the only platform of its kind that truly brings together payments and ID, utilizing self-sovereign data principles.</p><p>Nuggets was founded on the belief that each of us should own and control our personal information. No one else. Privacy is a fundamental human right, and a fundamental change is needed in the way personal data is&nbsp;stored.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/uk-based-nuggets-joins-the-id2020-alliance-aa984893fa48">UK-Based Nuggets Joins the ID2020 Alliance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.3finery.com/">3Finery</a>&nbsp;uses ground-breaking&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality#:~:text=Augmented%20reality%20(AR)%20is%20an,%2C%20haptic%2C%20somatosensory%20and%20olfactory.">Augmented Reality</a>&nbsp;(AR) technology which can boost customer engagement with remote marketing campaigns by portraying goods, services and venues in innovative ways. It is expected to appeal strongly to businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The new twist on traditional AR methods was developed at the School of Computing over a three-year period by Professor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drkennymitchell/">Kenny Mitchell</a> and his former PhD student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/llogaricasas/">Dr Llogari Casas</a>.</p>
 Intermediated Reality 
<p>3finery provides an Augmented Reality technology that enables objects to interact, play and receive messages remotely as if they were magically coming to life. Their software provides a novel way of interaction with the user’s environment and can be easily integrated to already existing solutions.</p>
<p>As Llogari explains at 14m:05s their unique innovation is a concept they define as “Intermediated Reality” (IR), the ability for people to interact with objects brought to life through Augmented Reality capabilities.</p>
<p>The technology can be used to enhance products, services and venues from businesses that have interaction with their environment through mobile devices. They offer unique interactive experiences with the ability to better understand customer needs by gathering valuable user data from their interactions, and their technology is built around social media with virality as the core value proposition and can be used as an incentive to make users interact with third parties software.</p>
<p>The underlying technology behind 3finery can be applied in a variety of verticals, such as, theme parks, museums, interactive toys, social network communication or entertainment and beyond.</p>

 As he describes in the feature video, Gordon Povey of Better Internet Search is one of Scotland’s Digital Disruptors. 
<p></p>
<p>Our goal with the DigitalScot.live webinar series is to showcase Scottish startups setting out to disrupt major industries, and Better Internet Search is taking on the most audacious of challenges: To build a better search engine than Google!</p>
<p>The theme of Gordon’s talk is how many “experts” have told them what a foolhardy goal this is, and you’d be forgiven for agreeing with them when you consider just how massive and ubiquitous Google is.</p>
<p>However at one point in time Google was just two guys in a garage and they were being told the same thing, with objective of displacing the incumbents like Altavista being their foolhardy mission.</p>
<p>That is the nature of Digital Disruption in the Internet era, no one is safe, any one can be toppled from the top slot simply through a new player having a unique competitive advantage that moves the game to an entirely new playing field.</p>
 Integrated Commerce Search 
<p>For the main introduction Gordon sets the scene by highlighting search users have two main issues with the Google approach: Data privacy and advertising. Google very intrusively tracks all of your online behaviours and uses that data to personalize adverts at you.</p>
<p>So Better Internet Search is going for a different model, one that keeps your personal data entirely private and doesn’t offer any advertising.</p>
<p>This leaves you wondering what possible options are there then to generate revenues, but as he explains from 13m:00s, Gordon and his team are pioneering an alternative model, one that charges users for searching, paid through tokens that they top up into their search wallet.</p>
<p>The core of their model is that should a user proceed to an e-commerce store as a result of their search and make a purchase, the user is rewarded with tokens back into their wallet. They can also directly purchase top ups.</p>
<p>From 25m:00s Gordon demonstrates where this can lead, showing an integrated search / product commerce experience. Given it is such a popular and distinct use of searching, to find products you want to buy, there is huge potential to offer a much improved, end-to-end integrated experience.</p>
<p>Thus Better Internet Search has defined a unique niche in the marketplace where they could achieve product superiority, and the dream of winning the David vs Goliath battle with Google suddenly seems more than realistic.</p>

 Next week Stephen Ingledew joins our webinar series to present on ‘<a href="https://summit.digitalscot.live/talks/developing-the-fintech-community-cluster/">Developing the FinTech Community and Cluster</a>‘. 
<p>A helpful background is available through the feature video from Scottish Development International where Stephen, along with Modulr’s chief financial officer Chris Brooks, provide an overview of the Scottish FinTech sector.</p>
<p></p>
 What is FinTech? 
<p>FinTech is a portmanteau of the two terms “finance” and “technology”. It is an umbrella term for innovative technology-enabled financial services and the business models that accompany those services. FinTech is used to define a new tech that seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services.</p>
<p>It also ​​​refers to the use of advanced technology to supply financial services to consumers and businesses — from buying and selling cryptocurrency to authenticating electronic payments. It can take the form of software, a service, or a business that provides technologically advanced ways to make financial processes more efficient by disrupting traditional methods.</p>
<p>In some cases, it includes hardware, too like smart, connected piggy banks or virtual reality (VR) trading platforms.</p>
<p>The FinTech industry is composed of companies that use technology to make financial services more efficient. It includes any company that provides financial services through software or other technology and also includes anything from mobile payment apps to cryptocurrency.</p>
 What does FinTech do? 
<p>Some fintech developments have improved traditional services, for example, mobile banking apps, while others have revolutionized services such as pay per mile car insurance or creating new products, such as Bitcoin. From mobile banking and insurance to cryptocurrency and investment apps, fintech has broad applications.</p>
<p>FinTech is currently helping companies, business owners, and consumers to better manage their financial operations utilizing specialized software and algorithms that are used on computers and, increasingly, smartphones enabling financial services that can make online transactions and gain access to insurance or credit.</p>
<p>Some of FinTechs traditional uses are crowdfunding platforms (Patreon, Kickstarter, GoFundMe, etc), blockchain and cryptocurrency, mobile payments, insurance, robo advising and stock trading apps and budgeting apps, online lending business and RegTech (regulatory technology).</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>In 2018 FinTech Scotland set out with an agenda of three parts, developed through three circles namely FinTech Cluster, FinTech Collaboration, and FinTech Community.</p>
<p>FinTech Scotland works for both consumers and businesses to improve the outcomes and build a participative cluster involving people and organizations from across Scotland. It has 136 member firms and 15 firms in the process of joining, a rapid growth from 26 at the beginning in 2018.</p>
<p>FinTech examples from across the world operating in Scotland include Modulr, Avaloq, Agrud, Encompass, FNZ and Gobill. FNZ is one of the most famous FinTech firms, with its HQ situated at Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The innovative FinTech community is reinventing financial services through financing, access, protection, affordability, engagement, giving, literacy, identity, community, payments, and cash flow. FinTech is also reinventing the regulatory landscape to improve the outcomes for both businesses and customers. FinTech does not only have a reputation in banking and insurance but also in capital markets.</p>
<p>It’s also responding to COVID 19 challenges. The global pandemic has accelerated the adoption of new technologies and the demand for innovation. They are helping businesses to improve themselves and become sustainable at speed and to adapt into the digital world.</p>
<p>FinTech Scotland is connecting the community by learning and supporting each other through innovation, driving outcomes, building impactful collaboration and an inclusive cluster, addressing regulatory priorities through progressive engagement and focusing on challenging issues of the environment.</p>
<p>The cluster is developing global engagement with the help of UK International FinTech Development, FinTech Global Trade Missions, European FinTech Collaboration Group and European FinTech Cluster Excellence.</p>
<p>In 2019 Fintech Scotland celebrated Scotland’s International Fintech Festival, sharing financial innovation around the world, and received ‘Scotland’s Fintech Cluster Achieves European Excellence Recognition’ in January 2020.</p>
<p>Recently they <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/fintech-scotland-proposes-new-research-23381951">released a report</a> proposing plans for increased research and innovation to drive acceleration in fintech development across the UK.</p>
 Modulr 
<p>Modulr is a payment alternative for digital businesses, enabling end to end payments through three core services namely automate, embed and launch. Modulr maximize payment efficiency across the receivables payables collections disbursement etc. It helps people to build new banking or new payment services.</p>
<p>Modulr was founded in 2016 in London, with the CEO, leadership team, investors and funding team working from London. Modulr raised £43 million funding and moved to Scotland in June 2020 and since then has accelerated growth in Edinburgh to 120 people.</p>
<p>It has enjoyed a massive success through moving to Scotland. Modulr was awarded a £10m ‘Government Banking Innovation’ grant, and moving to Edinburgh empowered Modulr through a skilled workforce, customers, strong professional services and support, economics, and through a small and well-connected ecosystem and financial services and tech market.</p>
<p>Modulr grew quickly in Edinburgh because the city has major banks, a strong FinTech network and fantastic platform that enables companies with ambitions to grow rapidly. The challenges in Edinburgh were a competitive talent market, limited flexible office options in central Edinburgh, the availability of Scottish funding and the challenge of managing split locations whilst growing quickly.</p>
<p>Modulr managed the distance challenge by ensuring solid governance, established processes and procedures, communication, technology, agility and leadership.</p>

 Introducing, Clay <p>After more than a year of hard work, we're excited to officially unveil the Ceramic Clay Testnet. Starting today you can experiment, prototype, and develop applications on top of the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">Ceramic protocol</a>. </p><p>To get started, try the <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">demo app</a> and jump into the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/quick-start/">docs</a>.</p> What is Ceramic? <p>Ceramic is a public, permissionless, censorship-resistant network for managing mutable information on the open internet. Ceramic combines a stack of cutting-edge web3 technologies including <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://libp2p.io">libp2p</a>, blockchain, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, and <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-store-signed-and-encrypted-data-on-ipfs/">standards for authenticated (signed/encrypted) data</a> to give developers the ability to build completely serverless applications using dynamic, verifiable, decentralized data.</p><p>Ceramic functions like a global-scale, permissionless NoSQL document datastore, but ensures strict ordering of document updates and data integrity without relying on database servers or trusted third-parties to perform mutations and transforms on content. Since Ceramic is built on a completely peer-to-peer network, all documents are openly discoverable and can be queried by any participant on the network or referenced in other documents.</p> Smart documents <p>In Ceramic all content is stored in smart documents, which are append-only IPFS logs where each commit (update) is signed by a decentralized identifier (DID) for verifiability and then subsequently anchored in a blockchain for consensus. Each smart document basically functions as its own independent doc-chain (a document blockchain). Here are some key features of smart documents:</p>  Mutable content: Store information in collections of mutable documents like your favorite NoSQL document database.  Immutable identifiers: Every document gets a globally unique persistent identifier, called a <code>DocID</code>. This DocID will never change regardless of how many updates are made to the document.  Verifiable signatures: Every update to a document must be signed by the DID of its owner, providing verifiability to its content.  Schema-enforced content: Documents can have schemas which will be enforced by the protocol. This allows for data integrity and simple cross-platform interoperability.  Strict versioning: Every update made to a document is anchored in a blockchain, so its commits follow a strict order. This allows the protocol to guarantee the state of a document at every commit and allows its content to be auditable and trusted at all times.  Programmable logic: Define custom rules for state transitions to enforce who, how, and when your document is updated without centralized servers. Rules can react to direct events such as a signature from the owner, or indirect events such as an update in another document.  Configurable persistence: Nodes can back up documents to any centralized or decentralized data storage platform.   How'd we get here? <p>Clay is the result of the tireless commitment by many in the community to the mission of creating an open dataweb free of silos. Since we first debuted a proof of concept of the Ceramic protocol in early 2020, the Ceramic codebase has had 1300+ git commits, 650+ releases, and dozens of top-tier projects in the Web3 ecosystem have been hard at work testing integrations and providing us feedback along the way.</p><p>This release is the final major milestone on a long journey to launching the Ceramic Fire mainnet, which is slated for the end of Q1 or early Q2 2021. Want to start building on Ceramic today? Continue reading to dive into the specifics of what's possible on Clay.</p> What's new for Clay?   A live, fully-functioning public test network that simulates mainnet as closely as possible  Three JavaScript clients: <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/clients/#core-client">Core client</a>, <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/clients/#http-client">HTTP client</a>, and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/quick-start/">CLI</a>  Loads of new protocol features, improvements, and performance optimizations  The final breaking API changes before mainnet 🤞  Document anchoring on Ethereum's Ropsten (<code>EIP155:3</code>) and Rinkeby (<code>EIP155:4</code>) testnets  A dedicated p2p gossip network using the libp2p topic <code>/ceramic/testnet-clay</code>  A new <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network">documentation site</a>   Things to keep in mind   The Clay network is experimental and should only be used for prototyping, development, and testing purposes. It's great for getting your application ready for mainnet.  Documents created on Clay will not be portable to mainnet. These are separate networks, similar to Ethereum's testnets and mainnet.  Clay does not yet have a purely decentralized peer discovery mechanism for nodes, and instead uses a curated <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/peerlist">peerlist</a></code> for node discovery. This is because the <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-kad-dht">DHT</a> functionality in <code><a href="https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p">js-libp2p</a></code> is not yet sufficiently performant for production, however it will be ready by the time mainnet launches.  <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a protocol for cross-platform decentralized identity built on top of Ceramic. The IDX SDK is a useful tool for adding decentralized identity functionality to your already existing application, and is an easy entry point to get started with Ceramic. IDX runs on the Clay testnet and is currently in beta, so it has the same guarantees as Ceramic and will move to production when mainnet launches.  You may encounter a few bugs and/or performance issues. We've done our best to make things work as smoothly as possible, but this is still a testnet. Please report any issues by <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/issues">opening a ticket on Github</a> so we can fix them as soon as possible.  We're always available in <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> to answer questions and help you out along the way. We're excited to see what you build on Ceramic!   Getting started   <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network">Jump into the developer docs</a>  <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Try the Playground demo app</a>   What's next? <p>After Clay, our efforts will be 100% focused on releasing mainnet as quickly and safely as possible. We're targeting the end of Q1 or early Q2 2021.</p><p>The Fire mainnet release will include additional performance optimizations, fully decentralized peer discovery, a new pubsub topic <code>/ceramic/mainnet</code>, document anchoring on the Ethereum mainnet (<code>EIP155:1</code>), network monitoring, public analytics, bug fixes, and more.</p><p>The community is also gearing up for mainnet with many announcements, launches, and partnerships to go live. We will be sharing more information on those as they are available.</p>

<p>Come for the summaries, stay for the clip reel, bookmark for the&nbsp;links!</p><p>DIF held its semiannual “Face-to-Face” community’ event this week, and man what an event it was! For obvious reasons, it was virtual for the second time, and for the first time, it spanned both Zoom and the interactive social platform <a href="http://gather.town">gather.town</a>, giving a more intimate atmosphere and allowing for more organic networking than often happens at “tele-conferences.” If you missed it in part or in full, you’ll find below summaries and recordings of the main&nbsp;events.</p> 1# Opening remarks, and an update on DIF-OIDF Collaboration <p>Executive Director Rouven Heck got us started on a warm and welcoming note, bringing the largely unfamiliar audience up to date on DIF’s member-driven nature and its goals for 2021. These include a more engaged membership, more co-development at various scales, and more work items reaching stable specifications and publicly going from community incubation to commercial production.</p><p>Then, presenting from Tokyo (actually a little before the opening remarks, as is our asynchronous way here at DIF) Kristina Yasuda (<a href="https://online2020.mydata.org/presenter/kristina-yasuda/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://mydata.org">Mydata</a>) gave an update on her new role as the liaison between DIF and the OpenID Foundation. Joined by DID Authentication WG chair Oliver Terbu (<a href="https://mesh.xyz/">Consensys Mesh</a>), Kristina gave an overview not only of the ongoing SIOP work in the AB/Connect WG at OIDF, but also other identity-related efforts that might be of interest to DIF members, including the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/mobile/">MODRNA</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">KYC-IDA</a> working&nbsp;groups.</p> 2# Interoperability and DIDComm working&nbsp;group <p>The “main stage” working group presentations started with the Interoperability Working Group, which has taken a break from its test-harness/test-suite role under its new chairs to concentrate on educational materials that support broader interoperability among verifiable credential protocols… and a better understanding of those protocols among decision-makers on the business side of the decentralized-identity business.</p><p>The chairs (Pam, Kaliya, and Juan) gave an overview of the last 6 months of their group, its publications and maps, and other products, an overview of their invited guests (and handy recordings), as well as the “parking lot” for future discussion/research topics for&nbsp;Q1.</p><p>The DID Communications Working Group, energetically presented by Chair Sam Curren (<a href="http://indic.io">Indicio</a>, <a href="http://mattr.global">Mattr</a>), got the ball rolling with a swift and accessible overview of the group’s rapid progress from ambitious roadmap to the sophisticated draft specification since the last conference. In addition to the specification reaching its final rounds of editorial clean-up, many “nice to have” protocols that were put out of scope while the group focused on the specification alignment process (specifically a Bluetooth implementation and an NFC implementation) have spun out into parallel work items, which are already underway. In other DIDComm news, DIF member <a href="http://jolocom.com">Jolocom</a> announced this week a DIDComm v2 sample implementation in Rust, built for the company’s [otherwise completely non-Aries!] wallet. It seems 2021 will be the year of&nbsp;DIDComm!</p> 3# Claims and Credentials, Presentation Exchange, and&nbsp;Sidetree <p>The Claims and Credentials group’s co-chair Wayne Chang (<a href="http://spruceid.com">Spruce Systems</a>) took a quick stroll through the new work item initiation process (currently being extended to other WGs DIF-wide) and the other major work items: the paused Credential Taxonomy, the work item formerly known as Credential Manifest, the new VC Marketplace.</p><p>DIF’s first Executive Director, Daniel Bucher (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a>), gave a quick overview of the Presentation Exchange spec, an ambitious specification for scaffolding credential requests and presentations between unfamiliar systems. After months of collaboration with core architects of the Aries ecosystem from DIF member <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a>, the presentation and request mechanics have been aligned with the upcoming iteration of the relevant Aries “Present Proof” RFCs, making this a major interoperability win that bridges the largest production ecosystems the decentralized identity space has yet seen. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">specification</a> is in the very home stretch of reaching 1.0 status and in the last weeks of a period of public comment, so give it a read and leave some <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange/issues">issues</a> soon if you have&nbsp;any!</p><p>Daniel also presented the other specification he has been tirelessly driving for even longer than the Presentation Exchange work item at Claims and Credentials — the Sidetree specification, which reached v1.0 this week. In this quick, extemporaneous video, Daniel runs through some common misconceptions and relates the overarching Sidetree Layer-2 architecture to Microsoft’s specific Ion implementation, the work of DIF members <a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> on a Hyperledger Fabric implementation, DIF members <a href="https://transmute.industries">Transmute</a>’s Ethereum implementation, and even the affinities with DIF’s next working group to spin out of I&amp;D,&nbsp;KERI.</p> 4# Secure Data Storage WG, Identifiers and Discovery WG, and&nbsp;KERI <p>From potentially universal specifications for presenting credentials, we jumped straight to potentially universal specifications for storing credentials and other confidential data. The Secure Data Storage working group co-chair Dmitry Zangadulin (<a href="https://digitalbazaar.com/">Digital Bazaar</a>) talked about the group’s first and flagship specification, <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a>, which is designing a modular and DID-controlled storage protocol that would allow so-called “encrypted data vaults” (with or without a coupled authorization server called an “identity hub”) to create a portable, secure, redundant, and replicable storage layer for the decentralized identity world. In addition to bringing the audience up to speed on the current status of the specification work and prototyping, the group also gave a quick overview of the many <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">guest presentations</a> since the last F2F, spanning the cutting edge of decentralized storage and next-generation database projects.</p>The architecture of the Confidential Storage draft <a href="https://identity.foundation/confidential-storage/">specification</a><p>Identifiers and Discovery WG, the oldest continuously-active group at DIF, gave a detailed overview of its impressive roster of donations, work items, and updates since the last F2F. Chair Markus Sabadello (<a href="http://danubetech.com">DanubeTech</a>) ran through this long list. These include research on WebID and key recovery/roll-over systems, the evolving WebID pre-standard being discussed in some browser groups of W3C, new common libraries in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-common-dotnet/branches">.NET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-key.rs">Rust</a>. Markus also explained to those new to the space the group’s broader mission of supporting the DID ecosystem and DID methods in particular as they experiment with decentralized governance and infrastructure. (Of particular interest to close watchers of the space was his update about the Universal Resolver project offering up very high-level analytics (privacy-preserving, of course!) about resolution activity on the public “testnet” service.)</p><p>Markus’ co-chair, Sam Smith (<a href="https://prosapien.com/">ProSapien</a>, <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/">Digital Trust Ventures</a>) talked about his passion-project, soon to become its own DIF WG: Key Event Receipt Infrastructure, or “KERI.” <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/keri">KERI</a> offers a new way of thinking of the “layers” of decentralized identity infrastructure, focusing doggedly on the “bottom half” of the concerns of a traditional DID method and separating itself entirely from the “top half,” including method-specific namespacing and all [clear-text] data. After months of honing the skill, Sam impressively conveys a considerable portion of the core concepts in this complex and nuanced system in a record-setting fifteen&nbsp;minutes!</p> 5# Special Interest Groups: Product Managers, Banking and Finance, and Healthcare <p><a href="http://transmute.industries">Transmute</a>’s Margo Johnson, co-chair of the Product Managers’ community of practice, gave a quick overview of their very generative and generous non-technical working group. In addition to producing a useful <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/product-managers/blob/main/agenda.md">open-source corpus</a> of discussion notes, presentations, and UX blotters, and the like, the group is also an important watering hole for product and user interface design thinking, covering such topics as accessibility, ethics, and adoption strategies, for products but also for new concepts of software (and better user interface patterns) more generally.</p><p>Co-chairs Paul Dunphy (<a href="http://onespan.com">OneSpan</a>) and Isaac Patka (<a href="http://bloom.co">Bloom</a>) gave a fascinating overview of the activity of their fast-moving and diligent Banking and Finance open group. Paul introduces the philosophy, focus, and working methods of the group, then Isaac overviews the invited guests to date. In addition to hearing reports from SSI researchers in the financial services space, the group is also building out a wiki of relevant regulatory events in the space, as well as opportunities in the space like the UK’s financial regulatory sandbox, the subject of their next meeting with <a href="http://evernym.com">Evernym</a>’s Andy&nbsp;Tobin.</p><p>Interim Chair Juan Caballero (<a href="http://learningproof.xyz">LearningProof</a>) gave a brief overview of the discussion group’s intentions and format. These could respectively be summarized as exploring the opportunities and access points for innovations in the healthcare space, and a recorded invited-guest series where researchers from the space offer “reverse pitches” about pain points and problems that decentralized identity might be uniquely suited to solve. As with all of DIF’s special-interest groups, the group is open to DIF non-members and interested parties can reach the chairs through the group’s <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/healthcare/blob/main/agenda.md">repository</a>, where they can also find notes and recordings of all guests to&nbsp;date.</p> Stay Tuned and Get&nbsp;Involved <p>As you can see, the DIF community has grown considerably since the last F2F, and keeps expanding into new terrains and modalities. If you work in the decentralized identity space or are trying to move your work into it, please consider <a href="https://identity.foundation/join">joining </a>the foundation, joining one of these working groups and special-interest groups, or even bringing a future project into DIF as a work item. <br>Or <a href="https://foundation.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7d1001f187a746b68d2ea0d28&amp;id=866a6c17be">subscribe </a>to our monthly newsletter.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-face-to-face-jan-2021-highlights-89e78cb80f54">DIF Face to Face Jan 2021 Highlights</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Joined by DID Authentication WG chair Oliver Terbu (<a href="https://mesh.xyz/">Consensys Mesh</a>), Kristina gave an overview not only of the ongoing SIOP work in the AB/Connect WG at OIDF, but also other identity-related efforts that might be of interest to DIF members, including the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/mobile/">MODRNA</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">KYC-IDA</a> working groups.</p>  2# Interoperability and DIDComm working&nbsp;group <p>The “main stage” working group presentations started with the Interoperability Working Group, which has taken a break from its test-harness/test-suite role under its new chairs to concentrate on educational materials that support broader interoperability among verifiable credential protocols… and a better understanding of those protocols among decision-makers on the business side of the decentralized-identity business.</p><p>The chairs (Pam, Kaliya, and Juan) gave an overview of the last 6 months of their group, its publications and maps, and other products, an overview of their invited guests (and handy recordings), as well as the “parking lot” for future discussion/research topics for Q1.</p><p>The DID Communications Working Group, energetically presented by Chair Sam Curren (<a href="http://indic.io">Indicio</a>, <a href="http://mattr.global">Mattr</a>), got the ball rolling with a swift and accessible overview of the group’s rapid progress from ambitious roadmap to the sophisticated draft specification since the last conference. In addition to the specification reaching its final rounds of editorial clean-up, many “nice to have” protocols that were put out of scope while the group focused on the specification alignment process (specifically a Bluetooth implementation and an NFC implementation) have spun out into parallel work items, which are already underway. In other DIDComm news, DIF member <a href="http://jolocom.com">Jolocom</a> announced this week a DIDComm v2 sample implementation in Rust, built for the company’s [otherwise completely non-Aries!] wallet. It seems 2021 will be the year of DIDComm!</p>  3# Claims and Credentials, Presentation Exchange, and&nbsp;Sidetree <p>The Claims and Credentials group’s co-chair Wayne Chang (<a href="http://spruceid.com">Spruce Systems</a>) took a quick stroll through the new work item initiation process (currently being extended to other WGs DIF-wide) and the other major work items: the paused Credential Taxonomy, the work item formerly known as Credential Manifest, the new VC Marketplace.</p><p>DIF’s first Executive Director, Daniel Bucher (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a>), gave a quick overview of the Presentation Exchange spec, an ambitious specification for scaffolding credential requests and presentations between unfamiliar systems. After months of collaboration with core architects of the Aries ecosystem from DIF member <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a>, the presentation and request mechanics have been aligned with the upcoming iteration of the relevant Aries “Present Proof” RFCs, making this a major interoperability win that bridges the largest production ecosystems the decentralized identity space has yet seen. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">specification</a> is in the very home stretch of reaching 1.0 status and in the last weeks of a period of public comment, so give it a read and leave some <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange/issues">issues</a> soon if you have any!</p><p>Daniel also presented the other specification he has been tirelessly driving for even longer than the Presentation Exchange work item at Claims and Credentials — the Sidetree specification, which reached v1.0 this week. In this quick, extemporaneous video, Daniel runs through some common misconceptions and relates the overarching Sidetree Layer-2 architecture to Microsoft’s specific Ion implementation, the work of DIF members <a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> on a Hyperledger Fabric implementation, DIF members <a href="https://transmute.industries">Transmute</a>’s Ethereum implementation, and even the affinities with DIF’s next working group to spin out of I&amp;D, KERI.</p>  4# Secure Data Storage WG, Identifiers and Discovery WG, and&nbsp;KERI <p>From potentially universal specifications for presenting credentials, we jumped straight to potentially universal specifications for storing credentials and other confidential data. The Secure Data Storage working group co-chair Dmitry Zangadulin (<a href="https://digitalbazaar.com/">Digital Bazaar</a>) talked about the group’s first and flagship specification, <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a>, which is designing a modular and DID-controlled storage protocol that would allow so-called “encrypted data vaults” (with or without a coupled authorization server called an “identity hub”) to create a portable, secure, redundant, and replicable storage layer for the decentralized identity world. In addition to bringing the audience up to speed on the current status of the specification work and prototyping, the group also gave a quick overview of the many <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">guest presentations</a> since the last F2F, spanning the cutting edge of decentralized storage and next-generation database projects.</p>specification<p>Identifiers and Discovery WG, the oldest continuously-active group at DIF, gave a detailed overview of its impressive roster of donations, work items, and updates since the last F2F. Chair Markus Sabadello (<a href="http://danubetech.com">DanubeTech</a>) ran through this long list. These include research on WebID and key recovery/roll-over systems, the evolving WebID pre-standard being discussed in some browser groups of W3C, new common libraries in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-common-dotnet/branches">.NET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-key.rs">Rust</a>. Markus also explained to those new to the space the group’s broader mission of supporting the DID ecosystem and DID methods in particular as they experiment with decentralized governance and infrastructure. (Of particular interest to close watchers of the space was his update about the Universal Resolver project offering up very high-level analytics (privacy-preserving, of course!) about resolution activity on the public “testnet” service.)</p><p>Markus’ co-chair, Sam Smith (<a href="https://prosapien.com/">ProSapien</a>, <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/">Digital Trust Ventures</a>) talked about his passion-project, soon to become its own DIF WG: Key Event Receipt Infrastructure, or “KERI.” <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/keri">KERI</a> offers a new way of thinking of the “layers” of decentralized identity infrastructure, focusing doggedly on the “bottom half” of the concerns of a traditional DID method and separating itself entirely from the “top half,” including method-specific namespacing and all [clear-text] data. After months of honing the skill, Sam impressively conveys a considerable portion of the core concepts in this complex and nuanced system in a record-setting fifteen minutes!</p>  5# Special Interest Groups: Product Managers, Banking and Finance, and Healthcare <p><a href="http://transmute.industries">Transmute</a>’s Margo Johnson, co-chair of the Product Managers’ community of practice, gave a quick overview of their very generative and generous non-technical working group. In addition to producing a useful <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/product-managers/blob/main/agenda.md">open-source corpus</a> of discussion notes, presentations, and UX blotters, and the like, the group is also an important watering hole for product and user interface design thinking, covering such topics as accessibility, ethics, and adoption strategies, for products but also for new concepts of software (and better user interface patterns) more generally.</p><p>Co-chairs Paul Dunphy (<a href="http://onespan.com">OneSpan</a>) and Isaac Patka (<a href="http://bloom.co">Bloom</a>) gave a fascinating overview of the activity of their fast-moving and diligent Banking and Finance open group. Paul introduces the philosophy, focus, and working methods of the group, then Isaac overviews the invited guests to date. In addition to hearing reports from SSI researchers in the financial services space, the group is also building out a wiki of relevant regulatory events in the space, as well as opportunities in the space like the UK’s financial regulatory sandbox, the subject of their next meeting with <a href="http://evernym.com">Evernym</a>’s Andy Tobin.</p><p>Interim Chair Juan Caballero (<a href="http://learningproof.xyz">LearningProof</a>) gave a brief overview of the discussion group’s intentions and format. These could respectively be summarized as exploring the opportunities and access points for innovations in the healthcare space, and a recorded invited-guest series where researchers from the space offer “reverse pitches” about pain points and problems that decentralized identity might be uniquely suited to solve. As with all of DIF’s special-interest groups, the group is open to DIF non-members and interested parties can reach the chairs through the group’s <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/healthcare/blob/main/agenda.md">repository</a>, where they can also find notes and recordings of all guests to date.</p> Stay Tuned and Get&nbsp;Involved <p>As you can see, the DIF community has grown considerably since the last F2F, and keeps expanding into new terrains and modalities. If you work in the decentralized identity space or are trying to move your work into it, please consider <a href="https://identity.foundation/join">joining </a>the foundation, joining one of these working groups and special-interest groups, or even bringing a future project into DIF as a work item.&nbsp;<br>Or <a href="https://foundation.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7d1001f187a746b68d2ea0d28&amp;id=866a6c17be">subscribe </a>to our monthly newsletter.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>2021 is going to be a significant year in Identity and Data Privacy. Since the GDPR went into full enforcement in 2018, we’ve seen&nbsp; many countries rapidly change or update their Data Privacy laws. Although intended to protect the individual, the number of Data Privacy Rights has increased dramatically. And, this is compounded by the fact that emerging technologies are putting a huge burden on identity and Identity systems.</p>
<p>The world is also experiencing an acceleration of technologies that rely heavily on Identity and Identity systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, I predict there will be a need to use Identity systems to facilitate new ways for people to access services:</p>
 
 carry out financial transactions with cryptocurrencies, 
 validate vaccination and health status due to Covid-19, 
 help big tech better moderate objectionable content. 
 
<p>These are my predictions for the year ahead – share your feedback below!</p>
<p></p>
 Immunity Passports will become ubiquitous 
<p>As a result of Covid-19, many countries are looking to how they can relax travel restrictions. A cruise company recently confirmed that they will not be accepting passengers unless they have been vaccinated. &nbsp;This is very likely to be the case for many other travel companies in 2021. &nbsp;This raises the issue of Data Privacy because some of these companies will now be collecting confidential, protected health information from the customers which they need to manage going forward.</p>
<p>Technologies are being developed right now to create things like Identity Passports through which travellers can present a negative COVID test result or proof of vaccination.&nbsp; This will then be tied to their identity to determine the right to travel. This will put a significant burden on identity systems as we seek to combine health information with travel information. Identity is going to be critical in making sure that organizations can have confidence in any tests results or new data provided.</p>
 Links between Cryptocurrencies and Identity 
<p>An essential part of bringing cryptocurrencies to people worldwide is the ability to have users create and maintain digital wallets. A fundamental purpose of digital wallets is to allow the unbanked or underbanked access to digital currency systems. As a result of this, Identity and Identity verification systems will grow in significance to cryptocurrencies. &nbsp;Identity and cryptocurrencies will be tightly bound together and initiatives aimed at getting people to use digital currency in the digital wallet will depend very much on adoption of the underpinning identity systems. Data Privacy and Data Protection will become the central point for developing trust in these digital money systems.</p>
 Emerging technologies and Identity 
<p>Emerging technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality will require more information about individuals as they move around, interacting with these systems. It will be vital that users are correctly identified and ‘marked’ appropriately so that, for example, their access to certain types of services can be restricted if needed. Identity plays a big part in this, and we will see increasing amounts of data collected about individuals which need to be protected to ensure their privacy rights.</p>
 Big Tech, Identity, and Content Moderation 
<p>Content moderation by big tech companies has become a hot issue in the US and the EU. Governments are looking very closely at ‘Big Tech”s role in moderating content and support for law enforcement when investigations relate to their customer base. As a result of this, and as we’ve seen recently in the US Capitol attack, the big tech companies are being asked not just to moderate conversations but also to track people that are causing harm or planning harmful events.</p>
<p>This is likely to result in more regulation around the responsibilities of ‘Big Tech’ in this area. In many different scenarios, I can see that this will cause a considerable uptick in how tech organisations identify users – particularly if it is to be used for law enforcement reasons.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how 2021 evolves. But whatever happens, it is likely that Identity and Data Privacy will play an increasingly significant role.</p>

 ASA Automation, a German automation manufacturer that supplies companies including Walmart and Pfizer, leverages Energy Web Zero to decarbonize international supply&nbsp;chain <p>Mainhausen, Germany and Zug, Switzerland — 26 January 2021 — Today, ASA Automation and Energy Web announced a renewable energy project leveraging the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">EW Zero</a> application to help ASA source renewables for its production facilities in Germany and Chile. ASA Automation is a leading global automation and robotics manufacturer that supplies equipment and solutions to multinational companies including Walmart, Nestle, Volkswagen, and Pfizer. Companies like these with strong sustainability policies require that suppliers such as ASA use low-carbon energy throughout their supply chain. EW Zero will enable ASA to provide a verified proof that low-carbon energy was used in its facilities throughout the world to produce its products. This pilot builds on the first technical and commercial demonstration of EW Zero — <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripple-and-energy-web-announce-worlds-first-decarbonized-blockchain-5c3cecbff31a">Energy Web’s partnership with Ripple and XRP Foundation</a> to decarbonize the XRP&nbsp;Ledger.</p><p>“We are thrilled to welcome ASA Automation as an early adopter of EW Zero to reduce the carbon footprint of its production facilities. We hope that this pilot will set an example for how small- to medium-sized companies, often excluded from participation in renewable energy markets due to their relatively low electricity consumption, can now contribute to sustainability efforts. As ASA Automation is showing, EW Zero makes it much easier to decarbonize global, complex supply chains as required by some of the largest corporates,” said Walter Kok, CEO of Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>EW Zero enables energy buyers of any size to efficiently locate and purchase renewables around the world. The first version of EW Zero leverages energy attribute certificates (EACs). In this transaction, ASA Automation will use EW Zero to cover electricity consumption in Germany and Chile using renewable EACs. Zero will also act as a discovery tool to view available renewable supply in the markets of interest and choose the suppliers that match specific demand criteria (such as location, generation type, and installation year). In this way, ASA Automation will reduce its electricity-related emissions (Scope 2 under the GHG Protocol), which in turn decreases supply chain Scope 3 emissions for ASA’s customers. Zero will also integrate with renewable energy suppliers to showcase how local renewables platforms can leverage open-source standardized APIs to connect to EW&nbsp;Zero.</p><p>“We’re proud to become a member of Energy Web and an early adopter of such an innovative project that will allow us to make a first step towards renewable energy procurement,” said Mario Krämer, CEO of ASA Automation. “I am convinced that this is only the first step in the strategic cooperation with Energy Web and we are thrilled to become a frontrunner in blockchain-based innovation for the automation sector.”</p><p>The project will be completed in early 2021 and inform the continued open-source development of EW Zero. In the meantime, ASA and Energy Web are seeking renewable energy developers with a footprint in Europe and Latin America to participate in the project. Interested companies are invited to contact <a href="http://meerim.ruslanova@energyweb.org">Meerim Ruslanova</a> to get involved.</p><p>About ASA Automation <br>ASA Automation is engineering, building, and installing high-tech automation solutions custom tailored to suit our clients’ specific needs and their products, working from our German facility at Mainhausen, in the vicinity of Frankfurt/Main.

<p>By Sarah Drinkwater, Director &amp; Aniyia Williams, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Back in 2018, we started funding the <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/why-were-investing-in-the-rise-of-the-responsible-tech-worker-a96e74661cdf">rise of the responsible tech worker</a>. This is our effort to help tech workers and founders step into their power, and build a world in which technology makes good on its promise of improving everyone’s lives for the better: fueling an ecosystem that is equitable, ethical, and inclusive in addition to innovative.<br> <br>2020 marked a monumental shift for the movement as the techlash came of age. A<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/a-legal-roadmap-to-address-googles-monopoly-on-search-engines-effdfbcbc1f7">t Omidyar Network, we were proud to provide a roadmap</a> for the US Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and dozens of state attorney generals to file <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/antitrust-case-against-google-roadmap-paper/">antitrust cases</a> against the largest tech companies; there was an escalating debate (and, finally, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/big-tech-did-the-right-thing-for-the-wrong-reasons-51610737986">some action</a>) around acceptable online speech; and millions of people worldwide gained a deeper understanding of the dark patterns in the devices they use everyday watching the hit documentary, A Social Dilemma. <br> <br>We’ve come a long way since US senators<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/10/17222062/mark-zuckerberg-testimony-graham-facebook-regulations"> asked Facebook how it makes money,</a> but there’s so much more to do. <br> <br>Here are the biggest lessons we’ve learned so far, and where we hope this year will take us.<br> <br>The people we’re told are “leaders” will not lead us where we need to go.<br> <br>We can’t expect technology executives to self-regulate because they have no incentive to do so. In a world in which <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">technology is inextricably bound with capitalism</a>, CEOs are beholden to their shareholders to maximize profit. <br> <br>But within those companies, there’s hope. <br> <br>Tech workers, from engineers to cafeteria staff, are pushing back and speaking up; and new founders are testing out new kinds of business models and products. Together, they are holding their employers and the industry accountable to do the right thing, not just say it.<br> <br>Yet too often these people face retaliation and get branded troublemakers. We see them as heroes. We believe these are the early stages of a massive tech labor movement, and the number of tech workers who understand the connection between their day-to-day job and its impact on society is growing. <br> <br>To help unlock their power, we’re creating space for workers and founders to come together, funding the tools and resources they need, and developing new mechanisms for accountability. <br> <br>In 2020, we launched <a href="https://ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer</a>, a tool that gives people working on tech products (including designers, engineers, or their collaborators) a practical guide to navigate and lead on complex topics such as bias in AI or outsized power.<br> <br>We helped launch the <a href="https://www.tspa.info/">Trust &amp; Safety Professional Association (TSPA)</a> to build the field and continue to elevate those working on the frontlines of content moderation. It is the first membership organization designed for trust and safety specialists, from contract content moderators to in-house engineering teams at big tech companies.<br> <br>For tech workers yearning to upskill and meet like minds, we funded<a href="https://school.logicmag.io/"> Logic School</a> to teach them about creative protest, as well as a course at Stanford for professionals on Tech, Ethics, and Public Policy.<br> <br>In addition, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ifeomaozoma/">Ifeoma Ozoma</a> joined our team as an advisor to help us consider how to strengthen tech workers’ ability to whistleblow when they see or experience something wrong in the workplace.<br> <br>The industry is missing a common vision and narrative about responsible technology.<br> <br>Last year, we discovered that “ethical tech” means<a href="https://sarahdrinkwater.medium.com/the-responsible-tech-movement-is-held-back-because-we-dont-know-what-to-call-it-9a674e867054"> different things to different people</a>. The lack of common narrative is a core challenge for the movement because it means that people haven’t gelled around a shared identity, have a hard time finding each other, and aren’t speaking the same language.<br> <br>How can you rally without something to rally around? We have to identify the harms as well as the common goals, interests, and passions to build the path forward. <br> <br>As the pandemic hit, we funded <a href="https://mobi.us.org/">Mobius </a>to bring technology leaders together and determine collective work. To help deepen our knowledge of how race and technology intersect, we funded the <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet Enquiry </a>to bring on an artist-in-residence (an incredible filmmaker, <a href="https://www.invisibleportraits.com/about">Oge Egbuonu</a>). And Civic Signals, now renamed<a href="https://newpublic.org/"> New_ Public</a>, kicked off 2021 with a festival that brought together a diverse crowd of activists, technologists, artists, academics, and urban planners to consider what healthy digital public spaces should look like. <br> <br>We win together, or not at all.<br> <br>For too long, tech has moved too fast and, at that high speed, broken things. An African proverb says “if you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” Beyond needing less haste and more conversation, we strongly believe in solidarity and collective approaches.<br> <br>If this past year has taught us anything, it’s how interwoven our lives are. Wearing a mask protects ourselves, as well as others. We exist as a society and we thrive in communities.<br> <br>That’s why last year we helped launch <a href="https://coworkerfund.org/">Coworker’s Solidarity Fund</a>, the first ever mutual aid fund designed specifically to assist employees and independent contractors who have faced retaliation for organizing in the workplace. The launch is timely given both our <a href="https://omidyar.com/news/omidyar-network-announces-worker-power-vision-35-million-investment/">commitment to worker power</a> in all forms of business under our Reimagining Capitalism banner and the continued progress of tech organizing, and we hope to see more progress in 2021 with the formation of the Alphabet Workers Union and Amazon employees voting for its first-ever union in the US.<br> <br>Acting with integrity can and should become business as usual.<br> <br>We think that doing the right thing for as many people as possible (whether you call it behaving with responsibility, integrity, or ethics) will be how the business world — including the technology sector — weaves together topics such as diversity, equity, belonging, and sustainability. <br> <br>2020, and the years before it, taught us that tech’s unethical behavior leads to incredible harm. It also results in reputation, regulatory, and talent risk. The largest tech companies are seeing experienced employees as well as young graduates (like those in our <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/awards/responsible-computer-science-challenge/">ResponsibleCS</a> program) turn away from the cultures they’ve built. <br> <br>Articulating and living by strongly held values will be how future leaders make their companies appealing to customers, investors, and the most sought-after employees.<br> <br>We’re already seeing this in the startup scene, with a new class emerging, led by organizations such as <a href="https://zebrasunite.coop/">Zebras Unite</a>,* who have created a powerful identity for founders who want to build companies grounded in values and defined in opposition to some of Silicon Valley’s most harmful norms. <br> <br>That’s why our teammates on the Reimagining Capitalism team are working to shift the current corporate governance rules away from shareholder primacy towards a world that recognizes broader stakeholders, including employees and consumers. It’s why we funded <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/apply/">Ethical Source</a> and the <a href="https://corpaccountabilitylab.org/">Corporate Accountability Lab</a>, elevating their existing work which challenges the notion that open source is “values neutral” by deploying tactical, practical licensing and legal frameworks to allow developers to center values in their work. We also funded <a href="https://projectinclude.org/">Project Include</a> to investigate how the shift to working remotely has impacted harassment and toxicity in the virtual workplace, and how tech companies can create better and fairer working conditions for all. <br> <br>What Comes Next<br>Looking ahead, we see our work as enabling a diverse community of tech stakeholders to connect, collaborate, and co-create. To fuel the next stage of the movement, we need to focus on both the aspirational (envisioning together what we want) and the adversarial (pushing back against what we don’t). After all, communities are defined as much by what they aren’t as what they are.<br> <br>In doing so, we hope examples will emerge of what we — as an industry and society — want to reward, as we so often see examples of what we want to correct. Working together, we believe a new surge of people, ideas, and examples will shift tech culture. <br> <br>We’re still navigating what Omidyar Network’s role should be in the movement towards responsible tech. We aren’t here to own, we’re here to listen, empower, and contribute. We feel strongly that people who are most marginalized in our communities are critical to developing effective solutions — they have deep lived-experience and can see a clear path forward. We must find ways to hear them and respond to their needs.<br> <br> If what you’ve read here resonates, tell us what you think. If you’re already engaged in some form of this work, or want to be, then we’d love to hear what you are working on or passionate about. <br> <br>We hope you’ll join us on the journey.<br> <br>And starting February 9th, we’ll be hosting a series of community conversations to share more of what we’ve learned. Register now for <a href="https://omidyar.com/the-tech-we-want/">The Tech We Want: Tech Whistleblowing</a> featuring the work of Ifeoma Ozoma.<br> <br>*For transparency, Aniyia Williams is one of the four co-founders of Zebras Unite and continues to serve on their board.

 Reimagining Capitalism Series: An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and&nbsp;Economy <p>By Audrey Stienon, Analyst, Reimagining Capitalism</p>Photo by <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/field-of-flags-at-national-mall-represents-americans-unable-to-attend-inauguration-day/2545279/">Eric BARADAT</a> /&nbsp;AFP<p>Over the coming weeks, Omidyar Network will expand on our theory of change around ideas, rules, and power and connect it to the five pillars outlined in our recently released <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Point of View</a> on Reimagining Capitalism, and the work being done by our grantees. This is the first contribution to that&nbsp;series.</p><p>Democracy &amp; Capitalism <br>This week, Joseph R. Biden was inaugurated as America’s 46th president, standing on the West Front of the US Capitol that was attacked earlier this month. With that picture still vivid in the minds of many, President Biden swore an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. In that moment, people across the country let out a sigh of relief; though our democracy has been bruised and battered, it continues. And so too can the American people continue to pursue a more perfect union. <br> <br>At Omidyar Network, we recognize that the strength of our democracy is deeply entwined with the strength of our economy. We believe that we all have a collective responsibility to defend our democracy, and we are recommitting ourselves to ensuring that our economy supports our democratic society in providing opportunity, dignity, and security to all.<br> <br>Democracy and capitalism have long stood as twin pillars under-girding American society. Their modern incarnations were both born in 1776 out of the same intellectual movement, and advance the same vision: for decision-making power to rest with the people. Just as we are united, as Americans by a common faith in the democratic values of equality, justice, and liberty, we value the capitalist promise that those who innovate, compete, and take risks will be fairly rewarded. Ultimately, capitalism is what has made possible American democracy, with its promise of shared prosperity and opportunity.<br> <br>A key debate across American history has been of how to balance the competing rights and freedoms guaranteed in each system. Adjusting this balance has allowed our government and economy to adapt to the changes in our values across centuries. However, it is clear to so many of us that the balance between democracy and capitalism is now in a dangerously precarious position. <br> <br>For years, we have prioritized the protection of capitalist rights to seek growth and profit at the expense of democratic commitment to general welfare, as enshrined in our Constitution alongside liberty and prosperity. We now find ourselves with an economy that is obviously structured in ways that exacerbate inequalities at every level. Despite a soaring stock market and rising GDP, the fundamentals of our economy are as broken as the windows smashed by the angry mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6th. Already profound gaps in income, wealth, and opportunity are widening, especially between white and Black families. <br> <br> Most of us are deeply dissatisfied with the status quo, yet feel that we lack the power to change our circumstances. This powerlessness is fundamentally undemocratic and, by extension, un-American. We must change it. <br> <br>Omidyar Network has called for a reimagining of capitalism so that we can once again strike a balance between our democratic and capitalist systems that creates an economy grounded in democratic values. Our goal is to achieve systemic change so that our society is centered on the well-being of individuals and communities, and allows for full economic, democratic, and social participation for all. Our strategy is to transform how economic systems support our society by investing in organizations and individuals working to reshape economic ideas, rules, and power.<br> <br>Replacing Old Ideas<br>Throughout America’s history, we have lived in accordance with a variety of ideas that reflected society’s values at the time — many of which were rightfully discarded as our values evolved. Over the last 50 years, a set of ideas based on individual liberty, the primacy of markets, and a limited role for government have guided our economic policies, and our views of what is possible. Those ideas were built on an even longer history of economic thinking that has perpetually excluded and devalued people because of their race, class, gender, or disability. They are not only outdated, but demonstrably false. <br> <br>We have entered a period of great uncertainty and change, in which ideas and the values that inform them are shifting toward a re-balancing of markets, government, and communities. Our New Economic Paradigm work is experimenting with new ways of thinking and talking about the economy, while seeking to align stakeholders around a coherent new vision for equitable, inclusive, and sustainable capitalism. <br> <br>Rewriting the Rules<br>At its core, our capitalist economy and the ideas that shape it are a reflection of our common values. These ideas are translated into rules which give the economy structure and which govern who can participate in markets, and how. These rules include laws and regulations, as well as norms that govern everything from contracts and property rights, to competition, to employer-employee relationships. Ultimately, the rules that govern and shape markets matter, and they desperately need a rewrite. <br> <br>Our democracy, policies, politics, and markets must be protected and shielded from manipulation and capture by those with the most money,. These rules must be rewritten to direct capitalism toward greater societal outcomes, not the interests of economic or political elites. To that end, we are also exploring ways to rewrite the rules that shape economic structures so that they can support the well-being of everyone in our society. As part of that work, we are looking at opportunities to strengthen market infrastructure, financial systems, and corporate governance norms so that companies and investors can account for their impact on people, communities, and the planet.<br> <br>Reshaping Power <br>Ideas and rules are important, but they become concrete with power. Those who wield power are most likely to see their ideas reflected in the world, to design the economic and social norms governing markets and society, and determine which rules are enforced. This is why democracy, and its ideal of equal power, is so crucial to a capitalist society. Capitalism can certainly exist without democracy, but cannot, alone, guarantee that everyone will have access to opportunities to build a dignified life. We see this around the world, and increasingly in the United States: capitalist, oligopolistic markets are manipulated by the powerful to enrich themselves while exploiting the powerless. Democracy is the critical factor that allows all people equal rights and power to have a say in how capitalism impacts their lives and, more importantly, is the only system ensuring that any person can advocate for change when the capitalist economy is not delivering the basic well-being that is their right.<br> <br>Any true reimagining of capitalism must include checks to balance the power between markets, government, and civil society. So, Omidyar Network is working to reshape how power is distributed across society and the economy. One of our key priorities is to increase worker power and strengthen grassroots movements, since we believe that the economy will only increase the well-being of everyone — businesses, working people, and communities — when working people have individual and collective agency and voice. On the flip side, we are working to ensure that those who have benefited from existing economic structures do not use their economic power to distort either markets or democratic processes. To this end, we are working to curb concentrated corporate power and monopolies, especially in the tech sector, and are exploring strategies to counter corporate influence in our government. <br> <br>Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>The interplay of ideas, rules, and power are ultimately what determine which iterations of capitalism and democracy are possible. Ideas (which reflect our values) guide how we build our society. Rules determine distribution of wealth and power. Power then determines which ideas and rules shape society, and how. It is impossible to create a better form of capitalism or democracy without tackling each at the same time. In doing so, we aim to create a reimagined capitalism that empowers all people to realize their fullest potential as our economy flourishes.</p><p>Last year, we outlined five core pillars that we believe could best support a modern and equitably economy, one committed to values that reflect the inalienable rights of all; built to be not only inclusive, but explicitly anti-racist; capable of exercising true counterweights to economic power; dedicated to fostering a rebalanced relationship between markets, government, and communities; and responsive to the unique challenges we face in the 21st century. <br> <br>We know that we cannot build this alone. It will require deep partnership with a cadre of advocacy organizations and grassroots leaders, intellectuals and academics, business leaders and shareholders, philanthropies, policymakers and concerned citizens alike. We are humbled by the work that has already been done, encouraged by the growing chorus of voices calling for change, and proud to be a part of this effort. <br> <br>Throughout our history, American capitalism and democracy held promise for upward mobility and shared prosperity. Despite the many challenges that lie ahead, we believe we can expand that promise by seizing this moment to reimagine what we can&nbsp;be.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">Reimagining Capitalism Series: An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Sarah Drinkwater, Director, Responsible Technology and Tracy Williams, Director, Reimagining Capitalism</p><a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/11/02/18/google-workers-around-the-world-protest-its-corporate-culture">Photo by Jeenah Moon</a>,&nbsp;Reuters<p>In less than three weeks, nearly 6,000 workers at a fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama will begin voting on whether or not to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. If they vote yes, they will make history as the first American union in Amazon’s&nbsp;history.</p><p>The tech giant, which employs more than 1.1 million people around the world, has so far thwarted all attempts to unionize workers in the United States. The results? “The working conditions are horrible is all I’m willing to say,” <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/amazon-warehouse-workers-in-alabama-they-work-you-to-death/">said one Bessemer employee</a>. “I support a union coming aboard, we need them&nbsp;badly.”</p><p>The efforts to organize the Bessemer warehouse are the latest in a spate of activism by Amazon employees. <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/20/20874497/amazon-climate-change-walkout-google-microsoft-strike-tech-activism">In 2019,</a> more than 1,500 Amazon workers staged a walkout to push the company to lower its carbon footprint. That was followed by a virtual walkout this <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-avoided-unions-25-years-heres-labor-leaders-think-soon-change/">past June</a>, in protest of the firing of several tech workers and warehouse associates who were organizing around social justice and climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>And Amazon workers are not alone. Last summer, software engineer Raksha Muthukumar also found herself in the midst of a battle with a giant tech company. Her offense? She sent her colleagues a GoFundMe list of criminal justice reform groups in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder. “The fear of retaliation has always been great, and we’ve seen retaliation, so this is our chance to protect ourselves,” <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/08/954710407/at-google-hundreds-of-workers-formed-a-labor-union-why-to-protect-ourselves">said Muthukumar</a>.</p><p>On January 4, Muthukumar joined several hundred Google employees in the formation of the <a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/">Alphabet Workers Union</a> (AWU) with support from the Communications Workers of America (CWA). Since the announcement, more than 500 additional people have joined the union, and will now be able to protect themselves with a union&nbsp;card.</p><p>Google’s employees aren’t demanding higher pay. They are fighting to overturn the fundamental concept of shareholder primacy — that Google’s primary goal should be to make as much money as possible. “We will use our reclaimed power to control what we work on and how it is used,” <a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/principles/mission-statement/">AWU wrote in its mission statement</a>. “We will ensure Alphabet acts ethically and in the best interests of society and the environment.”</p><p>This latest development comes after years of frustrated attempts by workers to unite and confront Google management on critical issues, including sexual harassment in the workplace, ethics and the responsible deployment of technology, and partnerships with controversial customers like the US Department of&nbsp;Defense.</p><p>Successful organizing drives don’t just happen. The formation of the Alphabet Workers Union is the culmination of many earlier efforts by Alphabet employees. In December, Dr. Timnit Gebru, a scholar in the race and Artificial Intelligence (AI) field and co-leader of Google’s Ethics in AI team, was ousted ostensibly due to a disagreement over her team’s research after previously speaking out on behalf of minoritized employees. Dr. Gebru’s termination was a defining moment that galvanized many Google employees on their path to forming the&nbsp;union.</p><p>This is all part of a growing movement to organize in the tech industry. Employees at tech firms Kickstarter and Glitch were able to unionize last year, and hundreds of other workers at large tech companies ranging from Microsoft and Facebook, to Salesforce and GitHub, have increased their activism.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/the-gm-score-25-billion-for-stockholders-vs-0-for-uaw-members-24fbd959331e">Omidyar Network</a> stands in solidarity with these workers who are organizing for their rights — and what’s&nbsp;right.</p><p>We believe that increased worker power provides an essential counterweight to the rising dominance of corporations. Over the past several decades, we have seen the economic power of major companies spill over into the political arena, leading to a lopsided power imbalance that has damaged not only the fundamentals of capitalism, but of our democracy as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The solution? Empower workers — from warehouse associates to software engineers — with greater power, agency, and voice at work, both individually and collectively. That goal lies squarely at the intersection of two of Omidyar Network’s key priorities: expanding Worker Power and supporting Responsible Tech Workers. In doing so, we can create a much healthier economy, one that is better for employees, businesses, consumers, and&nbsp;society.</p><p>Through our <a href="https://omidyar.com/responsible-technology/">Responsible Tech</a> work, we’re helping to <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/why-were-investing-in-the-rise-of-the-responsible-tech-worker-a96e74661cdf">provide tech workers</a> with the tools, resources, and space to ask thoughtful questions about responsible tech so they can focus on building solutions that avoid the potential downsides of technology. To that end, we have invested in organizations ranging from <a href="https://home.coworker.org/">Coworker</a>, a mechanism to helps tech workers organize, both within their companies and more broadly to the <a href="https://www.tspa.info/">Trust and Safety Professional Association</a>, to New&nbsp;Public.</p><p>As part of our efforts to <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">Reimagine Capitalism</a> and increase Worker Power, we’re fighting for labor reform policies that increase the power of all workers, and supporting new organizing models that expand worker power to a broader set of working people, whether in the gig economy, in homes, in fields, or in a conventional workplace. Some of our grantees in this area include the <a href="https://www.cleanslateworkerpower.org/">Clean Slate for Worker Power project</a> at Harvard Law School, United for Respect’s <a href="https://www.workitapp.org/">WorkIt app</a>, which uses artificial intelligence to answer workers’ questions about their rights and helps workers organize, and a new coalition focused on advancing worker power in California through policy and advocacy, narrative change, and strengthening organizing, led by the <a href="https://kiwa.org/">Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA</a>). We also work with the <a href="https://www.forworkingfamilies.org/">Partnership for Working Families</a>, and the <a href="http://www.warehouseworkers.org/">Warehouse Workers Resource&nbsp;Center</a>.</p><p>The actions taken by working people to organize at some of America’s most influential tech companies represent a significant step forward in restructuring the social contract between tech giants, the people who work for them, and the society they serve. We’re cheering them&nbsp;on.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/omidyar-network-applauds-tech-employees-who-are-demanding-a-voice-through-unionization-ebbe3bf2b26d">Omidyar Network Applauds Tech Employees Who Are Demanding a Voice Through Unionization</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Jessy Kate Schingler and Primavera de&nbsp;Filippi</p><p>Extitutional theory is an emerging field of scholarship that provides a set of conceptual tools to describe and analyse the underlying social dynamics of a variety of social arrangements, such as communities, companies, organisations, or any other types of institutions.</p><p>Extitutional theory posits that the institutional framework is just one specific lens through which we can make sense of social behaviour. Social dynamics that are not part of an institution are not unstructured, just differently structured. Specifically, institutions focus on the static and inert elements of social structures — the aspects that persist over time — whereas extitutions focus on the dynamic and mutating elements of social structures — the aspects that continuously evolve over time. Both serve as filters to observe different aspects of the underlying social arrangements. This means that if we look at structured social dynamics only and exclusively through an institutional lens, we are only seeing one part of the larger picture. Extitutional theory provides an alternative lens — and the choice to use it is a normative decision to look at another part of the&nbsp;picture.</p>Unknown author; <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=80222262">Public&nbsp;Domain</a>.<p>It is important to note that the extitutional lens is not claiming that there are social dynamics “outside” of an institution, in the Here be Dragons sense of extrapolated but as-yet-unexplored territory; it simply observes the same social dynamics of an institution from another conceptual angle. By relying on the idea that institutions and extitutions are two different interpretations of the same set of social dynamics, we can formalize the characterization of each lens, and begin to examine the underlying structuring logics that distinguish them. Since they represent two different points of view into the same social arrangement, we can also explore the structural relationships that link these two lenses. Extitutional theory attempts to formalize these different ordering logics and the interplay between&nbsp;them.</p><p>For instance, a company is generally composed of a structured set of roles: a board of directors, a series of shareholders, a CEO, a treasurer, etc. — each with their corresponding rights and duties. Instead of these formal roles, the extitutional lens focuses on the social dynamics that animate this structure, which necessarily evolve over time as individuals join or leave the social structure, and as their reciprocal relationships change. The hiring of a new CEO doesn’t mutate the structure from an institutional perspective, yet it could have a significant impact on the social dynamics of the company as whole, because of the different capacities and relationships that the CEO will establish with the other company members. These extitutional dynamics are crucial to the life of institutions, and may impact operational behaviour through culture and more informal principles and&nbsp;values.</p><p>Given that both lenses are looking at the exact same social arrangement — although focusing on different aspects of it — a proper understanding of the underlying social dynamics requires a holistic view, combining both the institutional and extitutional perspective. Indeed, one does not exist without the other: while the operations of a company or organisation are ultimately constrained by the specific rules and roles that constitute the institution, they are fundamentally fueled by the individuals assuming these roles and the corresponding relationships that make up the extitution. Accordingly, the interplay between institutions and extitutions is all the more crucial to explore in the context of complex social arrangements because the two are constantly shaping and influencing each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Extitutional theory is interested not only in the ways that individuals interact and engage with one another through relationships and rhythms, but also in how different practices of institutionalization can create conditions that stabilize and amplify, or erode and suppress, certain extitutional dynamics — and vice versa. Central to the process of institutionalisation is the concept of enclosure: the mechanism through which an institution implements increased control (or coding) relative to a particular domain. Conversely, extitutional theory contrasts enclosure with the concept of exclosure, which recognizes that certain types of enclosures appear to play a different role — that of protecting the activity within it from control and coding. Providing tools to better understand the interplay between these two mechanisms is one of the key contributions of Extitutional theory.</p><p>Extitutional theory does not assign any moral value to institutions or extitutions: neither are good or bad; yet, because of the performativity of these lenses, choosing to look at a particular social arrangement as an institution or an extitution will impact the way we interact with it, as well as the manner in which it will evolve over time. Networked technologies in particular have created dramatic new exclosures giving rise to extitutional dynamics which can’t be understood through the institutional lens alone. Hence, extitutional theory is important not because it is better than institutional theory, but because extitutions are an under-studied phenomena. Understanding extitutional dynamics, and their interplay with the more familiar tools and logics of institutions, can help us respond to the specific, unprecedented demands of human coordination in our&nbsp;era.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/an-introduction-to-extitutional-theory-e74b5a49ea53">An Introduction to Extitutional Theory</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>For the 1.7 billion unbanked adults around the world, access to financial services is extremely limited. Without even a basic savings account, economic opportunity is often limited to informal offerings such as local shopkeepers who extend credit to their customers, microfinance institutions that work to serve the last mile, and community savings and credit associations that are setup by individuals living in the same village.</p>



<p>In the unbanked world, individuals borrow a few hundred to a few thousand dollars at a time, paying back over a relatively short time frame of 12-18 months. But despite excellent credit records, they are unable to receive even similar credit facilities at local banks. This is because the data from their informal transactions is essentially invisible: the banks either do not trust the data sources, or are otherwise unable to verify the provenance of the data. </p>



<p>While this is the state of the world today, it does not have to be our future.  Kiva, a US-based nonprofit organization focused on financial inclusion, has built Kiva Protocol to bridge the data disconnect and help enable universal financial access. In 2019, Sierra Leone, a West African nation of about 7 million, launched the National Digital Identity Platform (NDIP) that used Kiva Protocol to enable fast, cheap, and secure identity verification for its citizens. </p>



<p>Kiva Protocol is built using Hyperledger Indy, Aries, and Ursa, and as implemented in Sierra Leone, allows citizens to perform electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) verifications in about 11 seconds, using just their national ID number and a fingerprint. With this verification, it is possible for the nation’s unbanked to open a savings account and move into the formally banked population.</p>



<p>To find the right platform, Kiva assessed more than 20 software stacks, both centralized and decentralized. Blockchain and decentralized ledger technologies quickly emerged as good solutions for the developing world as they enable data provenance at the protocol level and stakeholders can act relatively independently to enable their various activities in the formal and informal sectors.</p>



<p>After deep consideration, Kiva decided to use Hyperledger’s stack for identity: Indy, Aries, Ursa. While all three projects are closely related, each has a distinct mandate:</p>



  Hyperledger Indy is a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized ID with transferable, private, and secure credentials;  Hyperledger Aries is infrastructure that supports interactions between peers and between blockchains and other DLTs; and  Hyperledger Ursa is a modular, flexible library that enables developers to share time-tested and secure cryptography.  



<p>In August 2019, Kiva launched the beta of Kiva Protocol with a public event opened by the president of Sierra Leone. Since that launch, global regulators have made significant progress in terms of how they are considering digital identity and eKYC verifications. There is a growing global movement towards user-owned and -controlled data, better privacy, and more universal access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of today, Kiva is focusing on building additional ecosystem applications and services to make it easier for all stakeholders to access and use Kiva Protocol. Much of this is being contributed upstream into the Hyperledger Indy and Aires projects, with the remaining components hosted in Kiva’s repository.</p>



<p>Hyperledger teamed up with Kiva on a detailed case study covering the challenges of the unbanked, requirements for a solution that delivers fast, cheap and secure ID exchange, and plans for expanding Kiva Protocols’ use to other countries and other applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital identity is now a fundamental requirement to function in a world that has shifted to remote-first. To empower individuals and to protect their self-sufficiency, the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI) was developed. It grants the individual agency over their interactions and data by putting the data-subject back into the driver-seat.</p> Self-sovereign identity and its use-cases <p>There are plenty of potential use-cases. Our identity isn’t something we can easily explain or which can easily be summarized by single data sets. It highly depends on the context in which it operates and is different depending on the person with whom we interact. One category of use-cases is the proof of certification or qualification of an individual. This proof is required for applications for jobs, grants or the participation in special events. Depending on the requirements, an individual can collect all necessary certificates and present them directly to the relying party. Another big category of use-cases is to enable access to information, buildings or resources. When e.g. information is labeled as “internal only”, the authorized people should be able to access it. Organizations can issue credentials to the right target audience and only approve access for those individuals, which have a valid credential.</p> Wallets and&nbsp;Networks <p>Two elemental components of an SSI-ecosystem are the wallets for end-users and the networks for organisations on which issued credentials are anchored to. In this article, we will explain how these relate to each other, what their specific goals are and how they interact with each other by providing the example of the Lissi wallet and the Indicio&nbsp;Network.</p> About the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet <p>In order to store and possess the credential, an individual requires an application with a graphical user interface to receive, store and present these credentials to third parties. A wallet is a key management application, which hides all the complicated technical aspects from the user and provides the required guidance to securely interact with trusted contacts. The Lissi wallet offers an intuitive interface and provides the necessary information and flexibility to navigate through an increasingly complex digital environment. Furthermore, it automatically recognizes the network, which an organisation used to verify the authenticity of the credential. Hence, while organizations can choose a suitable network, the user is informed about the network, but doesn’t need to do anything to receive the credential or interact with the organisation. Lissi is your smart agent, which takes unnecessary workload from you, provides you with the information to make informed decisions while always offering a&nbsp;choice.</p><p>While the Lissi team is also involved in the formation of the <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion network</a> with its main focus in Europe, we recognize that organisations around the world have different needs. The networks, which are necessary to verify the authenticity of issued credentials, need to be adjusted to different regulatory requirements and the specific demands of their target audience. The network is a distributed and publicly readable database, which contains the public identifier of a legal entity. Therefore, we are committed to not only provide individuals with the choice of their favourite wallet, but also organisations with the choice of their network. We are delighted to announce that the latest version of the Lissi wallet also supports the Indicio&nbsp;Network.</p> About the Indico&nbsp;Network <p><a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio.tech </a>created the Indicio Network to meet the needs of companies and organizations that want a reliable and robust network to build, test, demo, and launch their identity solutions — all the while supported by a team of engineers with extensive experience in decentralized identity, its architecture, and its use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Indicio believes that this “concierge” approach to running a network will accelerate the development, adoption, and use of verifiable digital credentials. This&nbsp;means:</p>  Professional staffing: Indicio’s engineers are among the most experienced in the decentralized identity field and are ready to answer questions, support network operations, and help to get products ready for&nbsp;launch.  Stability for demonstrations: Indicio supports developers at every step of the way from building to testing and public demonstrations.  Cross-network test readiness: Indicio sees the future as one of interoperable credentials and networks. Its network is the perfect platform for testing interoperability by issuing and verifying on multiple networks.  Easy Node Operator onboarding: For those interested in joining a network as a node operator, Indicio has simplified the process, offers training for all levels, and a suite of network tools and resources.  <p>With the Covid pandemic driving urgent need for decentralized identity solutions, Indicio is committed to delivering superlative infrastructure and technical support, and to making decentralized identity as easy to use as possible, whether as a node operator, a developer, an issuer or a verifier.</p> About Indicio <p>Indicio.tech is a professional services firm specializing in decentralized identity architecture, engineering, and consultancy. Indicio provides expert guidance to a global community of clients on the use of verifiable credentials to build digital identity solutions. The decentralized networks and tools created by Indicio make verifiable credentials easy to adopt, simple to deploy, and reliable to use. As a Public Benefit Corporation, Indicio is committed to advancing decentralized identity as a public good that enables people to control their identities online and share their data by consent. Indicio believes in privacy and security by design, interoperability, and supports the open source goals of the decentralized identity community.</p><p>This article was co-written by the Lissi and Indicio team.<br>Cheers</p>

 Key Event Receipt Infrastructure to expand the reach of DIDs&nbsp; <p><br></p> Introduction <p>Work under the <a href="https://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> hood continues on <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>. This new type of digital identifier enables the verification that a DID comes from an authenticable source under the control of a governing entity. A DID is always coupled to a unique DID document that describes how to (i.) interact with a governing entity in a trustable way and (ii.) authenticate a DID controller.</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>This association is defined by a DID method, which can be captured directly through a dedicated namespace in the syntax of the DID. Each method defines the basic chaining and processing requirements - CRUD (create, read, update, deactivate) - for the immutable coupling of the DID and its associated DID document. A DID method specification defines both the DID method and the process of DID resolution, describing how a DID document is to be written and subsequently edited. DIDs come with a unique set of characteristics to provide a prominent solution for digital identifiers in decentralised networks, but there are cons.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">W3C DID Working Group</a> has already registered <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">84 different method types</a>, which raises questions about interoperability, scalability, and security of the current DID methodology, such as (i.) How secure are DIDs and specific DID methods?, and (ii.) Can all DID methods be trusted?</p><p>In this blog post, these questions are addressed from the viewpoint of <a href="https://keri.one">KERI</a> (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure), a novel, simple, and improved DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System) solution for digital identifiers. KERI provides a uniform solution to DID document authentication and resolution that will prove invaluable to use cases where security and interoperability are essential (e.g., for global supply chains and humanitarian applications).</p> Interoperability  DID resolution process, a security weakness <p>Each DID method aims to solve the same problem in a nuanced way by responding to a specific problem or use case uniquely by design. However, from the perspective of the user, this compromises the integrity of the network with a variance of digital assurance for each method implementation.</p><p>From the inclusion of standard Central Authorities (CAs) to the implementation of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), each solution comes with its own set of pros and cons when it comes to tackling digital security. Some rely on the human trust factor, while others rely on cryptographic assurance and, through these nuances, the DID resolution process, inadvertently, becomes a “magic box” with each specific implementation relying on different security measures.&nbsp;</p><p>If interoperability is a core requirement for a specific use case, assessing and maintaining an optimal level of security and assurance may become difficult. To achieve strong security between the DID and its associated DID document, regardless of who controls and stores the DID Document, interacting actors must assume that the result can always be cryptographically assured and, therefore, trusted. If a specific method is ever compromised, the negative connotations could be detrimental to the SSI community as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>With the ever-increasing number of DID methods, Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA) and digital wallet implementations would have to support all methods for full interoperability to be maintained.</p> Security  DID resolution process, the rise of the “Magic Box” <p>Digital security is only as strong as its weakest link. The process of obtaining a DID document for a given DID is called DID resolution and, when it comes to the DID, it is the weakest link. To create a DID, a user must first generate a public / private key pair. The DID can then be coupled to a DID document and usually within an infrastructure to enable that process. The cryptographic link enables a strong binding between the key and the DID. However, when it comes to the DID resolution process, most DID methods either rely on external sources of information or provide a limited scope on the capability and content of the DID document. There is no standard way of creating a strong binding between a DID and DID document, which compromises the security of the identifier. An example of weak binding is demonstrated by the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web method</a>, which simply points to a DID document in the public domain with a DNS (Domain Name System) resolver used for the retrieval process, e.g.:</p><p>did:web:w3c-ccg.github.io:user:alice</p><p>The DID method, a dedicated namespace in the DID syntax, currently defines the DID resolution process. As mentioned in this post’s introduction, the number of registered DID methods continues to rise exponentially.&nbsp;</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>With the rapid rise of decentralised authentication solutions appearing on the market, many different DID methods are currently active under the hood of applications and services which, for the most part, remain invisible to the end-user. Thus popularity, rather than security, has become the driving factor behind chosen DID methods. Due to this fragmentation, identifying and resolving weak security points of deployed DID methods continues to be cumbersome. Some of the method types, such as the <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DID method</a>, enable the derivation of a DID document directly from the DID itself. However, most rely on external processing to resolve the document, with the source providing a hidden "magic box" that masks the DID resolution process. To maintain system integrity, any DID method that requires external processing via a “magic box” requires trust from all interacting actors. Trust is a human trait. Cryptographic assurance, a machine trait, can often be overlooked in the presence of trust.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital security stems from the resolution process but, with the current DID methodology, a uniform standard is not available across all implementations, which can lead to fragmentation and security risks across the network.</p> How to maintain interoperability &amp; security <p>The weak binding issue between a DID and DID document can be resolved by a technological solution that provides an immutable link between the two objects. In doing so, a DID document can be cryptographically verified for correctness as there is an immutable coupling to a specific DID.&nbsp;</p> Cryptographic hash&nbsp; <p>Cryptographic assurance is provided by generating a hash of the DID document, to be used as the actual identifier. The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key method</a> works in this way. However, this approach is limited as there is no way of rotating the keys, revoking the identifier, or adding additional information to the DID document.</p> Key Event Receipt Infrastructure 








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p><a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a> (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) is a protocol that provides a simple set of rules on how to achieve strong bindings between the controller, identifier, and key pair, without sacrificing the functional capabilities of the identifier. It achieves this through solid security principles in its base architecture. KERI generates a type of “DID document” in the form of an appendable private micro-ledger that contains cryptographically-linked sets of events for transaction verification purposes. In doing so, KERI facilitates sapored data supply chains providing an append-only chained <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/kid0000.md">key-event log</a> (KEL) of signed transfer statements, which account for the source of the identifier and all transactions related to it.</p><p>In current KERI implementations, the genesis state of the identifier is “active” as defined by the Human Colossus model of <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/active-and-passive-identifiers">Identifier States</a>, meaning that a signing key is required to authenticate the controller. As a self-certifying identifier with an event log, KERI provides a strong binding between the DID and DID document, thereby enabling all DID identifier operations (e.g., key rotation, delegation, and interaction) to be tracked and cryptographically verified by any recipient of the identifier information. For instances where a controller's keys are compromised, a pre-rotation mechanism for key recoverability is also available. These security-rich enhancements suggest that a magic box, along with any associated weak binding issues, can be benched in favour of KERI, which promises to provide a simple, yet improved, alternative DKMS-solution for digital identifiers.</p><p>In the current version of the DID specification, location is identifiable via the method space. For example, the <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">did:sov method</a> assigns a DID to the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin</a> MainNet ledger. Other DID methods define the resolution rules for other unique implementations. In terms of security, this level of tailor-made differentiation between use cases can become an attack vector. Having to maintain an ever-growing registry of DID methods and implementation specifics suggests a scalability issue in the current methodology. These issues are disadvantageous to the whole SSI community.<br><br>To solve these issues, KERI introduces a component called Resolver, which provides a mechanism to discover identifiers. Resolver simply maps identifiers to URLs or IP addresses where users can either obtain (or be directed to) auditable identifier event logs. The resolver relies on a distributed hash table (DHT) algorithm, known for its beneficial characteristics in autonomy, decentralization, fault tolerance, and scalability, a good example being <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> (InterPlanetary File System) or <a href="https://gnunet.org/en/index.html">GNUnet</a>.&nbsp;</p> Simple and concise <p>The beauty of&nbsp; KERI is that the user can nominate locations through the event log with full autonomy to make edits or location transfers as they wish. To highlight a prevalent issue with the current DID methodology, a DID method may assign an identifier to the Sovrin MainNet but, after a few months, the controller may wish to move it to a new location such as the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> network or an IPFS location. As it currently stands, there is no restriction on the number of identifiers that can be issued to identify the same object. The generation of duplicate identifiers for the same content despite the encoded part of the DID remaining unaltered is problematic. By removing the method space, the identifier can be used on any network, thus providing a truly interoperable solution for decentralised identifiers.</p><p>With KERI, a cryptographically-verifiable DID document is available to a recipient without requiring prior knowledge of the exact location of the object. In the absence of having to define a specific network or alternative storage location in the DID syntax, the namespace for any “magic box” method becomes redundant, along with any fragmentation issues that have arisen from the current DID methodology. In the future, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-syntax">DID syntax</a> as defined in the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</a> specification, could evolve from …</p><p>did:&lt;method&gt;:&lt;identifier&gt;</p><p>to</p><p>did:&lt;identifier&gt;<br></p><p>The road ahead may be long, but the effort worthwhile, as the revised syntax could bring about an adoption factor where (i.) security is a primary concern (e.g., humanitarian sector) or (ii.) stakeholders for a given business process are numerous and operate in different jurisdictions (e.g., global supply chains).</p> Conclusion &amp; Further developments <p>The current generation of DIDs has introduced an innovative approach to digital identifiers, which has triggered the SSI movement. However, the inclusion of the method space in the DID syntax has led to fragmentation and weak security properties of the identifier type. These known method-space issues give the community impetus to redress them. In light of these innovative developments, now is the time to embrace KERI as an improved interoperable and secure solution for digital identifiers.</p><p>KERI is a truly secure network-agnostic decentralised infrastructure for digital identifiers.</p><p>Within <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, a Linux Foundation Project, trustees of the Human Colossus Foundation have convened an <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+and+Semantics+Working+Group">Inputs and Semantics Working Group</a> (ISWG), subdivided into an <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+Domain+Group">Inputs Domain Group</a> (ISWG-I) and a <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Semantic+Domain+Group">Semantic Domain Group</a> (ISWG-S).

<p>The term Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is rapidly growing in popularity, bit what is it?</p>
<p>SSI is a concept was created as a result of a long quest to find the new way to help create an electronic identity for the Internet that would on one hand allow individuals (and things) to share details on their identity with various websites and applications and, on the the other hand, ensure that this identity doesn’t leak more information than required (e.g. I’m over 18 years old) and can’t be tracked across services (e.g. my employer doesn’t know that I’m talking to several banks to get a mortgage).</p>
<p>SSI as a term can be tracked to the works of Devon Loffretto (“individuals have an established right to an identity” – <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">see here</a>). Christopher Allen, a cryptographer known for his contribution to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> , chose the term Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp; as the name for a new manifesto of 10 foundational principles for digital identity, which he published in a <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">post</a> titled&nbsp; “The Path to the Self-Sovereign Identity” on April 25, 2016. In this Blog post, he has outlined the history of on-line identity and described how these principles should guide the creation of the new identity system.</p>
<p>In his own words</p>
<blockquote><p>These principles attempt to ensure the user control that’s at the heart of self-sovereign identity. However, they also recognize that identity can be a double-edged sword — usable for both beneficial and maleficent purposes. Thus, an identity system must balance transparency, fairness, and support of the commons with protection for the individual.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result the following principles were formulated :</p>
 
 Existence 
 Control 
 Access 
 Transparency 
 Persistance 
 Portability 
 Interoperability 
 Consent 
 Minimalization 
 Protection 
 
<p>The ideas from the article and the principles served SSI community well and helped foster progress on implementing various technical approaches and define initial standards (e.g. W3C DID).</p>
<p>Fast forward to Dec 2020.</p>
<p>Sovrin Foundation, the leading global organizations that created the first functioning global utility network for SSI, <a href="https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/">publishes</a> a revised set of principles that builds on the original vision created by Christoper Allen in 2016.</p>
<p>The updated set of principles include the following 12 items:</p>
 
 Representation 
 Interoperability 
 Decentralization 
 Control &amp; Agency 
 Participation 
 Equity and Inclusion 
 Usability, Accessibility, and Consistency 
 Portability 
 Security 
 Verifiability and Authenticity 
 Privacy and Minimal Disclosure 
 Transparency 
 
<p>The main differences to the 10 SSI principles include decomposition of some of the original ones into separate categories, so that it’s easier to reason whether or not a service really adheres to the key ideas and goals of SSI. There is also emphasis on applicability of the SSI systems and Identities that can represent not only humans, but also legal entities and machines. The latter is very important for the future use-cases&nbsp; that will include fully digital, automated business processes, services and products produced and consumed by&nbsp; individuals, their AI driven agents, IoT devices and legal entities, which can can have completely new forms of ownership, such as Decentralised Autonomous Organisations.</p>
<p>This is a very welcome contribution to the emerging body of knowledge and best practices in the SSI space. From our viewpoint, these principles should be the foundation of the future eID Law and ecosystem in Switzerland, as they create a strong and sustainable foundation for the transformation of all key everyday processes for the digital future, without endangering the key values of federalism, democracy, freedom and pluralism that make Switzerland what it is today.</p>

<p>We have exciting news to share: CCI has a home&nbsp;now!</p><p>When the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI)</a> was formed in April 2020, we were a self-organizing group of companies and individuals, held together by a few mailing lists and working groups, to explore how Verifiable Credentials (VCs), an open standard and an emerging technology, could be used for the public health crisis unfolding with COVID-19. Recognizing our limits early on as an informal group, we quickly pivoted from developing a solution together to supporting each other to build for their local contexts. Over the course of nine months, we have seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dbWvs1m8uziTsbhUQv_nPofTXAyDSkxI5CZtoo1SlRY/edit?ts=5e85430a#heading=h.eu5hdldar29h">over 20 projects present their work</a> to the CCI community and developed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s7oEESllR9pa4ecXNGfougaHmDBzDBh1KHKvIsy0dPw/edit?usp=sharing">an MVP governance framework</a> that can be adapted to specific COVID-19 use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>As our work evolved and as vaccine development showed promising progress, the need to align efforts around VCs for COVID-19 and educate decision-makers on the use of VCs for COVID-19 became clearer and stronger. However, the limits of not having a formal organizational home hinder us from engaging with key stakeholders and conducting necessary development efforts. So, we began exploring options for a home in&nbsp;summer.</p><p>Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) emerged in the middle of the pandemic, right after we started our search. There was a natural alignment between LFPH and CCI on building on open standards to ensure interoperability and developing open-source code bases of minimal-viable privacy-preserving software components to make interoperability easier and cheaper to implement. So here we are today; after achieving success with privacy-preserving exposure notification apps, LFPH officially took CCI in before the end of 2020, kicking off our journey to advance the use of VCs for public health with vaccination record as a&nbsp;start.</p><p>At the tail end of holiday spirits, we hope to spread our joy by sharing with you the invitation letter (below in italics) from Brian Behlendorf, the Executive Director of LFPH. You can find the official press release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lfph.io/2020/12/16/press-release/">here</a>.</p><blockquote>Dear CCI Community,</blockquote><blockquote>We are excited to extend this invitation to you to join <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> and work together with us to advance the use of Verifiable Credentials and data and technical interoperability of Verifiable Credentials in the public health&nbsp;realm.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH) was founded in July 2020 as a collaborative effort to combat COVID-19 and future epidemics through building, securing, and sustaining open- source software to help public health authorities (PHAs). We started with exposure notification apps and have achieved success with <a href="https://github.com/covidgreen/covid-green-app">COVID Green™</a> and <a href="https://www.covidshield.app/">COVID Shield™</a>, which are being deployed in 4 US states and 7 countries around the world. The early achievements were made possible within such a short time frame through our merger with <a href="https://www.lfph.io/tcn-coalition/">TCN Coalition</a>, a global community promoting privacy-preserving and interoperable exposure notification apps.</blockquote><blockquote>As COVID-19 tests mature and vaccines are around the corner, we have identified an increasing demand for responsible and interoperable credentialing solutions to issue and manage COVID-19 credentials, especially vaccine records, from PHAs. Therefore, we would like to work with the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI), supporting you to build on your existing work and enabling open-source development for vaccine records or key components of it, which can be implemented widely by PHAs with the help of the CCI community. We view this as a starting point of a long-term partnership to advance the adoption of verifiable credentials for wider public health use cases, such as patient ID and patient centered information exchange.</blockquote><blockquote>At LFPH, we have been following CCI’s work; we value the resources and assets created by the community and the tight relationships you have developed with small, grassroots solution providers. We foresee the scope of our partnership to go beyond open-source software development. The nature of the problem we are solving requires us to build solutions that are interoperable, so we are committed to supporting CCI in leading work around open standards, e.g. definitions and schemas for public health credentials. We also will provide CCI resources to strengthen community and knowledge building, broaden and deepen engagement with key stakeholders (e.g. PHAs, commercial entities, software vendors, relevant identity and technical communities) and conduct public and strategic advocacy.</blockquote><blockquote>As the next step, we will join the CCI Group Update call on December 11 from 10 to 11 am ET to answer any questions you have. In the meantime, we plan to commission the following three members of the CCI Community Guidance Team to lead the migration of CCI into LFPH once the community is&nbsp;ready:</blockquote><blockquote>- Lucy Yang, Co-Lead of the Coordination and Communications Workstream of&nbsp;CCI</blockquote><blockquote>- John Walker, Co-Lead of the Coordination and Communications Workstream of&nbsp;CCI</blockquote><blockquote>- Kaliya Young, the Identity Woman, an active contributor at CCI and a super-connector in the credential community. (Kaliya made the initial connection between CCI and LFPH and facilitated the formation of the partnership.)</blockquote><blockquote>While LFPH does offer different levels of paid <a href="https://www.lfph.io/join/become-a-member/">membership</a> for companies and we welcome interested parties to join, membership will not be a requirement for individuals and organizations to participate in any CCI activities. We will strive to respect the community-driven and open nature of CCI to the maximum during migration and onwards, and only leverage LFPH’s structure and infrastructure to improve efficiencies and effectiveness.</blockquote><blockquote>This is a strong alignment of efforts between two communities that share the same vision and aspiration. We look forward to meeting you and working with&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>Brian Behlendorf</blockquote><blockquote>Managing Director for Blockchain, Healthcare and&nbsp;Identity</blockquote><blockquote>The Linux Foundation</blockquote><p>Happy New Year! We appreciate your support in 2020 and look forward to working together for a better&nbsp;2021.</p>

 2020 — How SSI Went Mainstream <p>January 12,&nbsp;2021</p> An introduction to SSI and where it came from.<br>2020 as a growth catalyst and where SSI is going.<br>A <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a> perspective. <p>Written by:<br>Chris Raczkowski — Sovrin Foundation, Chairman of the Board of Trustees<br>Drummond Reed — Evernym, Chief Trust Officer; ToIP, Steering Committee Member</p><p>It goes without saying that last year was transformational for the world. Along with pains felt by many, the challenges of 2020 were also a catalyst for positive growth. The global SSI community, dedicated to privacy-respecting digital identity, has risen to these challenges. Digital identity solutions have been called into action by governments and companies large and small to help mitigate pandemic-related public health challenges. This call to action has accelerated adoption of SSI across many use cases where it brings new standards of truly privacy-respecting digital identity control to all peoples of the&nbsp;world.</p> But first, what is&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI is an acronym for self-sovereign identity, representing the secure, privacy-respecting digital identity model developed around blockchain technology starting in 2016. During the last five years acceptance of this model has grown rapidly. SSI utilizes best practices in open-source cryptography and decentralized computing in tandem with humanistic governance. It also helped drive development of new technology open standards such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>. While SSI incorporates a wide range of complex technology and detailed governance, its essence is captured in the opening chapter of a book that will be published during&nbsp;2021:</p><blockquote>“The best overall analogy for the decentralized identity model (SSI) is in fact exactly the way we prove our identity to each other every day: by getting out our wallet and showing the credentials we have obtained from other trusted parties.&nbsp;... With decentralized digital identity, we just do this with digital wallets, digital credentials, and digital connections.” ¹</blockquote><blockquote>SSI has emerged as a, “simple, neutral, memorable name for this new model for digital identity.” ²</blockquote> Open Source and Open Standards: Growth Engines of&nbsp;SSI <p>SSI is rooted in core principles of privacy-respecting Internet-scale identity architecture first laid out by individuals like Kim Cameron with his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352/#lawsofiden_topic3">Laws of Identity</a>, which were published in 2006. Such governance principles, combined with open-source technology advances in blockchain, cryptography, supporting software and standards, ultimately gave rise to reliable SSI infrastructure starting in 2017. Open-source development of digital identity technology, standards and principles is truly the engine of SSI&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>, a not-for-profit corporation, was established in 2016 to promote global adoption of SSI as an open standard for digital identity. Over the past five years the Foundation has operated the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sovrin Ledger</a> as the best-known SSI identity network, helped advanced the most widely used SSI open-source software (Hyperledger Indy, Ursa, and Aries), published the most widely used <a href="https://sovrin.org/governance-framework/">SSI governance framework</a>, and drives SSI thought leadership in areas including data protection, financial inclusion, IoT, and government-issued ID. In its role as an originator and disseminator of open-source SSI concepts and code, the Sovrin Foundation is dedicated to supporting SSI development in cooperation with companies, organizations and governments around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>One of the most important products of this work is the “Sovrin Stack,” shown in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>Figure 1: The Sovrin Stack, developed by the Sovrin Foundation and the global SSI community, was created in early 2019 and is curated as part of the open-source Sovrin Governance Framework.<p>The Sovrin Stack was the first conceptualization of SSI infrastructure as a four-layer stack, where the lower two layers provide cryptographic trust needed for machine-to-machine communications and the upper two layers provide human trust needed for business, legal, and social interactions.</p><p>The Sovrin Stack also represents the first recognition of the critical role governance frameworks play in bridging the technological innovations of SSI with real-world policy requirements of governments, industries, businesses and individuals. In fact, as the importance of governance frameworks became more widely acknowledged, the SSI community recognized that specialized governance was needed at all four layers of the stack. During early 2020 the Sovrin Stack evolved into the Trust over IP (ToIP) stack, shown in Figure&nbsp;2.</p>Figure 2: The ToIP stack, showing how governance frameworks apply to all four layers of the stack, and also how Layer 4 can support entire digital trust ecosystems.<p>As a model for decentralized digital trust infrastructure at Internet-scale, the ToIP stack was compelling enough that in May 2020 it became the cornerstone of a new Linux Foundation project called the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP Foundation</a>. Rapid growth of ToIP Foundation membership is a testament to how core concepts of SSI architecture are strongly supported by respected governments and companies.</p><p>Emergence of entirely new organizations promoting SSI adoption is evidence of the effectiveness of the Sovrin Foundation’s open-source approach to advancing technology and thought leadership. The Foundation’s success is measured not only in by results it delivers, but in the progress of derivative and novel SSI products and services created by organizations which build on contributions of Sovrin and the global SSI community.</p> 2019: Early success ahead of unexpected crisis <p>Prior to the global public health crisis of 2020, SSI was progressing along a steadily increasing adoption curve. Start-up companies, global corporations, digital identity privacy organizations and a variety of national and regional governments (Canada, UK, US, Germany, British Columbia, Ontario, etc.) were all expanding SSI infrastructure and launching initial use cases. This advancement was based on vigorous technology development (open-source software architecture, code and standards), a robust global public identity utility (the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sovrin Ledger</a>), the first comprehensive decentralized digital identity governance framework (the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/">Sovrin Governance Framework</a>), and proof of concept use cases produced by a variety of governments and companies.</p><p>Woven throughout this activity, the Sovrin Foundation acted as a convener, facilitator and beacon for the global SSI community. The Foundation’s commitment to the <a href="https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/">Principles of SSI</a>, open-source technology and identity ecosystem governance, combined with efforts to sow the ethos of SSI across a spectrum of use-cases, helped to create fertile ground for emergent applications. During this course of activities Sovrin and the SSI community unknowingly primed the world for tremendous acceleration of SSI adoption during a most unexpected year.</p> 2020: The SSI Springtime <p>As the world embarked on a new decade at the start of 2020, almost no one could have guessed what their lives and societies would look like 365 days later. Public health challenges of 2020 brought tremendous stress and grief to most corners of the world. Yet, the situation also created opportunity for unprecedented growth of technologies that could address urgent social needs. For SSI, this meant compressing what could have been a five-to-ten-year adoption process for sensitive use-cases into a period of 12&nbsp;months.</p><p>During normal times, new technology standards for critical services such as medical information credentials, travel credentials and critical worker credentials often face regulatory review and approval marathons spanning years or even decades. Fortunately, prior to 2020, the core components of SSI had already been assessed and accepted by respected companies and governments. These organizations understood that trusted digital identity must be privacy-respecting, which is a central requirement for SSI technology and governance. With solutions needed immediately for verifiable proof of medical test results, vaccination status, etc., the standards and technology developed with the support of the Sovrin Foundation and the global SSI community have been fast-tracked into&nbsp;service.</p><p>Just a few of the SSI implementations that were launched in 2020 or are pending launch in early 2021&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/publications/travel-pass/">IATA Travel Pass</a> will be the first verifiable credential capable of providing proof of COVID-19 test and vaccination status at airports around the&nbsp;world,  <a href="https://www.digitalhealth.net/2020/03/covid-19-nhs-to-trial-digital-passports-to-free-up-staff-movement/">NHS Staff Passport</a> is the first portable digital identity credential for doctors and nurses in one of the largest public healthcare networks in the&nbsp;world,  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about/this-is-gleif">GLEIF</a> (the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation), based in Switzerland and the only global online source that provides open, standardized and high quality legal entity reference data, is <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/lei-corporate-digital-identity-verifiable-credentials-did/">committed to following the SSI model</a> for digital identity credentials for companies.  <a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Redaktion/DE/Standardartikel/SchaufensterSichereDigIdentProjekte/sdi-projekt_ssi.html">SSI4DE</a>, co-funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs, supports showcases for secure digital identities in Germany, and <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/e-personalausweis-alternative-zu-google-und-facebook-merkel-macht-digitale-identitaet-zur-chefsache/26684942.html?ticket=ST-22324660-c75hUhsrgC4moLTe3uGj-ap3">Chancellor Angela Merkel declared digital identity as a priority</a> matter during December&nbsp;2020.  <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass</a> brings SSI to financial services with Credit Union customer identity verification,  <a href="https://www.farmerconnect.com/">Farmer Connect</a> is realizing is vision to “Humanize consumption through technology” by enabling and empowering individual coffee farmers to more easily work with global enterprises, and reducing costs and inefficiencies for large companies to work directly with small and often remote&nbsp;farmers.  <a href="https://www.lumedic.io/perspectives/introducing-lumedic-connect">Lumedic Exchange</a> is the first network designed exclusively for patient-centric exchange of healthcare data using SSI-based verifiable credentials.  <p>While scientists and professionals in the fields of biology, genetics, immunology, medicine and public health are the superstars of 2020, SSI is also in a position to make a major contribution. Reliable digital credentials for medical test results and vaccination status, in the form of W3C Verifiable Credentials backed by privacy-respecting governance, can help societies more safely return to normal levels of social interaction and restart economies.

<p>Release Date: January 5th 2021</p>



<p>Today, the IoT Security Foundation (IoTSF) and FIDO Alliance announced that they are collaborating to improve the status of IoT security.</p>



<p>The main aims of the collaboration are to raise awareness on the limitations of passwords for IoT devices and provide practical alternatives for product manufacturers. The goals of the collaboration will be achieved by joint messaging and providing publicly accessible materials to help industry implement password-less authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s the problem with passwords?</p>



<p>Passwords are a traditional and simple method for authenticating a user and allowing access to resources. In the past this may have been sufficient, but passwords dramatically fall short in many ways when billions of devices are expected to be connected to networks to collect and share data or provide automation – the era of IoT.</p>



<p>Although this is not a new problem, users are still finding it a challenge to manage and keep track of different accounts and app login credentials. The result is that many take shortcuts – using easy to remember (and guess) passwords, or using the same password across many accounts1. This weakens security. Now consider the growing number of home, business, medical, industrial and national infrastructure uses of IoT which bring efficiency, innovation and user benefits. IoT devices are everywhere and the trend is set to continue as <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-many-iot-devices-are-there/">this article</a> illustrates. For IoT-class products such as routers and webcams, traditionally manufacturers have opted to have factory universal default passwords2 and whilst these can be changed, a significant number remain set to the default. This makes them prime targets for botnets which weaponize devices for DDOS attacks such as the famous Mirai and its many variants.</p>



<p>This means that the sheer volume of devices is only going to exacerbate the issues experienced with passwords today. In summary, passwords are not a good solution to the requirements of IoT authentication now, or in the future.</p>



<p>How can this be addressed?</p>



<p>New standards and forthcoming regulation are helping to drive change. The ETSI 303 6453 baseline requirements for consumer IoT cyber security standard published mid 2020, has a provision for “no universal default passwords” and this standard is now being used as a basis for regulation and certification schemes internationally4.</p>



<p>Whilst “no universal passwords” is a good start for regulation5, it does not go far enough. The good news is that there are good alternatives to passwords, so they can be eliminated, and they are also better and simpler to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How are IoTSF and FIDO Alliance working together?</p>



<p>Both organisations will work together to promote the awareness and use of password-less forms of authentication and link working group activities to ensure industry can access publicly available materials when designing new products.</p>



<p>The IoT Technical Working Group of the FIDO Alliance aims to build a comprehensive authentication framework for IoT devices which provides detailed technical specifications for password-less authentication.</p>



<p>The IoT Security Foundation publishes best practice cyber security advice for product manufacturers and users of IoT systems. Its IoT Security Compliance Framework Working Group is dedicated to the creation and maintenance of the framework which guides developers through a structured process of questioning and evidence gathering. This helps companies make better products with security by design. It is in this area where both organisations intend to collaborate at the technical level to complement the advocacy of passwords alternatives.</p>



<p>John Moor, Managing Director IoTSF said, “The use of passwords for security is an outdated and outmoded security practice for the digital age. There are solutions which are stronger from a technical perspective and better from a user’s perspective. We are delighted to be working closely with the FIDO Alliance to help eliminate the use of passwords and drive better practice for our manufacturing members.”</p>



<p>Christina Hulka, executive director and COO of the FIDO Alliance said, “The FIDO Alliance mission is to reduce the world’s reliance on passwords with simpler and stronger authentication, including in IoT which unfortunately continues to rely on default or weak password authentication. We look forward to working with the IoT Security Foundation to accelerate our path toward bringing passwordless authentication to IoT.”</p>

 About the FIDO Alliance 



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="http://www.fidoalliance.org">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

				 <p>In 2020 aNewGovernance, Onecub, and Visions have participated with Capgemini in a report for the French Banque des Territoire on the state of the art for Self-Data, and personal data sharing:</p>
<p>In the context of strong digitization of activities and services, the question of control and protection of personal data is a key issue. With this in mind, in 2018 the DPMR was created to provide a framework for the collection and use of data. Also, for a trusted digital world, a new concept is beginning to emerge: self-data.</p>
<p>Self-data can be defined in a few words as «&nbsp;the production, exploitation, and sharing of personal data by individuals, under their control and for their own purposes&nbsp;» (definition given by the New Generation Internet Foundation).</p>
<p>At the crossroads of data governance and digital trust, the control of personal data by each individual is a challenge for the digital projects of European public and private players. However, the construction of such a model also depends on the ability to remove obstacles on the technical, political, legal, and economic levels. This is why the Bank of Territories is publishing a study that proposes an inventory of the ecosystem of self-data actors.</p>
<p>This document aims to provide a clear and updated vision of the actors who propose solutions to implement self-data, the brakes and levers that need to be taken into account, and initiatives that can serve as an example to embark in turn on such a project.</p>

 Internet Shutdowns in&nbsp;2021  Rethinking advocacy strategies <p>It’s that time of the year again when expert analysts take a gaze into the future and proffer an outlook for the year ahead. In international affairs perhaps there is none as eminent as The Economist magazine’s “<a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2020/11/16/ten-trends-to-watch-in-the-coming-year">The world in 2021</a>’’ — insights that leaders in politics, business, and finance draw from to shape personal, institutional, and national agendas for the incoming&nbsp;year.</p><p>In digital rights, it is perhaps also apt to take a look at the incoming year to prepare for whatever it might throw up. An important trend to anticipate in the coming year is Internet shutdowns, and their impact on freedom of expression, political participation, and societal development, particularly in the global&nbsp;south.</p>Photo: <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/background-data-network-web-3228704/">Pixabay</a><p>Internet shutdowns have become a common tactic deployed in the past decade by authoritarian regimes to restrict human rights and citizen mobilization, particularly around political events such as elections and mass protests. The digital rights organization AccessNow documented at least <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/#problem">213 shutdowns</a> in the year 2019 across 33 countries. In 2020 some of the countries that shut down the Internet include <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/ethiopia-enters-3rd-week-of-internet-shutdown-after-unrest/2020/07/14/4699c400-c5d6-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/31/end-internet-shutdowns-manage-covid-19">Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar</a>. For the year 2021, we get the sense it is simply a question of when, rather than if there will be Internet shutdowns. However, there is no escaping the fact that this blunt tool of human rights repression is largely a feature of countries in the global south. In Africa, <a href="https://cipesa.org/2019/03/despots-and-disruptions-five-dimensions-of-internet-shutdowns-in-africa/">research</a> by the digital rights organization CIPESA revealed a correlation between government styles and the incidence of Internet shutdowns. Internet shutdowns occur less frequently in real, functioning democracies, and more in <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1576745/african-dictatorships-shut-down-the-internet-the-most/">authoritarian regimes</a>, the research&nbsp;noted.</p><p>The persistence of Internet shutdowns in authoritarian regimes despite perennial advocacy efforts by civil society organizations perhaps suggests the need for a shift in advocacy strategies to combat it. The first evolution of advocacy strategies to combat Internet shutdowns focused on the human rights angle — appealing to the governments and corporate actors who implemented shutdowns to see that shutdowns amounted to trampling on human rights of freedom of opinion, expression, and association. No other document encapsulates this approach as <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/un-passes-resolution-condemning-internet-shutdowns/">the resolution</a> by the UN Human Rights Council stating that human rights enjoyed offline also apply&nbsp;online.</p><p>This approach did not always work, necessitating the second evolution of advocacy strategies targeting shutdowns. Rather than focusing only on the human rights angle, these strategies also highlighted the economic losses shutdowns foist on economies. Examples of this approach include research by the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/intenet-shutdowns-v-3.pdf">Brookings Institution</a>, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/kr/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/the-economic-impact-of-disruptions-to-internet-connectivity-report-for-facebook.html">Deloitte</a>, and <a href="https://cipesa.org/?wpfb_dl=252">CIPESA</a> detailing in figures the losses accruing to the economies of nations that implement shutdowns. Given that some of the countries which implement shutdowns are also among the poorest in the world, this advocacy approach held some promise. This promise was however disappointed, as it emerged that the regimes which implemented shutdowns were more swayed by the survival of their regimes than economic considerations. Occasionally there was the counter-argument proffered by some of these states that although Internet shutdowns resulted in economic losses, they were nevertheless implemented to prevent even bigger losses and the collapse of&nbsp;states.</p><p>All these bring us to a third way. If these two illustrious approaches to Internet shutdown advocacy have not been effective, there has to be a better way. In the observation that Internet shutdowns persist in authoritarian regimes and are rare in functioning democracies perhaps lies a path to effective advocacy strategies. As has been touted in recent years in development circles, what if the future of digital rights advocacy lies in its participation in broader advocacy efforts that target broader societal reforms in the electoral process, government accountability and transparency, and development? This can be achieved, for instance, by digital rights advocacy <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/news/internet-shutdowns-africa-it-being-cut-world">organizations collaborating</a> with the broader human rights community.</p><p>Internet shutdowns and other digital rights abuses do not spring out of a vacuum. Instead, they proceed from broader dysfunctional societal systems needing reform. If, in general, societies heal and reform in the broad areas of electoral processes, accountability and transparency, and development, in time this progress will seep into better digital rights standards. This approach takes time but is sustainable. The new year 2021 is another opportunity to intensify our efforts in adopting new methods in advocating against Internet shutdowns.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/internet-shutdowns-in-2021-c2a4e8dd4845">Internet shutdowns in 2021</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Rinku Lamba, Rajarshi Dasgupta, Mohinder Singh, Valerian Rodrigues &amp; Shefali&nbsp;Jha  Session <p>Indian politics had witnessed the entry of new social movements in the 1970s, adding a whole set of new issues, actors, and ways of activism to the older nationalist tradition. We suggest a similar change is now taking place, as different ways of governance and interventions aided by latest technologies are emerging in the social media. Websites, blogs, tweets, emails and online petitions are creating a new virtual space for politics, through information, propaganda, debates, appeals and mobilizations.</p><p>The proposed session will discuss this emerging field of power, critically considering its democratic potential and interrogating the political issues and ideas at stake in it. The aim is to tackle the new forms of civic and public-political engagements witnessed in the domain of social media, and analyze their implications for the theory and practice of democracy. In the process our papers would explore conceptual notions such as agency, political act and participation as well as notions of selfhood and subjectivity.</p> Plan <p>We will present four papers, with a question-answer and discussion session at the end. The papers will be addressing broadly three kinds of concerns.</p>  The first concern is to identify novel understandings of the political and political acts in the social media. We ask the following questions in this regard: What are the political issues and ideas at stake and how do they affect conventional understandings of democracy? Who are the new actors outside the fray of party-centered politics and how do they see what is political in the acts of internet-users? How are political institutions including parties reacting to the phenomena?  The second concern relates to probing the new forms of political subjectivity that are emerging in this process. The questions here include: What kind of political actor is getting shaped by the forms of political participation engendered by the social media? How does the virtual nature of practice impact on questions of location and identity as determinants of political membership and political action? Is this nature of virtual participation too fluid for the state to&nbsp;control?  The third concern relates to the forms of exclusion and inclusion that virtual participation entails. This involves questions like: What kind of social capital is necessary for talking part in the process and does it cut across cultural and economic divisions? What kinds of interest drive the social media? How does it shape the meaning of political concepts like representation and rights, accountability and political agency?  <p>It is likely that we will raise more questions than we can answer at this point. However, we think it is important to raise them all the more in keeping with the questions that make up the focus of the conference, especially, the first question of how do we conceptualize, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India.</p> Readings <p>None.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day2.PoliticsOnSocialMedia">IRC 2016: Day 2 #Politics On Social Media : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Rinku Lamba is Assistant Professor at the Centre for Political Studies in<br>Jawaharlal Nehru University.

<p>In Fall 2020, Blockchain Commons continued to work on creating architectures, specifications, and applications to support blockchain infrastructure.</p>

<p>This has included:</p>

 
   Releasing a trio of Gordian Cosigner apps; 
   Advancing wallet interoperability specifications in the Airgapped Wallet community that we host; 
   Researching new multisig specifications; 
   Releasing a third platform for our seedtool application; 
   Publishing Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line 2.0; 
   Debuting our new torgap architecture; 
   Organizing our reference crypto libraries and applications; 
   Starting a DID architecture review; 
   Working on Digital Identity laws; and 
   Starting our 2021 blockchain internship program. 
 

<p>Here’s a bit more information on everything:</p>

<p>Gordian Cosigner Releases. We have released alpha versions of the entire Gordian Cosigner family of apps, for <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Android">Android</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Catalyst">iOS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-macOS">MacOS</a>. These applications support the signing of multisig transactions in an airgapped manner, creating a new level of support for what we see as the future of Bitcoin transactions. Though the iOS and MacOS apps were created in-house, the Android app was developed by Bitmark, who is both a sustaining and contributing sponsor to Blockchain Commons. We are expecting public Testflights of the apps in January, but before we have a full public release, we need to work with the Airgapped Wallet Community on related specifications.</p>

<p>Wallet Community Expansion. We are continuing the successful collaboration with our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community">Airgapped Wallet Community</a>, which has also given us a seat at the table for discussions of wallet standardization. Our Universal Resources (UR) specification and its animated QRs are increasingly being adopted, with our UR library now available in C++, Java, Python, Rust, and Swift. We’ve also been doing extensive work with Bitmark on their Autonomy wallet release, which is built on our Gordian architecture design.</p>

<p>Wallet Community Multisig Research. Our early work with multisigs has shown that critical elements like the m/48’ derivation, PSBTs, and descriptors are all underspecified given modern bitcoin architecture. In addition, current multisig usage doesn’t include schemes to prevent xpub reuse or to secure internal metadata in support of cosigning. In conjuction with our wallet community, we are working on standardizing the methodology for creating account maps for multisig cosigning; investigating ways to store full wallet descriptors and metadata for multisigs without creating new privacy problems; and defining the different roles of multisig cosigners. Some multisig issues are UX-focused, and so we are also defining user interfaces that can help humans to make meaningful decisions when cosigning. This research has included a new release of our Swift-based <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHashTool">LifeHashTool</a>. We hope to do more in Q1, to further enable Gordian Cosigner as our premiere multisig release.</p>

<p>Seedtool Expansion. Our seedtool apps, which offer best-practices examples of offline seed generation, continue to expand. We’d previously released a seedtool as part of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit">LetheKit</a> and upgraded the separate <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli">command-line version</a> to beta last quarter. At this point our initial iterations of our seedtools are fully feature-complete, though we’re also planning for future versions with camera support. This quarter we also released an alpha for a third platform: an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Fehu">iOS seedtool</a>, currently code-named Fehu.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin 2.0 Release. As planned we released <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/README.md">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line 2.0</a> at the end of October. Our popular Bitcoin tutorial is now a complete 19-chapter course that starts with the fundamentals of Bitcoin Core usage and continues on through using Lightning and programming in seven languages.</p>

<p>Torgap Architectural Focus. Blockchain Commons is not just about specifications, tutorials, and applications, but also architectures. We want to prototype and exemplify the best methods for creating safe, secure, and private Bitcoin and blockchain systems. This quarter we went public with our work on Torgap, which is a new methodology to ensure separation of interests (<a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md#what-are-the-adventages-of-the-torgap-architecture">and lots of other advantages</a>) by using Tor to segregate neworked services. Not only have we created a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md">Torgap</a> repo as a nexus for the work, but we’ve also been looking at varied Torgap possibilities, including <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap-sig-cli-rust">DIDs over Torgaps</a> using a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/did-method-onion">did:onion method</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap-opentimestamps/blob/master/README.md">open timestamps over Torgaps</a>.</p>

<p>Crypto Commons Reference Code. We’ve created a large amount of content at Blockchain Commons, and so one of our challenges is making it accessible. We did this in Q4 not just through our core Torgap repo, but also through a similar <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons">Crypto Commons repo</a>. It links up all of our crypto reference libraries (which went beta in Q3) as well as the various apps and command-line programs that exercise them, including the new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bytewords-cli">bytewords-cli</a>.</p>

<p>Architectural Review Begun. Blockchain Commons also does more direct work with companies to improve the usage and trust for blockchain systems. This quarter we have begun a security architecture review of a major Decentralized IDentifier (DID) deployment that should reach one million or more people. We’ve been involved with DIDs since they were incubated at <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/papers.html">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, so we’re proud to do the first major review of such a system.</p>

<p>Decentralized Identity Evangelization. Christopher Allen is continuing his work with the Wyoming legislature, where he is now a member of Digital Identity and DAO subcomittees. He’s been working on what will be the first laws anywhere to recognize personal digital identity (as opposed to digital data, which is the focus of many current laws). This legal definition is intended to work with legacy identity systems, but also to support future decentralization. He also has been leading another bill to give special legal protection for private keys.</p>

<p>Trusted Processor Research. We are always researching and analyzing the newest cryptography and blockchain innovations. This quarter that included an examination of trusted processors. We hope to advance that toward interoperable specifications for trusted hardware in the future.</p>

<p>Internship Planning. Finally, we are planning for new intern cohorts for 2021. We have posted a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/32">complete announcement</a>.</p>

 Social Movements &amp; the Limits of the&nbsp;Law <p>By <a href="https://www.zahrastardust.com/">Zahra Stardust</a>, <a href="https://www.rsatchel.com/about-roslyn">Roslyn M. Satchel</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/afsaneh-rigot">Afsaneh Rigot</a>, <a href="https://kendraalbert.com/">Kendra Albert</a> and <a href="https://www.geekylegal.com/">Micaela&nbsp;Mantegna</a></p>The Revolution card from <a href="https://www.croadcore.org/">Cristy C Road</a>’s <a href="https://croadcore.bigcartel.com/product/next-world-tarot-card-deck">Next World Tarot</a>&nbsp;deck.<p>Ten years ago, trans activist, writer and teacher<a href="http://www.deanspade.net/"> Dean Spade</a> published a piece <a href="https://legalleft.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/3.Spade_.final_.pdf">for those considering law</a>, setting out ‘what every activist should know before going to law&nbsp;school.’</p><p>In the article, Spade discusses the complicated relationship between law and social movements (including how law is used to maintain rather than undo systems) and asks what role can lawyers play in social movements, through demystifying the law to resist indoctrination and by linking legal service provision to transformative change strategies.</p><p>Inspired by this piece, 5 lawyers, ex-lawyers and legal practitioners from the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society</a> speak about their vexed relationship to the law, tensions in their practice, their strategies and tactics, and the kinds of futures they are trying to&nbsp;build.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/roslyn-satchel">Roslyn M.&nbsp;Satchel</a> <p>Media, Law, Ethics, &amp; Social Movements</p><p>Principles of justice, equity, mutual aid, and self-determination animate my&nbsp;work.</p><p>Law is content for courses I teach, as well as organizing and policy advocacy I do in communities. I teach that the law can be helpful as both a guide for protecting the vulnerable and for challenging unethical practices/laws. Simultaneously, however, I often use history to reality-test slippery slope harms created by laws that are inconsistent, cause confusion or lack predictability — particularly in relation to race, gender, sexuality, ability, national origin, language, socio-economic status, or other caste&nbsp;markers.</p><p>The relationship between law and social justice movements is one of tension and boundary challenging. The law could be an instrument to help people live in security and dignity, but instead those in power use it to entrench and fortify their power via status quo. These competing interests require juxtaposition to avoid dominant group tyranny. Those pushed to the margins must exert pressure by all necessary means. For 20 years, I’ve pushed&nbsp;back.</p><blockquote>Sometimes law is not the answer; it’s the&nbsp;problem.</blockquote><p>Sometimes law is not the answer; it’s the problem. The difficulty I often see arises when law enables/permits money and power to corrupt movements. The non-profit industrial complex has a political economy that retains power with elite gatekeepers through funding grants. These foundations broker grants to address certain social problems but rarely change social conditions or the law. As a result, Non-Government Organisations/Community-Based Organisations compete for grants (scraps) — often abandoning the mission or programming for the preferences of grantors — in order to make payroll or provide healthcare benefits for staff. Meanwhile, the government either fails to act or enacts laws that tie activists’ hands (e.g., U.S. Patriot Act). Currently, this divisive dynamic is at work in popular social movements, and we must question whether splintering is the purpose; and if so, who benefits?</p><p>Having experienced these problems professionally as a non-profit executive (as well as hating disempowering adversarial courtroom practices), I opt for alternative uses of my legal skills that shift power by prioritizing research and interventions with practical benefits to marginalized communities. I am trying to build a future where children of the African diaspora have futures as bright as (or even brighter than) they did before colonization and enslavement.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/afsaneh-rigot">Afsaneh Rigot</a> <p>Resistance and the Power of the&nbsp;People</p><p>I never wanted to study law. It wasn’t for us. Coming from Iran, moving to the UK as a refugee and living in the UK in a struggling working-class family (in a predominately immigrant BIPOC town) l quickly realised, the law was not for us. The law was about us. It was for us to bypass and navigate and not fall into the traps&nbsp;of.</p><p>In Iran the law served as a tool for a theocratic dictatorship that surveilled, imprisoned, tortured and exiled its residents, our friends, my family. In the UK it was the structures that worked to keep people like us out — on the outskirts of borders or in the margins of&nbsp;society.</p><p>The law meant barriers to jobs, financial support and opportunities to exist. It meant the police, immigration control, access issues. The law meant: you’re not safe; this isn’t for&nbsp;you.</p><p>That changed as I grew. I didn’t know about Movement Lawyering per se — but came to admire those who I now know employed it: legal aid lawyers that helped us get status when all other hope was lost; the fearless lawyers in Iran who used their in-depth knowledge against the legal system itself; those I’d read about in books who used the law as a tool to contain its own power, to cripple the structures confining groups most oppressed, marginalised and targeted. Then I was intrigued. I wanted to learn how to wield the same tool for our communities.</p><p>My favourite movement lawyering quote is from <a href="http://www.law4blacklives.org/respond">Law for Black Lives</a>: “It means building the power of the people, not the power of the&nbsp;law.”</p><p>I didn’t continue with traditional legal practice (I was working towards becoming an immigration and human rights barrister). These days, I use my access and knowledge to support communities in my region. I follow their leadership on how to build strategic movements and support their safety. I use the language of law to leverage power and hold companies accountable for harm. Most of the time the law itself isn’t useful, but my knowledge of how to navigate it&nbsp;is.</p><p>The law might not be for us, but we can do our best to stop it from being used against&nbsp;us.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kalbert">Kendra Albert</a> <p>The Limits of&nbsp;Law</p><p>I’ve always had a weird relationship to my role as a lawyer. I didn’t go to law school because I believed in the majesty or dignity of the law, but because I wanted software engineers to listen to me. Law felt like a way to accomplish that. And somehow, at the end of law school, people expected me to be a lawyer. Turns out a law degree isn’t just humanities finishing school, it’s a professional degree. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p><p>Fortunately, while I was in law school, my peers radicalized me. Specifically, Derecka Purnell, Kidist Keaton, and the other Black women who led the student protest movement at Harvard Law School called <a href="https://reclaimharvardlaw.wordpress.com/">#Reclaim</a>, radicalized me. I saw how lackluster the institutional response to racism was. I also saw how easy it was for White folks who the institution worked for (even self-professed liberal ones) to underestimate their own power to make change. At the same time, I was processing my own identity as a transgender person who wasn’t out (or even totally sure of their gender), and I could see all the ways in which law failed trans&nbsp;folks.</p><p>As I’ve gotten further into my legal career, I am more and more aware of the limits of law. As an attorney, I’ve embraced my role as a demystifer of legal systems (to use Dean Spade’s words). I’ve also been taught by friends and comrades, like Danielle Blunt of <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/">Hacking // Hustling</a>, how to use the power that comes with institutional affiliations for rebellion.</p><p>As a teacher, I hope to help my students understand the limits of law as a tool. I support my students by building spaces for them in hierarchical institutions with unwritten rules, while challenging them via the material I teach to think bigger about systemic oppression, violence, and our duty as people to make change. Through my teaching, I aim to pass along, at least in part, the gift I was given by #Reclaim.</p><p>Ultimately, my legal work pales in comparison to the hard work of building movements and supporting communities. So now I play a small part in making the law less of a barrier to those who are making what John Lewis called “good trouble”, and I hope to train the next generation to push further and imagine&nbsp;more.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/micaela-mantegna">Micaela Mantegna</a> <p>Law in 8-bits: Finding Joy and Creativity in the Legal Profession</p><p>My relationship with the law is ambivalent to say the least: I went to law school because I wanted to make a positive impact in the world, and becoming a judge seemed the proper way to do so. Spoiler alert! It was&nbsp;not.</p><p>Years as a Court clerk taught me a fair bit about how bureaucracy shapes organizations, preventing them from effective action and meaningful change. I come to the unsettling place of a non-conforming legal practitioner buried in one of the most archaic, formal and change-averse institutions: the judiciary. If you don’t fit, you must not acquit, but make&nbsp;room.</p><p>Law is a loose corpora of building blocks that interact to create solutions, a duality of limits and spaces for freedom. In that sense law is as much a tool as is code, and both could be equally inaccessible and esoteric for the uninitiated. Wide and open knowledge is crucial as a catalyst for change, that can be achieved by involving the communities affected by law’s frameworks before they are set in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Being lectures, podcasts or streamings, in divulgation and advocacy I found my call. And through pop culture and video games, the language to translate law and policy into something relatable and&nbsp;fun.</p><p>When presenting myself, I used to be in a “too many hats” conundrum: Should I speak as a policy researcher or from my place as a diversity activist through <a href="http://www.womeningamesar.com/">Women in Games Argentina</a>? Videogames or artificial intelligence? Media or attorney?</p><p>Before, all these facets seemed antagonistic to being a legal professional. Now I settle on defining myself as the mind of a scholar, the heart of an activist and the skillset of a lawyer, trying to use all of them for&nbsp;good.</p><p>Through an unconventional journey I came to peace of mind with my purpose: trying to inspire the rogues and the misfits to embrace the whimsical weirdness of being different and to find our place in Law and its intersections: you are welcomed and you are needed&nbsp;here.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/zahra-stardust">Zahra Stardust</a> <p>Sex, Law &amp;&nbsp;Protest</p><p>When I was admitted to practice, I was advised by colleagues to disclose my sex work experience so the Legal Profession Admission Board could consider whether I was a ‘fit and proper person’ of ‘good fame and character’. Sex work is often seen as some kind of reputational risk. But in my view, sex work is a more dignified profession than law. And sex workers have plenty to offer in legal analysis, including robust critiques of criminalisation, licensing, border patrol, policing practices and the carceral&nbsp;state.</p><p>Law makes us preoccupied with incremental change and symbolic victories. My auto-ethnographic research on pornography taught me about the perils of reformism and my background as a policy advisor taught me that an ‘evidence-base’ will only get you so far before it is trumped by political expediency and self-interest.</p><p>In law reform, wins for some mean losses for others. And it is consistently the most marginalised who are left off the agenda with the promise that legislators will return for them ‘later’, a date that never&nbsp;arrives.</p><p>Where I live, on the unceded Gadigal land of the Eora Nation, our government refuses to enter into a treaty with our Aboriginal and Torres Strait people, anti-protest legislation is on the rise and there is political backlash against trans youth. Yet the law maintains a delusion of progress.</p><p>My work has involved various strategies and interventions, from demystifying the law to legal accountability to strategic litigation. I’ve been a Legal Observer during protests for Black Lives Matter and Mardi Gras to document and record police brutality. I began the <a href="https://www.zahrastardust.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quick-Guide-to-Strip-Searches-171220.pdf">Illustrated Law Project</a>, collaborating with tattoo artists to create accessible guides to police powers, protests and strip searching. I am working with <a href="https://www.scarletalliance.org.au/">Scarlet Alliance</a>, Australian Sex Workers Association and the <a href="https://www.iclc.org.au/our-services/sex-worker-legal-service/">Inner City Legal Centre</a>, to prepare a class action of sex workers against payment processors for financial discrimination.</p><p>As lawyers, we should be thinking about how we can use our skills to further social movements. Law speaks to itself in inaccessible jargon and maintains a profoundly unjust system of race, class, gender, sexuality and ability. The real legal experts are not lawyers or academics, but the communities who witness the brunt of its operation. I want to help build a future where marginalised communities drive social, cultural and economic change and eventually dismantle institutions of law as we know&nbsp;them.</p><p>For more on movement lawyering, see <a href="https://www.law4blacklives.org/">Law for Black Lives</a>, the <a href="https://movementlawlab.org/mission">Movement Law Lab</a>, the <a href="https://advancementproject.org/movementlawyercon/">Movement Lawyering Conference</a>, or watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOxihoQVfUg&amp;feature=youtu.be">Spotlight on LGBTQ Advocacy in Lebanon</a> as part of a series on Movement Lawyering and Social&nbsp;Change.</p>The Seven of Wands from <a href="https://www.croadcore.org/">Cristy C Road</a>’s <a href="https://croadcore.bigcartel.com/product/next-world-tarot-card-deck">Next World Tarot</a>&nbsp;deck. <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/movement-lawyering-for-alternative-futures-404ba2010bf2">Movement Lawyering for Alternative Futures</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Fatema Pirone, Senior Director, Enterprise Innovation for CIBC
<p>I have the privilege of leading the Enterprise Innovation team at CIBC, shaping and transforming our bank’s stance on how we approach emerging trends and technologies. Our team is built of data scientists, designers, UX researchers, strategists and collectively we have created comprehensive projects, frameworks and a culture of innovation across our lines of business at CIBC. My role is to ensure we do not overinvest or underinvest in emerging technology and have built our innovation frameworks to tackle the banks most compelling opportunities and problems. I also have the privilege to elevate the people on my team to recognize their strong skills, provide opportunities for them to continue to grow and develop those skills, all while being able to set the vision and develop strong partnerships and sponsors from leaders in our organization.</p>
<p>I am constantly motivated by the various mindsets of the people around me, the depth of experience that everyone is able to bring to the table, and the great work that is the outcome of all of that combined! What gets me out of bed every morning is a strong cup of coffee, but also the curiosity of seeing what that day brings. The only standard on this team is that you can guarantee no two days will be the same. And that is what I love most about it.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I follow a couple of key principles:</p>
 
 Be open to new experiences. This career path was never in my plans but I happened upon it and took various roles and training to figure out what I was passionate about and where I wanted to apply myself. 
 Align yourself with great people, leaders that are willing to share their experiences and give you advice, and colleagues and employees you will take along on the journey. 
 Lastly, never turn away from a complex project – I have grown the most doing the work others found unattractive. There are always lessons to learn which I embrace. I think this is at least part of the reason why I received WXN Canada’s Top 100 Most Powerful Women’s award this year. 
 
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>It’s got to be the value and importance of advocating for yourself. I’ve been fortunate to have leaders who have supported and mentored me as I have developed throughout my own career, and I think that because of this I have seen the outcomes that are possible when you trust yourself. It can be easy to get caught up in imposter syndrome, but if I have learned anything, it is that if you can learn to believe that you have earned where you are today, that will transpire into better tangible outcomes.</p>
<blockquote><p>The most important lesson I have learnt is the value and importance of advocating for yourself.</p></blockquote>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>Digital Identity is the single most important emerging tech that will allow us to provide end to end digital servicing for our clients in the most secure and transparent (to the client) way. We need to start ensuring we embed Digital ID into every flow where client’s data is moving – internally or externally. We need to stop creating siloed solutions and rather take an holistic approach. We need to continue to make the client the center of our solutions and services.</p>
 Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity matters to me because it is the only way we create a future that is unique, that is better for all and is simply not like our history. Diversity is truly representations of all, that includes ethnicity, sexual orientations, belief systems, experience, skills, education and so on. When you have representation of all with a diverse group of people, the best outcomes are possible ~ that is where the magic lies.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
“From the Ashes” by Jesse Thistle
<p>I am an avid reader so its really hard to just recommend one – so I’ll go with one recently read called “From the Ashes”&nbsp; a memoir by Jesse Thistle. I think this book is a heart wrenching memoir and testament to inter-generational trauma that Indigenous people of Canada have experienced and are still battling. It is not the duty of the marginalized to drive the change that our society needs, rather the job of the privileged. So it is all of our duty to gain better understanding of what has happened, what the different experiences of the Indigenous communities and people are and advocate to do better. This book is a good start.</p>
 
 
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>“There is no need to grow up so fast!” I jumped in the deep-end of adulthood really quickly, I was working full-time by the time I was 17 and got married when I was 19.&nbsp; Although I do not regret any decision I made,&nbsp; I would tell my younger self to be kinder to myself and enjoy that short time one has a teenager.</p>

				 <p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>We all agree 2020 is not a year we’ll regret. Still, we shall all remember it!</p>
<p>This pandemic has been devastating for individuals, families, health professionals,&nbsp;cities, countries, the world at large. Still, we found the way to adapt our lives through&nbsp;technology and data, while keeping human relations alive, sometimes reinforcing&nbsp;them. It led to imaginative solutions and technical leaps in many areas. It enabled&nbsp;an unprecedented mobilization on a global basis which delivers as we speak<br>efficient vaccines in a record time. This pandemic has silver linings!</p>
<p>Let’s push it further and make 2021 the year fair, human-centred and&nbsp;trusted data becomes a reality and the norm.</p>
<p><br>Happy Holiday Season and together we shall build the best in the New Year in&nbsp;Europe and beyond!</p>

<p>Yuriy Ackermann, Certification Technical Manager, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>With the advancement and modifications to specifications and program requirements, certification processes and policies will need to be modified from time-to-time. With the recent changes and publication of the FIDO Authenticator Certification program as they relate to V1.4 of the Security Requirements, and the current FIDO Registry of Values specification, we are recommending currently certified servers make necessary changes.</p>



<p>It is strongly recommended that you update your FIDO2 and UAF servers in order to correctly process current and future metadata statements based on the latest updates to the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/common-specs/fido-registry-v2.1-ps-20191217.html">FIDO Registry of Predefined Values</a>.</p>



<p>The spec changes are as follows:</p>



  All previous USER_VERIFY methods have been post-fixed with _INTERNAL to identify them explicitly as INTERNAL user verification methods&nbsp;  Example: USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE → USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE_INTERNAL.<br>    New USER_VERIFY methods have been added: USER_VERIFY_PASSCODE_EXTERNAL (0x00000800) and USER_VERIFY_PATTERN_EXTERNAL (0x00001000)<br>  RS1 or ALG_SIGN_RSASSA_PKCSV15_SHA1_RAW (0x0010) IANA ALG_KEY_COSE “alg” identifier has been changed to -65535  



<p>Servers should make the following updates to support these changes:</p>



  FIDO2 servers: Update pubKeyCredParams to contain -65535 alg<br>  FIDO2 and UAF servers: Change old user verification methods values to the new post-fixed values. Example: USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE → USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE_INTERNAL<br>  FIDO2 and UAF servers: Run the conformance tools to verify support for these changes  



<p>The latest FIDO Registry of Predefined Values is now available in <a href="https://github.com/fido-alliance/conformance-test-tools-resources/blob/master/snippets/registry.js">JavaScript</a>.</p>

 Introduction <p><a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a protocol for building applications with user-centric, interoperable data. In <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity/">a previous post</a>, we described what IDX is and the benefits of building applications in this way. This tutorial will walk through the creation of a simple note-taking web app using decentralized technologies for authentication and data storage, allowing users to have complete ownership over their contents.</p><p>In this tutorial, we will use the following technologies:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">React</a>: a popular framework for building web applications  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-idx">IDX</a>: a JavaScript/TypeScript framework for user-centric data management  <a href="https://www.ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a>: a decentralized network for storing mutable, verifiable documents  <a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">DIDs</a>: a W3C standard for decentralized identifiers  The finished product ✨ Environment setup <p>To get started using IDX, we'll first need to install the IDX CLI using <code>npm</code>. You'll also need to have <code>node</code> installed.</p> <code>npm install -g @ceramicstudio/idx-cli</code>  Project setup  Initial dependencies <p>We'll use Create React App with the TypeScript template to setup our project:</p> <code>npx create-react-app idx-demo-app --template typescript --use-npm
</code> <p>Then we'll add the first dependencies:</p> <code>cd idx-demo-app
npm install @ceramicnetwork/cli @ceramicnetwork/http-client @ceramicstudio/idx-tools key-did-provider-ed25519 uint8arrays</code> <p>Let's also edit the <code>package.json</code> file to add the following <code>scripts</code>:</p> <code>"bootstrap": "node ./bootstrap.js",
"ceramic": "ceramic daemon",</code> <p>Finally, as the <code>uint8arrays</code> package does not provide TypeScript definitions, let's add them to the <code>src/react-app-env.d.ts</code> file:</p> <code>/// &lt;reference types="react-scripts" /&gt;

declare module 'uint8arrays' {
  export function toString(b: Uint8Array, enc?: string): string
  export function fromString(s: string, enc?: string): Uint8Array
}</code> src/react-app-env.d.ts file Local Ceramic node <p>Let's start a local Ceramic node using the script defined, and keep it running for all the steps of this tutorial:</p> <code>npm run ceramic</code> <p>We'll also need to bootstrap the local node with the IDX documents, using the IDX CLI previously installed:</p> <code>idx bootstrap</code>  Data model <p>By using Ceramic and IDX, we can create a data model for our application that is user-centric (instead of application-siloed), &nbsp;globally available from any client on the Ceramic network, and publicly discoverable and shareable across any application(s) that a user interacts with. This is all made possible thanks to public schemas, data definitions, and the user's IDX document. Thus, by storing your application's user data in the IDX framework, it becomes truly user-centric and portable across app domains and contexts.</p>  A schema is a <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON-schema</a> document created by a developer which can be used to validate the contents of other documents simply by including the unique document identifier (DocID) of the schema.  A definition is a document created by a developer which provides metadata about the data that they want to store with the user. The DocID of the definition acts as a unique key within the user's IDX document, and is used to identify a reference (the actual contents) associated to a specified schema.  An IDX document is a document owned by a user which maintains an index of all of their data in a single place. It is a key-value store that stores mappings from definitions to references.  <p>For this notes management app, we'll use two types of documents and therefore two schemas:</p>  <code>Note</code>: this document will store the contents of a single note  <code>NotesList</code>: the entry-point document to index the list of notes with metadata  <p>We will need to create and publish these schemas to the local Ceramic node, along with a definition which allows us to interact with the notes list using IDX. This will allow our app and others to access the notes via the following path:</p> <code>User DID —&gt; IDX index —&gt; notes definition —&gt; notes list —&gt; note 1
                                                        -&gt; note 2
                                                        -&gt; ...
</code> <p>Let's create a <code>bootstrap.js</code> script that will create and publish the schemas and definition to our Ceramic node, and store the Ceramic document ID (DocID) of the definition to a JSON file that will be used by the app:</p> <code>const { writeFile } = require('fs').promises
const Ceramic = require('@ceramicnetwork/http-client').default
const { createDefinition, publishSchema } = require('@ceramicstudio/idx-tools')
const { Ed25519Provider } = require('key-did-provider-ed25519')
const fromString = require('uint8arrays/from-string')

const CERAMIC_URL = 'http://localhost:7007'

const NoteSchema = {
  $schema: 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#',
  title: 'Note',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    date: {
      type: 'string',

    },
    text: {
      type: 'string',
      title: 'text',
      maxLength: 4000,
    },
  },
}

const NotesListSchema = {
  $schema: 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#',
  title: 'NotesList',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    notes: {
      type: 'array',

      items: {

          },
          title: {

            title: 'title',
            maxLength: 100,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  definitions: {
    CeramicDocId: {
      type: 'string',
      pattern: '^ceramic://.+(\\\\?version=.+)?',
      maxLength: 150,
    },
  },
}

async function run() {
  // The seed must be provided as an environment variable
  const seed = fromString(process.env.SEED, 'base16')
  // Connect to the local Ceramic node
  const ceramic = new Ceramic(CERAMIC_URL)
  // Authenticate the Ceramic instance with the provider
  await ceramic.setDIDProvider(new Ed25519Provider(seed))

  // Publish the two schemas
  const [noteSchema, notesListSchema] = await Promise.all([
    publishSchema(ceramic, { content: NoteSchema }),
    publishSchema(ceramic, { content: NotesListSchema }),
  ])

  // Create the definition using the created schema ID
  const notesDefinition = await createDefinition(ceramic, {
    name: 'notes',
    description: 'Simple text notes',
    schema: notesListSchema.commitId.toUrl(),
  })

  // Write config to JSON file
  const config = {
    definitions: {
      notes: notesDefinition.id.toString(),
    },
    schemas: {
      Note: noteSchema.commitId.toUrl(),
      NotesList: notesListSchema.commitId.toUrl(),
    },
  }
  await writeFile('./src/config.json', JSON.stringify(config))

  console.log('Config written to src/config.json file:', config)
  process.exit(0)
}

run().catch(console.error)</code> bootstrap.js file<p>Now to run this script, we'll need to provide a 32 bytes base16-encoded string as an environment variable:</p> <code>SEED=&lt;your seed&gt; npm run bootstrap
</code> <p>If you need a simple way to create such a seed, you can use the following command:</p> <code>node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
</code> <p>Running the bootstrap script will create a <code>config.json</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder, that will be imported by our app. The schemas and definition DocIDs contained in this <code>config.json</code> file are globally unique and can be shared with other apps wanting to interact with the notes associated to the user.</p> Interacting with our data model <p>Before moving forwards with implementing our app, let's first check we can interact with our data model using the IDX CLI.</p><p>First, we'll need to create a local DID that will be used by the CLI:</p> <code>idx did:create --label=local</code> <p>The <code>local</code> alias can be used to reference the DID in the following commands, rather than having to provide the full DID string.</p><p>Now we can create a note with some text using the <code>Note</code> schema URL added to <code>src/config.json</code>. In my case this URL is <code>ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw14atxo8ax0mrknm7xfh8pxqy24hbdrxi9nagtwoa3la5s4hf32qr</code> but it will be different when using another seed, so don't forget to change it in the example below:</p> <code>idx tile:create local '{"text":"My first note"}' --schema=ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw14atxo8ax0mrknm7xfh8pxqy24hbdrxi9nagtwoa3la5s4hf32qr
</code> <p>Successfully running this command will display the document ID of the created note, that we can then add to the list of notes using the <code>notes</code> definition key added to <code>src/config.json</code>:</p> <code>idx index:set local kjzl6cwe1jw14almqh93rmt1mpv8h6zvyeyhh7jzlqp95kgv38c0jb5yuo8mo7w '{"notes":[{"id":"ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw147xhyjemd6r38812gzhhexw9mj3gz2vvkimotu5xktssik2cbzp","title":"First"}]}'
</code> <p>Make sure to replace the definition key (<code>kjzl6cwe1jw14almqh93rmt1mpv8h6zvyeyhh7jzlqp95kgv38c0jb5yuo8mo7w</code> in my case) and the created note URL (<code>ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw147xhyjemd6r38812gzhhexw9mj3gz2vvkimotu5xktssik2cbzp</code> in the code above) by the values created in your environment.</p><p>We can now check the created note and notes list can be loaded:</p> <code>idx index:get local kjzl6cwe1jw14almqh93rmt1mpv8h6zvyeyhh7jzlqp95kgv38c0jb5yuo8mo7w
idx tile:get ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw147xhyjemd6r38812gzhhexw9mj3gz2vvkimotu5xktssik2cbzp
</code>  Application dependencies and IDX setup <p>Our app is going to use the following additional dependencies:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/idx-web">IDX</a>, to interact with the list of notes  <a href="https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui">Material UI</a> for UI components and icons  A <a href="https://www.stablelib.com/modules/_random_random_.html">random bytes generator</a>, to generate a seed   <code>npm install @ceramicstudio/idx @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @stablelib/random</code> <p>Then, let's create an <code>idx.ts</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder, implementing the logic to authenticate using a provided seed and load notes with IDX:</p> <code>import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { IDX } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'
import { Ed25519Provider } from 'key-did-provider-ed25519'

import { definitions } from './config.json'

const CERAMIC_URL = 'http://localhost:7007'

export type NoteItem = {
  id: string
  title: string
}

export type NotesList = { notes: Array&lt;NoteItem&gt; }

export type IDXInit = NotesList &amp; {
  ceramic: Ceramic
  idx: IDX
}

export async function getIDX(seed: Uint8Array): Promise&lt;IDXInit&gt; {
  // Create the Ceramic instance and inject provider
  const ceramic = new Ceramic(CERAMIC_URL)
  await ceramic.setDIDProvider(new Ed25519Provider(seed))

  // Create the IDX instance with the definitions aliases from the config
  const idx = new IDX({ ceramic, aliases: definitions })

  // Load the existing notes
  const notesList = await idx.get&lt;{ notes: Array&lt;NoteItem&gt; }&gt;('notes')
  return { ceramic, idx, notes: notesList?.notes ?? [] }
}</code> src/idx.ts file Application state and actions <p>In this section, we'll implement the core logic of our app based on a state, synchronous actions mutating the state, and high-level handlers performing one or more actions.</p><p>First, let's create a <code>state.ts</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder with the following initial contents:</p> <code>import type { Doctype } from '@ceramicnetwork/common'
import type Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import type { IDX } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'

}
type NoteState = {

  nav: NavDraftState | NavNoteState
}
export type State = Store &amp; (DefaultState | NoteState)</code> src/state.ts file<p>Here we are importing types and dependencies from React (the <code>useCallback</code> and <code>useReducer</code> hooks) and defining the valid shapes the application <code>State</code> can have.</p><p>Next we'll define an <code>Action</code> type that includes all the possible synchronous actions that can be performed to mutate the <code>State</code>:</p> <code>type AuthAction = { type: 'auth'; status: AuthStatus }
type AuthSuccessAction = { type: 'auth success' } &amp; IDXInit

}</code> src/App.tsx file<p>Next, let's add the <code>DraftScreen</code>, allowing users to create and save a new note:</p> <code>type DraftScreenProps = {
  save: (title: string, text: string) =&gt; void

}

function DraftScreen({ save, status }: DraftScreenProps) {
  const classes = useStyles()

        Save
      &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  )
}
</code> src/App.tsx file<p>We will use another component, <code>NoteScreen</code>, for displaying an existing note as the logic is a bit different from a draft, notably that we have to first load the document from Ceramic before being able to display the note contents:</p> <code>type NoteScreenProps = {
  note: IndexLoadedNote | StoredNote
  save: (doc: Doctype, text: string) =&gt; void
}

function NoteScreen({ note, save }: NoteScreenProps) {

  if (note.status === 'loading failed') {
    return &lt;Typography&gt;Failed to load note!&lt;/Typography&gt;
  }

  if (note.status === 'init' || note.status === 'loading') {
    return &lt;Typography&gt;Loading note...&lt;/Typography&gt;
  }

  const doc = (note as StoredNote).doc
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Paper elevation={5}&gt;
        &lt;TextareaAutosize
          className={classes.noteTextarea}
          defaultValue={doc.content.text}

        Save
      &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;

<p>The 2020 FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge has come to a close – a big thank you to the FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group members and event sponsors. The Korean video versions of the entire 2020 FIDO Hackathon journey and presentations by the top 5 winners are available through <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-seoul-virtual-seminar-day-1/">FIDO Videos Library</a> and a <a href="https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20201202205414">ZDNet Korea interview</a>. We hope this blog will help English readers to understand these winners’ projects, and how their ideas showcase the myriad possibilities for FIDO Authentication in the future.</p>



<p>Here is an overview of the winners and their projects:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moses’ Miracle – Gold Award</p>



 [Picture of Moses’ Miracle Team at Final Evaluation Day] 



<p>Moses’ Miracle is a team consisting of three students majoring in computer engineering and industrial design. They developed a gate access control system based on FIDO Authentication. The smartphone-based system helps people access different security areas much faster and more conveniently without remembering passwords, physical keys, or smart cards. From a management perspective, this solution consumes less time, cost, and labor. For more technical information and a demo of the system, <a href="https://youtu.be/G8IM00U2oa8">please watch their video presentation</a>.</p>



<p>Protect Homes – Silver Award</p>

<p>Protect Homes is a team that consists of two developers and two designers, half studying in university and the rest working for venture companies. The team integrated FIDO Authentication to strengthen a smart home ecosystem’s security, coming up with a management app for IoT devices. By going passwordless, the system demonstrated that security and usability are both enhanced. For more technical information and a demo of the solution, <a href="https://youtu.be/jIvJIzWL0Ss">please watch their video presentation</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Who – Silver Award</p>



 [Picture of Dr. Who Team at Final Evaluation Day] 



<p>Dr. Who is a team consisting of one project manager, two developers, and one public healthcare specialist from WHO (World Health Organization). The team came up with a Proof of Concept project, introducing smart health insurance card services that link Distributed IDentity technology and FIDO Authentication. They wanted to solve the problem with the existing physical health insurance card, which is an inferior way of identifying a patient’s actual identity. For more technical information and a demo of the service, <a href="https://youtu.be/Zj44RIwgidY">please watch their video presentation</a>.</p>



<p>Fingerprint 486 – Bronze Award</p>

<p>AWS is a team that consists of two backend, two front-end developers, and one computer graphic designer coming from the same woman’s university. The team developed a FIDO Authentication-based passwordless Wi-Fi router control system, which does not disclose an administrator’s information. For more technical information and a demo of the system, <a href="https://youtu.be/FbxEvnAn2Bw">please watch their video presentation</a>.</p>



 [Pictures from Award Ceremony – September 2, 2020] 



<p>Building upon the success of the FIDO Hackathon in Korea over the last two years, we are looking at possibilities for APAC-wide (or global) Hackathon in the year 2021. We believe such a Hackathon (or challenge program) helps us engage and empower developers to accelerate service deployment with out-of-box ideas.</p>

<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/dLij9K4ObYY">Joe Shields</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/dLij9K4ObYY">Unsplash</a><p>Everyone is talking about self-sovereign identities (SSIs) and how they allow users to control their data and identity. We at Energy Web believe that this is only the first step in the journey to a decentralized application landscape.</p><p>Indeed, being able to authenticate with a certificate has been possible for a long time now but it has never been widely adopted due to technical limitations. Until recently, there’s been the need to create centralized public key infrastructure systems—with a key shortcoming being that one certificate would only give you access to one application. So while the identity might remain self-sovereign to the ID owner, it still lacks the efficiency of a more-decentralized system in which a master ID ‘passport’ could be used seamlessly across multiple&nbsp;apps.</p><p>This is because most implementations of SSI focus on the authentication portion. This is the first step and a mandatory one. But as long as there is no standardized manner to exchange profile data, this will only be a global certificate system, allowing passwordless login but not permission management. This is what we want to change with <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">Energy Web Switchboard</a>, our <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-unveils-ew-switchboard-2f71bc82daa0">recently released</a> one-stop solution for access management.</p> Requirements <p>A permission management system—or Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)—is the basis for every Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution. It fulfills three basic functions:</p>  Authentication: Verify that the user is in possession of the credentials (in our case, the private&nbsp;key).  Authorization: List the roles that have been assigned to the user in order to do Role-Based Access Control&nbsp;(RBAC).  Accounting&nbsp;: Keep a log of the operations performed by the&nbsp;user.  <p>In order to create a decentralized version of IAM we have to enable the above functionality, while at the same time make sure our system has the following properties:</p>  Censorship Resistance: A user can use their credentials whenever they&nbsp;want.  Data Confidentiality: It must not be possible to list the users who have access to a specific&nbsp;system.  Decentralized Infrastructure: Nodes must not be able to misbehave; either they perform correctly or not at&nbsp;all.  <p>Let’s look at each one of these requirements in more&nbsp;detail.</p> Censorship resistance <p>When using a centralized system like Google or Facebook, these entities have complete control over the data that your application receives. They have little incentive to withhold information from you specifically but they could if they wanted to. And as we don’t know their motives, it is difficult to assess the probability of this occurring. Even in a system like OpenID, there is an administrator for the database and unless that administrator is you, their interests might diverge from&nbsp;yours.</p><p>Being resistant to censorship means that there is no actor in the system that has the power to selectively limit the information other actors have access to. In other words, everyone has access to the same information at the same time and there is nothing the creator of the information (or anybody else) can do about&nbsp;it.</p><p>This matters because there are a few data points that you do not want to be withheld from you when using an IAM system. You must know as soon as possible:</p>  If a permission has been revoked. You would not want to give access to someone who should not have&nbsp;it.  If a key has been invalidated. If a key has been compromised, all the permissions granted by it should be revoked or it should not be able to authenticate anymore.  If a permission has been granted. Once a permission has been granted, it must be possible to verify it every time it is presented.  <p>A blockchain fulfills these requirements by design. Since the state is kept in sync over all the participating nodes, once something has been published, it is either known to all or none of the nodes. Additionally, the cryptographic proofs contained in the transactions allow the offline verification of the&nbsp;data.</p><p>This is why all the permissions are anchored on chain. The descriptions of roles are held in an ENS smart-contract; the successful granting of a permission is noted in the DID document of the user. Each user holds their credentials and is the only one to have unrestricted access to that&nbsp;data.</p> Confidentiality <p>As an application developer, I don’t want the world to be able to make a list of my app’s users and even less, a list by roles. It is therefore crucial that when a user is granted a role, this event not be made&nbsp;public.</p><p>Centralized systems are not terrible in this use case, as they will not disclose your information to third parties but they themselves will record all the activities of your users. This is a feature of the platform. It is a tradeoff you’re willing to make in order to give convenience to your&nbsp;users.</p><p>In the EW Switchboard solution, no third party has the full list of users of an application. This is guaranteed by the permission-granting process:</p><p>What we’d like to highlight in this simplified process is the fact that it is the user who stores the claim and anchors it on chain. Also, because it is a private claim, the contents are provable but not disclosed. The user can therefore prove that they have been granted a certain privilege, but unless they elect to disclose this information, it is impossible for a third party to find&nbsp;out.</p><p>And as the users must anchor the claim on-chain themselves, there is no opportunity for an observer to make a list of the addresses added to a particular smart contract or any other indirect way to observe the activities of the IAM. The only information an observer can garner is that the user has added a claim to their DID document but not the content, origin, or nature of the&nbsp;claim.</p> Decentralized infrastructure <p>We have mentioned the Energy Web Chain and <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, which are both peer to peer networks and lack a central point of control. There is one piece of infrastructure we have not mentioned yet: the message transport between&nbsp;users.</p><p>How the user and the role admin in the above sequence diagram exchange information is through a service bus: the EW-DOS messaging component. This component is decentralized in the same manner IPFS is: there is no centralized control but there is no consensus either. Each client must pick the service node they want to connect to and if this service node does not deliver the expected service, it is the responsibility of the client to connect to a different service&nbsp;node.</p><p>As every message must be signed by the sender there is no opportunity for the service provider to alter messages in transit. Either messages are delivered as received or they are rendered invalid by the update and the recipient would notice immediately. The messaging service therefore fulfills the requirement of not being able to misbehave. It either fulfills its duty correctly or not at&nbsp;all.</p> Conclusion <p>With Switchboard, we provide application developers an alternative to centralized authentication and authorization systems like OAuth with Google and Facebook or Azure Active Directory. Obviously we still have a lot of features to add in order to compete with these established services, but EW Switchboard is the first fully decentralized IAM solution. You can use the installed version today on the EWC or deploy your own from source on any EVM&nbsp;chain.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/digging-deeper-into-self-sovereign-identity-and-access-management-e6eefbac631e">Digging Deeper into Self-sovereign Identity and Access Management</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 How Switchboard Tackles the Challenge of Enterprise Identity Management <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/fPxOowbR6ls">Matthew Henry</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/fPxOowbR6ls">Unsplash</a><p>By Ian Kelly and Nitin&nbsp;Gavhane</p><p>Nearly a decade has passed since Marc Andreeson <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">wrote</a> that software was eating the world, by which he meant that software — and ultimately the services that software and the Internet could provide — would increasingly capture value in the economy from traditional firms producing things. A list of the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/">world’s largest companies by market cap</a> suggests Andreeson was right: three of the top five — Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet — are software-centric digital enterprises.</p><p>This digitalization of the global economy has spurred a new wave of Big Data, including data associated with identities. Yet for enterprises around the world, managing identities remains a major information technology challenge.</p> Challenges in enterprise identity management <p>In traditional enterprise identity management, identity data is typically highly siloed both within and across organizations, even with respect to individual business processes. Anyone who’s had to separately on-board with two more departments at a single company—such as accounts receivable, a membership department, a software tech team, and maybe a parallel business unit located in another country—knows what we’re talking&nbsp;about.</p><p>Enterprises must aggregate, share, and synchronize identity data across databases and directory services. Despite their best efforts, this is cumbersome and inconvenient at best. Plus, managing identities with traditional enterprise IT architectures like these often leads to high administrative and maintenance costs, privacy and security risks, and high compliance costs to mitigate those&nbsp;risks.</p><p>We see four key problems with the traditional approach to enterprise identity management:</p>  Low Interoperability: Centralized systems with information silos increase friction for would-be collaborators due to proprietary processes and architectures.  Expensive Verifiability: Sharing verified attributes about users and assets (such as energy market participants and distributed energy resources like electric vehicles) is time-consuming and&nbsp;costly.  Data Protection: Policymakers globally are regulating customer data privacy and ownership via new regulations such as the EU’s GDPR and the California Privacy Act. Complying with these policies using traditional IT architectures and processes—which were not designed with customer data ownership in mind—is increasing operational costs for many companies.  Security: Even when enterprises attempt to manage data responsibly, vulnerabilities in traditional software and infrastructure systems can result in compromised data.  <p>Taking a smarter approach to identity management using traditional enterprise architectures can address these challenges in part. However, a new approach to enterprise identity management that fully embraces the concept of self-sovereignty can unlock significantly more&nbsp;value.</p> Benefits of a self-sovereign approach <p>We at Energy Web believe that an enterprise identity management architecture based on <a href="https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identities</a> (SSIs) enabled by decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) presents the best solution to these challenges.</p><p>We believe that DIDs should have four essential characteristics:</p>  Decentralized: The DID-based system has no central issuing authority.  Persistent: The DID does not require the continued operation of any underlying organization.  Cryptographically verifiable: One can prove control of the&nbsp;DID.  Resolvable: One can discover metadata about the&nbsp;DID.  <p>Using DIDs and VCs to build a SSI system should address the main challenges of centralized IT approaches we described above: interoperability, verifiability, data protection, and security.</p><p>Here’s what this could look like applied to a simple example in the energy sector: managing lithium-ion batteries from cradle to grave. The system could assign a DID to each battery when manufactured and the manufacturer could issue claims regarding the battery’s model, serial number, and specifications like capacity and energy. Next, the installer of that battery could add claims related to its purchaser and location. The owner of the battery could add a claim about the transfer of ownership and, at the end of its life, the recycler of that battery could issue a final claim about its retirement. Meanwhile, during its operating lifetime, the battery could enroll via its DID in various energy markets, such as to provide grid flexibility services.</p> How EW Switchboard brings this architecture to&nbsp;life <p>We are building this system, which we call <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">EW Switchboard</a>. It allows anyone to create a decentralized identifier based on a public-private keypair, and it provides a way for application owners to manage <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/digging-deeper-into-self-sovereign-identity-and-access-management-e6eefbac631e">authentication, authorization, and accounting</a> for their own apps. Like everything we do at Energy Web, it is not a product for sale but an open-source tool, designed for the needs of the energy sector but also sufficiently abstract to be applicable for any user or app owner — even those apps and services that do not use blockchain technology at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Switchboard is compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C v1.0 decentralized identifier and verifiable credentials standards</a> and is intended to accommodate a variety of approaches to digital identity. It uses a decentralized architecture, meaning that no one person or organization stores sign-in information or other user data or controls authentication or authorization. Each user remains in control over their own data and who has access to it. Thanks to WalletConnect, users can select from a <a href="https://walletconnect.org/wallets">large variety of existing wallets</a> to create their&nbsp;DIDs.</p><p>Let’s see how Switchboard works.</p><p>We host Switchboard at <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">our own website</a>, meaning that anyone can access Switchboard and use it to create and manage their own DID, enroll in applications, create a DID for their devices, or perform other tasks. Developers or owners of applications can integrate Switchboard into their own apps, using it to manage user authentication, authorization, and accounting (without the user leaving the primary app) so that they need not develop these functionalities from scratch. This latter option means that users could use their DID as a single sign-in for a variety of apps, similar to how many people use their Google or Facebook accounts for single sign-in today, but remaining in control of that DID for life and independent from any one platform. It also means that application developers can focus on other functionalities in their apps and therefore deploy&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Once a user has authenticated with Switchboard, they can then use their DID to enroll in applications. This terminology is intentional: the user registers a DID once and owns it for life, and therefore that user need not re-register a new DID every time they want to use a new application. Instead, that user authenticates with their DID and then takes on specific roles in applications.</p><p>As the owner of an application, how do you ensure that users take on the correct roles? For example, what prevents an unknown user (i.e., a DID) from enrolling as the owner of a rooftop solar PV system in your app, especially if the architecture is decentralized (meaning neither you nor any other single authority dictates who has what&nbsp;role)?</p><p>To do this, Switchboard employs a system of VCs and provides an interface for you to set the roles and role governance for your application (role governance leverages <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ethereum-name-service-ens-is-now-available-for-the-energy-web-a8d884138790">Energy Web’s Ethereum Name Service</a>). In our example above, you could use Switchboard to specify that your app includes the roles PV owner and PV installer, and that in order for a DID to enroll in your app as a PV owner that DID must have proof from a PV installer that the DID does in fact own a home with a PV system on the roof. The DID requests the installer to cryptographically sign a statement that the installer installed a PV system on that DID’s roof, and when the installer signs this statement then the DID can then present it to your app. Your app can verify that the cryptographic signature must have been added by that installer and thus allow the DID to enroll as a PV owner. Of course, you can use Switchboard to set whatever roles and requirements you wish (e.g., “a PV owner must have signed claims from the installer, the PV OEM, and from the PV owner’s distribution utility in order to enroll”).</p><p>This approach also benefits from network effects, because the verified claim is specific to the DID but not specific to the application. Continuing our example, imagine a user with a rooftop PV system wanted to enroll in someone else’s application and therefore obtained verified claims from the installer, the OEM, and the distribution utility relating to the specifications, location, and ownership of the rooftop PV system. You can, as the owner of a different application, set your app to allow any DID with those same claims to enroll as a user in your app — if the user can present the verified claims you require, it is not necessary that the user obtained those claims specifically to enroll in your app. The user does not lose the claims in the other app owner’s system, but retains them and can simply present them to your&nbsp;app.</p><p>We are releasing an <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">alpha version</a> of Switchboard now, for initial use and feedback from our community. Our intent is then to release a beta version in Q1 of 2021, with a final production version to follow. These future versions will add functionality related to asset management and incorporate Energy Web’s concurrent work with key management solutions and distributed messaging and&nbsp;storage.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/how-switchboard-tackles-the-challenge-of-enterprise-id-management-b26f995caefa">How Switchboard Tackles the Challenge of Enterprise ID Management</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Simone Hill, Senior Manager, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Illustration by <a href="https://www.tiphughes.com/">Tiffany&nbsp;Hughes</a>.<p>In June, <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">Omidyar Network committed $500,000 to organizations fighting on the frontlines for racial justice</a> because we firmly believe that this work is core to our ability to create inclusive, equitable societies. While the funding is an essential step toward our vision, the way we invested was also critical to developing thoughtful partnerships with organizations already building or scaling innovations.</p><p>What does it mean to invest in justice? It begins with a clear-eyed recognition of the systemic racism that manifests within all of our systems to undermine the safety of Black and Brown people. Investing in justice means attacking the many resulting symptoms of white supremacy at their root by finding organizations working to innovate and advance holistic ways to create lasting change. It means being strategic and careful about ensuring that while we are looking for ways to address the wrongs that pervade our societies, we are not inadvertently causing more harm. With that, an awareness of our own limitations as a funder is required –– financial investments are a step at the beginning of a long-term journey towards holistic, strategic action. Finally, investing in justice means continuing to integrate racial justice with our firm-wide focus to reimagine systems: building an economy that works for all — an anti-racist economy is a <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">key pillar of our point of view</a>; realizing the promise of responsible technology; and fostering a more pluralistic society.</p><p>We searched around the country for Black-led organizations whose work combined economic, civic, or criminal justice reform with narrative shift or movement building towards racial justice. Among many organizations doing incredible work, the following five are achieving impact in ways that align with our current strategic focus.</p> Large Scale Change, Powered by Deep Networks: <a href="https://medium.com/economicsecproj/centering-blackness-the-path-to-economic-liberation-for-all-f6c2c7398281">Centering Blackness Initiative</a> <p>Spearheaded by three dynamic women of color, the Insight Center for Community Economic Development has developed the <a href="https://medium.com/economicsecproj/centering-blackness-the-path-to-economic-liberation-for-all-f6c2c7398281">Centering Blackness Initiative</a>; a lens to identify how and where economic policies, practices, and institutions harm Black&nbsp;people.</p>Graphic illustration from Insight Center’s Power Learning Community<p>A multi-pronged approach to systemic change, the Initiative is a new framework for examining and reimagining systems. It is accompanied by a set of tools, currently in development, to encourage multiracial, progressive organizations to adopt the framework. Not only will organizations be supported to develop new internal operations through this lens, but they can also adopt it for their policy advocacy campaigns.</p><p>Because narrative shift is a critical component of the Centering Blackness Initiative, the Insight Center has also launched the <a href="https://www.blackthoughtproject.com/">Black Thought Project</a> to create safe spaces in cities that center, celebrate, and protect Black thoughts and expression.</p>Black Thought Project installation <a href="http://www.blackthoughtproject.com/">www.blackthoughtproject.com</a> Systems Change in the Informal Economy: <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/">Equity &amp; Transformation</a> <p>“Black informal workers are resilient and creative, and they have constructed an informal economy to acquire a means of subsistence,” — Richard Wallace, founder, and director of <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/">Equity &amp; Transformation</a> (EAT).</p>(Right) Richard Wallace, Founder and director of&nbsp;EAT<p>Founded in 2018, EAT is the only organization in the United States, specifically focused on protecting and uplifting Black workers operating in the informal economy. Defined as a set of unregulated economic activities, the informal economy includes street vending, childcare, auto-mechanic, and moving services — activities which allow people who cannot find standard employment to make a living, but without the protection of formal labor standards.</p><p>While EAT’s work includes research and policy development to destigmatize the informal economy, the organization also educates workers about their protections. EAT spearheads and collaborates on campaigns across Chicago to improve the lives of Black workers in the informal economy. The Guaranteed Income Project, for instance, provides previously incarcerated individuals with $500 per month to help cover their bills, find homes, and ultimately, reduce recidivism.</p>EAT <a href="http://www.eatchicago.org/">www.eatchicago.org</a> Building Power through Black Leadership: <a href="https://www.jwj.org/our-work/absi">Advancing Black Strategists Initiative</a> <p>Black leadership is critical to the success of racial and economic justice movements, but while BIPOC are often the implementers of social change campaigns, they rarely drive the strategies that energize these movements. The <a href="https://www.jwj.org/our-work/absi">Advancing Black Strategists Initiative</a> (ABSI)—a joint project led by The Jobs With Justice Education Fund, in collaboration with the Black Worker Initiative at the Institute for Policy Studies and Morehouse College—is raising a cohort of Black economic-justice and labor-focused strategists to lead, develop, and advance policies and campaigns.</p><p>ABSI will provide the tools and knowledge to equip Black strategists to work from the strength of their lived experiences, to inspire participation and engagement around polices that center Black economic justice. As this new generation of Black leaders takes on bigger roles and builds and wields power across movements, they will ultimately strengthen Black institutions, advance economic democracy, and change the socio-economic conditions of the Black community.</p> Narrative Shift at the Intersection of Race and Technology: <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet&nbsp;Enquiry</a> <p>While technology permeates our everyday lives, it is another system where built-in white supremacy limits both usage and accessibility by Black&nbsp;people.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet Enquiry</a> (a newly-founded interdisciplinary research center at UCLA) aims to use art and storytelling to reimagine technology, and in the process, champion racial justice, reframe our understanding of the role of technology in our lives, and strengthen democracy by holding those who create unjust systems and technologies accountable.</p><p>Over the next year, artist-in-residence, film-maker <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7307049">Oge Egbounu</a>, will work alongside the center’s co-directors and racial justice lead, to translate the center’s work into cultural artifacts that can resonate with a broad audience. This project creates a unique opportunity to develop cultural artifacts grounded in the center’s research that can shift narratives for mass audiences and tech workers alike, to more intentionally use and create technology in ways that do not harm&nbsp;others.</p> A Clear Path Forward: <a href="https://m4bl.org/">Movement for Black&nbsp;Lives</a> <p><a href="https://m4bl.org/">Movement for Black Lives</a> has a courageous vision: a long-term plan to shift the consciousness toward racial reckoning, and an ability to chart a clear path towards their goal. Fiscally sponsored by the Common Counsel Foundation, the Movement for Black Lives’ Black Power Rising: Vision 2024 seeks to build the social, political, institutional, and collective power of Black people by harnessing the collective power and creativity of Black people. Grounded in Black culture, the initiative aims to bring an informed electorate to the table to drive anti-racist policy&nbsp;shifts.</p><p>This strategic five-year plan will guide the coalition’s programmatic and campaign efforts to build mass support for progressive policies that center the needs of Black people. A core part of this work will equip local leaders with tools and strategies to build power within and between their organizations, scale engagement around political participation, and attack white supremacy by ensuring political representation and leadership, especially in Black communities.</p>Illustration by <a href="https://www.tiphughes.com/">Tiffany&nbsp;Hughes</a>. Restorative Justice Requires Restorative Investment <p>Why invest specifically in narrative shifting, and power-building in the intersections between movements, institutions, and Black leadership? Why look for spaces that prioritize economic justice in underfunded regions? Because we believe that this is where organizations are creating innovative, holistic solutions to specific problems that will generate the most significant returns.</p><p>In the course of identifying these organizations, we collaborated with five of our sister organizations within <a href="https://www.omidyargroup.com/">The Omidyar Group</a> —<a href="https://democracyfund.org/"> Democracy Fund</a>, <a href="https://flourishventures.com/">Flourish</a>, <a href="https://humanityunited.org/">Humanity United</a>, <a href="https://www.imaginablefutures.com/">Imaginable Futures</a>, and <a href="https://luminategroup.com/">Luminate</a> — to jointly fund two regranting organizations focused on supporting grassroots racial justice groups. Emergent Fund (a fiscally sponsored project of Amalgamated Charitable Foundation) quickly moves no strings attached resources to communities of color under attack by federal policies and priorities. Liberated Capital Fund of the Decolonizing Wealth Project (fiscally sponsored by Allied Media Projects) provides unrestricted resources through a reparations model to Black and Indigenous-led organizations to shape a future where we can all heal from generations of colonial trauma. As a result of the substantial work we’ve seen around the country, we will have exceeded our initial goal and invested a total of $1,050,000.</p><p>We believe that these investments are a significant step towards creating the world we are advancing toward in our mission as an organization. But this is only a first step. We are committed to building true partnerships with these organizations, putting our relevant resources at their disposal, and amplifying their work to a broader audience of both practitioners and funders. Investing in justice means much more than dollars; it is a whole-hearted commitment by our institution.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/an-investment-in-justice-bad462284f27">An Investment in Justice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome to the last DINZ newsletter of the 2020 (Gregorian) calendar year. Recognising that as with ideas of identity, our marking of time and seasons is very much based on our cultural and sometimes geographical context.&nbsp;We’ll avoid the temptation to contemplate fake snow and warmly-clothed grey bearded characters, and instead focus on things such as the beautiful pōhutukawa bringing colour and joy to our Aotearoa landscape.<br>&nbsp;<br>Reflecting on the theme of international diversity and context, we welcome you all to appreciate and share the video session&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/biasmlopes/?originalSubdomain=dk">Bianca Lopes</a>&nbsp;prepared for our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2020/12/07/aotearoa-digital-identity-hui-taumata-2/">November Aotearoa Digital Identity Hui</a>.&nbsp;In it she explored how five different countries have tackled the opportunities and challenges of developing digital identity ecosystems. It’s a great reminder of the importance of cultural context, and was a perfect springboard for our kapa kōrero session exploring identity from a Te Ao Māori perspective.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In the same&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2020/12/07/aotearoa-digital-identity-hui-taumata-2/">link</a>&nbsp;you can also watch an up-to-the minute update of the work of the Digital Identity Transition Programme, featuring Director Alan Bell and Emma O’Connell.&nbsp;We are excited about the ecosystem potential as a New Zealand Trust Framework and accreditation system starts to take shape.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our Annual Meeting was last week, and we had the pleasure of congratulating and welcoming our newly-elected Executive Council members Russell Craig (Microsoft), Sat Mandri (JNCTN) and John Evans (TSB), and the re-elected Luke McIntyre (Mattr).&nbsp;You can view the full Council&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Looking ahead to 2021<br>A number of you have been participating in our workshop sessions on AML Reliance and Trust and Identity Research and Education. We will be continuing with this collaborative, initiative-based approach into the New Year, phasing out our old working group structure.&nbsp;<br><br>We are very conscious that there is a big information gap between those on the ‘inside’ of all things digital identity and those at the other ends of the solutions. This includes&nbsp; individual and community service users, as well as a raft of commercial and community businesses and organisations for whom information and identity management is critical. Closing the gap will be a major focus for us in 2021, and we will be asking you to join us in that endeavour.<br><br>Introducing the New Zealand Tech and Innovation Story<br>I’d also like to make a mention of an exciting new programme that NZTech is leading. The New Zealand Tech and Innovation Story is a marketing initiative that will be designed to promote and enhance our international reputation for delivering world-class solutions and present New Zealand as a compelling place for tech talent and investment.&nbsp;But to get started, we need your help!<br><br>If you could take 10 minutes to complete&nbsp;<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/THJJXNN">this survey</a>&nbsp;it would be greatly appreciated (please feel free to share amongst your network also).</p>



<p>By completing the&nbsp;survey, you are playing a part in helping shape the narrative and the way we promote New Zealand’s tech and innovation capabilities internationally. The survey findings will be shared and will help form an integral part of developing the story we tell to the world.<br><br>A Christmas wrap<br>Finally, some Christmas good-giving inspiration for you from the&nbsp;<a href="https://thegoodregistry.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b6e92d96f6ff002bd992c7de3&amp;id=3f391eb51d&amp;e=ea906af905">Good Registry.</a><a href="https://thegoodregistry.com/pages/why-good-gift-cards">Good Gift Cards</a>&nbsp;are a wonderful way to unlock the joy of generous giving to Aotearoa charities, a beautiful gift of giving!</p>

				 <p>A DLT/blockchain independent platform to Issue and Verify certified attributes and claims, under different formats, and for any SSI system</p>
<p>With the introduction of notified eID schemas, thanks to eIDAS regulation, Europe made a big step forward in the identity management interoperability field. Yet these systems rely on centralized standard models and protocols (SAML being the most spread).</p>
<p>The enrichment of identity attribute with other types of attestations and claims, as of today, remains an unfulfilled promise: Federated Identity Model, upon which the whole eID system is based, isn’t enough agile to let new player come in and provide certified attributes services.</p>
<p>Italy is one of the main exemplifications: tough systems like SPID and CIE are gradually taking over the eID scenario, Attribute authorities, which should have provided attributes and claims about identities are, as of today, completely absent.</p>
<p>With the advent of SSI we have an extraordinary opportunity to deploy new technology standards to enrich eID: verifiable credential. Yet, we need to perfectly fit the regulatory trust model while still being compliant to eIDAS schemes.</p>
<p>But still SSI is a very complicated subject, both from the theoretical and technical point of view, mainly because it requires a deep understanding of blockchain and cryptography concepts.<br>Further on, each SSI project tends to propose its own solution as a closed platform, with no particular attention to interoperability and blockchain-independent solution approach.</p>

				 <p>An eIDAS bridge, which is a component that proposes to enhance the legal certainty of any class of verifiable credentials</p>
<p>The eIDAS bridge is a component that proposes to enhance the legal certainty of any class of verifiable credential, by incorporating the issuer’s advanced or qualified electronic signature (if the issuer is a natural person) or seal (if the issuer is a legal person).</p>
<p>Basically it allows Issuers to issue credentials that incorporate the issuer’s advanced or qualified electronic signature (if the issuer is a natural person) or seal (if the issuer is a legal person).</p>
<p>Trustworthiness in a Verifiable Credential is linked to the issuer’s DID: Verifying the identity of the issuer is paramount, since there is no binding of a DID to a real-world natural or legal person per se.</p>
<p>The main role of the eIDAS Bridge is to assist:</p>
 
 Issuers, in the process of signing/sealing a verifiable credential, and 
 Verifiers, in the last mile of the verification process, to help identifying the natural or legal person behind an issuer’s DID. 
 
<p>Its functions are:</p>
 
 Assist in setting up the Issuer’s qualified certificate. 
 Assist in signing or sealing Verifiable Credentials with the private key of a qualified certificate. 
 Assist in the verification process of a Verifiable Credential to retrieve the Qualified Certificate and verify it against the EU Trusted Lists.

				 <p>Online password less authentication based on SSI and FIDO2</p>
<p>Self-Sovereign IDentity Online (SSIDO) is an online passwordless solution for SSI users’ authentication through the standard Fast IDentity Online (FIDO2) protocols. SSIDO is aimed at consolidating both two technologies related to the Identity and Access Management (IAM). As a result, emerging SSI-enabled solutions can be seamlessly integrated with the existing FIDO2 applications.</p>
<p>The Web Authentication ceremony begins at the Application Layer between a user (Holder) and a Relying Party (Verifier) and implies an authentication assertion about the presence and consent of that previously registered user using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).</p>
<p>SSIDO extends this PKI-based approach by introducing the Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) built upon the concepts of SSI, Distributed Ledger, Agent, DID Record (DID and DID Document), as well as Verifiable Credential (VC) and Verifiable Presentation (VP).</p>
<p>To proceed with the Authentication ceremony at the Agent Layer, SSIDO incorporates the following two components:</p>
 
 SSIDO Authenticator, an edge-side agent (Holder’s Agent) designed for both mobile devices and desktop environments. 
 SSIDO Validator, a server-side or cloud-side agent (Verifier’s Agent). 
 
<p>SSI Authenticator responds to a challenge generated by SSI Validator (VP request) with the assertion signed by the user’s private key (VP). While attesting the received assertion (VP verification), SSI Validator employs the user’s public key retrieved from the DID Document.</p>
<p>The SSIDO solution is compatible with different schemes of verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations, and it can be generalized on Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</p>

				 <p>Open sourcing Evernym’s credential exchange platform</p>
<p>At Evernym, we have a history of open sourcing our work. Until now, we have kept the top layer of our SSI architecture proprietary. This layer provides a much easier to use SDK and platform for developers to create compelling SSI deployments compared to the lower level Hyperledger Indy/Ursa/Aries stack.</p>
<p>We want to encourage anyone to develop SSI solutions. For this reason, we will use our ESSIF-Lab grant to convert our proprietary software into repositories covered by a business source license, which itself will convert to an open source Apache 2.0 license after 36 months.</p>
<p>This will enable anyone to use and develop on our code, with all non production use permitted as well as production use up to a limit.</p>
<p>We believe this will accelerate SSI adoption, removing technical and commercial barriers to entry, by providing the world with access to the best SSI technology available.</p>
<p>Evernym’s products that are the target of this open sourcing initiative cover enterprise and consumer uses:</p>
 
 Verity: our enterprise SSI SDK and server to operate on-premise or as Saas. This performs all enterprise functions that are needed in an SSI ecosystem including forming DID connections, authentication, credential issuance and verification. 
 Mobile SDK: our app SDK to allow anyone to build Android or iOS based apps with full SSI wallet functionality. 
 Connect.Me: our mobile app that provides SSI wallet capability for making DID connections, holding credentials and sending proofs.

				 <p>TRAIN (TRust mAnagement INfrastructure): Trust Management Infrastructure Component for the ESSIF-Lab Architecture</p>
<p>Our component aims to extend the ESSIF-Framework through a global trust infrastructure that can be used to verify the trustworthiness of involved parties in an electronic transaction. The trust layer enables actors using the ESSIF-Framework to verify the root of trust of certificates used to sign credentials. In addition, the component allows for the definition, consideration, and verification of Trust Schemes compliance (e.g. eIDAS including LoAs or other Trust Schemes that can also be application/industry-specific) of involved parties. It is not dependent on a hierarchical CA infrastructure. The component builds on the infrastructure developed in the EU project LIGHTest (2016-2020, G.A. No. 700321). The trust layer is flexible, individual parties can define their own trust policies, manage and publish them. TRAIN is fully in line with the open and decentral SSI approach and complements other approaches.</p>
<p>The trust management architecture that is made possible by TRAIN enables secure, trustable digital interactions. At the same time a classical hierarchical CA-type structure is avoided – so is fraud, chaos and the pure dominance of the economically strongest actors in the system.</p>
<p>Individuals or groups (industry organizations, NGOs, etc.) of validators can define for themselves the trust standards they require. Issuers can publish to what standards they comply. The system is open, but standards for trust are transparent, as the Trust Schemes and Lists can be published.</p>

<p>Strengthens digital trust, simplifies member ID verification and digital exchange</p>
<p>Sherpa Technologies and CULedger today announced the integration of Sherpa’s identity and document verification-provided solution, ID-Pal, into CULedger’s MemberPass, to enable the first KYC-backed digital credential that provides credit unions a solution to verify their members’ identities. This first-of-its-kind integration of ID-Pal into MemberPass strengthens and supports the issuance of the digital credential by validating the member’s authenticity during the initial enrollment of MemberPass. It will be available for credit unions using MemberPass in the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>“ID-Pal is a compliant, end-to-end solution that offers a comprehensive and seamless ID and document verification experience,” said Sherpa Technologies’ President and CEO Keith Riddle. “The ID-Pal/MemberPass solution provides credit unions with a single experience for enhancing ID and member validation that can be applied to a variety of use cases. Additionally, Sherpa’s partnership with CULedger gives credit unions an opportunity to issue the MemberPass application and consume the digital credential through the Mosaic platform.”</p>
<p>Through MemberPass, a credit union member will receive a tokenized credential that is created instantly, following the ID-Pal verification process. Back-end integration between Sherpa’s Mosiac platform and CULedger ensures a seamless experience for issuing the digital credential. Credit union members use their MemberPass credentials to authenticate themselves seamlessly at any time and across any channel the credit union offers, from in-branch to mobile banking and digital onboarding.</p>
<p>“The solution encompassing the ID-Pal functionality embedded in the MemberPass wallet, along with Sherpa’s back-end integration capabilities, provides credit unions with the opportunity to implement a next-generation identity verification process and digital exchange for members,” said John Ainsworth, president, and CEO of CULedger. “The solution also provides meaningful improvements to the new member experience and offers a significant reduction in operational expenses for credit unions.”</p>
<p>Sherpa Technologies is ID-Pal’s exclusive identity verification solution partner for the U.S. credit union market and was one of the original investors in CULedger. In 2019, Sherpa and CULedger entered into a Letter of Understanding (LOU) to collaborate on the development and delivery of a streamlined, identity verification and digital identity issuance method to credit union members. “We chose to become an investor in CULedger more than a year ago due to its promise to deliver an innovative digital experience for digital identity and access to an open platform for the accelerated enablement within the credit union industry,” said Riddle.</p>
<p>To see how the ID-Pal/MemberPass new member enrollment process works, <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/1916079562799/WN_DbvUZXkbTzSdCsw34RU6Wg">sign up here</a> to attend an upcoming webinar.</p>

You can find more information about it <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/introducing-the-lissi-mobile-wallet-b2af9bccaf03">here</a>. However, this article details how it creates transparency for the&nbsp;user.</p> Your credential, information and transparency <p>When owning a credential it’s not only important what information it contains as attributes, but&nbsp;also:</p><p>1) When it was issued and presented, <br>2) Who issued it and to whom it was presented and <br>3) Which attributes were presented.</p>The Lissi wallet offers a clear overview of shared information.<p>The Lissi wallet illustrates the information of the credential (the attributes) within the info section. The activities section displays the interactions in which the credential was involved (e.g. an issuance or a proof request / verified presentation). It states all three of the above mentioned points. The Lissi wallet protocols all these interactions to increase transparency and help to stay informed.</p> Further developments <p>A protocol of interactions to monitor one’s activities is a good first step. However, the next topics, which we need to address are consent, sharing policies and the execution of GDPR&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Consent is a permission granted by an individual to a third party for a certain activity. In order to make an informed decision an individual e.g. needs to know: Who asks? Has the party the right to ask? What is done with the data? Where is it stored? All this information needs to be easily accessible for the user in order to grant or revoke consent for the use of his:her data. However, this should not be a vendor specific integration and instead needs to be discussed and formalised with other stakeholders. We are actively involved in such discussions in the Decentralised Identity Foundation (DIF) and other relevant communities.</p><p>Cheers<br>The Lissi&nbsp;Team</p>

<p>Asvin provides solutions for trust, secure update distribution in Internet of Things and monitoring of Software security for the entire life cycle. In 2020 the company has been awarded as best german cybersecurity startup. asvin has developed open-source solutions to secure and monitor the software for IoT applications in industry and consumer devices. Companies and IoT operators can minimize and control cyber security risks in IoT business by asvin. The solution includes smart contracts by using Hyperledger Besu in the Alastria Blockchain Network. During a Fed4Fire+ (<a href="https://www.fed4fire.eu/">https://www.fed4fire.eu/</a>) experiment the scalability and latency of the overall system architecture has been approved on an extended stress test emulating 100.000 Internet of Things&nbsp;devices.</p><p>How asvin is using the Alastria Blockchain Network</p><p>asvin.io utilizes blockchain nodes to securely and efficiently store security patches and device metadata. The setup of blockchain server is an open-source enterprise-grade permissioned Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</p><p>Our cybersecurity startup has been selected for <a href="https://blockchers.eu/">Blockchers</a> (<a href="https://blockchers.eu/">https://blockchers.eu/</a>) program in which we worked with <a href="https://alastria.io/en/">Alastria</a> and assembled Hyperledger Besu (an Etherium client) in our platform for blockchain solution. Now the asvin blockchain component is powered by HyperLedger Fabric and Besu to record all process logs. It facilitates a very secure platform. All parties in the network are authenticated and every transaction happening among them are stored in an immutable distributed ledger.</p><p>The Fed4FIRE+ Experiment on Extended Stress Test of asvin.io showed high performance of blockchain nodes during high traffic of requests.

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md">Uniform Resources specification</a> is one of Blockchain Commons’ most notable wallet enhancements of 2020: it enables airgapped PSBTs and is supported through a variety of reference libraries, including C++ and Swift implementations. Third parties have already ported the UR encoder to Python, Java, and Rust.</p>

<p>Uniform Resources, or URs, are a method for encoding binary data in plain text strings that are also well-formed URIs. They are simultaneously intended to address the challenges of QR codes, which are the main way that Bitcoin wallets transmit  data across airgaps. While QR codes themselves are standard, the data encoded within QR codes is not, resulting in inconsistent usage among developers.</p>

<p>URs were created to resolve these interoperability issues by creating a standardized method for encoding binary data. They’re built on CBOR, the Concise Binary Object Representation described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049">IETF RFC 7049</a>. The CBOR data is encoded in a typed UR object, which creates a self-describing, structured binary representation. URs can be transmitted as text or encoded via other means, including QR codes. Once received, URs can be decoded by different apps on different machines without having to guess about the contents or the encoding methods.</p>



<p>The tight size limitations of QRs, where version 40 QR codes max out at 2,953 bytes, are also resolved in the UR specification. The CBOR foundation supports sizes up to 2^32-1 bytes; the UR specification then describes how to sequence those large binary encodings into a multipart UR, which can be displayed across multiple QR codes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Thus far, the prime use of URs has been to allow the airgapped transmission of PSBTs, which frequently don’t fit into a single QR code. Using URs, PSBTs can instead be transmitted as a animated sequence of QR codes, with each frame displaying one part of a UR sequence. Fountain codes allow the QR recording to start at any point and resolve problems with missing individual frames. This permits for the easy and intuitive transmission of partially signed transactions to airgapped devices for further signing: a user just needs to hold up a camera to scan the animated QR.</p>

<p>However, URs can do much more than that: they can support any airgapped Bitcoin function, as well as Blockchain Commons’ unique <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md">torgap architecture</a>. Definitions for seeds, keypaths, addresses, and accounts allow for all sorts of Bitcoin data to be transmitted in the efficient, self-describing format. In additions, URs can be sent not just as QR codes, but also as URLs or Signal Whispers. The possibilities go far beyond animated QRs for PSBTs.</p>

<p>As a creator of open infrastructure, Blockchain Commons is working to support wallet interoperability, helping end-users have many flexible choices among vendors. URs are one of our earliest and most successful open wallet projects. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur">bc-ur reference library</a> supports URs in C++, while our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/URKit">URKit</a> does so in Swift. The specification has also been adopted by a number of third-party wallet developers:</p>
 
   Foundation Devices, a company that focuses on open hardware for the decentralized internet, has created a <a href="https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/foundation-ur-py">python implementation</a>. 
   Sparrow Wallet, a Bitcoin wallet for those who value financial self sovereignty, has created a <a href="https://github.com/sparrowwallet/hummingbird">java implementation</a>. 
   Dominik Spicher has created a <a href="https://github.com/dspicher/ur-rs">rust implementation</a>.
We expect to see URs deployed in more commercial wallets in the near future.
