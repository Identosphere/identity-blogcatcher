<p>By Jason Keirstead, OASIS Open board member</p> 


<p>Bravo to GitHub! Any member or advocate of global open source communities must applaud the move by GitHub to open source a lightweight community governance structure. GitHub’s <a href="https://github.blog/2021-07-22-minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/">Minimum Viable Governance (MVG)</a> model for free and open source software projects (FOSS) is a valuable resource to our community, addressing a very real pain point of open source innovators who are guiding projects with great potential but need an easy-to-implement governance structure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact is, many open source projects get started with no thought to governance issues whatsoever. That can cripple a project down the road when the base of maintainers and contributors grows beyond one or two people. I personally hope MVG takes off and becomes ingrained as “le mode de vie” (i.e., the way of life) for open source projects far and wide, especially as an on-ramp for those who are just getting started.</p>



<p>The ‘Yes, And…’&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my experience, as an open source project grows, its governance landscape gets a little more challenging to maneuver. As great as MVG is, FOSS teams should consider future scenarios that might require a bit more from their governance approach than MVG is intended to deliver:&nbsp;</p>



  Patents and IP Rights. MVG suggests a few options to choose from with regard to licencing and trademarks—ideal for when an open source project is small, because at this stage, let’s be honest, pulling in a legal team can be overwhelming and stifling. Ask most developers and they’ll tell you nothing sucks the wind out of a room of innovation-driven energy faster than a well-meaning team of lawyers!  



<p>Nevertheless, if you have any inkling at all that your project is going to grow and potentially attract involvement from additional people and entities, you need to give IP protection its due. In reality, many open source licenses are based on copyright laws that don’t protect your project contributors from patent claims as strongly as you may expect. To be sure, some open source licenses, such as the Apache license, offer projects explicit patent agreements to protect consumers. But others offer implicit agreements that may turn out to be tough to defend in court, and some offer nothing at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So beware: If your project has the potential to scale, you need to lay the groundwork to protect both your contributors and consumers, especially if corporate entities are or ever will be involved.</p>



  The Path to Standardization. What will your project be when it grows up? As Stephen Covey popularized in the best-selling “7 Habits of Highly Successful People,” it’s best to “begin with the end in mind.” Having a vision of what you plan to achieve is important in framing your decision making; it’s also critical because we don’t have time machines to rectify the “if only we had …” regret. It’s impossible to go back in time and redo your work!&nbsp;  



<p>Do you think your software could one day be commercialized across a vendor ecosystem? Could it be used by organizations that operate within regulatory frameworks? Do you dream of your software project becoming an industry standard? If you have big ambitions for your project, you should strongly consider having a solid path to a de jure standards process.</p>



<p>In the case of open source projects, preparing for a standards-based path means choosing a governance approach from the outset that documents a level playing field approach and backs that up with rules-based mechanisms. Without said documentation, achieving de jure status down the road could be a large challenge. MVG’s consensus-based approach is an ideal and first choice for an open source project when just a few people are participating. However, as soon as commercial entities get involved, decision making can become heated, because organizations will inevitably have conflicting priorities and visions for how to proceed. What no one wants to see in this situation is a cage match where two factions or stakeholders enter and only one leaves. That’s where a second layer of rules-based, vendor-neutral decision making is invaluable.&nbsp;</p>



  The Bus Factor. The bus factor is a real concern with a lot of open source projects; it refers (in perhaps too blunt and morbid terms) to how many individuals involved in your project can be hit by a bus and the project would still survive. Or, what if 90% of your maintainers all work for BigCo, and BigCo decides one day to withdraw from the project or hold the project ransom? And what if some brave champion comes along that has the ability and interest to do something with the neglected project? How do they get access to not only the code, but the project name, trademarks, web domains, and other important IP?  



<p>The key issue here is project continuity. We need to make sure that valuable open source projects have the foundation they need to live beyond any one person or corporate entity. MVG doesn’t really address this issue sufficiently.</p>



<p>The point is, if you are trying to build something that lasts and has the ability to scale, you probably want a larger governance structure around it than MVG provides. That’s the value provided by open source foundations like OASIS Open, on whose board I serve. (Others with which you are likely familiar include Apache Software Foundation, Cloud Native Computing Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, the Mozilla Foundation, and Open Infrastructure Foundation.)</p>



<p>In the case of OASIS Open, its <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/">Open Projects</a> governance model is like a hardened laptop—built to stand up to battle conditions. Going beyond the basics of MVG, the Open Projects program enables seamless collaboration with commercial interests, striking a smart balance between “the easy button” and the legal hoops required to provide protections to contributors and strong protection to the project itself. The Open Projects program also offers open source projects a governance process that is recognized by de jure international standards bodies, so if you choose to one day take your project down the path to standardization, you’ll be ready—no time machine needed.</p>



<p>If you’re launching an open source project, by all means, consider using GitHub’s MVG approach as your on-ramp. And when your project takes off, reach out to OASIS Open or another open source foundation to build something enduring, impactful and rewarding for all those who contribute.</p>

	<p>We’re pleased to announce that the Me2B Alliance has fully approved our <a href="https://me2ba.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/me2ba-operating-proceduresv1.0-20211210.pdf">Membership Operating Procedures</a>. This significant milestone for the organization defines the governance, organization, and operating rules for the Me2B Alliance Membership activities, projects, and Working Groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was the process?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Operating Procedures were subjected to&nbsp;multiple approval stages which included:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Membership Council reviewed&nbsp;the&nbsp;draft&nbsp;Operating Procedures weekly beginning&nbsp;in&nbsp;September 2021&nbsp;and&nbsp;unanimously&nbsp;voted to approve&nbsp;them&nbsp;at the end of October&nbsp;2021.<br>
 
 The draft Operating Procedures then moved on to a two-week review period by the Full Membership Community.&nbsp; 
 Following the review period,&nbsp;the Full Membership Community&nbsp;voted to approve the draft Operating Procedures.&nbsp;43% of members voted (33%&nbsp;required)&nbsp;and&nbsp;100% voted to approve&nbsp;(51%&nbsp;required).&nbsp; 
 The&nbsp;last step&nbsp;in the process was&nbsp;a review and vote by&nbsp;the Board of Directors. This final&nbsp;approval&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;on December 10, 2021.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;This rigorous process ensured a thorough examination&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Operating Procedures which are a crucial part of our membership operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
What are the Operating Procedures?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Operating Procedures are used by Me2B Alliance Members, Working Group Chairs, and Me2B Alliance Staff to provide governance for membership operations and ensure successful development of respectful tech specifications. They also define voting, our publication approval process, Working Group responsibilities, and much more.&nbsp;</p>

 This post expands on the fifth key pillar for building a new economic paradigm as outlined in <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Our Call to Reimagine Capitalism</a>. Read the first post in this series, “An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and Economy”&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">here</a>. <p>By Audrey Stienon, Associate, Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>This time last year, many of us were making new year’s resolutions for 2021 with hope that after months of chaos, this would be the year where some normalcy would be restored to our lives. On many levels, this came to pass. Most notably, over 3.6 billion people have been fully vaccinated against COVID in the past twelve months, allowing many of us to plan for year’s end celebrations with family and&nbsp;friends.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is impossible to look to 2022 without noticing the rumbling warnings of the storm clouds gathering on our horizon. During a year of record heat, floods, droughts, and storms, world leaders concluded the COP26 meetings in Glasgow while leaving us on track to experience an estimated 2.4 degrees of warming by the end of the century — an outcome which threatens to expose hundreds of millions of people to life-threatening climate conditions. Misinformation and conspiracies continue to run rampant across our virtual networks, feeding discord and mistrust precisely at a time when unity of action and purpose have been paramount. And, of course, the emergence of a new COVID variant acts as an unwelcome reminder that borders are meaningless in fighting the growing number of crises that now threaten all of humanity.</p><p>In this context, we must recognize that, whether we want it or not, unpredictability rather than stability is the new normal of our lives. Whether it is to come from climate change or the development of new groundbreaking technologies, change is coming, and it would be as futile to try to prevent this as it would be to hold back a flood. Instead, for the new year, we as a society must resolve to embrace change, learning to ride the waves so that we find stability amid the tumult — and in so doing, retain greater control over the direction that change takes&nbsp;us.</p><p>This degree of comfort with change requires that we become more resilient, and thus able to regain our balance after a wave hits us. We will need to get better at quickly and efficiently redistributing our weight and resources to stay afloat, holding on to others for support without accidentally knocking them off balance, and making space for new ideas — perhaps even risky ones — for how to chart a more stable course. Furthermore, not all change is harmful, and given the continued inequalities and divisions of our society, much change is necessary. By becoming comfortable with change, we can make repairs so that we are more likely to stay afloat when the next storm&nbsp;breaks.</p><p>Our economy can be a critical system for helping us recover from and adjust to rapid change and these unpredictable shocks, helping us to reach a new level of resilience.</p><p>Unfortunately, not only is our economy itself vulnerable to being overwhelmed by new shocks, it also actively contributes to a number of the crises that we are facing. The norms of economic behavior that we follow as consumers, producers, employers or investors do not encourage us to consider the consequences of our decisions on others, and so we see companies pursuing profits while polluting entire communities, or while unveiling digital metaverses that promote discord and corrode social trust. Inequality remains staggeringly high, robbing the majority of people of the financial resources they need to invest in moving their families away from environmental dangers or in learning jobs skills demanded by new technology. Policymakers who drag their feet on, or even actively oppose, efforts to address these challenges remain in power through the monetary support of the largest companies and the wealthy. And government and community systems have been weakened to the point of no longer being able to ensure that the people most threatened by these impending crises have the power to participate in the shaping of social and economic systems that will protect&nbsp;them.</p><p>If we are to survive as a prosperous, democratic society, we need our economy to stop being part of the problem and instead become part of the solution. Indeed, there is no feasible way in which our society can build enough resilience to survive — let alone thrive — in the face of these crises without the support of a vibrant, competitive, and inclusive economy.</p><p>We need an economy that people can reliably depend on for wealth and income, one that everyone can benefit from when times are good, and one with social insurance and financial systems that efficiently distribute resources to where they are needed when times get bad. We need markets structured to foster innovation and reward people who take risks to find profitable, competitive ways to solve new societal problems; we also need guardrails against attempts by those who would use the power they have gained from past innovative success to prevent the next great idea from competing with their own. We need government and community institutions to be flexible and equipped with as many economic tools as possible to respond to whatever challenge materializes. And we need networks and institutions of global cooperation that will turn our interdependence with people around the world from a liability to an asset in presenting a common front opposed to shared&nbsp;threats.</p><p>The good news is that the resilience we build against one crisis will better prepare us for the next challenge. Efforts to reduce carbon emissions, for example, will limit the extent that climate change — by disproportionately hurting already vulnerable communities — exacerbates existing global inequalities. Similarly, efforts to limit power inequalities — by increasing multi-racial participation in democratic systems, or reducing global poverty — will ensure that solutions to the climate crisis are strengthened from input from all of humanity’s knowledge and experiences.</p><p>All told, we at Omidyar Network believe that the level of our individual and societal resilience will make the difference between our being a society in which the ideas and energy that we collectively contribute to overcome the challenges ahead form the basis of a new, broadly shared prosperity, or our being a society that loses control and is torn apart by the&nbsp;waves.</p><p>Although many of our partners organize their work around countering specific challenges — such as the climate crisis or fight for racial justice — our priority is to build cross-sectoral economic resilience so that we are prepared for new challenges in whatever form they materialize. Therefore, all of our work is ultimately intended to boost resilience by dismantling existing economic systems that foster instability and building in their place systems that uphold a democratic, inclusive, equitable, prosperous, and sustainable society.</p><p>By shifting the ideas and<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-grounding-our-economy-in-a-new-ideas-and-values-99596c8dabe8"> values that underpin the economy</a>, our partners are strengthening our understanding of the ways in which markets can exacerbate problems such as climate change or racial inequalities, and providing proposals for how we can design economic systems and tools that prepare us for the challenges ahead.</p><p>By working to change the rules that structure the economy, our partners are shaping <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-network-commits-10-million-to-new-focus-area-corporations-capital-markets-and-the-common-good/">markets that incentivize businesses and people to contribute to the common good</a>, while dismantling systems that currently reward harmful behavior towards people and&nbsp;planet.</p><p>By building power for <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ON_POV_PDF-2020.pdf">workers</a> and communities, our partners are creating a more equitable balance of power across market actors, and ensuring that the people who will be most harmed in any crisis have a say in designing the policies and systems that will prepare and protect&nbsp;them.</p><p>Finally, as a funder, we are ourselves cognizant of our power to contribute directly to resilience during and after crises. At the start of the pandemic, we launched an <a href="https://omidyar.com/news/omidyar-announces-economic-response-advocacy-fund-investment-in-18-advocacy-organizations/">Economic Relief Advocacy Fund </a>to provide immediate support to national and local groups working to address the economic toll of the pandemic on working people. We also have helped set up the <a href="https://carryonthefightfund.org/">Carry on the Fight Fund</a> to build the long-term capacity of grassroots organizations in Arizona, Louisiana, Michigan and Minnesota to push for systemic&nbsp;reform.</p><p>We as a society may be heading into a storm, but that does not mean that our fate is sealed. People built this society — its communities, its markets, its governments — and we, as people, have it in our power to determine the strength and resilience of these systems from here on out. Therefore, as we each take the time to reflect on ways that we can be better people in the coming year, we invite each of you to also consider the ties between you to and the people and communities around you, and to resolve to start the new year prepared to fight for the ideas, rules, and power that will protect us, all of us, in the choppy waters&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>This is the final post in our “Reimagining Capitalism” series.

<p>Is your institution ready to infuse on-campus learning spaces with digital tools and strategy? Many schools were forced to enhance the delivery of online and digital learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As we continue to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptations made during the last several years, there’s a great opportunity to more deeply leverage the progress we’ve made in the digital world and apply lessons and tools to a more digitally-enabled learning experience in-person.</p>
<p>Join this session to learn how your institution can:</p>
 
 Evaluate learning spaces and other areas on campus for their readiness to support digital learning 
 Accelerate the learning space enhancement process by using repeatable, validated space and instructional design models 
 Improve the in-person student experience by leveraging digital tools and strategies more effectively as part a long term return to campus 
 Partner with Edge as a nonprofit, leveraging our deep subject matter expertise and experience in the field to help your institution drive effective digital transformation

 A reflection on&nbsp;2021 <p>We Are Open Co-op has had a big year! It’s time for a bit of reflection, and we thought we would write a quick post that sums up all the things we did this&nbsp;year.</p> Quarter 1 Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> of&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>As we came into 2021, we kicked off the year with <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-year-of-the-rebuild-co-op-2-0-2c67ad5c69e6">a Co-op Day</a>. 2020 was certainly A Year, so we needed to regroup and reflect on what we wanted to co-op to be. We reviewed processes and policies and set our sights on what we wanted to achieve in 2021. We wanted to do different kinds of projects. We wanted to inspire our long term clients and contacts.</p><p>We bid for <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/prototyping-with-purpose-catalyst-definition-phase-f1ee568b3684">the Catalyst Definition project</a> in January. We were successful, and Catalyst asked us to run a programme for a cohort of 10 charities. Meanwhile, Doug Belshaw was running <a href="https://medium.com/sector-challenge-9-claiming-universal-credit">another Catalyst programme</a> in parallel. Throughout the spring we helped our charities learn new skills. We helped them make <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/archive/2021/02">plans for their communities</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/archive/2021/03">define the charity tech projects</a>. We assisted their digital transformation initiatives.</p><p>In March, we began production for an internal Greenpeace International project that shall not be named 😉 In April, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/thats-a-wrap-2c6bd649968c">we wrapped up the Definition Project</a> and continued to make resources and assets for our secret learning project at Greenpeace.</p> Q2 Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> of&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>In May, we did some <a href="https://weareopen.coop/near/">workshopping with the crypto platform NEAR</a>, which was the first time we accepted cryptocurrency as part of our fee. In May, We Are Open Cooperative also <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wao-turns-five-30747f4df0f9">turned 5 years old</a>. We celebrated this momentous occasion by launching our <a href="https://weareopen.coop">new website</a> and adding more stuff to our <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop">free learning resource hub</a>. As icing on the cake, two members created a new podcast “about the intersection of technology, society, and internet culture — with a dash of philosophy and art for good measure” called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tao-of-wao">the Tao of&nbsp;WAO</a>.</p>Our Tao of WAO header, CC-BY Laura Hilliger of&nbsp;WAO<p>We also created a proposal to develop an internship programme for WAO. We wanted to provide new people with intimate understanding about the kinds of skills and mindsets members and collaborators have. We wanted to create a programme in which we could learn from our interns, as they would learn from&nbsp;us.</p>Learning journey design (using Whimsical) CC-BY Laura Hilliger &amp; Doug Belshaw of&nbsp;WAO<p>Catalyst selected us for another Catalyst programme, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/all-good-things-come-to-an-end-e3d21a93da49">the Continuation Programme</a>. This was an extra bit of funding for charities to have more one to one support. The co-op set up consultation sessions and office hours for charities. To give back to a wonderful funding partner, we participated in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/on-common-ground-8fadc99692cd">the Catalyst Network Engagement Working&nbsp;Group</a>.</p><p>June is also the month we started working on a new project with longtime collaborators, <a href="https://www.participate.com/">Participate</a>. We went to Participate with some ideas on revamping an email course we used to run on the basics called <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/badge-bootcamp-will-be-back-soon-b11859b01873">Badge Bootcamp</a>. After one meeting, we realised that <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/participation-thats-what-s-gonna-save-the-human-race-pete-seeger-ae57ba8370a5">it’s a good time to do more</a>. We started looking at the intersection between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice">Communities of Practice</a> and <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open&nbsp;Badges</a>.</p> Q3 CC-BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/hashtag/activism/">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a><p>In July our ideas with Participate started to balloon. We published a post on <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/badges-for-digital-transformation-7e9e1a17e714">Badges for Digital Transformation</a> and documented <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/4-benefits-of-open-recognition-pathways-a51c10a37633">the Benefits of Open Recognition Pathways</a>.</p><p>Also in July, we had time to work on some internal stuff and process things that have been happening in the world. We had a bit of an existential chat and published a post and a wiki page to explain <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/spirit-of-wao-e5cb23c8cdfb">the Spirit of&nbsp;WAO</a>.</p>Anne, very much frozen in Lapland, CC BY-NC-SA Anne&nbsp;Hilliger<p>And then came August, another momentous month as WAO welcomed <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/hello-world-6b5c8caed8db">its first intern</a>. Anne started on the first, a start date that allowed her to have a good full month of onboarding as August tends to be quite slow. In August, our Catalyst Continuation project <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-end-of-the-beginning-fad2447f378f">came to an end</a>. We had time to help Anne get to know her new workplace and colleagues.</p><p>There was movement in the open badges community, as a proposal to align Open Badges with the W3C standard for Verifiable Credentials was made. Developments in this conversation impact some of our clients, so <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-standards-should-be-developed-openly-1f0cf552308d">we paid close attention</a> to the discussion.</p><p>Towards the end of August, we started working with our friends at <a href="https://outlandish.com/">Outlandish</a> on a strand of work for a new client, <a href="https://juliesbicycle.com">Julie’s Bicycle</a>, a pioneering not-for-profit mobilising the arts and culture to take action on the climate and ecological crisis.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> of&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>In September we continued collaborating with <a href="https://outlandish.com">Outlandish</a> on Julie’s Bicycle (JB) software projects, and we launched <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/climate-change-for-the-better-457134bd0b43">a new strand to the project</a>, the Strategy strand. Our task was to help the climate-focused non-profit with strategic stuff. In September we helped JB write job descriptions, figure out structural stuff and otherwise support the organisation as they prepare to hire their first digital team. We also began thinking about the strategy that team would implement.</p><p>Our September co-op day used a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/strategic-starfish-another-co-op-day-4745b52b798f">Strategic Starfish</a> to reflect a bit on how things are and where we want to&nbsp;go.</p> Q4 CC-BY Laura Hilliger and Bryan Mathers of WAO. <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/feed">Join us&nbsp;here</a>!<p>A lot of work happened behind the scenes in October. We prepared to launch a pilot training programme with Greenpeace. We ran interviews for a Product Lead, contributed to funding documents and started imagining a digital strategy for Julie’s Bicycle. We prepared and then launched the <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/keep-badges-weird-e26a1b055ff5">Keep Badges Weird</a> community alongside Participate at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jObhmAVyCKk">Badge Summit</a>, and we did platform feedback work for Participate as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The Keep Badges Weird community received a good reception, and we pushed out three badge heavy posts around our community facilitation and content creation.</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/designing-badges-for-co-creation-and-recognition-62fd06fd5636">Designing Badges for Co-creation and Recognition</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reflecting-on-the-evolving-badges-and-credentials-ecosystem-6efac4d673d3">Reflecting on the Evolving Badges and Credentials Ecosystem</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/good-things-happen-slowly-bad-things-happen-fast-2fd894cbd4df">Good things happen slowly, bad things happen&nbsp;fast</a>  <p>In addition to helping members with Keep Badges Weird work, <a href="https://medium.com/@anne.hilliger/rethinking-we-are-opens-learning-platform-learnwith-wao-b6d2f4d022a3">Anne spent time</a> in the autumn thinking about and improving Learnwith.</p><p>For Greenpeace, we launched our pilot and agreed to a new project. The new project is around implementing a strategy we wrote a while back. We found a new collaborator to work with and are looking forward to project kick off in&nbsp;2022.</p><p>We wrote, edited, illustrated and finished <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-and-creative-climate-platform-116640a62132">a fully fledged digital strategy</a> for Julie’s Bicycle between October and the end of November too. It’s a meaty piece of work that has been called “impressive”, “inspiring” and “ambitious”.</p>WAO badge design v.04 CC-BY Laura Hilliger and Bryan Mathers of&nbsp;WAO<p>For the last couple of weeks, we’ve continued refining JB bits and bobs and we’ve run some workshops with <a href="https://outlandish.com">Outlandish</a>. We’re bringing the two Julie’s Bicycle strands, software and strategy, back together as the digital strategy envisions a big shift. We’ve also been pleased to begin onboarding JB’s new product lead, who hasn’t even officially started.</p><p>Anne’s fresh eyes and interest in media pedagogy has proven extremely helpful in the Participate Keep Badges Weird work. We’ve encouraged her <a href="https://medium.com/@anne.hilliger/all-i-am-thinking-about-are-open-badges-9c9760a60c49">to fall deeper into the world</a> of edtech and, in particular, badges. Over the course of her internship, Anne has been coming up with badges that are relevant to her. WAO has started thinking about a badge design system so that she gets her badges&nbsp;soon.</p><p>The last bit of “work” we have to do this year is our WAO Christmas Party. We’re going to eat mince pies, play silly games and spend a bit of time just being together before we retreat for some well earned&nbsp;rest.</p> Next Year <p>Oh there’s so much! Members are looking forward to more <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tao-of-wao">Tao of WAO podcast</a> in 2022, we’ll come back to get our badge design done and dusted, and we’re going into the new year with a fairly full client&nbsp;slate.</p><p>We are, however, always looking for new, interesting things to do. We have some changes afoot (all good things!) in the co-op so it’s going to be interesting to see how we evolve next year. For now, if you’re reading this post and feel like you want to work with a collective of independent thinkers and makers, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact">give us a shout</a>!

<p>We at DIDAS are committed to establishing and promoting a viable and thriving self-sovereign identity ecosystem.</p>
<p>We are convinced that this identity-centric approach will enable a fundamental change in how social, public and business areas interact and work together in the future. This change will underpin the values ​​of our country and lead to greater data sovereignty and better data protection for each individual.</p>
<p>Our goal is to overcome complex, systematic and multifaceted challenges in the design of services and to enable more seamless digital processes &amp; experiences. With this <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SSI-Explainer-Introduction-final.pdf">presentation</a> (in German) we start the journey and want to:</p>
 
 Offer a broader audience access to functionality and developments relating to the topic of self-sovereign identity – comprehensive and interdisciplinary. 
 Give interested parties the opportunity to deal with the topic in a simple, understandable and technology-agnostic manner and to develop an understanding of the effects and potentials of digitisation. 
 Show citizens the advantages compared to other approaches so that they can follow discussions relating to digital identity (e.g. E-ID) and form an opinion. 
 Provide decision-makers with a memorable summary of the most important principles, international opinions and relevant take-aways. 
 
<p>The <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SSI-Explainer-Introduction-final.pdf">Self Sovereign Identity Explainer</a>&nbsp; (in German) is the basis for the future discussions and in-depth learning. It briefly introduces the development history of digital identity and roughly describes the different phases of identity in the Internet age.</p>
<p>In order to gain a better understanding of how a digital identity should be designed and the principles according to which it should be realized, we briefly deal with the characteristics and complexity of an identity. Derived from this understanding, we summarise the most important SSI principles (WEF, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">Christopher Allen</a>, Sovrin <a href="https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/">principles)</a> in an easy to understand way and thus formulate our DIDAS Good Practices.</p>
<p>These good practices will help us in the future to better classify and evaluate technological developments, legal and regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Building on the preceding explanations, we reflect on the functionality of the peer-to-peer approach and show the importance of a governance framework – it is actually the interplay of “Human Trust” and “Cryptographic Trust” that enables a functioning ecosystem that is accepted by all parties. We conclude the Self Sovereign Identity Explainer with a short presentation of the benefits and show how SSI pays off for the parties involved.</p>
<p>We wish all readers a fruitful examination of the world of Self Sovereign Identity and we would be pleased if we can win you over to this exciting and promising topic.</p>

 Reaching the Next Milestone in Counteracting Sybil Attackers <p>The development of BrightID began three years ago with the goal of providing a decentralized platform for applications to ensure the uniqueness of their users and counteract the attack of bots on their applications. We believe that the only decentralized, scalable, and reliable way to detect humans from bots in the future of cyberspace is to rely on the social relations of&nbsp;humans.</p><p>From the beginning, BrightID was supposed to distinguish real users from bots and verify them by analyzing the graph formed by connections that users make with their friends and family members. However, the graph-analysis-based verification methods can only be used if there is enough data covering them. It is not possible to use such verification methods unless a graph of a significant number of users who have connected with at least a small number of friends exists. That is why BrightID had to make use of another verification method to verify its early users in the initial stage although that method was not reliable and scalable.</p><p>Joining connection parties and making connections with a trusted person who hosts the call was the initial verification method that BrightID used. In this stage, BrightID was like a newborn fed on milk. As milk is the only suitable food for a newborn to grow in the first stages of growth, the only healthy way that BrightID could grow enough was to rely on the Stars in connection parties to verify users. And just as milk is not enough for newborns to grow as they age, BrightID cannot grow by only relying on stars. And just as humans always use milk as nutritious food, using stars can always be a basic verification method in BrightID.</p><p>Today, we are proud to announce that BrightID has grown enough to start using graph-analysis-based verification methods. BrightID has more than 30,000 active users, 10,000 of whom have made 4 connections on average with the people they know in person. That is why BrightID can now start to use other verification methods. Soon BrightID will be making use of various verification methods, the first ones are Aura and&nbsp;Bitu.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/brightid/brightid-verification-story-2d0c2ab82f42">BrightID Verification Story</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/brightid">BrightID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

		<p>New Jersey’s Community Colleges are critical institutions of higher education and economic opportunity; reaching a significant proportion of the state’s population and offer an affordable, high-quality education that serves the complex needs of students, employers, and local communities. As president of the New Jersey Council of County Colleges (NJCCC), Dr. Aaron R. Fichtner, has a broad influence in establishing the advancement of New Jersey’s Community Colleges. The recent health and economic crisis introduced new challenges to accomplishing that mission and has forced many institutions in the education community to reevaluate their long-term goals. New Jersey’s Community Colleges continue to play an important role in responding to the current crisis and ensuring that students and communities can rebound in the months ahead.</p>
<p>“Operating a college or community college during a pandemic has been very challenging, from keeping people safe to finding creative ways to deliver high-quality instruction,” says Fichtner. “We’ve learned how to do things remotely that we might not have thought were possible even three years ago. In a larger sense, the pandemic accelerated many of the major changes that are happening in the economy and to our students. We need to think differently about how we build a skilled workforce to drive economic growth and prepare people for family-sustaining careers. As educational institutions, we must ensure that we’re building a broader partnership and providing people with the knowledge, skills, and abilities that will serve them well in their life.”</p>
<p>Translating Insight into Action<br>
With the speed at which the economy is evolving, Fichtner says some industries are changing the way they do business, and the educational space must make haste as well. “First, we must understand what is going on in these industries. We not only should drive decisions based on data, but also have enough interactions with people in other industries across the state to have an accurate pulse on what’s transpiring in our region. With this information, we can then translate those insights into real action. Community Colleges play a vital role, but we can’t do any of this alone, so we continue to build relationships with high schools, workforce development partners, and 4-year colleges and universities.”</p>
<p>To expand the collaborative ecosystem of partners in education, higher education, and workforce development, NJCCC and the New Jersey Business and Industry Association have launched a new initiative, NJ’s Pathways to Career Opportunities. This collective effort has three main goals: (1) to build strong industry driven education and training pathways that will be the foundation of the state’s economy for years to come, (2) to build a skilled workforce that can adapt to the changing economy, and (3) to provide adults the opportunity to obtain new skills and careers. “Our mission is to build a talent ecosystem based on collaboration and information to expand economic mobility and opportunity and drive economic growth,” explains Fichtner. “We will focus on four industries and allow employers to guide our work and dialogue. These industry sectors include (1) health services, (2) innovation and technology, (3) infrastructure and energy, and (4) manufacturing and supply chain management.”</p>
<p>NJ’s Pathways to Career Opportunities will also be creating Centers of Workforce Innovation (COWIs) at ten local colleges where partners work together to develop new programs and modernize existing curriculum.&nbsp; Representatives from across the industry and state will provide guidance for COWIs and as a group, will share curriculum, provide professional development for faculty and staff, and develop transfer agreements. “If a high school student wants to work in data analytics, we want to make sure that the classes at his/her high school are aligned with the Community College he or she may later transfer to after graduation,” says Fichtner. “We want to allow students to earn stackable credentials that make them employable, but will also allow them to get a 4-year college degree, without having to start over again.”</p>

		<p>Expanding Student Research Opportunities<br>
In support of research and discovery and broadening participation of institutions connected to the regional and national research and education fabric, Edge has submitted for the National Science Foundation’s Campus Cyberinfrastructure regional connectivity grant. With this funding, Edge aims to increase research and education connectivity among smaller, less-resourced institutions, including Community Colleges.</p>
<p>EdgeDiscovery continues to identify partnership opportunities for advancing its mission for supporting research, education, and innovation. “Working with R1 institutions through to Community Colleges, Edge is engaged from many perspectives, including research and discovery and workforce development,” shares Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs at Edge. “With regard to our education and workforce development, there is a great deal of opportunity to advance capabilities and competencies in areas such as advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI), data science, and analytics at every level of education.”</p>
<p>To address the need for a skilled workforce who can support the advanced cyberinfrastructure for research computing and data, advanced networking, cloud services, and cybersecurity, a cybertraining opportunity conducted by Edge, Rutgers University, and NJCCC is currently being explored. With a goal of creating a CI career pathway, the project aims to become a track within the NJ’s Pathways to Career Opportunities program. “The focus of the program will be in four areas, including systems facing, research facing, data facing, and cybersecurity,” explains Ghahramani. “These skills are of interest for both academia and industry.”</p>
<p>Along similar lines, Edge is exploring a cohort-based Bridge-to-STEM program between Community Colleges, Rutgers, and NJCCC that will also align with the NJ’s Pathways to Career Opportunities initiative. “The Bridge program will offer an array of services and opportunities to participating students, including the potential to conduct undergraduate research,” says Ghahramani. “Other program components include a select set of credit bearing STEM courses, industry speakers, hands-on internship opportunities, and undergraduate research. The plan is to pursue joint funding for these programs, start with a few Community Colleges, and expand in the future.”</p>
<p>Creating an Environment for Organic Collaboration<br>
The choice to select innovation and technology as one of the industries of focus was inspired by conversations regarding STEM-related pathways. “We consciously picked innovation and technology as one of our four sectors from our discussions with Edge and Rutgers University this past year,” shares Fichtner. “We will look to the leadership and staff at Edge to provide insight into the changing needs of employers and to help us create a framework for organic and natural collaborations. Oftentimes, we all live in our silos and react to whatever crisis or issues arise, but if we had an ongoing place, physical and otherwise, that would bring people together, we believe we’ll be better able to solve problems, inspire innovations, and create an environment for creativity and growth.”</p>

		<p>As the pandemic forced many people to shift to a home-based work and school environment, countless families struggled to participate in remote learning due to a lack of adequate internet access and computing resources. While many districts worked to help close the gap, between 9 and 12 million U.S. students still lack adequate Internet at home.1 With hopes of helping to close the digital divide and expand technology access to more neighborhoods, the Hub City Mesh project is working to bring free Internet to more households. Involved in this mission is Jeff Bedser, CEO, iThreat, along with Edge, Rutgers University, and the Internet Society. “Children should not have barriers to accessing the Internet for educational purposes,” says Bedser. “While the need for internet access grew amid the pandemic, our program looks to create a long-term strategy for getting the Internet in the hands of more students so they can have an equal playing field in regards to education.”</p>
<p>After graduating from Rutgers, Bedser began his career at Johnson &amp; Johnson in the Global Security Department, and later started his own company, iThreat, which specializes in internet investigations and threat intelligence. Throughout the years, Bedser has looked for ways to share his experience and expertise as a volunteer for various organizations. “For the first half of my career in global security, I worked with ASIS International, a global community of security practitioners, and later became involved with the Security Instability Advisory Committee for ICANN, a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation who is dedicated to keeping the Internet secure, stable, and interoperable. Now, for the past 4 ½ years, I’ve been serving as the vice chair of the Public Interest Registry board through the Internet Society. Their mission is to bring the Internet to underprivileged communities throughout different parts of the world.”</p>

		<p>Connecting the Community<br>
In July 2020, Bedser began meeting with Keith Jones, former Chief of Staff for Mayor Cahill in New Brunswick, to find ways he could help with the underlying issues that were contributing to the disparity between parents who could afford Internet in their homes and those who could not. “The Internet Society has a department dedicated to creating grants for programs that connect communities with much-needed internet resources. Through my partnership with the City, the Hub City Mesh project was born, with a mission of bringing free Internet to a larger number of neighborhoods. As the program began rolling, we were able to get the needed hardware funding from the Internet Society, but we still needed additional partners. Thankfully, Rutgers joined the project, along with Edge, creating a collaboration made in heaven. Rutgers donated the bandwidth for this program and is allowing an initial access point on one of their buildings to bring data out to the city. Edge is building and running the needed networks and is helping install and maintain the necessary equipment. We are currently working on getting city approvals, and once we’re up and running, other partners like Johnson &amp; Johnson and New Brunswick Tomorrow, will also be joining the project.”</p>
<p>As the implementation and rollout of the Hub City Mesh project takes place, creating a safe and secure network is a top priority. “Currently, we are able to boost the Service Set Identifier (SSID), or Wi-Fi network, of a school system,” explains Bedser. “Most schools have networks that go just beyond school walls, where children can access needed resources. By piggybacking on the current security of the school system’s own networks, we can provide a secure amplification of the same network.”</p>
<p>Creating Equal Learning Opportunities<br>
With plans to expand the Hub City Mesh project, the group has received helpful resources and inspiration from NYC Mesh, a similar project that has been running for a few years out of New York City, and Murambinda Works, a community network in Zimbabwe. “I believe we are the first network built on the model that solely focuses on giving children internet access for education,” shares Bedser. “By working with Edge and their member institutions in New Jersey, we hope to bring this service to the Route 1 corridor. We look to bridge between Baltimore and Philadelphia, all the way to New York City, and hit the most densely urban areas where many disaffected students reside.”</p>
<p>“The technology to create these mesh networks is getting better and better at handling greater bandwidth and will give us a greater opportunity to help a larger number of people,” Bedser continues. “Especially in a place like New Brunswick, where Rutgers campuses are on either side of the city, students would be able to get bandwidth almost seamlessly from the Hub City Mesh network into the Rutgers network. While progress on the project has encountered some hurdles due to restrictions caused by COVID, the collaborative effort remains strong and the program will exist well beyond the pandemic. All students deserve equal education and we look forward to bridging the gap and helping to bolster connectivity and opportunity within the community.”</p>

		<p>As technology becomes interwoven into our work, home, and personal lives, digital information is rapidly overtaking print communication as we step into a digitally connected world. To navigate this transformation, society must be able to effectively and ethically use digital tools to learn, create, and share information and find innovative ways to bridge the gap between humans and technology. “Being digitally fluent allows you to obtain content from a digital environment, understand the purpose behind that content, and identify the systems that go into creating and delivering that information,” says Josh Gaul, Associate Vice President &amp; Chief Digital Learning Office, Edge. “Digital fluency is an awareness of how everything works together. We must recognize that every piece of content in a digital environment has mechanisms, including human and automated decisions, that are involved in presenting that information. Additionally, there are also ramifications for finding, using, and sharing that content.”</p>
<p>Moving from Digital Literacy to Digital Fluency<br>
The digital fluency umbrella involves understanding all the pieces of the digital world and combines technical proficiency, digital literacy, and social competence. Digital literacy is whether you can use digital tools to read, evaluate, and apply technical skills that allow you to think digitally and create meaning. “Digital literacy is understanding that if someone handed you equipment to build a birdhouse, you would know how to use the pieces of wood, saw, and nails to create the finished product,” explains Gaul. “Digital fluency is understanding why you would want a birdhouse, what the reasons are behind building that birdhouse, and identifying the larger schematics of where you live. If I see a lot of birds in my backyard, maybe having a birdhouse will be a nice addition, so I’m going to use these tools to build the structure, find an optimal location, and then think about what type of food the birds will need. Digital literacy is understanding how to use technology to achieve an endgame and digital fluency is understanding why those tools need to be used, why the decisions are made to use those tools, and why those tools are important to the larger system of digital learning.”</p>
<p>Creating Digitally Fluent Learners<br>
The infusion of technology into our society continues at a rapid pace and is becoming increasingly critical in the realm of higher education and preparing the next generation for the workforce. “The time when a class can take place without some digital component, even at the smallest level, is now gone,” says Gaul. “The moment you introduce a digital aspect to your course, whether these tools are checking the online library, giving assignments online, or using a learning management system (LMS) to deliver documents or take tests, you’re introducing a need for digital literacy and digital fluency. As we look to achieve digital fluency, we must take note of why all classrooms need to use an LMS, Dropbox, or Google Doc to supplement instruction. Then we must gain a deeper understanding of the benefits, ease of use, and flexibility that come with an LMS or similar tool.”</p>
<p>At this stage of the digital transformation trajectory, Gaul says digital fluency is of paramount importance to a higher education institution, since all students, whether they are adult learners or high school graduates, live and interact on the Internet. “Today’s students have a digital portfolio, often falling on the spectrum of a formal portfolio to simply an online presence or profile. We must help create digitally fluent learners who understand the impact and ramifications of their digital presence. From a leadership standpoint, institutions need an infrastructure in place that allows online learning to continue, even as we emerge from the pandemic. Not only will an organization need the technical, broadband, and networking capabilities, but also the instructional designers, educational technologists, and faculty who are willing to do things a little differently online and reach students in a way that goes beyond face-to-face instruction.”</p>

		<p>Promoting Professional Development<br>
As digital fluency rises in importance, institutions must provide educators and staff with proper support and training to help them effectively meet the needs of today’s students. “Research has shown that taking an active learning approach to training and development is really beneficial, especially within our current digital landscape,” shares Gaul. “When Edge helps institutions build out training programs for both faculty and students, we like to provide smaller, digestible reusable learning objects. Instead of giving them an LMS shell with a 10-week course full of information, we break the material down into smaller segments that can be taken one at a time. While we may use an LMS to deliver content, the content is more engaging, like a video or an article, followed by a formative assessment. This approach ensures educators understand what they are learning and can demonstrate mastery of those skills. Most importantly, we provide live Q&amp;A sessions where participants can ask questions and provide feedback. We are then able to further build out sections and learning objects that help improve competency and mastery across the board.”</p>
<p>Enhancing instructional practices by integrating technology is a top priority for many institutions, especially as they look to weave digital fluency into the overall educational experience. “Whatever reusable learning objects an organization looks to incorporate, ensuring they can be integrated into the LMS is essential,” says Gaul. “This integration allows an organization to measure success, whether that involves tracking scoring or just participation. Edge creates learning objects that are flexible to serve both purposes. We’re finding that providing a variety of content and formative assessments goes a long way in helping people stay engaged, understand the information, and appreciate the importance of improving digital fluency.”</p>
<p>Pairing Digital Fluency with Innovation<br>
As online learning continues to grow and expand, Edge is dedicated to creating pathways to digital fluency and helping member institutions to boost student engagement and empower faculty and staff. “We are working with multiple institutions to help build upon their fundamentals of online learning courses,” says Gaul. “This curriculum is focused on the technical side, including topics like how to create an assignment in Blackboard to how to create a discussion forum in Canvas. Our approach focuses on the research-based information that not only builds digital literacy, but digital fluency. For example, rather than concentrating on creating a quiz in your LMS, we dive into writing high-quality quiz questions and building assessments in an online learning environment. Rather than outlining the steps to build a discussion, we examine how to frame thought-provoking questions that inspire students to create authentic discussion threads. When your organization pairs digital fluency with innovation, you ensure your students have a positive and impactful learning experience that imparts the real-world skills they will need for the future.”</p>

		<p>Cybersecurity remains an important topic in today’s digital world, where the variety and severity of cyberattacks continues to grow. Without a holistic security strategy, many organizations could face costly repercussions if an attack occurs. Like many experts in the field, Dr. Dawn Dunkerley, Edge’s Principal Virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO), says recognizing the inevitability of a cyberattack is essential. “Unfortunately, bad things are going to happen, whether the threat is ransomware or a data breach. In addition to attacks, we must also be wary of poor user behaviors. Organizations must get ahead of these threats by building a structure that allows them to respond effectively and efficiently. Planning and preparing ahead of time is vitally important and involves reviewing the incident response plan and understanding everyone’s roles and responsibilities, both inside and outside the IT department.”</p>
<p>Dr. Dunkerley has been working with Edge for two years, providing vCISO services and conducting Cybersecurity Health Checks for higher education institutions, K-12 schools and districts, healthcare organizations, municipal governments, and nonprofit organizations. “Edge’s vCISO services provide a cost-effective way to gain support and a roadmap towards cybersecurity maturity,” says Dr. Dunkerley. “One of the major challenges organizations face in the education community is retaining trained, qualified personnel. Edge can help fill that gap and augment an organization’s staff. As a vCISO, I aim to be an affordable, high-quality resource that member institutions can rely upon. I have a variety of roles, including helping with documentation, conducting webinars and lunch and learns, providing training and guidance to junior security team members, assessing vulnerability management strategies, and sharing the latest threats and emerging trends in the marketplace.”</p>
<p>Protection from Cyberattacks<br>
While the pandemic drove transformation across many fronts, including digital learning, changes to the threat landscape evolved too. The rapid shift to remote work and learning quickly revealed many organization’s weaknesses and left them vulnerable to possible threats. “We continue to see a prevalence of ransomware, with groups who are specifically targeting the education sector,” says Dr. Dunkerley. “Previously, if you got ransomware, they would hold you at ransom, but hopefully you would get your systems unlocked. Now, we’re seeing that while you’re locked up, they breach your data as well. The attacks are going to continue to grow, evolve, and change. Organizations must remain agile and employ a layered security solution to try and stay one step ahead of potential attackers.”</p>
<p>To create a proactive cybersecurity strategy, an organization must consider both the internet and the World Wide Web. “The web is the pages you interact with while online or the human interface, and the internet is the network of connected computers,” explains Dr. Dunkerley. “There is no silver bullet that is going to fix everything, meaning that one security tool that works to protect from attacks on your actual network is not the same that protects your web servers. You must employ a defense in depth approach, which is a layered defense that incorporates improving human behaviors, technology, and processes. All of these three things have to be in place to protect the web presence, as well as the underlying network and associated data resources.”</p>
<p>When considering cybersecurity, organizations must also be aware of the dark web, the hidden collective of internet sites that are only accessible by a specialized web browser. “The dark web is where many bad actors post the data they’ve breached from organizations, including usernames and passwords,” says Dr. Dunkerley. “Your dark web footprint can be indicative of problems in your system and is an important component of lowering your vulnerability. Edge can conduct dark web vulnerability scans and help implement best practices, so if passwords are ever stolen, the risk is more contained. Mitigation tactics include using different passwords across multiple websites, conducting password resets, and instituting multi-factor authentication measures.”</p>
<p>Edge begins all initial security assessments by helping an organization understand their current level of maturity and determine security readiness. “We help build a work plan that incorporates best practices and helps fill any gaps,” explains Dr. Dunkerley. “This assessment also provides a unique external look from an attacker’s perspective and identifies current risk levels. We must remember that being compliant with a framework does not mean you’re secure. Managing cybersecurity goes beyond IT; cyber risk management is an organizational-wide concern.”</p>
<p>“Cybersecurity is continuing to gain attention in leadership outside of the IT department, from university presidents to town mayors,” Dr. Dunkerley continues. “They understand that their organizations are dependent on their information systems and data, and there are ramifications if they don’t pay attention to cybersecurity. Managing cybersecurity is not just an IT risk, managing threats is a business risk, and by getting cybersecurity out of the IT shop and into the larger discussion, you can equip your people properly and promote positive behaviors across the students, faculty, and staff.”</p>

		<p>Optimizing Cybersecurity Insurance<br>
As the risk of cyberattacks continues to rise, cybersecurity insurance is designed to help reduce the financial ramifications of cyber incidents and offers organizations a way to mitigate the losses from network damage, data breaches, malware, and overall business interruption. “We’ve seen the cost of cybersecurity insurance increase exponentially, while coverage goes down” says Dr. Dunkerley. “In addition, if an institution had an incident in the past, some are now facing a reduction or elimination of coverage because their current provider labels them too large a risk. Through my experience working with schools both large and small, I’ve gained a good understanding of what factors providers are looking for when determining if an organization is worth the risk.”</p>
<p>While exploring an organization’s current security profile, providers will look at perimeter protection, which includes identifying the traffic coming and going from the network and determining if proper controls are in place, like multi-factor authentication. “When assessing security strategies, the people, process, and technology framework is applied,” explains Dr. Dunkerley. “For the people component, this includes training programs, phishing testing, and general testing to determine if the team understands their role and responsibilities. Processes include whether an organization has up-to-date incident response plans; do they know what protocol to follow and who to contact in a time of crisis? Lastly, do you have the necessary technology? Edge continues to align our market portfolio to ensure our technology solutions match provider’s requirements. While an organization can never be completely secure, Edge can help them optimize their cybersecurity insurance.”</p>
<p>Institution-Wide Responsibility of Cybersecurity<br>
As we head out of 2021 and into the future, periodically assessing network security is a crucial part of an organization’s cybersecurity plan. The Edge team’s in-depth knowledge of technology and security techniques helps to proactively identify and prevent potential risks that may adversely impact an organization. “I’ve never encountered an Edge member institution that wasn’t concerned about their data and systems, but creating an effective cybersecurity strategy can feel overwhelming,” shares Dr. Dunkerley. “Important questions to ask yourself are: do you know your current cybersecurity maturity? Are you aware of the best practices that should be incorporated, like regulatory, framework, or insurance requirements? Do you know where you need to be and how to accomplish that goal? Leaders outside of the IT space, including a president or business administrator, must also be aware of the procedures for tracking risk associated with the institution’s cybersecurity. Ensuring that an organization can operate safely and securely is an institution-wide responsibility. Edge can help create a comprehensive strategy that connects the dots between security and business, identifies the risks, and remediates new vulnerabilities as they arise. Depending on an organization’s goals and current security profile, we can recommend cost-effective solutions, provide the team with insight into improving security, and through regular monitoring and reporting, we help an institution to take proactive control of their cybersecurity needs.”</p>

		<p>In her role as head of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Research Business Development &amp; Strategy, Andreia Pierce, Ph.D., MBA, leads a team that works on various federal initiatives in collaboration with the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), other government agencies, and academic research centers. With the rapidly changing and dynamic global health situation, many trends that impact research have surfaced. “One may say the most salient change is the acceleration of digital transformation in the way we conduct research,” says Pierce. “Cloud computing and technology are at the forefront of helping to speed the development of new solutions. Some of the most common themes in research are an increased interest in computational sciences, and the need, not just the interest, for cross-disciplinary, cross-industry, cross-country collaboration. Amazon and AWS have responded by deploying resources and technology to enable remote learning and work, as well as supporting researchers who are processing data, collaborating online, and trying to maintain labs remotely. This includes labs working on vaccines and treatments, along with labs conducting non-health related research in a virtual, remote, and often socially distant reality.”</p>
<p>As a global company, Amazon continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 and find ways to support researchers and healthcare professionals. “We are committed to supporting communities during this critical time as we look at how we can do more,” says Pierce. “We launched the AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative (DDI) in 2020, committing $20 million in AWS Promotional Credit and technical support for research into diagnostic solutions. DDI is supporting dozens of projects, including one with Stanford University School of Medicine researchers who developed a smartwatch-based diagnostic system that flagged signs of a person’s immune system fighting a potential COVID-19 infection.”</p>
<p>Collaboration between Edge and AWS has also played an important role during these times of accelerated change. In New Jersey colleges and universities, this has translated to confidence that their IT systems, sophisticated applications, and analytics are going to have increased flexibility, scalability, and reliability when using the AWS Cloud, which provides another avenue for higher education to change the world. With the needs of higher education customers and researchers in mind, Edge members can have higher bandwidth and lower latency when accessing AWS resources and endpoint services. “We have been able to offer managed hardware deployed into locations outside AWS data centers, extending secure edge computing capabilities to 5G networks, on-prem locations, and metro areas,” says Pierce. “In short, the role of technology companies as I see it is to work with researchers and research institutions, including federal agencies, to make innovative technologies easier to access, bridging the technology gap across markets.”</p>
<p>Enabling Remote Work and Education<br>
Amazon and AWS have also deployed resources and technology to enable remote learning and working from home, as well as supported researchers who were processing data, collaborating online, and trying to maintain labs remotely. “Many of the accelerated cloud initiatives to support remote work, learning, and the management of labs safely happened because of the pandemic,” shares Pierce. “However, the new solutions and improvements that have been implemented will have a lasting impact on our customers’ operations; ultimately helping citizens. Prior to the pandemic, 96% of R1 Research Institutions were already using AWS, and we will continue to be customer obsessed, turning our customers’ challenges into opportunities to invent and innovate.”</p>
<p>Last year, AWS launched Service Workbench, an open-source solution for researchers to access domain-specific data and compute on secure IT environments within minutes. This solution is designed to promote repeatability, multi-site collaboration, and cost transparency in the research process. “With Service Workbench, researchers can now quickly and securely stand up the research environments for their work, shifting worry away from the technology, and allowing renewed focus on conducting experiments with peers from other institutions,” says Pierce. “By automating the creation of baseline research setups, simplifying data access, and providing price transparency, both researchers and IT can save time, allowing them to refocus on evolving cloud best practices and research reproducibility.”</p>
<p>Technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), virtual research environments, and High Performance Computing (HPC), allows researchers to achieve results in record time and with greater accuracy. “In addition to compute specific tools, others that have made a significant impact include AWS IoT and IoT 1-Click, which can be used to monitor labs, specimens, and reagents for temperature, humidity, and vibration, and to predict whether failures are imminent in labs with appropriate logging and alerts,” explains Pierce. “Other solutions like Amazon Workspace, Amazon WorkDocs, and Amazon AppStream, have also facilitated an environment for researchers to still conduct their day-to-day jobs remotely in a collaborative manner.”</p>
<p>Providing Shared Services to the Research Community<br>
Shared knowledge is important to many researchers, where data integration and sharing is happening not only within disciplines, but also across different fields of study. “Just as disciplinary clusters appear, the institutional barriers are also disappearing across the globe,” says Pierce. “Agencies like the European Parliament Research Service, reported a 189% increase in co-authored publications. The realization that we are not bound by our physical space is translating to research projects that involve multiple schools, pharmaceutical companies, the food industry, and government agencies across countries—sometimes all working on the same projects. To foster collaboration, AWS offers a number of publicly available datasets through the open data program.”</p>
<p>Cloud resource scalability has also made technology more accessible to a greater number of organizations. “HPC on AWS, for instance, helps remove long queues and wait times and helps put a supercomputer in the hands of every scientist,” explains Pierce. “Going back to our current global pandemic, a public AWS COVID-19 data lake became available in April, consisting of up-to-date curated datasets relating to the characteristics and spread of the coronavirus. The data lake tracks several areas of data, including hospital bed availability, and contains over 45,000 research articles about COVID-19.”</p>
<p>“AWS has also created the Pandemic Response Commons, which is a collaborative data ecosystem powered by research at the regional level,” Pierce continues. “These commons are developed and operated like a private-public partnership for nonprofit corporations. Since anyone in the country can submit data, a number of scientists use this data to gather insights into population scale information as related to the impact of COVID-19. With Industrial IoT applications, such as AWS IoT SiteWise Edge, the medical community is able to collect data from various disparate sources, organize the information, and contextualize the data in a secure and effective manner. In an era where collaboration across industries and geographies is key, we must be able to offer multiple solutions, including edge solutions, to the research and healthcare communities.”</p>

In addition to her role at AWS, Pierce is also a biomedical scientist and is involved with various groups, including the American Chronic Pain Association (ACPA), a non-profit with over 40,000 members worldwide. “Prior to joining Amazon, I was a researcher who worked in the pharmaceutical industry for over a decade,” shares Pierce. “I helped develop and implement global medical strategies across a number of disease states and launched many innovative therapies. Some of the therapeutic areas I worked in included movement disorders, autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis, respiratory eosinophilic disorders, and chronic pain. In fact, I worked in the pain space on a few different occasions, one time focused on migraines, and another focused on chronic pain and addiction. The challenges and stigma associated with treatment of chronic pain management affect over 50 million adults in the U.S. When one of my former colleagues, who is now the CEO of ACPA, reached out to me to ask if I would volunteer to help an organization that offers support and education to healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers who battle this often debilitating condition, I did not hesitate to join their mission.”</p>
<p>Accelerating Science and Innovation<br>
AWS provides cost-effective, scalable, and secure compute, storage, and database capabilities to accelerate time to science. Researchers can quickly analyze massive data pipelines, store petabytes of data, advance research using transformative technologies like AI, ML, and quantum. “Cloud technology is the new normal and introduces a paradigm for speed, accuracy, and collaboration, and the benefits of the cloud are no longer limited to improved business outcomes,” says Pierce. “This technology is now vital to improved scientific outcomes and life-saving, history-making innovation. For example, AWS recently started working with DNAnexus to create a cloud-based data analysis platform, the UK Biobank, which can make data more easily and more cost-effectively accessible to approved researchers around the world.”</p>
<p>Pierce continues, “In 2019, the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium used AWS ParallelCluster to access the HPC resources they needed to model air pollution faster and scale for their member states. As more researchers embrace cloud as a computing utility that fosters innovation, these examples will be the norm in scientific discovery. Overall, the magnitude at which analytics and research are being used to find solutions today in the cloud is amazing. Collecting, storing, analyzing, and sharing data has never been easier, not only because the cloud is cost effective and secure, but also the analytics services available today are changing the possibilities that are on the horizon.”</p>
<p>Advancing Research and Institutional Initiatives<br>
With a direct peering connection to AWS, the Edge network enables members to securely access innovative cloud technology and connect to AWS products and services like Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, VMware on AWS, and more. All on-net traffic for connected members is subject to a data egress waiver for outgoing data flows from the AWS Cloud, helping members save money when accessing their data. Oftentimes, organizations can transfer data to the cloud for free, but are charged egress fees by the cloud provider when the data is retrieved. Beginning in 2016, AWS waived data egress costs for qualified academic customers and researchers, including Edge members, to help provide more institutions with access to computing, cloud storage, and database services.</p>
<p>Specifically, within higher education, colleges and universities across New Jersey can use AWS to help advance their research initiatives, as well as further expand student access to education, create cloud-based storage for legacy data, modernize their disaster recovery solutions, power a wide variety of workloads, and optimize their IT operations and infrastructure. If an institution has new curriculum or lab delivery models that require virtualized desktops or applications delivered from the cloud, they can utilize the AWS solution offered through Edge. On campus and beyond, Edge member institutions can take advantage of a full portfolio of AWS services and utilize technology and advanced computing to fuel their research and institutional initiatives.</p>
<p>A superior solution for superior value, AWS technology can open doors to new opportunities and help organizations begin leveraging the cloud quickly and efficiently—helping to ignite innovation and digital transformation.

		<p>In 2003, Stefan Robila, Ph.D. joined Montclair State University (MSU) as a professor of computer science and is currently the Computer Science Director of the Computational Sensing Laboratory. With a diverse background in the topic, Robila completed his M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science at Syracuse University and his B.S. at the University of Iasi in Romania. He was also a visiting scholar at Cambridge University, University of Oxford (UK), University of Geneva (Switzerland), and Uppsala University (Sweden). Robila’s main research interests lie in computational sensing, and he has worked extensively with the collection and analysis of hyperspectral data. “My career began during my graduate studies, and I believe that for a researcher, and especially for faculty, graduate studies are a strong indicator of the direction your professional life will be headed,” says Robila.</p>
<p>“The focus of my research during graduate school explored a relatively new type of data called hyperspectral images,” continues Robila. “Rather than collecting a single grayscale image or a color image as you do with most cameras, a hyperspectral camera collects hundreds of grayscale images, and each of these images corresponds to a very narrow interval of the electromagnetic spectrum. This results in a refinement of the image that is not found in normal cameras. The hyperspectral data we collect can be used to differentiate among materials, plants, and minerals. We can detect whether vegetation is real or artificial or use this data in agriculture to reveal the health and potential success of crops. Professionals also use this type of imagery on production lines to investigate the quality of food products, including if they are corrupted by pathogens.” Robila’s work has now expanded to include more general research and applications for large data sets.</p>
<p>Expanding Research Focus<br>
As Robila started to expand his research focus beyond image processing to include high-performance computing (HPC), especially data processing and visualization, the transition allowed him to further diversify his research to include general parallel and specificity computing for big data processing and visualization. “For the last decade, I’ve also looked at ways in which we can use data centers that maximize energy efficiency. New Jersey has been very open-minded and supportive of these initiatives. I’ve had excellent collaborators from my own department and the Environmental Science programs at Montclair State, as well as support from public companies and regional and national foundations—which has all helped me to broaden my research. In addition, as a computer scientist who works at a public research extensive institution with graduate and undergraduate students, I also sought to investigate&nbsp; research directions of significant community relevance, such as social aspects of computing security or artificial intelligence and machine learning tools for social science research and practice.”</p>
<p>With teaching experience that spans the computer science and IT undergraduate and graduate curriculum, Robila shares his diverse knowledge and passion with students looking to explore the world of computing. “I truly enjoy working with undergraduate and graduate students because they bring such enthusiasm and desire to learn and they’re looking for guidance as they build their own professional paths,” says Robila. “Montclair State has many first-generation students and people coming from all regions of the state and other parts of the world. During my time here, I’ve not only seen the transformation of my organization, but of the student body. Along with the growing student population, I’ve seen the group evolve and mirror the transformation of our state. They come to school with a tremendous interest in technology, especially computer sciences, and are looking to help find solutions to societal problems. Personally, I was extremely fortunate to have graduate advisors and faculty members who served as valuable mentors and role models during my graduate studies and helped make the transition to becoming a researcher much easier. I hope to provide that same guidance and support to my students as they prepare for the next chapter of their lives.”</p>
<p>Understanding Funding Opportunities<br>
Between 2018 and 2021, Robila served as Program Director in the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and developed a portfolio of awards that enable cyberinfrastructure research, development, and acquisition. “Spending time with the NSF gives you a tremendous in-depth understanding of how the funding environment functions within the Foundation,” shares Robila. “Some funding opportunities are tied to specific events. For example, a significant funding effort has occurred in the last couple of years due to the pandemic, where the NSF has run a very extensive program to support RAPID grants. These projects must have an outcome within twelve months and the grants target ways to combat the pandemic, whether the research involved molecular modeling of the virus, supporting research on the mental health wellbeing of society, or funding educational programs that enabled universities to function and support students and staff amid the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Along with an insider’s look at national funding programs, Robila says he also gained insight into the future priority of funding. “Sometimes the seed of funding is planted years before the funding is announced. Understanding how the federal government works and how federal agencies work together to come up with priorities for future efforts, helps us predict the direction research is headed. With this insight, I start thinking strategically about how Montclair State could be positioned to further support our researchers as they pursue cutting-edge research. Most importantly, we also want to create a strong pipeline where early career colleagues have access to funding and training opportunities that can help them build successful research endeavors.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Having an expert resource to consult, like Edge, will be very helpful for an organization to better understand the Cloud, when cloud computing is well suited and when it is not, and how to navigate the campus environment without penalties from the sponsor.”</p>

		<p>he Future of Computing<br>
In discussing cloud resources, Robila says that any future research cyberinfrastructure will be a hybrid environment, with cloud computing as a significant component. “The Cloud offers important advantages, including providing organizations with the opportunity to procure cloud computer resources in an expedited manner. However, estimating the true cost of compute for a specific project can be challenging, especially when the cloud cost is provided in compute cycles or in data transfer. Plus, educating researchers on the use of the Cloud, including understanding the diversity of the cloud environment and the benefits and challenges, is not always financially feasible for an institution. Having an expert resource to consult, like Edge, will be very helpful for an organization to better understand the Cloud, when cloud computing is well suited and when it is not, and how to navigate the campus environment without penalties from the sponsor.”</p>
<p>Robila continues, “Projects across nearly every discipline require access to research cyberinfrastructure, but this investment is very expensive and can be difficult for many organizations to find significant funding sources to support larger cyberinfrastructure. Expansion is feasible, but institutions should not be expected to provide all resources on their own. In fact, the way cyberinfrastructure is sought today allows an institution to provide some local resources, maybe through some smaller size computing systems or smaller human resources support, but when a researcher requires expanded access to cyberinfrastructure resources, multiple organizations can pull their resources together. Upon joining the team at Montclair State, I recognized the essential role Edge played in coordinating common resources and providing our institution with high quality access to the larger research community. I’m extremely happy to see that Edge has expanded beyond our region and is crossing state lines to build an even greater network. I see Edge continuing to push forward and build a community that is not bound by state borders, but creates an extraordinary opportunity for community colleges and state colleges and universities to work together across the country.”</p>
<p>Building Collaboration Mechanisms<br>
Upon adding the information technology major to the computing program at Montclair State sixteen years ago, the number of students majoring in computing doubled. “Adding this new major was an extraordinary event and allowed us to spend significant time defining what our team is compared to computer scientists,” shares Robila. “With the rise of big data, we have been given this opportunity again, where we’re looking to define a cyberinfrastructure (CI) professional. This exercise involves looking at how skills from computing can combine with skills from other disciplines. The future CI professional should be well trained and educated in specific aspects of sciences, as well as being well versed in the computing field.&nbsp; Many programs within our organization can set up a good base for identifying these specific skills and helping other organizations to create successful CI programs at their own institutions.”</p>
<p>Many academic institutions share a common mission and Robila says members of the education community have a very natural way of building collaboration mechanisms among themselves. “Being in the educational world, our common goal is to help our students succeed. We often see community colleges collaborating with larger institutions to develop educational programs and facilitate the transfer of students. I don’t see why this strategy cannot be expanded to research. We often hear discussions in this country about the lack of trained professionals in specific fields, and computing is one of the largest areas lacking well-trained professionals. Community colleges have an impressive pool of talented and well-trained professionals—both in faculty members and students—and we must build upon the strength of the community college and undergraduate institution. By helping to connect these smaller schools with R1 institutions, we provide opportunities for more computing students to participate in innovative research. Edge plays an important role in facilitating these collaborations and helping show the common thread throughout our institutions: driving research and discovery and creating a strong and successful workforce for generations to come.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>By highlighting technology-based research and discovery achievements and ongoing projects throughout the region, EdgeDiscovery aims to facilitate multi-campus collaborations and partnerships—and their transformative impact—on the research communities in both small and large institutions across New Jersey and the region.

<p>The eKYC and Identity Assurance (eKYC &amp; IDA) working group is developing extensions to OpenID Connect that standardize the communication of assured identity information, i.e., verified claims along with trust framework and assurance level as well as information about how and when the verification was done. The core of that work has become OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance (OIDC4IDA).</p>
<p>With its first interoperability event, the working group has taken an important step on the journey towards a final specification. Interoperability of implementations is paramount and with the support of the GAIN proof-of-concept participants, where this specification is an important technical building block, several organizations have been able to test their implementations.</p>
<p>At the core of the event was the beta eKYC &amp; IDA conformance test plan developed by the OpenID Foundation. The test plan will ensure that implementations of the OIDC4IDA specification adhere to the rules described in the current implementers draft, and thereby assure technical interoperability across identity providers and relying parties.</p>
<p>In the last week of November, four early implementers of the OIDC4IDA specification (<a href="http://bankid.com">BankID Sweden</a>, <a href="https://github.com/identityfirst/eKYC-Hub">eKYC Hub Open Source Framework</a>, <a href="https://www.dizme.io/">DIZME</a>, and <a href="https://yes.com">yes.com</a>), all in the role of identity providers, came together to run the tests and to present their results in a special session of the OAuth Security Workshop 2021. All four Identity Providers ran the tests successfully, detecting only minor deviations from the standard.</p>
<p>These existing implementations will be also available in the sandbox being set up by the upcoming GAIN proof-of-concept community group for interested RPs to test with.</p>
<p>The eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance working group plans to organize another interoperability testing event, together with relying parties, in the near future.</p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2021/12/16/ekyc-identity-assurance-interop-event-update/">eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Interop Event Update</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a>.

		<p>Over a year ago, the technology provider CBTS partnered with Edge to help improve communication and collaboration efficiency at Edge member institutions. Through their Hosted Enterprise Unified Communications as a Service solution (UCaaS), organizations gained access to on-demand communications and applications that delivered scalable collaboration services faster, helping to improve business agility and better meet an organization’s needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our relationship with Edge has grown into a true partnership, where we are both working to solve members’ issues around technology and telephony challenges,” shares Linda Mazzo, Executive Account Manager, CBTS. “We’ve worked closely with the Edge team to offer members a variety of options that bring positive outcomes. In addition, we’ve built out a connection to the EdgeNet network to provide our services on the existing network-to-network interface (NNI) that Edge currently offers its members. With this approach CBTS has engaged with many long standing members of the Edge community, including Passaic County Community College, Stockton University, and Middlesex College and brought on new members such as Jackson Township.”</p>
<p>Best-in-Class Solutions<br>
As one of the top twenty communications providers in the country, CBTS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Bell and has over 1,500 technologists dedicated to advancing IT and helping customers reduce risk and solve their business challenges. “Our technologists and engineers bring a breadth and depth of experience to thousands of customers and share best-in-class solutions in each of our practice areas, including cloud, communications, telephony, networking, security, and consulting services,” shares Mazzo. “We start with a consultative approach to understand what our customers currently have and identify their end goal or the challenge they’re trying to overcome. We then dig in deeper with assessments and analysis, where our architects and engineers develop a solution that fits the member’s needs, business objectives, and goals. These objectives might include simplifying management of telephony, enhancing communication within an institution for end users on premise or remote, the ability to utilize cell phones, or providing services, such as E911 and mass notification, all from one cohesive system. We then design a solution to fit their needs, including end-to-end implementation and ongoing support through our cloud offering.”</p>
<p>Mazzo continues, “When many organizations purchase a phone system, they often choose a solution that meets their needs today, not thinking about 10 plus years down the road. You can quickly encounter obsolescence in features and functionality if you do not budget for annual, or at least biannual, updates for a phone system. For redundancy purposes, CBTS will stand up four phone systems inside our two data centers that are strictly your phone systems and yours alone. CBTS is responsible for constantly being on top of those released updates that come out year after year of new feature functionality.”</p>
<p>CBTS also pairs every customer with a service delivery manager who conducts monthly or quarterly meetings to review the new dot releases, firmware updates, feature functionality, and determine what an organization wants to deploy inside their environment. “Along with being responsible for the lifecycle management of the phone system, we also offer the routine moves, adds, and changes,” explains Mazzo. “Through a ticketing portal, you can submit tickets to request items like a voicemail password reset or a more complex task, like adding new staff. CBTS acts as an extension of your IT staff and looks to take some tasks and responsibilities off of your plate so you can focus on other initiatives and goals.”</p>

		<p>Guaranteed Quality and Cost Savings Through the Edge and CBTS partnership, Edge-connected members can further leverage their investment through a dual, diverse, direct NNI between the EdgeNet network and the CBTS hosted platform. “Edge members receive large dedicated fiber pipes from Edge that can deliver internet services, as well as allowing them to take advantage of dedicated circuits to leverage as a service solutions,” explains Gene Ratto, Director Sales, CBTS. “Since these are dedicated circuits that your organization is running voice traffic across,” Mazzo adds, “There is a guaranteed quality of service that Edge members will receive similar to paying for local lines through a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) provider. This NNI is not an over-the-internet solution where you could experience intermittent issues; you receive a guaranteed quality of service.”</p>
<p>“We’ve worked with Edge to connect NNIs located in Newark and Philadelphia,” says Ratto. “For an Edge member that wants to connect to the CBTS UCaaS solution, you can ride across the Edge fiber, specifically a virtual local area network (VLAN) circuit that goes from your environment, across the Edge self-healing fiber network, and dynamically routes to either the Newark or the Philadelphia NNIs. This ensures resiliency and redundancy inside your network, so that no matter where a link is lost on the NNI side or even in the EdgeNet network, you can still be dynamically routed to the CBTS UCaaS interface. Our CBTS data centers are located in Cincinnati, Ohio and Ashburn, Virginia.&nbsp; When riding across that Edge self-healing network going to one of our two NNIs, the traffic can be routed up to four different circuits to get to our two data centers. With an enterprise architecture that has been designed by CBTS and Edge Engineering Resources, Edge members can count on maximum uptime.”</p>
<p>Kirk Rooney, Senior Solutions Design Engineer at CBTS, says that by leveraging the existing Edge connection, members can get this connectivity to the CBTS data centers free of charge. “If an institution chooses another UCaaS provider, there will often be additional costs above and beyond the cost of the UCaaS solution. Especially if an organization wants several circuits to multiple data centers like we provide, this can often range in the thousands of dollars per month. As an Edge member, you can count on substantial savings and tap into this connectivity to the CBTS data centers at no cost to you.”</p>

		<p>“By joining Edge and using the consortium contract, Jackson Schools was able to leverage the RFP that Edge issued for telephony and take full advantage of the pricing and services offered by CBTS. We’ve been very pleased with the CBTS program management, technical expertise and knowledge of the telephony engineers, and the responsiveness of the CBTS teams. Our CBTS project manager was extremely organized, kept the project implementation and cadence on track, and made sure we met our tight timeframes and deadlines.

		<p>Protection from Outages<br>
An important benefit of the CBTS UCaaS solution is providing business continuity in the event of a power outage. Whether a storm hits, there are component failures, or other risks arise, an outage can be detrimental to an organization. “One thing that we’ve learned over the last year is how vital it is to be flexible and have the ability to continue with business no matter where you are or what happens,” says Rooney. “If you have a solution that solely runs and depends on equipment or hardware located onsite, servicing that hardware is very challenging if you cannot go to the facility. Or if you have a single device that breaks onsite, the turnaround time to replace that hardware can be lengthy. Additionally, parts can be difficult to find for older phone systems. This is why a resilient and redundant phone system located in the Cloud is a valuable solution and can allow an environment to be up and running at all times.”</p>
<p>With a cloud environment, the phone system is never interrupted, even if power is lost or phone lines go down that service inbound and outbound calls. “In today’s environment, CBTS works with customers to build a disaster recovery plan to ensure everyone stays connected and an organization can continue operations,” says Rooney. “By moving the voice system to the Cloud, you will never experience an outage. In fact, we’ve never experienced one minute of outage for the CBTS core for any of our customers. Plus, the UCaaS solution also allows organizations to avoid being dependent on other technologies. For example, with an on premise phone system and someone using a softphone, they have to use a virtual private network (VPN) to be able to access that phone system. Issues may arise, whether the firewall doesn’t allow that many users or they don’t have the appropriate licensing on the firewall. When you take the phone system and move it to the Cloud, you’re not dependent on other departments and their technologies in order to make your technology work.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“When riding across that Edge self-healing network going to one of our two NNIs, the traffic can be routed up to four different circuits to get to our two data centers. With an enterprise architecture that has been designed by CBTS and Edge Engineering Resources, Edge members can count on maximum uptime.”</p>

		<p>Expanding the Network<br>
Many states do not have individual State Contracts to purchase UCaaS for their participating cities, towns, universities, and state agencies. To expand the reach of these valuable solutions, CBTS has twelve dedicated public sector account managers working in over twenty states and is developing new relationships with Edge’s Research and Education Network (REN) peers. To help more organizations take advantage of current technologies like UCaaS, Edge provides access to the CBTS UCaaS solution through EdgeMarket. “We see a bright future across the country to connect with your peers,” says Mazzo. “CBTS is currently working on several partnership proposals with other networks that offer services and benefits similar to our three active RENs, OARnet, Edge, and OCEAN. We are also looking to foster more collaboration opportunities between the RENs. With each of these partnerships, we will need state contract vehicles, so EdgeMarket will be essential in providing a convenient and affordable means for organizations to procure services and enter new realms of possibility.”</p>

<p>By Nicole Allred, Strategic Communications, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Illustrations by <a href="http://www.julieteninbaum.com/">www.julieteninbaum.com</a><p>What role does the economy play in the fight for racial justice and the defense of our democracy? Can we have a strong democracy without both racial and economic justice, or are they separate and distinct?</p><p>From the socially constructed idea of race to sociopolitical systems, our nation’s institutions have long excluded people from the promise of equal opportunity based on the color of their skin or economic standing. Today, thanks to the racial reckoning that continues to simmer beneath the surface, conversations acknowledging the presence and impact of systemic racism are finally near the forefront of American society. Acknowledging it is one thing. Overcoming it is another mission completely.</p><p>This is the work that Kyle Strickland is taking on as a deputy director of race and democracy at the Roosevelt Institute. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Kyle is working to unveil the systems behind disparities in our society often incorrectly blamed on individual failings.</p><p>As we continue our <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">blog series focused on racial justice</a>, we’re speaking with leaders in the field to highlight their perspectives and life journeys that led to their work. Through Kyle’s story, we discuss the myth of individualism, the power of narrative in defining community and culture, and how inequitable systems are threatening American democracy.</p><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-team/nicole-allred/">Nicole Allred</a> conducted this interview with assistance from <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar_team/hannah-brown/">Hannah Brown</a>. A transcript of our conversation is below, edited for length and&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>Listen to the audio version&nbsp;here:</p><p>Nicole Allred: I want to talk about the formative experiences in your life that led you to where you are today. Paint me a picture of what it was like growing up in Columbus and&nbsp;Ohio.</p><p>Kyle Strickland: I grew up in a predominately white suburb of Columbus — Worthington, Ohio — where I didn’t really feel like I fit in. Despite my family’s long historical roots in the area, I didn’t have a sense of belonging. When I learned more about my own family’s experience — my parents’ and grandparents’ experiences — then I understood how they were shaped by issues and events in our community.</p><p>NA: Is there a story or an experience from your early childhood that helped make you aware of your perceived place in the&nbsp;world?</p><p>KS: Often in school, I got in trouble because I was raising my hand or being disruptive in class. I thought that I was being treated differently, but no one listened to me. Now I look back on it, and it was so very clear that I was perceived as being disruptive because of my background.</p><p>The most significant event was when a student in sixth grade called me the N-word. We were playing basketball, and he got mad about something. That was one of the most visceral reactions and moments that I’ve had in my life. It was a deeply painful experience to me, and I will never forget it. Everybody who went to elementary school with me remembers that, including the kid who said&nbsp;it.</p><p>NA: You talk about the connection between race and democracy in the economy. That’s not very apparent to a lot of people. I’d love to hear more about how you went from these childhood experiences to forming those connections.</p><p>KS: I started to make these formations using my experiences growing up, and then later at Ohio State, which was more diverse than any school I previously attended. Ohio State is right in the heart of the city of Columbus, but five miles down the road is a completely different picture of that city. It’s predominately Black and communities of color. Many kids on the South or East sides of Columbus may never even step foot on campus. It was here where I started to make the connections between concentrated residential segregation, concentrated poverty, and how people blame individuals for their circumstances rather than systems and barriers.</p><blockquote>Based on my own experiences, and those around me, I was always aware that so many outcomes in life depend on the opportunities that you may or may not&nbsp;get.</blockquote><p>It’s not about some sort of individual or cultural flaw. That has always been deep at the heart of my work. Doing this work, we must be able to empathize with others and that sense of belonging.</p><p>NA: Talk to me about your grandfather and his journey obtaining a loan to have property. There’s disparity financially between different groups of people — race comes into it. How does he fit into these different issues that you’re starting to put names to and understand?</p><p>KS: My grandfather’s story is so illustrative of how all of this plays into where we are today. My grandfather graduated from high school, didn’t go to college, but he started his own business doing construction and later building homes. When he wanted to build his own home, he couldn’t get a loan. And it was very clear he was turned down, not because he didn’t have the right credit, but because of the color of his&nbsp;skin.</p><p>Eventually, my grandfather received financial support from the community and he paid them back. That history of my grandfather building a home — not only his actual craftsmanship, but also his experience of being discriminated against and unable to obtain a loan — helped me understand why so many others were unable to get a loan. Instead of being able to buy a home and build wealth, many Black families had to rent, preventing them from building wealth over time to pass&nbsp;down.</p>Illustrations by <a href="http://www.julieteninbaum.com/">www.julieteninbaum.com</a><p>With redlining, I can look at my city and see how it’s divided between the East and West sides of the city so clearly. It’s not because people just chose to live somewhere, these were intentional policies that served as barriers to building wealth. So, you start to see these connections and realize this is part of a bigger picture and a bigger pattern. Disparities are not the result of individual failings. They are the result of intentional policies.</p><p>NA: I know you are aware of the systemic impact of one’s zip code and education on life outcomes. What would you say to a way of thinking that says, “If some people can make it today in today’s system, that this isn’t systemic”?</p><blockquote>KS: The narratives we’ve been told about America are powerful. They’re deeply problematic narratives, but powerful nonetheless. This is why it’s so critical to do narrative work.</blockquote><p>Bryan Stevenson says it best when he talks about how the North won the Civil War, but the South won the narrative war because so much of what we see today continues the rhetoric of the lost cause — the white supremacy rhetoric at the root of all these stories about reckoning with our country’s history. Sadly, even some people of color have internalized that narrative. That, too, is powerful, because what happens then is people perpetuating that narrative say, “Well, look, people of color also believe in it, so this must mean it’s not racist or problematic,” and that couldn’t be further from the&nbsp;truth.</p><p>When discussing the narratives defining issues of race and equity, if we were solely guided by public opinion, especially white public opinion, we would not be where we are today. We have to make space for prevailing counter opinions.</p>Illustrations by <a href="http://www.julieteninbaum.com/">www.julieteninbaum.com</a><p>NA: That brings us beautifully into your current work at the Roosevelt Institute and the Race Landscape Project. Can you tell me what went into the formation of this project and how it came to be? And then if you can, share with us a little bit about what you’re finding so&nbsp;far.</p><p>KS: With the Race Landscape Project, we are making the connections between race, the economy and our democracy, which tend to be siloed. When people think about racial justice, they might think about a small segment of issue areas like voting rights or criminal justice, but they don’t really think about racial justice as connected to the economy — specifically how the economy has been structured in exclusionary ways as part of racist&nbsp;systems.</p><blockquote>We must reckon with our history, not just acknowledge it, through actual material&nbsp;redress.</blockquote><p>Ultimately, it’s going to come down to narrative change, policy change and the ways in which we, our courts and our institutions, make change happen. These are all parts of the connections made in our recent report. We’re excited about what’s to&nbsp;come.</p><p>NA: I have to ask, how has this pandemic — and the issue of The Great Resignation — played a role in all of this? How do you see the current moment in the pandemic and this labor movement impacting your work, and again, deepening that connection between race, the economy and democracy?</p><p>KS: It’s hard to believe that we’re now close to two years into the pandemic, and it has created a fundamental reckoning with where we and what we value as a society. What we’re starting to see are questions around deservingness.</p><p>We’re starting to realize how vulnerable we are as a society. But like anything when it comes to health and economic disparities, we also know that these disproportionately burden Black and Latinx individuals, indigenous communities and communities that continue to be marginalized by the policies in our society. So, when a crisis hits, our communities continue to be hardest hit and left&nbsp;behind.</p><blockquote>I hope we don’t fall into this idea that we can just go back to normal, because normal was not normal for a lot of people. We normalized inequality. We normalized injustice. We don’t have to do that&nbsp;anymore.</blockquote><p>We also cannot lose sight of the nearly 800,000 Americans and the millions around the world who have lost their lives because of this virus and the toll that it’s taken on families and communities. We can’t lose sight of that either, as we build moving&nbsp;forward.</p><p>NA: In our final minute, and because I like to leave things on a high note, I know obviously you’re working on intense, heavy topics. What brings you joy? What gives you hope as you do this&nbsp;work?</p><p>KS: I would say my three nieces who are 5, 3 and six months. When you get caught up in the work, it can be a lot. But to be able to spend time with them and to see them grow up, the light that they have in their eyes and the joy in their laughs brings me so much hope. Family means everything and is a source of strength to me. I hope that people have that same sense of hope, love, value and belonging as we try to create a better&nbsp;world.</p><p>Roosevelt Institute and its Race Landscape Project is an Omidyar Network grantee.

<p>Real cash flows generating staking&nbsp;rewards</p><p>Zug, Switzerland — 15 December 2021 — <br>Energy Web Token (EWT) staking will be launched very soon. This will be the first step of the Energy Web Community to move the decentralized Service Level Assurance (dSLA) platform from the research phase into the production phase. A very important step for democratized energy markets to function. In these markets, the grid operators will be procuring energy services (supply, demand, store) from the new prosumers. Those who have invested in green energy assets like electrical vehicles, rooftop solar, home batteries etc.</p><p>Staking will be a crucial component of this new energy grid to operate. The decentralized operators of the grid need to guarantee the availability of their service. Like the markets operate today. This decentralized Service Level Agreement will provide a decentralized curation and trust mechanism on the platform. To our knowledge, EWT staking will be the first utility token staking linked to real-world cash&nbsp;flows.</p><p>What you will experience when you stake your EWT is that you need to create a DID that is authorized to stake. We are testing this functionality for a couple of&nbsp;reasons:</p>  Real energy markets will operate with real energy assets. They need to know where people live, and obviously, an asset cannot be committed to several markets at the same moment in time. For testing this concept, we have included a ‘proof of being a real person’, where your wallet address gets confirmed through email. Your email address will always remain private and will NOT be publicly disclosed or linked to your wallet address. Once confirmed, the smart contract will allow your wallet address to become a DID that is authorized to stake (all GDPR-compliant by&nbsp;design).  In future applications that will manage the grid using your assets, you can imagine that certain areas in your region are in need of a specific amount of power. By staking EWT you commit to delivering the load (or battery for storage) or supply of electricity. Once the right amount is committed for that area, no further / new capacity is needed. If you do not deliver your commitment, you might lose your stake. If you do deliver, you earn extra EWT. But for the stability and management of the grid, these mechanisms are important.  Indeed, Know Your Customer will gradually evolve to Know Your&nbsp;Device.  <blockquote>An industry first, staking for identified devices (people) only, the tech behind the&nbsp;scene</blockquote><blockquote>When you put in your email address to identify yourself, a new request will be sent to the decentralized identity-cache. Next, the “KYC issuer server” will receive this message and send you the email to verify yourself. Once you click on the link, this request will be flagged as verified and the newly issued Verifiable Credential (VC) is sent to the requestor, Again via the identity-cache. For those who do not know: a VC is a form of machine-readable credential that is cryptographically secure and privacy-respecting. A VC is bound to a DID in a DID Document and thus linked to an identity. When you go back to the staking page, you can actually see that the request has been approved (by clicking in the email). Then you will add this VC to the on-chain smart contract to prove that it has a “KYC” role issued by a verified issuer (yourself in this case, but that can be anyone in the future depending on the governance). Only when you have this role issued will the contract allow you to stake. This is the first ever implementation of on-chain staking with DID+VC+SmartContract authorisation+Off-chain verification. We will be testing this when we launch and foresee the following phasing for testing the total&nbsp;concept.</blockquote><p>Phase 1, testing the staking system from start to&nbsp;finish</p><p>In the first phase, staking rewards will be fixed and dependent only on the amount of EWT deposited into the staking contract. Energy Web Community Fund will pay compounding rewards every hour. This corresponds to 21.79% annually. This first stage is necessary to test in the real world 2 essential components of&nbsp;dSLA:</p>  The staking mechanism itself, including the user interface, email verification and the staking smart contracts  Decentralized, role-based authorization system, which allows the staking contracts to interact with staking patrons. This will later enable clients to identify the service providers and grid-connected devices. This implementation of decentralized identifiers (DID) and decentralized authorization is the only way of bringing together all the parties on the platform that doesn’t require any integration  <p>Phase 2, testing the system with multiple service providers</p><p>We are planning on launching the first service nodes operated by 3rd party service providers. As per the dSLA architecture, each service provider will be able to launch their own staking pool and invite patrons to stake EWT there. The rewards distributed to the staking pools will be performance-driven, but the service providers will have flexibility when deciding how to reward the patrons. There will be no slashing of the staking pools, but the poorly performing service providers will not receive any&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This mechanism is designed to promote high-performance services, as patrons will move their stakes to providers with the best service performance. A higher amount of EWT stakes will attract higher staking rewards and more clients subscribing to services. This mechanism driven by token economics will provide a decentralized curation mechanism on the platform.</p><p>The crucial component of the dSLA platform is the Watchtower infrastructure. Watchtowers issue service performance reports about every service provided in the Utility Layer. As mentioned above, providers’ payment and staking rewards are dependent on the quality of the services they provide, and the performance reports document and determine the quality of their services, so Watchtowers determine the payments and staking&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>We will conduct early live tests of the Watchtower infrastructure in phase 1 in order to have it operational in phase 2, to support the service level assurance of the node providers.</p><p>Once this is done, our main focus will be on increasing the number of Utility Layer service nodes and onboarding clients and service providers. Depending on the adoption rate, our ecosystem can be fully decentralized and market-driven in 2023. EWT staking rewards will then be generated by real-world cash flows and distributed on a performance basis to the best-performing service providers and patrons who stake in their staking&nbsp;pools.</p><p>At that point, dSLA will be able to support the global clean energy transformation and provide enterprises and software companies with secure, convenient solutions able to serve hundreds of millions DIDs across all the flexible and renewable energy devices.

<p>The Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation announced a <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Meaningful-Gift-Alliance-Governance-Framework.pdf">critical governing framework (PDF)</a> to assist Santa in making his toughest choices during Christmas Eve.</p>



<p>For generations, Santa used many information sources, potentially unreliable, to choose gifts.&nbsp;However, with the advent of verifiable credential standards, systems, and governance, a more trustworthy ecosystem is being built which will issue NAUGHTY and NICE verifiable credentials based upon trustworthy evidence and accountability standards for all participants.</p>



  



<p>ToIP, working closely with the Santa-led Meaningful Gift Alliance (MEGA), applied its ground-breaking Metamodel Specification to define the ecosystem whereby trustworthy NAUGHTY and NICE credentials will be made available to Santa on Christmas Eve. This effort is expected to save Santa and his elves around 3.14159 million elf-hours per Christmas event which translates into a minimum of 742,000 additional toy deliveries for the 2.2 billion children of the world. #logistics #supplychain</p>



<p>Santa is thrilled. “Those NAUGHTY and NICE lists are just too difficult to scroll through when I’m out all-night delivering presents. I get acid reflux worrying that I’ll get my lists mixed up! This new ecosystem delivers all the information I need right to my satellite smartphone with the confidence I need to sail through the night!” #UXdesign</p>



  



<p>The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Meaningful-Gift-Alliance-Governance-Framework.pdf">Governance Framework (PDF)</a> sets nuanced and contextual rules for the privacy protection of BAD and GOOD life events for children, used as input to the quantum-computer generated algorithm that issues NAUGHTY and NICE credentials. It also allows for parents, guardians, and child-advocates to petition on a child’s behalf.&nbsp; The <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/mega/glossary">Glossary of Terms</a> for uses for the MEGA <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Meaningful-Gift-Alliance-Governance-Framework.pdf">Governance Framework (PDF)</a> is supported by a Trust Over IP terms community using the Trust Over IP terms wiki tool.</p>



<p>“While we want to save Santa some stress, the main focus is ensuring every child gets a meaningful gift each gift-giving season.” says Nichola Hickman, Secretariat for the Meaningful Gift Alliance. “We consulted with many meaningful gift-givers, including representatives for Wookie Life Day, Mother Earth, the IFFF (International Federation of Fairy Godmothers &amp; Tooth Fairies) and the Free Magi-Sons. They all had experienced fraud from grown-ups claiming to be children, so we are delighted with this new method of ensuring that every child gets exactly what they deserve.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bids will be announced shortly for vendors for MEGA’s technical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MEGA also joined the Good Elf Pass Initiative whose “interoperability blueprint” supports its crucial role as issuers of these credentials. The ground-breaking “Hypersleigh” blockchain standard will also support rapid delivery and high security for all Meaningful Gifts. #hypersleigh</p>

		<p>Every day, institutions of higher education collect massive amounts of data, from tracking new admissions to purchases made at the cafeteria. Using this data effectively—and turning this information into insight—can help an organization maximize their resources, evaluate their programs, boost recruitment and retention, and ultimately better serve their students and faculty. Most institutions are familiar with institutional research (IR) and assessment and often have a department dedicated to providing data, reports, and research that support institutional planning and promote a better understanding of the quality of education provided at their school. While IR collects, maintains, and shares data to support strategic planning, institutional effectiveness (IE) further builds upon that foundation to give a 360-degree view of an institution where educational leaders can make informed decisions about where to effectively invest time, money, and resources.</p>
<p>Following IE practices allow higher education institutions to leverage data to perform ongoing self-evaluation, use those findings to measure outcomes, and plan for strategies designed to meet their mission and comply with accreditation standards and expectations. By connecting strategic planning with resource allocation, institutions can be better aligned to continuously improve student learning, academic programs, and educational and administrative support services. Most importantly, incorporating IE practices allow institutional leaders to identify data patterns and use those projections to not only make well-informed decisions, but propel the transition from predictive to prescriptive analytics. Predictive analytics helps identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data, while prescriptive analytics examines data to give recommendations for the most optimal actions that can help achieve business objectives. Managing and treating data as a strategic institutional asset allows an organization to transform information into a valuable well of knowledge.</p>
<p>Transforming Data into Knowledge<br>
With data coming in rapidly from all over an organization, harnessing those data points into a central location is key to unlocking the trends, anomalies, patterns, and behaviors that can reveal overlooked opportunities and solutions to an organization’s complex problems. The first step in crafting an IE function is assessing the current state of data governance and clearly outlining data field and fact value definitions at an institution. Oftentimes, departments have different definitions of terminology like full-time student, at risk student, a credit hour, or various other data points. Taking stock of critical data flows helps create a strategy that will accelerate the use of data across the institution.</p>
<p>To further engage this value proposition of utilizing data information, an organization must build a data repository or a “single source of truth”, which is easy to access and use. This data warehouse serves as the foundation for the business intelligence platform and allows an institution to set up automated reports throughout the student lifecycle and enable cross-functional teams to use data to create strategies for student success. With a shared understanding of data governance, the variety of data coming from different tools, platforms, and offices across campus can be unified into one location for analysis.</p>
<p>With a kaleidoscopic view of data, institutions can extract insightful information that provides a deeper understanding of each facet of the organization and can help pinpoint strengths, pain points, and areas that need improvement. By embedding IE into core operations, an organization can then use the information garnered from incoming data to trigger defined, impactful actions that are designed to improve student outcomes, enrollment, retention, and graduation rates. Employing IE best practices lets an institution take a proactive approach to how data is examined and explored and highlights effective actions and intervention strategies that help foster a culture of continuous improvement across the organization.</p>

		<p>Developing a Data-Informed Strategy for Success<br>
The Edge Virtual Institutional Effectiveness (vIE) program provides access to professionals with experience and expertise building IE practices and who can help turn an institution’s data into clear, actionable insights. Through this virtual vIE program, organizations can get more out of their existing investments and data assets and find new ways to leverage data to inform the decision making process. The vIE service works with all data platforms and consists of four components that are designed to develop a data-informed strategy for the entire student lifecycle—from admissions through graduation. Edge will assist institutions to build a unified data repository for reliable access and reporting, create self-service reporting where functional teams can access real-time data, and help identify data-informed actions that can positively move the needle for promoting student success.</p>
<p>IE planning is becoming increasingly important in the competitive world of higher education. Institutions must continue to look for ways to meet students’ needs and expectations, offer high-quality programs, recruit talented faculty and staff, and create future-ready graduates who will enter the workforce with the necessary skill set. IE practices help introduce data centricity and empower education leaders to refine an institution’s goals and strategies; making knowledgeable decisions based on data insights. By continuously examining how effectively an institution is accomplishing its mission, the organization can better support its commitment to educational excellence and enriching the community in which they serve.</p>

		<p>The world of esports has become a rapidly growing industry, where interest in competitive gaming continues to spread across the globe. In the next four years, the industry is expected to reach $9 billion globally. Many institutions of higher education are incorporating esports degree programs into their curriculum, helping to attract large numbers of students who are interested in learning these skill sets and the business side of this fast-growing industry. “Esports is an expanding community of players, industry professionals, and academics who drive the sector to new heights,” says Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Ed.D., Associate Vice President Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, Edge. “Esports research is a critical part of that journey and has developed into a field of study spread across several academic disciplines, including business, sports science, cognitive science, informatics, law, media studies, and sociology.”</p>
<p>Professional sports in general have an enormous economic impact on a community and many institutions today offer sports management degrees. “With esports now trending to be the next generation of sports, a wider demographic of people can watch, participate and play,” says Bill Penders, Managing Director, Sector Development, New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA). “In this country, major league sports corporations are well aware of the challenge they are facing to try and attract these new generations of viewers. Many stadiums are building esports lounges into their facilities to get more of this demographic to come to the stadium and watch a game. The world of esports is already creating a substantial economic impact globally. We’re looking to attract esports companies that see New Jersey as a place to expand their business, add skilled workforce, and further help cultivate the esports ecosystem within the State and across the country.”</p>
<p>Innovation Center<br>
Looking to tap into this growing industry and further build upon the strong tech infrastructure and innovation ecosystem of New Jersey, Stockton University, an Edge member, has established an Esports Innovation Center (EIC) at the institution’s Atlantic City campus. With funding support from the NJEDA, the Center aims to create new academic and workforce development opportunities and expand research initiatives and technology innovation. “Two years ago, a mandate came through the governor’s office to the leadership team at the NJEDA that wanted to establish New Jersey as the hub for esports in the country,” says Penders. “We started to engage as many stakeholders as possible across the state who were affiliated with esports or had a private sector business within the esports ecosystem. We also spoke with schools that had esports teams and had a vested interest in developing esports curriculums for their students. Through the course of that dialog, we were able to connect with Stockton University and partner together to help cultivate and catalyze the esports sector in New Jersey.”</p>
<p>By bringing in the additional insight and expertise of various technology companies, both large and small, the idea of the EIC began to take shape. “Through these strategic partnerships, we began to determine how to create an innovation center that elevates esports in New Jersey,” shares Penders. “In about a year of planning, we created the concept of the EIC, where private companies can join as members to help fund operations.” Edge is pleased to have finalized a partnership agreement with Stockton University and the NJEDA, and through this partnership, Edge’s contributions will include input to strategic planning and the business plan, startup services for establishment of the non-profit, and back-office support for the EIC that include legal, human resources, and financial services. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Supporting the EIC is part of a wider NJEDA’s strategic effort to grow New Jersey’s innovation, sports wagering, and fintech ecosystems,” notes NJEDA Chief Executive Officer, Tim Sullivan. “Establishing New Jersey as the State of Innovation requires thinking outside the box and supporting new industries that have shown strong potential for sustainable, equitable growth. Esports is a large and rapidly growing industry that has the potential to provide significant economic benefits to communities throughout New Jersey. The Esports Innovation Center at Stockton University is a timely project that will help to establish New Jersey as a hub for the U.S. esports industry and will create new opportunities for New Jersey businesses and workers to enter the sector.”</p>

		<p>Growing the Esports Ecosystem<br>
As a hub for esports innovation, the EIC will continue to grow New Jersey’s esports ecosystem and find new ways to create career-ready graduates. With this mission in mind, the Center’s top initiatives include catalyzing collaborative technology innovation, supporting workforce development and education in the esports industry, promoting best practices for regulating wagering and ensuring integrity in esports, advocating for diversity, inclusion, and healthy gaming practices, and positioning New Jersey and Atlantic City as esports leaders in an emerging and competitive field.</p>
<p>Working with Stockton and industry partners, the EIC also looks to shape the esports culture and set a strong example for regulation and integrity practices. “Stockton University and Atlantic City have been leaders in recognizing the potential of the esports industry. Stockton’s Chief Information Officer, Scott Huston, helped make Stockton among the first colleges in the nation to recognize esports and its impact on the future of both entertainment and gaming technology,” explains Stockton University President, Harvey Kesselman. “We look forward to collaborating with public and private partners to make New Jersey a hub for esports innovation.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Esports has the potential to have a huge impact on the future of New Jersey so we are excited about having the Esports Innovation Center located on the Stockton Campus in Atlantic City. We look forward to bringing together both public and private partners to help innovate, create workforce development and academic opportunities, and guide the future of esports,” adds Scott Huston, Chief Information Officer at Stockton University.</p>
<p>To help in this mission and deliver a superior esports experience, the EIC uses esports connectivity via EdgeNet, which offers high bandwidth, low latency, highly available connections and provides direct peering connections to all major gaming platforms. With local esports peering taking traffic off the commodity internet, Edge’s optical fiber high performance network makes real-time gaming and lightning-fast competition possible, while simultaneously minimizing service disruptions.</p>

		<p>Developing a Skilled Workforce<br>
From supporting software development and gaming products to event production, data analytics, and machine learning/AI, the esports industry relies heavily upon innovative technology and high-tech manufacturing. The EIC focuses on teaching in-demand skills needed in the workforce and supporting esports-related research. “We want to have skilled graduates who understand the landscape of esports and everything that goes along with the industry,” says Penders. “Then, when local companies or private sector companies come to the United States looking for a place to plant their flag to set up esports operations, they’ll look no further than New Jersey. Businesses will recognize that our local institutions have grasped this opportunity to build curriculums that support this growing industry and create a highly-skilled workforce.”</p>
<p>Many innovation and research centers often create intellectual property as a result of the activities occurring at the institutions and the private sector companies who are devoting resources to exploring potential technological advancements within the esports environment. “Traditionally, the model is intellectual properties are owned by the school, but are then licensed out royalty free to the members of the center for the use within their own private sector companies,” explains Penders. “We expect this type of innovation and product development to occur at the EIC and provide valuable opportunities for private sector companies to gain an edge on their business by employing a new technology advancement from the esports arena.”</p>
<p>“Even more importantly,” Penders continues, “Companies say they will join as a member of the EIC because of the access to a skilled workforce who understand this industry and can bring value to their business. By participating in this innovation center, big companies will devote their resources to the EIC and gain exposure to Stockon students and hopefully other schools that would like to join the ecosystem.”</p>
<p>“The Innovation Center will promote innovative collaboration and partnerships that position the state of New Jersey as a leader in the esports industry, resulting in job growth and economic development,” adds Ghahramani. “Esports has the potential to engage players and fans regardless of background, and the Center can play a key role in promoting diversity and inclusion and healthy gaming practices, and identifying opportunities for underrepresented groups as the esports industry expands.” Along with student activities, the EIC will also host events for the local community, including coding and hacking challenges and esports competitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the Memorandum of Understanding with Stockton University, the NJEDA concurrently approved a separate agreement with New Jersey City University (NJCU) to support the Sports Wagering and Financial Technology Workforce Development and Innovation Center at NJCU. This Center will provide an incubator for the sports wagering and fintech industries and act as a connector between industry, academia, and relevant State agencies to grow and support innovation in sports wagering technology and fintech.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one paragraph, FAPI 1.0 Advanced is secure, stable, and complete Final Specification with a certification test suite while FAPI 2.0 is still in development so new features can be incorporated. FAPI 2.0 Baseline is hoped to be almost as secure as FAPI 1.0 Advanced while significantly simpler to implement. Also, FAPI 2.0 has greater scope than FAPI 1.0. We are hoping FAPI 2.0 Suite to be simpler, more elegant, more feature-rich, and more interoperable than FAPI 1.0. The catch is that FAPI 2.0 still is not formally verified, does not have a certification test suite, and is still changing. The last point can be a blessing as well. If you have a new feature request that FAPI 1.0 cannot fulfill, you should come to the FAPI working group to participate in FAPI 2.0 development.</p>
<p>While FAPI 2.0 is not a final specification, it is built from many current best practices and existing specifications. A FAPI 1.0 Advanced deployment that uses PAR &amp; PKCE is likely to be conformant with FAPI 2.0 baseline.</p>
<p>This table compares the two sets of specifications:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




FAPI 1.0
FAPI 2.0


Status
FINAL
Baseline: Implementer’s draft<p></p>
<p>Advanced: Draft</p>


Development Period
2016 – 2021
2020 –


Design principles.
Based on BCM principles[1].<p></p>
<p>All messages are integrity protected (message authentication) and all senders are strongly authenticated (client authentication) etc.</p>
Based on the explicit attacker model [2].<p></p>
<p>Message authentication requirements are relaxed so to make it simpler to implement while hopefully not exposing it to threats.</p>


Will it change?
No.<p></p>
<p>It is FINAL and set in stone.</p>
Likely.<p></p>
<p>Baseline is an Implementer’s draft and Advanced is still a working draft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


Are new features possible?
Only in extensions. FAPI 1.0 Baseline and Advanced are FINAL and cannot be changed.
Yes.<p></p>
<p>It is still in development.</p>


Formally Verified for security?
Yes for FAPI 1.0 Advanced.
No. However, as it is created with formal verification in mind, it probably will be easier to formally verify than FAPI 1.0 Advanced.


Is a certification/conformance test suite available?
Yes.
No.


Is it being used?
Advanced: Yes. UK, AU, BR Banking sectors, etc.<p></p>
<p>Baseline: No.</p>
Not yet. It is only at the first Implementer’s Draft and people are implementing it to test it out right now.


Right-sized?
No.<p></p>
<p>Baseline is probably undersized and is mostly not being used, while it is quite simple to implement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advanced is quite well adopted but may contain more features needed for many cases.</p>
Hopefully.<p></p>
<p>Baseline is incorporating some of the essential features from FAPI 1.0 Advanced. While it is enjoying the good part of the most wanted features of FAPI 1.0 Advanced, it is significantly simpler to implement.</p>


Is PAR (RFC9126) Required
No.<p></p>
<p>It is optional.</p>
Yes.<p></p>
<p>It is better for interoperability.</p>


Can it be used with the Grant Management spec?
Yes.
Yes and will be optimized since it is being developed together with it.


Can it be used with CIBA?
Yes.
Yes and will be optimized since it is being developed together with it.


“Non-repudiation” of the resource response.
Limited.
Comprehensive.


Vendor support.
Quite well supported.
Limited as of Dec, 2021.


Backward compatibility with FAPI 1.0?
–
No, although some deployments of FAPI 1.0 Advanced may be compatible with FAPI 2.0 baseline.



<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Recommendation for Deployers 
<p>In short, the FAPI working group recommends that deployments being specified at present use FAPI 1.0 Advanced, since it is Final and has been formally verified. At the same time, we also encourage people interested in FAPI 2.0 development to participate in the working group.</p>
 Footnotes 
<p>[1] BCM principles is a summary version of the recommendation by the seminal paper by Basin, Cramers, and Meier: Provably Repairing the ISO/IEC 9798 Standard for Entity Authentication [BCM2013].</p>
<p>P1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Positional tagging. Cryptographic message components should contain information that uniquely identities their origin. In particular, the information should identify the protocol, the protocol variant, the message number, and the particular position within the message, from which the component was sent.</p>
<p>P2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inclusion of identities and their roles. Each cryptographic message component should include information about the identities of all the agents involved in the protocol run and their roles unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise.</p>

It is hoped to be significantly easier to formally verify than FAPI 1.0 due to this explicitness.</p>

 10th Dec - ESSIF-LAB Consent Record Demo - <a href="https://youtu.be/Mq4oXEaOTwg">YouTube recording</a>
 
 Data Agreement demos  from NGI ESSIF-LAB sub-grantees iGrant.io, Gataca and the Human Colossus Foundation. These three demo'd implementations demonstrate how a consent notice (or "data agreement" as it was called in the ESSIF-LAB context) gets signed as a shared record between issuers/verifiers (data controllers) and holders (data subjects). The data agreement sets a clear purpose of usage, what personal data is collected, how long data can be retained and on what lawful basis it can be processed; both parties keep a record, allowing precise GDPR enforcement and transparency on all sides.
 
 The data agreement was originally based on the Kantara Initiative's Consent Notice, which is now being standardized as a new <a href="https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27560.html">ISO standard 27560</a>.

 Call to Participate - DIDComm User Group
 
 Now that the DIDComm v2 spec is nearing completion, and there are robust libraries in multiple programming languages, we are starting a user group to share learnings as we put DIDComm into production. We will organize community resources, produce a handbook, foster application-level protocol creation, maintain the didcomm.org website and repo, and recommend best practices. We invite anyone who's interested to register in the user group's <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/didcomm-usergroup">email list here</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/F4Qw7h6Sr9">Discord channel here</a>. 
 
 
 The first regular meeting will be held on January 10th-14th, with meeting selection to happen prior on the above communication methods. 
 Although this UG is sponsored by DIF, this is not an IP-protected context. We won't be developing specs or working on standards. Thus, you don't have to be a member of any particular org to join, and there are no legal terms to review or paperwork to sign. Please join us! 
 
 
 
 <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/agenda.md">🔧 KERI</a> 
 
 Status update for <code>did:keri</code>, and plans to add it as a work item to the ID WG.
 
 <a href="https://hackmd.io/@RYgJMHAGSlaLMaQzwYjvsQ/ByAYibtdF">Information and contextual documents</a> 
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/keri/did_methods/">Current did:keri method specification</a> 
 Current status of did:keri
 
 The goal is to continue and further expand the work on the DID method specification, to figure out how all the KERI building blocks can be utilized together in a method spec. 
 Does did:keri by itself make sense, or only "KERI in the context of an existing DID method" (e.g. did:indy:keri)? 
 The work in the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">KERI WG</a> is in a special state. The goal is to "wrap up" that current status of KERI so that the KERI spec work goes into a "sleep" state.

 3 design options:
 
 1. No awareness - most flexible for higher layers 
 2. Current approach - prefix with bit array to match order to underlying order (doesn't allow for canonicalization algos or higher-level users which need to reorder, i.e. LDP URDNA) 
 3. Append a more elaborate structure - byte array of indices referring to the message order in underlying dataset

 Hyperledger Aries 
 
 To anyone in the Aries Community that either builds Frameworks or deploys Aries solutions:
 
 Many of  in the Aries community want to transition from using the "early days" <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0160-connection-protocol/README.md">RFC 0160 Connections protocol</a> (part of AIP 1.0) to the newer <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">RFC 0023 DID Exchange</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md">RFC 0434 Out of Band</a> protocols.  A "community upgrade" has been proposed that will accomplish that in a way that we can avoid periods of instability between Aries agents (Issuers, Verifiers, Wallets, etc.) if we coordinate a series of changes in our deployments. 
 A PR has been proposed to RFC 0496 (Transition to OOB and DID Exchange)  and is expected to be accepted that will move us to Stage 1 of the transition, where all implementations are to be updated to accept requests using both the older Connections and newer DID Exchange protocols. During that period, all deployments will continue ONLY to send requests using the older Connections protocol. Please see RFC 0496 for the details of the entire transition. 
 
 
 The Aries Working Group is requesting that all deployments of Aries:
 
 Support this transition 
 Update their code bases and deployments to achieve Step 1 of the transition. 
 Document their completion of that Step in the RFC (per instructions). 
 Monitor the conversation around RFC 0496 to be ready to go to Step 2 of the transition. 
 
 
 Please direct any questions to the Aries channel in <a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger RocketChat</a>.

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>In the globalized digital economy, the job of verifying the identities of trade partners is becoming more complex and costly as each month passes. GLEIF data (see related links below) highlighted that 50% of financial institutions use, on average, four different identifiers to validate each customer organization. Individual businesses, which lack both the verification skills and the resources of financial institutions, struggle even further. </p>
<p>In November 2021, GLEIF partnered with Contour, a global network of banks, corporates and trade partners working together to revolutionize the trade finance industry by removing barriers to entry. The partnership enables the use of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) within Contour’s platform and puts digital identity at the heart of its proposition. </p>
<p>We caught up with Aaron Seabrook, COO at Contour, to discuss the partnership and explore why digital identity is such a vital component in creating more accessible trade networks. </p>
<p>What are some of the common challenges Contour’s clients encounter when trying to verify the identity of potential trading partners? </p>
<p>When organizations set out to build relationships with new suppliers, establishing that they are indeed who they claim to be is a vital step. We have heard from our member organizations that supplier verification processes are fragmented and inconsistently applied, particularly so following the business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Establishing the identity of a new supplier tends to be a manual process which, of course, is very inefficient: it is prone to human error; a challenge to scale in line with business growth; and really time consuming. </p>
<p>Why did Contour decide to partner with GLEIF?</p>
<p>Contour’s vision is to create a better world for businesses by making global trade accessible, digital, and secure. Our platform’s goal is to simplify the financial workflows between banks and corporations to enable seamless collaboration in real time. By doing so, we hope to reduce complexity and optimize efficiency for all involved. </p>
<p>As we have grown the platform, we have encountered challenges along the way when onboarding new member organizations. Some have multiple connections into disparate networks where they may be registered under a slightly different name, others may register with us using a holding company and be using a trading company to sign into others. When we try to piece this information together, mistakes happen because we’re reliant on manual processes. Digital systems crave structure, so we decided that a unique identification system was for our platform. </p>
<p>We chose the LEI because it is a well-governed and widely adopted global standard.</p>
<p>How will Contour’s customers benefit from access to the LEI as part of this latest partnership?</p>
<p>The LEI is going to become a central part of the Contour onboarding system through our new role as a Registration Agent. When an organization joins Contour, they go through our automated onboarding journey. Part of this system will now include a check to see if they have an LEI. If not, we will not only register them but shoulder the cost of doing so too.</p>
<p>Not only will the LEI improve our users’ customer experience within Contour, but it will also have a significant impact on their overall digital trade journey. Our members have multiple connections within multiple networks. With an LEI, a company’s legal reference data is available electronically to anyone, anywhere, for free - it can be universally validated. When used in international trade and trade finance, this creates greater confidence amongst trading parties resulting in more transparent and efficient cross-border exchanges of goods and data. In addition, the LEI will also lower data reconciliation costs, reduce transaction discrepancies and improve risk management for all our clients. </p>
<p>From their first day of joining Contour, our members will be in possession of a globally recognized digital identifier, applicable not only within Contour but across other international systems as well. This will help them realize the benefits of digitalization more quickly.</p>
<p>What long-term potential do you see for ID initiatives, such as the LEI, for global trade?</p>
<p>We believe that the LEI holds vast potential for global trade. As part of our vision of making trade accessible and inclusive to all, this means providing companies, both large and small, with the tools to improve their access to trade finance. The LEI enables SMEs in developed and developing countries to quickly establish their credentials via a native digital identity that is recognized globally. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/mckinsey-company-and-gleif-leis-and-client-lifecycle-management-in-banking-a-u-s-4-billion-beginning">GLEIF and McKinsey data</a> highlights that banks issuing trade finance could save up to $500 million every year by using the LEI for letters of credit alone. The potential for savings across the entire KYC process are therefore tremendous. Banks may also be incentivized to lend to a broader range of businesses of all sizes if those borrowers could offer up a globally recognized and validated form of organizational identity. </p>
<p>Businesses with LEIs are also more likely to be able to establish credit terms with international partners in the supply chain, creating further opportunities for global economic growth.<br>
The ripple effects that can occur by equipping businesses with LEIs are remarkable. We want to ensure that Contour plays a key part in the drive to make the LEI de-facto means of legal entity ID by continuing to advocate for industry adoption. </p>
<p>A fairer, more open, and more efficient international trade ecosystem is in sight.</p>

<p>Security practitioners will leverage PACE to evaluate their organization's overall state of cybersecurity readiness</p> 


<p>9 December 2021 — The <a href="https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/">Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA)</a>, a global, ​standards-based initiative to simplify ​​integration across the threat lifecycle, announced today that it has accepted the Posture Attribute Collection and Evaluation (<a href="https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE">PACE</a>) project contributed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), the National Security Agency (NSA) and McAfee. PACE will focus on creating production-ready code that evaluates the posture assessment of computing resources using a communication fabric which will allow organizations to use this information in zero-trust architecture decisioning.</p>



<p>Based on an implementation effort from the IETF Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/sacm/about/">SACM)</a> architecture, PACE will deliver community-maintained code that will arm operators with an interoperable out-of-the-box solution that monitors risk and threat exposure, reducing integration costs and redundancy while increasing resiliency. Providing comprehensive views into the endpoint, PACE will take advantage of existing standards such as SCAPv2 and leverage ongoing work in SBOM, to allow cybersecurity practitioners to fully utilize threat-informed defenses in their environment in an open and interoperable fashion.</p>



<p>The PACE project aligns with the OCA’s mission of integrating tools and solutions across security teams and will directly enable vendors and end users, advancing the OCA’s mission of building an open ecosystem where cybersecurity products interoperate without the need for customized integrations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“NSA Cybersecurity is proud to have supported the development of the OASIS standard <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2">OpenC2</a> language for command and control, which has been included in PACE. Additionally, PACE will leverage several of the cybersecurity standardization efforts NSA has been working on with industry partners to improve the cybersecurity of National Security Systems, the Department of Defense and the Defense Industrial Base.”<br>— Neal Ziring, Cybersecurity Technical Director, National Security Agency</p>



<p>PACE joins other OCA projects that include Kestrel, the threat hunting tool, the STIX Shifter patterning library, and the OCA Ontology.</p>



<p>The OCA is hosted by OASIS Open, one of the most respected, international bodies in the world for open source and standards. To learn more about the OCA, or other OCA technologies that are available to help security teams connect their security tools and data, please visit: <a href="https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance">https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance</a>.</p>



<p>SPONSOR QUOTES</p>



<p>Center for Internet Security<br>“Managing risk and addressing threat exposure are important facets of any security program. CIS is pleased to have introduced PACE as a new OCA project, we look forward to evaluating and integrating new posture assessment solutions as the cooperative ecosystem increases in participation and interest.” <br>– Adam Montville, Chief Product Architect, Center for Internet Security</p>



<p>CyberNB | CIPnet<br>“We applaud the work of OASIS and believe in the mission to create open, global standards that help strengthen digital resiliency.&nbsp;The new PACE project will help define standardized process to measure cybersecurity posture across computing resources.&nbsp;The team here at CyberNB and our Critical Infrastructure Protection Network (CIPnet) will benefit from the PACE project and its outcomes.”<br>– Tyson Johnson, CEO, CyberNB | CIPnet</p>



<p>Cydarm Technologies<br>“PACE is an important addition to the OCA project portfolio, as it enables faster gathering of context around intrusion alerts, enabling responders to more quickly triage possible incidents and reduce time wasted on repetitive queries across disconnected systems. Cydarm looks forward to integrating PACE, to further our goal of enabling better and faster security operations.”<br>– Dr. Vaughan Shanks, CEO, Cydarm Technologies<br><br>Cyware Labs<br>“Cybersecurity threats are rapidly evolving, making it essential for organizations to have complete visibility over their current security posture and the environment they are striving to protect. At Cyware, we facilitate the goal of collective defense for all organizations and communities through collaborative threat response and threat intelligence sharing. PACE, an OCA project will steer the community towards a collaborative framework, enabling them to have the right visibility over the security posture of any organization.”<br>– Avkash Kathiriya, VP – Research and Innovation, Cyware Labs<br><br>F5 Inc.<br>“Effectively sketching the cybersecurity posture of organizations to practically combat cyber threats requires the power of both enterprise and open-source tools to build a coherent and vigorous cyber defense platform. Fusion and integration of security products including information exchange with the PACE project in the OCA ecosystem not only helps the organizations to subvert cyber threats at scale by generating efficient threat intelligence but also helps to build a proactive and robust cybersecurity stance. In fact, that’s the need of the hour for organizations to provide a secure and safe digital transformation environment to customers.”<br>– Renuka Nadkarni, CTO Security, F5 Inc.<br><br>IBM Security<br>“Posture assessment is foundational for any zero-trust based approach to security. Having open and interoperable implementation of existing posture standards is critical to ensuring that innovations in this space can be effectively implemented by the broader community, and bringing the PACE project into the OCA will help the industry realize that goal.”<br>– Jason Keirstead, Senior Technical Staff Member and the Chief Architect of Threat Management, IBM Security</p>



<p>McAfee<br>“The state of a system at the time of an event is of utmost importance in an event driven system, perhaps as important as the event itself. Without this context, we cannot determine if an event is of high or low critical importance or what the resulting action should be to a given event. Posture attributes that we can broadly agree on as well as open tooling for the collection and evaluation of those attributes is a great move forward in making open, interoperable and event-driven cybersecurity a reality.”<br>–  Mark Mastrangeli, Lead Technology Architect, McAfee</p>



<p>Rapid7<br>“Visibility is the cornerstone of cybersecurity. Being able to measure and effectively communicate the posture/state of business process assets fosters better (and faster) decision making and can significantly improve enterprise safety and resilience. By creating and relying on open standards for data storage and interchange and removing the need for vendors to reinvent the wheel on commodity architecture components, PACE will help bring security automation and continuous monitoring (SACM) to the widest possible audience, arming organizations of any size with the core components necessary to maintain the health of their IT ecosystems.”<br>– Bob Rudis, Chief Security Data Scientist, Rapid7</p>



<p>SAIC<br>“As a leading systems integrator for the federal government, SAIC assesses cyber security postures of large customers with complex cyber environments. We have made significant progress in creating a holistic picture with a repeatable process, and the PACE project will enhance our solutions by allowing us to generate the posture and compliance picture in a more rapid and standardized fashion.”<br>– Forrest Hare, Solution Developer, Cyberspace Operations, SAIC</p>



<p>sFractal Consulting<br>“PACE is a great fit for OCA’s mission of standards-based, vendor-agnostic, interoperable cybersecurity. One timely PACE example is the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) – collecting the SBOM of a device or cloud-service and comparing it with vulnerabilities found in the National Vulnerability Database, and using the results to inform your threat-hunting.”<br>– Duncan Sparrell, Chief Cyber Curmudgeon, sFractal Consulting</p>



<p>ThreatQuotient<br>“ThreatQuotient believes in a data-driven approach to security that improves efficiency, has an open architecture, and enables balanced automation. We are proud to be a part of the OCA and to support protocols and standards such as PACE that simplify the exchange of information between different teams and technologies, and enable threat-informed defenses. We are encouraged by continued efforts across the industry to meet the needs of security teams and ultimately help them improve the resiliency of their organizations.”<br>– Haig Colter, Director, Alliances, ThreatQuotient<br><br>VISUA<br>“VISUA recently joined the OCA specifically because we saw the valuable work the member companies were doing to not only find new and innovative ways to detect compromises and behaviours, but also to communicate threat intelligence in a more cohesive and open way. This kind of work is very exciting to us as we bring new technology discussions to the world of cyber security and begin to integrate the wonderful innovations developed and ratified by OASIS members. PACE is yet another example of this great work.”<br>– Alessandro Prest, CTO and Co-Founder, VISUA</p>

<p>ClaimReview is one of the hidden jewels that can be found amongst schema.org's 2700+ definitions. To kick off a series of guest posts around this topic, we bring you a guest post from two members of the factchecking and open data community who have been exploring the potential of this work.</p> Enriching ClaimReview for fact checkers <p><a href="https://twitter.com/mr_dudders">Andrew Dudfield</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ldodds">Leigh Dodds</a></p><br><p>To help fight bad information, search engines, social media platforms and other sources of online content are increasingly highlighting the work of fact checkers by labelling posts with incorrect, misleading or harmful information.</p><br><p>This is often enabled through the publication of structured data that uses Schema.org's <a href="https://schema.org/ClaimReview">ClaimReview</a> schema. This defines a simple approach for <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/factcheck">tagging fact checking articles</a> that has been collaboratively developed and documented through <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>. For more background for a journalistic and factchecking audience, see <a href="https://reporterslab.org/">Duke Reporters' Lab</a>'s <a href="https://www.claimreviewproject.com/">dedicated site</a>.&nbsp;</p> <br> At&nbsp;<a href="https://fullfact.org/">Full Fact</a> we have recently been exploring ways to revise and extend the claim review metadata to provide more detail that might enable further reuse and labelling of content, and further insights into the fact checking process.<br><br><p>Our investigation has covered the following areas:</p><br>  <p>Current scope and application of ClaimReview. The currently defined model provides a lot of flexibility around how much detail might be included in a review, with Google, <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/Webmaster-Blog/September-2017/Bing-adds-Fact-Check-label-in-SERP-to-support-the-ClaimReview-markup">Bing</a> and others recommending specific profiles of that in their structured markup documentation. Full Fact has adopted their own approach for applying the standard,&nbsp;we have reflected on that experience and the current recommendations from Google, Bing and other adopters, in pursuit of a Full Fact profile that is close to those used elsewhere.</p>  <p>Identifiers and linking. How can additional links and identifiers be included in ClaimReview markup to support disambiguation and aggregation of data? We've concluded that Schema.org already provides useful properties which, if applied consistently, can support this goal. In line with its growing role as a clearing house for identifiers, we believe <a href="https://wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> would be a useful common target for linking data across the community, e.g. making use of schema.org's <a href="https://schema.org/sameAs">sameAs</a> property. Full Fact articles <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_dudders/status/1466362791200280581">now contain</a> experimental markup in this direction.</p>  <p>Enriching Claims. The standard was revised to include the notion of a <a href="https://schema.org/Claim">Claim</a>: a statement made by an author that appears in one or more locations. We believe this is an important part of the data model and one that should be more widely adopted. Consistent use of Claim markup would help to clearly indicate situations in which a person or organisation is repeatedly making the same claim, or where others are repeating the same misinformation. In addition to enriching claims with author and appearance information, the addition of topic information would provide a useful dimension to the data, helping to surface related claims and fact checks.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Corrections and actions. The <a href="https://fullfact.org/blog/2019/jun/how-fact-checking-works/">second wave of fact checking</a> is about more than just writing fact checks, it involves taking action to tackle disinformation. How might we surface data about requests for corrections to published content, and record when those corrections have been made? Schema.org currently includes some vocabulary to help describe corrections and comments which we've explored. But further work is needed to define a useful way of recording and sharing the other activities undertaken by fact checkers</p>  <p>Citing evidence. Finally citing evidence is an essential part of performing a fact check, so how can we use existing Schema.org vocabulary to help to surface the key resources, papers and datasets that were used in producing a fact check?</p>  <br><p>Building on the open, collaborative approach that the community has taken so far, we have published <a href="https://fullfact.github.io/markup-investigation/">our research notes</a> that explore these questions in more detail and present some early recommendations. We welcome feedback from anyone working to tackle online disinformation.</p><br><p>We would also like to propose the creation of an informal mailing list or community group to support ongoing discussion and experimentation, e.g. hosted at W3C alongside the broader <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">Schema.org CG</a>.</p><br><p>Our joint goal would be to create proposals for further enhancing the current Schema.org model, as necessary, and documenting useful patterns of applying the current model to real-world scenarios including both tagging content and developing APIs.</p> <br>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to welcome David Henstock, Head of Identity Products at Visa to the board of directors as a sustaining member.</p>
<p>Visa joins an accomplished group of identity thought leaders including, Cisco, Google, KDDI, Microsoft, NRI Secure, Okta, Ping Identity, Verizon and Yahoo Ad Tech. The Board is deeply committed to ensuring that the Foundations’ standards and programs are poised to meet the needs of a rapidly changing identity landscape. OpenID Foundations standards and programs already enable billions of users and millions of applications, and market demand indicates an even wider range of use cases will drive rapid adoption in the years ahead. Success to date and going forward is directly a result of the active engagement and investment by leading organizations and their representatives, like Visa.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have Visa and David join the OpenID Foundation Board at this inflection point in the global identity ecosystem,” said Gail Hodges, Executive Director of the OpenID Foundation. “Visa’s leadership in global payments and identity services as well as their longstanding commitment to standards will be of great value as we tailor our strategy to this moment. I look forward to working with David and the other members of the Board to define and build the foundations that will give users, businesses, and governments secure and interoperable identity ecosystems.”</p>
<p>“Digital identity delivers innovation to existing and new use cases but achieving its potential requires industries to align on the common goal of establishing global standards,” said David Henstock, Head of Identity Products at Visa. “I look forward to working with OpenID Foundation members to achieve this goal to bring greater awareness and adoption of digital identity in payments.”</p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2021/12/07/the-openid-foundation-welcomes-visa-to-the-board-of-directors/">The OpenID Foundation Welcomes Visa to the Board of Directors</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a>.

<p>2021 continues to be a pivotal time for digital identity as interest and perspectives emerge from every sector of society. The Covid-19 pandemic, a long overdue global reckoning on racial and economic justice, and challenges to the roles and responsibilities of tech companies catapulted the debates around identification systems into the mainstream. Governments scrambled to digitize services, displacement and forced migration increased, and urgent issues on vaccination credentials dominated the news cycle, accelerating industry discussions and the introduction of new actors and advocates on a global&nbsp;stage.</p><p>A constant has been the #GoodID channels (<a href="http://www.good-id.org">www.good-id.org</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/goodid">@GoodID</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/goodidstories/?hl=en">@goodidstories</a>) convening those new to the discussion and serving as reliable global spaces for long-standing privacy activists, software vendors, humanitarian organizations, advertisers, national governments, tech startups, lawyers, and economists to share viewpoints and resources. While there were an enormous number of frameworks, principles, codes, and academic research circulating, what was often missing in the digital identity debate were real-world stories that would bring the issues to life — a place where all the different stakeholders, often siloed by their interests and industries, could connect and&nbsp;debate.</p><p>Launched in 2019, the #GoodID channels and the larger Good ID movement have served as a catalyst for bold ideas, shared solutions on good policy, good technology, good practices for government-issued ID, data trails, and both the technology and ethics surrounding decentralized identity systems. Facilitated by <a href="https://unfoldstories.co.uk/">Unfold Stories</a> (a creative agency for social issues), supported and guided by <a href="https://omidyar.com/">Omidyar Network</a>, and accelerated by movement leaders and visionaries, #GoodID offers an accessible platform — open, safe, clear, practical — for navigating the legal, technical, and political complexities of digital identity.</p><p>Through thoughtful convening by Unfold Stories, the #GoodID channels — and the #GoodID hashtag — successfully established a common language and <a href="https://www.good-id.org/en/glossary/">glossary</a> around what “good” should look like in the context of digital identity. Unfold Stories has communicated a practical set of values and tenets in a clear and accessible way that galvanizes the movement. #GoodID surfaces regularly in conversation within governments as well as academic, business, and humanitarian organizations.</p><p>Guided by an <a href="https://www.good-id.org/en/articles/introducing-goodid-editorial-board/">Independent Editorial Board </a>in 2020–2021, the #<a href="https://www.good-id.org/en/awards/2021/">GoodID Awards</a>, monthly <a href="https://www.good-id.org/en/engage/">e-bulletin</a>, and related <a href="https://twitter.com/goodid">Twitter debates</a> resulted in the #GoodID hashtag reaching 285 million impressions on Twitter, over 400,000 individual engagements, and nearly 40,000 posts with engagement rates that frequently topped 20%. In an effort to reach a broader audience, Unfold Stories also explored the opportunities and risks of digital identification systems for people in the real world via a series of 22 vignettes on Instagram, called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/goodidstories/">Good ID&nbsp;Stories</a>.</p><p>Recognizing the importance of this point in time for the #GoodID movement — and as advised by consultations with the #GoodID community — we agreed that #GoodID will move to an academic institution to grow and&nbsp;evolve.</p><p>Starting in 2022, the<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/"> Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society</a> at Harvard University will steward #GoodID, curating the <a href="https://twitter.com/goodid">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://@goodidstories">Instagram channels</a>. The Center brings expertise, a cutting-edge research network, the ability to convene influential thinkers and doers, and a commitment to developing initiatives that explore the future of digital identities. As part of this evolution, we will sunset the #GoodID website in late December 2021; please check out the Berkman Klein Center <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">website</a> to find many identity-related resources.</p><p>“Berkman Klein is committed to studying the possibilities of digital identity across a range of domains and geographies,” said Managing Director Lis Sylvan, “We’re excited to share our work and engage with and learn from the communities that have been drawn to ideas and debates around #GoodID.”</p><p>The Center will foster dialogue through the #GoodID channels, introducing new research and academic efforts that reflect trust-building practices (transparency, accountability, and public participation) alongside policy and technology design features that prioritize privacy, inclusion, user value, user agency, and security.</p><p>Berkman Klein Center is uniquely positioned to introduce viewpoints, debates, and areas of exploration from academic and research perspectives. The Center recently launched the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/institute-rebooting-social-media">Institute for Rebooting Social Media</a>, a research initiative to accelerate progress toward better understanding of social media through legal, architectural, and platform policy interventions. In connection with this Institute and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2020-10/research-sprint-participants-explore-digital-transformation-time-crisis-focus">Berkman Klein Research Sprints</a>, and through the Center’s ongoing work with the over 100 international <a href="http://networkofcenters.net/">Network of Internet and Society Research Centers</a>, the Center will support conversations about digital identity issues that will reach diverse and interdisciplinary communities of research and practice.</p><p>COVID-19 has changed our collective understanding of the uses, value, and risks of digital identification systems. The Center will explore questions surrounding digital identity in the data governance, privacy, social media, and data economy debates. Omidyar Network and Unfold Stories are excited to see how the Berkman Klein Center will advance these questions through the existing #GoodID channels and the Center’s academic programming.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/new-steward-for-goodid-berkman-klein-center-for-internet-and-society-at-harvard-university-a221cdb12949">New steward for #GoodID: Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Wolf McNally’s <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lifehash">LifeHash</a> is one of Blockchain Commons’ interoperable specifications intended to make digital infrastructure open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate. A LifeHash takes a cryptographic objects such as a seed or a key (or really, any sort of data) and turns it into a beautiful and easily recognizable image.</p>

<p>You can now play with LifeHashes at <a href="http://lifehash.info/">LifeHash.info</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash-web/">C++ implementation compiled to WebAssembly</a> allows you to enter an arbitrary text string or a SHA-256 digest and view the corresponding LifeHash — using one of a few different LifeHash variants. (We recommend v2 as the “official” LifeHash.) Because it’s compiled into Webassembly, LifeHash.info does all the work in your browser, ensuring your secrets stay safe!</p>

<p>A similar idea called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum-blockies">Blockies</a> already exists to identify Ethereum addresses. They’re a great addition to the Ethereum ecosystem, but LifeHashes incorporate a few additional features. Because each one is built from an iteration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>, they’re more detailed. They also have been carefully formatted to display well on grayscale screens and low-resolution screens, with our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/quarterlies/Q1-2021-Report/">LetheKit offering a proof of concept</a>.</p>

<p>So why use LifeHashes? They ensure that any time that you see a key or seed in a different environment, you’ll be able to recognize it through the visual hash (and now you can use <a href="http://lifehash.info/">LifeHash.info</a> to display the LifeHash derived from the SHA-256 hash of an object, even if your app doesn’t support LifeHashes). As an adjunct to existing computer and human examinations of digital hashes, LifeHashes can improve your security.</p>

<p>LifeHashes are particularly important for Blockchain Commons given our focus on resilient and independent airgapped architectures: a LifeHash allows for the easy comparison of a cryptographic object on either side of the gap, so that you know that you received what you were expecting. Transferred a seed? Asked to sign a PSBT for a specific account? LifeHashes can help you avoid costly errors.</p>

<p>Our explainer video talks more about LifeHash and demonstrates how it works:</p>





<p>Blockchain Commons is dedicated to improving the human aspects of the digital world; LifeHash does that by considering the human experience of cryptographic hashes and providing visual cues to replace (or at least supplement) the long strings of letters and numbers that we can’t easily differentiate.</p>

		<p>“I have been using Hyperledger technologies for the past two years. The most valuable insights that I gained from this are how a project can be planned and executed. I learnt that, if you plan, document and discuss a task clearly with your mentors and the people in the community, the time it takes to complete it is considerably lower and you don’t need to do any rework for it. This experience also improved my techniques in maintaining proper code and designing the code keeping conventions in mind. Finally, I learnt a lot about Hyperledger Fabric architecture as well as Hyperledger Indy and Docker networks.”</p>

<p>“I have been part of the Hyperledger ecosystem for the last five years and seen it grow to 18 projects, including DLTs, libraries and tools for efficient blockchain development and deployment. Hyperledger Fabric is the most used DLT in enterprise applications, and decentralised identity (DID)/self-sovereign identity (SSI) applications have grown in the last three to four years. To support Fabric as a ledger for Hyperledger Aries will increase the adoption of DID/SSI in enterprises by adding the flexibility to use Fabric as a ledger for SSI/DID systems and will create more interoperability within the Hyperledger ecosystem. It is a really interesting project. I have learnt lot as a mentor and got the opportunity to contribute more to the Hyperledger ecosystem. My mentee, Harsh, did really well. He completed this project and now we are planning to propose this as a Hyperledger Lab to build out the future roadmap.”</p>

<p>Much is made of attributes like “opinion leader”, “domain expert”, and “mentor”.  Kim Cameron was all that and much more.  Our colleague Joerg Resch has <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/resch/rest-in-peace-kim-cameron">eloquently memorialized</a> Kim’s many contributions to our industry as “fundamentally influencing the way we think about and deal with privacy and digital identity”.  Not only did Kim “inject his 7 laws of identity into Microsoft’s DNA”, but did so throughout today’s growing global digital identity ecosystem. </p>
<p>Kim was crafty. He not only injected his thinking into Microsoft; as a champion of the Identity Standards Community, Kim embedded his thinking into the standards that inform many of the identity systems operating at scale today. Kim’s domain expertise went beyond his considerable engineering chops. He had a deep understanding of the interplay between the rapid pace of technical innovation, the practicalities of market adoption, and the constraints of government regulation.</p>
<p>Organizations like the OpenID Foundation and the Open Identity Exchange are among those that benefited from his early advocacy and sustained support. Many of us are proud to call him a mentor and remember him fondly for his intellectual openness and generosity of spirit. The occasion of Kim’s passing reminds us of our debt to those who volunteered their time and talents, broke new ground, and helped clear the path we follow today. </p>
<p>Both our professional and personal lives are better because of Kim.  Despite his untimely passing, his contributions and memory will carry on into the better future he helped create.</p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2021/12/04/in-praise-of-kim-cameron/">In Praise of Kim Cameron</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a>.

<p>HTTPS transfer specification is ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages via HTTPS Version 1.1 from the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. HTTP over TLS is a widely deployed transfer protocol that provides an authenticated, ordered, lossless delivery of uniquely-identified messages. This document specifies the use of HTTP over TLS as a transfer mechanism for OpenC2 Messages. A Testing conformance target is provided to support interoperability testing without security mechanisms.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>Members of the OpenC2 TC [1] approved this specification by Special Majority Vote. The specification had been released for public review as required by the TC Process [2]. The vote to approve as a Committee Specification passed [3], and the document is now available online in the OASIS Library as referenced above.</p>

 Shops.scot is a new venture under development, that will launch in the new year. 
<p>As the title suggests, this will operate a ‘Multivendor Marketplace’ – A site where multiple sellers can each create their own e-store, and visitors can browse and buy from any of them.</p>
<p>This will accelerate our Digital Nation Action Plan, specifically the digital enablement and support of micro and small businesses. It’s still the case that many don’t even have a web site.</p>
<p>So this will provide them an ultra simple way of achieving that, with the key distinction from other options like EBay or Amazon obviously being that it’s entirely Scotland focused. This means a much more local, hands on technical support, and a concentrated market focus.</p>
<p>Key features will include:</p>
 
 A powerful set of digital marketing tools – As well as loading up your products, you’ll be able to send e-vouchers, email marketing etc. 
 Cryptocurrency – Accept Bitcoin payments et al. This is another key technology field where SMEs know they should be doing more but it is simply beyond them. 
 
<p>In short it will leverage the SaaS (Software as a Service) model to make easily accessible the powerful e-commerce and digital marketing technologies that most small businesses would greatly benefit from but don’t have the resource or expertise to deploy themselves.</p>
<p>There is also great potential to team up with other Scottish innovators, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/">Miconex</a>. They offer a gift card system that could tie in with #1, with a particular focus on local towns, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/casestudy/case-study--the-perth-gift-card">Perth</a>.</p>
<p>Shops.scot will be able to provide the core e-commerce tools for selling their products, and organized into similarly local sections, like Shops.scot/Perth. This will provide a powerful combined solution to achieve key Scottish Government goals like <a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/scottish-government-offers-support-local-online-firms">boosting local commerce for local merchants</a>.</p>

<p>First public review - ends Dec. 31st</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) TC are pleased to announce that XACML v3.0 Dynamic Attribute Authority Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment. This is the first public review of this draft specification.</p>



<p>This specification defines a new XACML system component, the Dynamic Attribute Authority, which augments the request context of an XACML authorization request with additional attributes and attribute values that are generated on demand according to a set of rules. The rules are expressed as XACML policies, use obligations to specify the additional attributes and values, and are processed in the normal manner of a Policy Decision Point. This means that a Dynamic Attribute Authority can be readily constructed from existing XACML system components.</p>



<p>A primary use case for the Dynamic Attribute Authority is role enablement, where the dynamic attribute in question is the subject role.</p>

<p>Discussion Papers are to White Papers as a quick sketch is to a finished painting. Where a White Paper advocates for a completed solution as the best solution for a problem or set of related problems, Discussion Papers provide a quick way to write up a radical or unexpected idea to solve a problem in a way that fosters discussion and collaboration on refining the idea.</p>



<p>The goal of Trust over IP working groups and task forces is to produce SSI and related technologies and standards, eventually advocating them outside Trust over IP for general adoption.</p>



<p>White Papers are the gold standard for talking about solutions with enough development, testing and successful deployment to provide evidence that this is a solution that is ready for mainstream adoption.</p>



<p>Discussion Papers are focused on providing a quick way of capturing new directions or ideas for stubborn problems in 500 to 2000 words with a combination of google docs (for authoring) and blogs (for comments) that encourage quick turnaround and lively discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ideas can be radical, opinionated or unexpected, but they do have to solve a problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The structure of a Discussion Paper is problem-focused, focused on issues that customers or consumers of ToIP (or related) technologies have now or need to be solved to make distributed Digital Identity and the Data Economy successful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The (suggested) Discussion Paper outline:</p>



  (Executive) Summary  Problem(s to be solved)  Requirements for a Solution  Solution  Pro’s, Cons (vs other Solutions) &amp; Vulnerabilities  See Also (other ToIP related ideas)  Resources and References  Links to supporting documents &amp; URLs    



<p>Trust over IP welcomes Discussion Papers from ToIP members, encouraging potential contributors to join Trust over IP.</p>



<p>Start by reviewing the <a href="https://live-trustoverip.pantheonsite.io/our-work/discussion-papers/">published Discussion Papers</a> on this site.</p>

<p>"Transfer via MQTT" is ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages via MQTT Version 1.0 from the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a widely-used publish / subscribe (pub/sub) transfer protocol. This specification describes the use of MQTT Version 5.0 as a transfer mechanism for OpenC2 messages.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

Bild: Anwendungsfälle im Bildungsbereich mit dem Lissi&nbsp;Wallet<p>In diesem Artikel möchten wir einen Überblick über die Anwendungsfälle im Bildungsbereich geben, an welchen wir im Rahmen von <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a> derzeit arbeiten. Der <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/lissi-use-cases-education-c39908690300">Artikel ist auch in Englisch</a> verfügbar.</p><p>Wir verbringen viel Zeit in der Schule oder in Universitäten, um einen guten Bildungsabschluss zu erlangen. Mit erfolgreichem Abschluss an einer (Hoch)Schule wird ein Zertifikat als Nachweis der erbrachten Leistungen ausgestellt. Diese werden aktuell in Papierform ausgestellt und sind somit nicht medienbruchfrei bei Dritten vorzuweisen. Mit Lissi erhältst Du deine Bildungszertifikate direkt in Dein Wallet und kannst es nach Bedarf dritten Parteien, wie z.B. einem potenziellen Arbeitgeber oder einer Universität präsentieren. Wir gehen aber noch einen Schritt weiter und möchten zusammen mit unseren Partnern aus dem Bildungssektor alle Prozesse, welche vertrauensvolle Interaktionen voraussetzen, digitalisieren. Vorerst zählen dazu die folgenden drei Anwendungsgebiete:</p>Bild: Bildungsnachweise im Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Bildungsnachweise: <p>Es gibt eine Vielzahl an Nachweisen für erbrachte Leistungen im Bildungsbereich: Von Abschlusszeugnissen der Schule und Universität bis hin zu Schulungsbestätigungen vom Arbeitgeber oder einer Online-Plattform. Aktuell erhalten wir diese Zertifikate in Papierform oder als PDF, welche nur schwer durch Dritte überprüft werden können. Parteien, die die Zertifikate überprüfen möchten, haben oftmals keine Möglichkeit eine Fälschung von einem Original zu unterscheiden. Dies ist für alle beteiligten ein Problem. Wir arbeiten aktiv mit Anbietern von Bildungszertifikaten daran, diese Nachweise zu digitalisieren, sodass Du diese bequem in Deinem Lissi Wallet speichern kannst und Dritte diese einfach überprüfen können. Unser Ziel ist es, den kompletten Prozess für einen Studenten abzudecken und das fängt bereits im Gymnasium an. Mit dem Lissi Wallet kannst Du alle Zeugnisse vom Schulabschluss bis zum Master und alles dazwischen lebenslang und selbstbestimmt aufbewahren.</p><p><a href="https://www.bwi.de/news-blog/blog/artikel/sichere-digitale-identitaeten-wie-das-pdf-aus-der-bewerbung-verschwand">Ein Beitrag dazu </a>hat unser IDunion Partner, die BWI GmbH veröffentlicht.</p>Bild: Bewerbungen bei Bildungseinrichtungen mit dem Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Bewerbung für Bildungseinrichtungen: <p>Bei einer Bewerbung an einer öffentlichen Einrichtung als Student:in sind oftmals einige Nachweise notwendig. Häufig zählen dazu der Personalausweis, bisherige Bildungszertifikate oder sonstige Dokumente abhängig vom Studiengang und den persönlichen Umständen. Da diese Dokumente im Großteil noch in Papierform vorgelegt werden müssen, ist dies viel Aufwand für Bewerber:innen sowie die Bildungseinrichtung. Mit Lissi möchten wir die digitale Übersendung der Dokumente ermöglichen, welche besonders wertvoll bzw. schutzbedürftig sind. Damit fällt für Bewerber:innen der Mehraufwand weg, z.B. Kopien beglaubigen zu lassen. Bildungseinrichtungen können die Bewerbungen dann schneller und effizienter bearbeiten, was für alle Beteiligten von Vorteil&nbsp;ist.</p> Campusmanagement: <p>Zusammen mit der Technischen Universität Berlin untersuchen wir, wie die Campus Management Infrastruktur mit SSI-Agenten erweitert werden kann. Diverse Leistungen, beispielsweise der Zugang zu den Campus Diensten werden zukünftig mit verifizierbaren Nachweisen angeboten. Lernende sowie Lehrende haben somit über das Wallet Zugang zu den verschiedenen Dienstleistungen der Hochschule. Hierzu zählen z.B. Anmeldungen für Kurse oder Veranstaltungen, der Erhalt von Bescheinigungen, der Zugang zu Räumlichkeiten oder die Beantragung von sonstigen Leistungen. Somit hat die Bildungseinrichtung einen direkten Kontakt zu jedem Lernenden und kann bequem Informationen anfragen und Leistungen zur Verfügung stellen.</p>Patrick Herbke der Technischen Universität Berlin über das Lissi&nbsp;Wallet<p>Organisationen, welche Interesse der Zusammenarbeit an den genannten Anwendungsfällen haben oder neue Anwendungsfälle aus dem Bereich einbringen möchten, können uns gern via info@lissi.id kontaktieren.</p><p>Dein Lissi&nbsp;Team</p>

Picture: Use cases with the Lissi Wallet within the education sector.<p>In this article we would like to provide you with an overview of the use cases within the educational sector we are currently working on within <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a>. The <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/lissi-anwendungsf%C3%A4lle-bildung-7c7bda96ea64">article is also available in&nbsp;German</a>.</p><p>We spend a lot of time in school or universities to get a decent education. Upon successful graduation from a school or university, a certificate is issued as proof of the achievements. However, these are currently still only issued in paper form and therefore cannot be easily presented to third parties. With Lissi, you receive your educational certificates directly in your wallet and can present them to third parties, such as a potential employer or university, as required. However, we are going one step further and, together with our partners from the education sector, would like to digitise all processes that require trusted interactions. For the time being, this includes the following three application areas:</p>Picture: Educational certificates with the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Educational Credentials <p>There are a variety of proofs of educational achievements: from school and university certificates to training confirmations from employers or an online platform. Currently, we receive these certificates in paper form or as PDFs, which are difficult to verify by third parties. Parties who want to verify the certificates often have no way to distinguish a fake from an original. This is a problem for all parties involved. We are actively working with education certificate providers to digitise these credentials so that you can conveniently store them in your Lissi Wallet and present them to third parties. Our goal is to cover the complete journey for a student and that starts in high school. With the Lissi Wallet, you can store all your certificates from graduation to master’s degree and everything in between for life long&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Our IDunion partner, the BWI GmbH, has published <a href="https://www.bwi.de/news-blog/blog/artikel/sichere-digitale-identitaeten-wie-das-pdf-aus-der-bewerbung-verschwand">an article on this&nbsp;topic</a>.</p>Picture: Applications to educational institutions with the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Applying to educational institutions: <p>When applying to a public institution as a student different documents are required. Oftentimes these include the identity card, previous educational certificates or other documents depending on the course of study and personal circumstances. Since most of these documents still have to be submitted in paper form, this is a lot of work for both the applicant and the educational institution. With Lissi, we make it possible to send documents that are particularly valuable or in need of protection in digital form. This eliminates additional work for applicants, e.g. the need to have certified copies. Educational institutions can then process applications faster and more efficiently, which is an advantage for everyone involved.</p> Campus management: <p>Together with the Technical University of Berlin, we are investigating how the campus management infrastructure can be expanded with SSI agents. Various services, such as access to campus services, will be offered with verifiable credentials in the future. Learners as well as teachers will thus have access to the various services of the university via the Lissi Wallet. These include, for example, registering for courses or events, obtaining certificates, accessing premises or applying for other services. Thus, the educational institution has direct contact with each learner and can conveniently request information and provide services.</p>Patrick Herbke of the Technical University of Berlin about the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet<p>Organizations which are interested in collaborating on the above use cases or would like to contribute new use cases from the field are welcome to contact us via <a href="mailto:info@lissi.id">info@lissi.id</a>.</p><p>Your Lissi&nbsp;Team</p>

<p>The specification, providing a common interface for exchanging project management data, enters the 60-day public review that precedes the call for consent as an OASIS Standard.</p> 


<p>General information about this public review can be found in https://docs.oasis-open.org/oslc-promcode/promcode/v1.0/cs02/promcode-v1.0-cs02-public-review-metadata.html.</p>



<p>OASIS and the OSLC PROMCODE TC [1] are pleased to announce that OSLC PROMCODE V1.0 CS02 is now available for public review and comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Managing software delivery can be highly challenging due to the diversity of the development processes, methods, tools and platforms used by different organizations participating in a project. Manual work done in order to exchange proprietary management data is inefficient, error-prone and inflexible.</p>



<p>PROMCODE was designed to address the need for systematic sharing of project management information within and between organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The TC received 3 Statements of Use from IBM, Fujitsu, and NEC [3].</p>



<p>The specification and related files are available here:</p>

 Reflecting on a decade of the Open Badges ecosystem <p>Today, a pre-recorded keynote panel conversation goes live to kick off the <a href="https://www.ic-badges-credentials.org/en/icobc-symposium">2021 International Council of Badges &amp; Credentials Symposium</a>. My interlocuters were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerrilemoie/">Kerri Lemoie</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/longpd/">Phillip Long</a> and we could have talked for&nbsp;hours!</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a><p>As I was preparing for this panel discussion, I made notes which turned into this post. Like any history written by someone who was part of the events, it is partial and personal. I will have missed out things both obvious and important.</p><p>You may also want to read <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reflecting-on-the-evolving-badges-and-credentials-ecosystem-6efac4d673d3">this post</a> published last week on the evolving badges and credentials ecosystem.</p> The development of standard can take a while to bear&nbsp;fruit <p>I can remember being excited about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a> when I found out about it in 1998, but it wasn’t until 10 years later that people were using it everyday for useful things like exchanging files or connecting devices.</p><p>So I realised that it would probably take a decade for Open Badges to become mainstream. It’s nice when <a href="https://medium.com/the-slackerati/why-the-future-remains-bright-for-open-badges-f09eb6ffe889">predictions</a> turn out to be correct! We’re now in the situation where badges are popping up everywhere, with hundreds of millions of them issued in the last couple of years&nbsp;alone.</p>CC BY-SA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle#/media/File:Gartner_Hype_Cycle.svg">Jeremy&nbsp;Kemp</a><p>I admit to being skeptical about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle">Gartner hype cycle</a> (see diagram above) when I first discovered it. However, it’s actually described the development of Open Badges pretty well over the last 10&nbsp;years!</p><blockquote>“Communications tools don’t get socially interesting until they get technologically boring,” (Clay&nbsp;Shirky)</blockquote><p>What follows isn’t just a nice story, it’s instructive in terms of how technologies develop, and indeed how important people are to the process. Technological development is not inevitable, nor is technology neutral. People make and shape it, making decisions along the way that can have far-reaching implications.</p> Technology Trigger (2011–13) <p>It’s worth remembering that badges are nothing new. Anyone who can remember pre-social media online interactions will remember badges in web forums. And, of course, badges in games have been around&nbsp;forever.</p><p>Some organisations were experimenting with digital badges before 2011, but these were siloed and easy to right-click and copy. The ‘technology trigger’, the innovation with Open Badges, was to invent and make available an open metadata standard.</p><p>This standard not only described the required and optional fields of information for the metadata, but also provided a way in which badges could be verified.</p>CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a><p>The initial work in this area was funded by the <a href="https://www.macfound.org/">MacArthur Foundation</a>, which funded a lot of the <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/">Mozilla Foundation</a>’s work around online learning in the early days. The original <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">white paper</a> explored four different learner scenarios and was widely interpreted, especially given the zeitgeist, to be supportive of thinking about a landscape in which we wouldn’t need universities anymore.</p><p>This proved to be a distraction, as innovation is rarely either/or but rather and/and. There was pushback in some quarters of formal education, especially in Higher Ed where there was much talk of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation and that nebulous term: “quality”.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/open_badges/">v1.0 release</a> of the Open Badges came in March 2013, with a lot of fanfare and was followed by the <a href="https://clalliance.org/resources/chicago-summer-of-learning-2013/">Chicago Summer of Learning</a> that year where thousands of badges were issued to young people in the city of&nbsp;Chicago.</p><p>Personally, I attended around 50 events that year as part of the Mozilla Open Badges team, popularising and explaining the possibilities. One of my first was the 2012 <a href="https://epic.openrecognition.org/">ePIC conference</a> which has been a galvanising force since that time in thinking about badges for recognition rather than just credentialing.</p> Peak of inflated expectations (2014) BadgeKit<p>Open Badges were on a roll and, to capitalise on this, the Badge Alliance was formed. Many of the Mozilla Open Badges team transferred over to the new organisation and work started in earnest on BadgeKit, a way that any organisation could set up and issue&nbsp;badges.</p><blockquote>2014 was a great building year for the badges ecosystem and the Badge Alliance (BA) network, and 2015 has been an exciting year so far. Rooms are overflowing for badging-related presentations at conferences around the world, more compelling use cases are popping up all the time, and the level of understanding and conversation about badges is far higher than two years ago. While the Badge Alliance has played a pivotal role in this progress, much of the work has come from the community itself.</blockquote><blockquote>The BA was created to grow the community and seat the ownership and accountability of the badging work in the ecosystem that was using badges. We’ve accomplished that — the BA has grown, with hundreds of organizations pledging to work together to issue and understand Open Badges. The first year of the BA’s investigation, community-building, and outreach provided us with a better understanding of the state of badges in the world, and connected a vibrant community around collaborating to use a shared technology. The momentum behind Open Badges has never been stronger.</blockquote><blockquote>(<a href="https://openbadges.tumblr.com/post/123556754619/the-badge-alliance-in-2015">Open Badges&nbsp;blog</a>)</blockquote><p>At the time, I was a co-chair of the Digital / Web Literacies Working Group at the Badge Alliance, but otherwise wasn’t directly involved in the day-to-day operations, having remained at the Mozilla Foundation to work on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/WebLiteracyMap">Web Literacy&nbsp;Map</a>.</p><p>It was pretty clear, though, that the hype around Open Badges — including talk about the ‘end of universities’ was greater than the technical ability for the badges ecosystem to develop. The technology needed to mature, and so <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nateotto">Nate Otto</a> took over from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erinknight">Erin Knight</a> as Executive Director to steer it in that direction.</p><p>It’s hard to underestimate the impact that Erin and the team she built had on the online learning landscape at the time. The team, never more than around 10 people, galvanised a community of thousands of technologists and educators into&nbsp;action.</p> Trough of disillusionment (2015–16) IMS Global Learning Consortium<p>I left Mozilla in April 2015 for the world of consultancy, working with <a href="https://www.cityandguilds.com/">City &amp; Guilds</a> and other organisations on Open Badges and projects around digital literacies. The narrative that was came out was that the Badge Alliance was only ever meant to be a temporary steward for the Open Badges standard before it found a new home at <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/">IMS Global Learning Consortium</a>.</p><p>Whatever the true story, there were severe headwinds as the MacArthur Foundation moved on to fund other initiatives. Nate was working at the Badge Alliance on top of his role on <a href="https://badgr.com/">Badgr</a>, and this was the time when the world was unreasonably excited about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a>. In fact, it got to the stage where, when presenting on badges, I’d have slides ready for the inevitable blockchain questions. I tried to explain that not every badge is high-stakes, and other problems blockchain can&nbsp;raise.</p><p>After a flurry of excitement about the possibilities of badges, people were a little bit at a loss as to what to do with them. We were in the trough of disillusionment. There were plenty of academic institutions experimenting with <a href="https://altc.alt.ac.uk/blog/2015/06/implementation-of-open-badges-in-education/">badges for staff CPD</a> but the assumption was that blockchain would fix credentialing. Initiatives such as MIT’s <a href="https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/what-we-learned-from-designing-an-academic-certificates-system-on-the-blockchain-34ba5874f196#.4m4bmwcm0">Blockcerts</a>, which were compatible with the Open Badges specification, got a limited amount of traction.</p> Slope of enlightenment (2017–19) <p>Thankfully, along with City &amp; Guilds, organisations started using badges in new and interesting ways. A perfect example of this is <a href="https://ibm.com">IBM</a> and, in particular David Leaser. Having run a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/ibm-training/open-badges-a-better-way-to-track-skills-and-accomplishments/">pilot in 2015</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/ibm-training/open-badges-vs-certifications-is-there-a-battle-brewing-in-the-it-credential-market/">introduced the first IBM badges</a> in 2016 for “resume-worthy activities,” by 2019 he was an advocate for Open Badges <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/ibm-training/badges-need-rigor-or-do-they-really/">not only for credentialing</a> but for recognition. In mid-2020, IBM <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/ibm-training/ibm-issues-its-three-millionth-digital-badge-and-disrupts-the-labor-market-in-the-process/">issued its three millionth badge</a> showing how quickly these things can&nbsp;scale.</p>IBM badges<p>Badges started popping up on LinkedIn, within email signatures, as well as being shared on resumes and CVs. These were often from professional associations such as the <a href="https://www.badges.sssc.uk.com/getting-started/what-you-need-to-know-about-open-badges/">SSSC</a>, who not only issued them for CPD activities, but for activities such as implementing the recommendations of an important resport within the care&nbsp;sector.</p><p>There was a growing recognition that badges were useful tools for marketing, for talent acquisition, and for team formation. Inevitably, organisations came together to standardise on frameworks within badges were issued, for example the European MOOC Consortium who established the <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/info/the-common-microcredential-framework">Common Microcredential framework</a>.</p><p>Building on this, and given the cost of university tuition and talk of a growing ‘skills gap,’ there emerged what has become known as the <a href="https://credentialasugo.org/">Credential As You Go</a> (CAYG) movement. CAYG focuses on incremental credentialing in an attempt rather than the all-or-nothing approaches of bachelor’s degrees and the&nbsp;like.</p><p>Open Badges not only began to be known by many different names but were also starting to be used in quite different situations.</p>Image from <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reflecting-on-the-evolving-badges-and-credentials-ecosystem-6efac4d673d3">Reflecting on the Evolving Badges and Credentials Ecosystem</a> Plateau of productivity (2020+) <p>The Covid-19 pandemic merely accelerated a process which was already underway. As we all worked and/or learned from home, there was a need for solutions which allow us to represent ourselves at a distance.</p><p>Whereas previously people would get in touch to discuss piloting badge programmes, the talk is now very much about adding them into to augment existing systems. For example, <a href="https://www.multiverse.io/en-GB">Multiverse</a> is an organisation “building an outstanding alternative to university and corporate training via professional apprenticeships”. They are an IMS-certified badge issuing platform, but are no a general-purpose issuer. Rather, they use Open Badges to add superpowers to their programmes.</p>Multiverse<p>The next step, which is the move to <a href="https://kayaelle.medium.com/the-future-of-open-badges-is-verifiable-bce27664a668">Open Badges 3.0</a> and alignment with the W3C’s Verifiable Credentials standard, will be an interesting one. Decentralised identifiers will do away with the need to issue to email addresses, and issuers can specify for the first time what kind of thing they are issuing due to alignment with the <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/about/clr">Comprehensive Learner Record</a> (CLR). For example, the CLR states whether something is an assignment, membership, a degree, or even a&nbsp;license.</p> Conclusion <p>The best way to predict the future, as the saying goes, is to invent it. So I’d like to thank all of the people who have, and are currently, working to make Open Badges into the force for change that it has become. I’ve already named some people by name, for example Kerri Lemoie and Nate Otto, but there are so many people who have been visible and active in the community over the decade, as well as those who have been quietly working away behind the&nbsp;scenes.</p><p>One of the reasons I got involved in Open Badges a decade ago was because I wanted a world where young people, including my own children, could choose whether to go to university. With development such as CAYG and providers such as Multiverse enabling professional apprenticeships, I feel that we’re getting&nbsp;there.</p><p>But more than that, I feel like Open Badges and the work around it is enabling a world where a much wider and more diverse set of skills are valued. And that’s got to be something worth celebrating! 🎉</p>Keep Badges Weird&nbsp;header<p>If you’d like to keep up-to-date with some of the latest developments around Open Badges, you may want to join the <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d">Keep Badges Weird</a> community.

 <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/an-open-security-ecosystem-with-shared-signals-is-the-future-of-zero-trust">An Open Security Ecosystem with Shared Signals is the Future of Zero Trust</a> 
<p>Author: Nancy Cam-Winget<br>
Publish Date: November 30, 2021</p>
<p>Zero Trust: as the name implies, is the strategy by which organizations trust nothing implicitly and verify everything continuously. This industry north star is driving different architectures, frameworks, and solutions to reduce an organization’s risk and improve their security posture.&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the need to enforce strong authentication and authorization to establish trust of an endpoint, how can we verify continuously? Often, the zero-trust approach today uses strong authentication and tools that evaluate the security of the user and device at the point of access, but what happens when the security posture of the user and device change after its initial access request is granted?</p>
<p>With many vendors offering impressive security capabilities in cybersecurity, there is a wealth of information that can be shared. Unfortunately, this information is fragmented and lacks standardization and thus interoperability. Getting all these best-in-class vendors to talk to each other is an expensive and time-consuming task, leaving organizations with disparate signal silos and a serious lack of visibility and control across their environment.</p>
<p>This is the problem the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/sse/#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20the%20Shared,operating%20in%20a%20dynamic%20environment.">OpenID Foundation’s Shared Signals and Events</a>&nbsp;working group is poised to address. For the unfamiliar, the OpenID Foundation is a non-profit organization that promotes open, interoperable standards with OpenID at its core, most notably the standardization of a simple identity layer on top of Oauth 2.0: OpenID Connect. The Shared Signals and Events working group lives within the OpenID Foundation and is comprised of industry leaders and innovators working to promote more open communication between systems. Shared Signals and Events standards like CAEP and RISC have the goal of enabling federated systems with well-defined mechanisms for sharing security events, state changes and other signals. This communication in turn simplifies interoperability and allows organizations to get closer to the Zero Trust ideal of continuously evaluating and enforcing security.</p>
<p>In its first ratified standard, the Shared Signals and Events working group created an open standard through which multiple services can communicate by publishing or subscribing relevant event streams. The standard drastically simplifies communication between applications with security context.&nbsp; For example, a cloud application might subscribe to events from an endpoint detection and response solution to quickly remove access from infected systems. Alternatively, an IAM solution might publish a change of user context used by a SIEM tool to start an investigation.&nbsp; An example shown below demonstrates how a device or an application performs an HTTPS service request in step 1 can trigger an update to a change in state to a policy server in step 2.&nbsp; Further, a policy service can determine whether that change in state needs to be broadcasted to other subscribers (step 3).&nbsp; A subscriber to that event can process the information and determine if a remediation response (step 4) is needed.</p>
<p>By communicating across an open and interoperable standard, we can move to a world where risk is assessed and addressed in real time.<br>
Risk assessment need not be done after static intervals of time but can move at the speed of contextual changes.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are excited to share that Cisco has joined the OpenID Foundation as a sustaining member, with the goal of contributing to the Shared Signals and Events ecosystem.</p>
<p>“Given Cisco’s pivotal role in building networked systems that underpin the internet today, we are honored to have Cisco join the Board at this critical inflection point in identity standards development,” said Gail Hodges, Executive Director of the OpenID Foundation. “Cisco is a&nbsp;long-standing&nbsp;contributor to global standards, and we look forward to collaborating to meet this moment by crafting the path and scaling an approach that will serve society.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a first step in our contribution to the open Shared Signals and Events ecosystem, we’ve published an&nbsp;<a href="https://sharedsignals.guide/">open-source technical&nbsp;reference</a>&nbsp;setting up the initial communication foundations.&nbsp;We hope that providing this reference will&nbsp;make it easier for developers and vendors alike to adopt&nbsp;more&nbsp;seamless communication&nbsp;mechanisms, with the eventual goal of enabling more robust and dynamic implementations of Zero Trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the same way that we believed the&nbsp;<a href="https://webauthn.guide/">WebAuthn standard</a>&nbsp;would underly the passwordless authentication revolution, we believe Shared Signals and Events will enable a sea change in security – moving from opaque and siloed environments to those empowered by openly shared signals.</p>
<p>At Cisco, we see a path forward where we can simplify the administration and collection of risk signals around access while simultaneously removing security friction to make security easy for everyone. It’s a future with far fewer unnecessary, rote re-authentications or authorizations and far more precise reactions to increased risk.&nbsp; While it won’t be tomorrow, we believe that the OpenID Foundation and groups like the Shared Signals Working Group are on the right track to enabling a more secure future. We are excited to share in the journey and contribute to this compelling new approach to security.</p>

 Virtual Event, 12-14 October 2021<br>  <br>What is the Internet Identity Workshop? <p>IIW is run as an “<a href="https://agilecrete.org/what-is-an-open-space-unconference/">Open Space un-Conference</a>”, designed to be a dynamic, participant-led 'marketplace of questions and topics', to foster conversation, networking and learning. Empowering everyone to speak, ask and present, this format takes partial inspiration from decentralized approaches to technology. Collectively, attendees set each day’s agendas, volunteering a mix of prepared presentations, open discussion, product demos and workshops. Hundreds of attendees, including a number of DIF members, put together a huge programme of content for the 33rd IIW, covering topics ranging from the technical minutiae of IAM and SSI to big-picture discussions about ethics and strategy, and participated in over 110 virtual sessions across the three days.</p><p>A book of proceedings, containing the notes from all of the sessions will be collated and published by IIW (back catalogue from previous IIWs <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops">here</a>, and a wiki of notes from individual sessions <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_33_Session_Notes">here</a>). Here we will overview a few of the topics discussed and sketch out some of the strong and weak signals discernible in the collective discussion. To that end, sessions are clustered thematically and not chronologically.</p> 101 Sessions <p>A staple of IIW, 101 Sessions are conceived as entry-level primers, often given by the same IIW veterans year after year, on various aspects of the digital identity landscape. They are designed to give participants a solid base from which to engage fully with the rest of the programme. 101 Session topics this year included OAuth2 101, UMA 101, OpenID Connect 101, with DIF’s own Chris Kelly and Karyl Fowler (Transmute, DIF Steering Committee) presenting an <a href="https://youtu.be/GWszMWmSLSQ">SSI 101 session on Self-Sovereign &amp; Decentralized Identity</a>.<br></p> Governance &amp; Ethics<br> <p>Informing the whole framing of this technical revolution is a broader, more conceptual sea change. Ever-popular themes for discussion include the ethical underpinnings of decentralized identity, and the increasing awareness of potential pitfalls.</p><p>The contours and workflows of identity in the digital age are largely molded by government regulations around privacy, security, and their historic interest as one of the main issuers of identification documents. For this reason, analyses of policy tendencies and direction are in close dialogue with the design of products and infrastructure, which has long been a hallmark of this particular unconference.</p> Ethics &amp; Equity <p>Identity veteran Adrian Gropper led an indefatigable series of sessions each focused on an interlocking important concern about how identity technologies change how we understand, exercise and protect fundamental human rights across a variety of systems with Human Rights Impact of Identity Protocols. Privacy, a pillar of the decentralized identity movement, got discussed in terms of the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/pimdl-v1-final-html/">Kantara Report</a>, at John Wunderlich’s Privacy Enhancing Mobile Credentials session.</p><p>User choice, data portability and consent also sparked lively discussions with Adrian Gropper and Alan Karp’s session on Policy Managers and John Phillips’ session on Designing for Consent. The ethics of making any of the above mandatory at DID Ethics &amp; Mandatory Vaccine Passports with Timothy Holborn to corona section?</p> Governance of SSI systems <p>The oversight and governance of the decentralized identity community got plenty of attention, as Open-Source organizations like DIF and ToIP introduced themselves and spoke about the work they facilitate. This discussion continued on the topic of Interop(erability) and where the appropriate venue is to continue this valuable work (Kai Wagner, Andreas Freitag, Hakan Yildiz, Eugineu Rusu). <br></p><p>Decentralized Identity tech also offers exciting new possibilities itself for governance, democracy, humanitarian aid and education, as discussed by Drummond Reed, cheqd’s Alex Tweeddale &amp; YOMA’s Nicky Hickman, imagining what the Future of Governance using these tools might look like. &nbsp;YOMA’s work on an interim <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UGUq6wuTrJH-TCkL7Fzw8cHqcFXMoQwK/edit">Governance Framework</a> in Africa, which is ultimately built on <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Governance+Metamodel+Specification">ToIP’s Governance Metamodel Specification</a>, was examined as one example.</p><p>The ongoing effort by the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition to get Verfiable Credentials (VCs) and trust frameworks recognized within Californian legislation was outlined by Kaliya Young and Ally Medina at Verifiable Credentials Policy Committee - &nbsp;Come Help us Pass a Trust Framework in California, identifying challenges and a path forwards towards greater legal and institutional acceptance for VCs.<br></p> Covid, Health, Travel<br> <p>Corona has been a driving force recently in the decentralized identity space, particularly with regard to health and vaccination records, as well as greatly affecting travel. How decentralized identity tech like smart contracts and DIDs can empower individuals and give them granular control over their health data was tackled in Elias Strehle’s session, entitled Controlling your medical data via DIDComm - discussion and feedback on our system architecture. <br></p><p>Building on this system architecture theme, and the challenge of how to deal with varying forms of data arriving from a variety of sources, was teased out at Semantic Interoperability with Layered Schemas and Semantic Pipelines with Burak Serdar, who invited us to test a live, interactive <a href="https://playground.layeredschemas.org/">Layered schema playground</a> that manipulates and edits the various layers as defined by metadata, and then rounding off by considering the implications of this for the storage of digital healthcare data.</p><p>Linux Foundation Public Health launched the Global COVID Certificate Network in June 2021 to enable interoperable and trustworthy verification of COVID certificates between jurisdictions, based on a global trust architecture. Lucy Yang and John Walker outlined the state of this initiative at Updates on the Global COVID Certificate Network, while they were also joined by Kaliyah Young for COVID Credentials: How to Meet the Market Where it is, to join community leaders of the COVID Credentials Initiative (CCI) reviewing the state of play and obstacles to adoption</p> VC-centric Technical sessions <p>Verifiable Credentials (VCs) were an inescapable topic at IIW33, both following up IIW32’s strong theme of roadmapping adoption of BBS+ signing systems for selective disclosure and more generally educating people about the <a href="https://www.lfph.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Verifiable-Credentials-Flavors-Explained.pdf">4 flavors of VCs</a> and how they interact.</p> Vc tooling and education <p>Sometimes the best thing to do is lead by example, and Kyle Den Hartog presented his Working with JSON-LD - Best practices and improvements (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16OTHsmxk_WQsbTfbIGkBUadpryMcSEeR/edit#slide=id.p4">DECK</a>) along with proof of concept code (<a href="https://github.com/kdenhartog/context-integrity">GitHub</a>) to demonstrate how handling JSON-LD data can be done elegantly. As a strong theme at the last two IIWs was that LD-VCs have a steep learning curve and require a 90-degree turn in many approaches to credentialing and data exchange, this will surely be remembered as one of the most useful and educational sessions of the conference.</p><p>At An Extended LDP-BBS 2020 and ZKP-LD Playground, Dan Yamamoto &amp; Kazue Sako dove even deeper into the operation of BBS+ protocols and zero-knowledge proofs. The tagteam recently forked Mattr’s BBS+ LD implementations and were presenting on strategies for handling the “multiple blank node” problem, a common stumbling block in signing over flattened graphs. Attendees were invited to a<a href="https://playground.zkp-ld.org/"> ZKP LD playground</a> to test their approaches.</p> Updates from the OIDF/DIF collaboration: <p>Kristina Yasuda, Torsten Lodderstedt started us off by considering generally Open ID Connect for SSI, examining some potential benefits, and comparing the typical OIDC flow to a more SSI-led Self-Issued OpenID Connect Provider (SIOP) model. Kristina and Torsten returned, this time joined by Oliver Terbu and Tobias Looker, to give us an insight into the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a> work towards a protocol suite for SSI at their session on VC Issuance using OpenID Connect, while considering the potential of the OpenID protocol and how it operates with existing frameworks luke FIDO 2 or Microsoft and Apple’s authentication methods.<br></p><p><br></p> Verifiable Credentials versus Mobile Driver’s Licenses (mDL) <p>Andrew Hughes (Ping Identity) did a series of sessions on Mobile Driving License AND Verifiable Credentials laying out the basics of mDocs (mobile driver's license) as currently released, including the OIDC/web transport specification, and how the data model and protocols could co-exist and whether they should. Discussion here was predominantly about <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO 18013-5</a>, a new ISO standard designed to primarily specify a driving license data models, protocols, and security models, which has led to renewed interest in digital forms of electronic ID (eID) credentials issued by and closely regulated by state identity authorities.</p> VC adoption vectors <p>No new technology can get off the ground without some consideration about how and where it gets adopted and implemented. Trinsic’s Ben Crockett kicked off with an overview of the global playing field, in his Global Verifiable Credential Adoption session. Newly-minted DIF members <a href="http://cheqd.io">cheqd</a> presented Payment rails, customisable commercial models and decentralised governance for SSI, which gave Fraser Edwards &amp; Alex Tweeddale a chance to examine roadblocks, in particular the lack of commercial models, in the adoption path for SSI models and payment systems. They rounded this off with cheqd’s vision of <a href="https://blog.cheqd.io/the-internet-identity-workshop-how-to-make-ssi-work-c3f2fe35b5c6">being the one to bridge this divide</a>.</p> The Universal Registrar and Friends <p>Longtime DIF insider Markus Sabadello introduced the IIW community to DanubeTech's new commercial offering <a href="http://godiddy.com">GoDiddy.com</a> (based squarely on two of DIF's oldest work items, the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver</a> (and <a href="https://uniregistrar.io/">Universal Registrar</a>), following the classic "hosted service, open-source self-hosting option" formula; DanubeTech also gave additional technical sessions about these work items. The Universal Resolver Work Item was recently folded <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/universal-resolver-calls-wrapup/">back into the main DIF Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>, where work continues. Markus was joined by Azeem Ahamed and Cihan Saglam to discuss DID Registration Architectures more generally, discussing considerations for working with CRUD methods while remaining architecture-neutral<br></p> Other Technical Sessions <p>Sam Curran led a session on-boarding interested community members to the protocol work being organized within and on top of DIDComm. The session was named Fantastic DIDComm Protocols, and How to Write Them because the focus was on DIDComm protocols as a <a href="https://didcomm.org/">community-driven toolkit</a> where sub-protocols and extensions are contributed organically by users, and users discuss design issues and implementation issues with one another in a forthcoming User Group, which provides an “outer circle” to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm Working Group</a> (which will continue on after the completion of the v2 specification to manage the iteration of the DIDComm and the related protocols in an IPR-protected venue).</p><p>The DIDComm reference implementations Session with Alex Scherbakov and Vyacheslav Gudkov gave newcomers to the space a crash-course on DIDComm v2 and DID:Peer, while extolling the virtues of reference implementations for emerging specifications. They also illustrated how basing these implementations on established libraries is important to ensure interoperability with a live <a href="https://github.com/sicpa-dlab/didcomm-demo">DIDComm demo</a>.</p><p>DIDComm was one primary use-case but not the only possible use case discussed by Oliver Terbu and Alen Horvat in a session called “LibP2P as transport layer,” which explored the possibilities of the DIDComm mediator networks and other lightweight infrastructure crucial to SSI systems being spun up in a peer-to-peer way. The <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p library</a>, which came out of the <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> stack for decentralized storage and has found a lot of adoption in blockchain for other peer-to-peer applications and communication transports, could end up being crucial as more infrastructure moves out of centralized clouds and into more organic distributed systems.</p><p><a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189992/Persistent+Compute+Objects">Picos</a> (persistent compute objects) are DIDComm-enabled agents supporting SSI. Picos, DIDComm, and Decentralized SSI Agencies from Phil Windley explores the potential of these microservices, aligned with many of the design goals of decentralized identity, and how they could function as nodes for a scalable Internet of Things (IoT) model.<br></p> DID AuthN WG without DIDs <p>Surprisingly, one of the best-attended sessions at this IIW wasn’t about the DID/VC stack at all, but rather about the Ethereum stack so central to the work of Consensys, Affinidi, Ceramic, and many other DIF members. As part of a <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum/">grant</a> from the Ethereum Foundation and in collaboration with the Ethereum Name Service (a registrar for linking ethereum addresses to a DNS-like record system), Spruce has been been driving a design process for Sign-In With Ethereum informed by community calls to harmonize how relying parties within the Ethereum community request an “off-chain signature” to log into services and create sessions. Both chairs of DIF’s DID Authentication WG (which has not been holding regular meetings while focusing on the Authentication aspects of the DIF/OIDF specification work) have been participating, as have DIF members Ceramic; <a href="https://login.xyz/">work is ongoing</a> and an alpha release will be available soon.</p> User Journeys &amp; Product Thinking <p>Strategies For Bridging to Next-Generation Identity Systems (from the bottom up) from David Schmudde outlined some potential solutions to e-commerce challenges using VCs, OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC). Conversations and topics arising at each IIW often make a reappearance at a later session, and Phil Wolff’s UX: continuing the mid-2021 IIW UX conversation, revisited a UX design session held at IIW32 in April of this year. A unified tech framework ideally needs to be complimented by a common visual language, as well as a standardized way of describing the tools and processes involved.</p> Devices &amp; users <p>Considering end-users’ experiences and which devices they use to access new technology is also incredibly important. To this end, IIW co-founder Doc Searls, along with Joyce Searls and Johannes Ernst hosted User Stories for the VRM Intention Byway. <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">The Intention Byway</a> presents an alternative vision for how buyers and sellers in a decentralized marketplace can reach one another with their offerings. Bridging Digital and Physical to Make Identifiers Identify by Liam McCarty discussed both the technical challenges between varying device types, while underscoring the need for consumer, community and business interest in decentralized tech to attain widespread adoption and trust.<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explosive-growth-smart-homes-internet-135745356.html"> IoT and Smart Homes add to the growing number of entities online</a> that will need an ‘identity’, and digital assistants as mediator for ‘communal computing was outlined by Chris Butler at Is the smart home a dictatorship, co-op, or homesteading?</p> Organizational Bread-breaking <p>At Time is Running Out - Get to Market: revenue, costs and who pays for what, Kimberly Linson argues that without a convincing business case, adoption of new tech may be slow or even stall, and the financial cost of implementation needs to be borne by someone. Phil Wolff hosted VC Metaphors - Containers and ? to discuss how we can agree on a common language around this emerging technology and how it can be easily presented to policy-makers, customers and businesses alike. In a similar vein, Kaliyah Young used two separate sessions dedicated to Explainers Needed to host an open discussion about where the knowledge or vocabulary gaps are around decentralized identity tech, and how and where we should fill them. The huge number of ideas to come out of these sessions will provide a wealth of informational content for the sector, important for making it cohesive and accessible.</p><p>Karim Stekelenburg, James Ebert and Timo Glastra used Taking the adoption of SSI to the next level to discuss how this conversation also needs to extend to developers, who may not necessarily already be involved in the digital identity space. Ample documentation, open-source communities and extendable functionality of frameworks were just some of the resources name-checked to make the sector welcoming beyond the enthusiasts and dedicated groups seen at spaces like IIW. Illustrated use-cases, specifically one based on Aries and written in JavaScript was highlighted for using familiar, stable and well-documented APIs to improve accessibility. <br></p> Other User-Centric Data Orgs <p>Lisa LeVasseur, at Identification Minimization and other Respectful Tech Principles, explored how decentralized identity solutions can offer increased security, privacy and anonymity. The discussion centered around minimizing user data collection, under the umbrella idea of ‘respectful’ tech design principles, as outlined by the <a href="https://ooqc943yvdw4abzes1q1ezta-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/intro-me2b-spec-iis-101321.pdf">Me2B Alliance’s Attributes for Respectful Me2B Commitments</a>. Lisa returned with Scott Mace to introduce attendees to the IEEE P7012 working group at Privacy Signal Standard Update (<a href="https://standards.ieee.org/project/7012.html">IEEE P7012</a>), the standard for machine readable personal privacy terms. Again, Lisa shared a framework out of the Me2B Alliance to illustrate how P7012 can matter in the arc of a digital relationship, such as between an individual and a web site.<br></p> ToIP <p>Judith Fleenor presented an Introduction To Trust Over IP, introducing <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>, and reviewing their first year as part of the digital identity community, focussing on not only the technical questions around decentralized identity, but also accountability on the legal, business and social impact layers. Neil Thomson gave an overview of one cluster of related work items at ToIP entitled VCs Meet Reality: Custom VC Evaluation with Privacy that went into the weeds on the nuances of progressive disclosure and privacy considerations of complex, real-world use-cases involving sensitive personal data requiring consent receipts and the like. This work was partly done in the context of the Brussels-funded <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/essif-lab/">ESSIF-LAB incubator</a> project, which allowed European startups (many of them DIF members) to collaborate on privacy and regulatory compliance issues specific to the European context.<br></p> Next Steps <p>Many thanks and much praise to the dedicated team at IIW for running a virtual event of this scale, and providing a virtual venue for such vibrant exchanges and discussion. As always, the conversations at IIW are like games of jump-rope: you can jump in and out at any time with a little tact and coordination. Many of these conversations happen at DIF, or have touchpoints with DIF that give periodic updates at DIF meetings, and the upcoming DIF Face-to-Face in early 2022 will include major updates from many of these. In particular, DIF’s <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/productmanagers">community of practice</a> for Product Managers and UX professionals is actively seeking discussion topics and presentations to keep the momentum going between IIWs and DIF F2Fs, so do <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/groups">join the mailing list</a> and reach out if you’d like to discuss product ideas, user stories, and UX quandaries. As always, the best way to keep up-to-date, gain insight and learn-while-doing is to <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/">get involved directly</a> with the open-source decentralized identity community.</p>

 Working on the digital vision for Julie’s&nbsp;Bicycle <p><a href="https://juliebicycle.com">Julie’s Bicycle</a> is a non-profit helping organisations in the arts and culture sector understand their carbon footprints. They’ve created a unique set of tools, the <a href="https://ig-tools.com/login">Creative Green Tools</a>, as well as many high-impact programmes specifically to support the creative&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Over the last months, our vision for the digital transformation and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/climate-change-for-the-better-457134bd0b43">strategic direction</a> for Julie’s Bicycle (JB) has solidified. We are pleased to note that not only have we assisted Julie’s Bicycle in hiring their first ever Product Lead, we’ve also established a pathway and guideposts designed to help JB achieve a digital vision that will put them squarely in the column of digital leader for the climate&nbsp;crisis.</p> External vision <p>It should come as no surprise that We Are Open is encouraging JB to become an open organisation (<a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/open-course/">we do this all the time!</a>). We are advising they move forward with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service#OpenSaaS">OpenSaaS</a> model and pair it with a community strategy in which they fly the flag of openness together with environmentalism.</p><p>The external development piece of this strategy details the community-driven approach and processes that will help Julie’s Bicycle grow strategically and sustainably. Key to this development is embedding the open approach, which will help JB bring its existing audience and help them to leverage community in ways which would significantly augment opportunities for Julie’s&nbsp;Bicycle.</p>how the different pieces of the community interact. cc-by We Are Open&nbsp;Co-op<p>We’ve used JB’s theory of change to create three distinct design principles for the digital work JB has on the horizon. With creativity, sustainability and solidarity, JB will design its tools and resources together with and for the cultural community. The “Creative Climate Digital Platform” will connect and make visible all climate action taking place in the cultural sector for advocacy and communications. This will enable users to communicate climate action and campaign/advocate to their own creative communities.</p><p>We will create an intersection between climate activism and technology by engaging with and inside of the Open Source community, and we will use these associations to foster peer to peer knowledge exchange, collaborative problem-solving, an opportunity to use and improve tools and resources and leadership in the climate tech&nbsp;space.</p>cc-by We Are Open&nbsp;Co-op<p>The overarching objectives for the community are&nbsp;to:</p>  Enable peer to peer knowledge sharing so that we are making all creative climate action visible, profiling emerging and established sector experts, encouraging collaborative problem-solving and leadership, supporting people to connect with each other and learn new and best practices, and co-create new knowledge with the sector directly.  Make visible the global creative response to the climate challenge, enabling a coherent advocacy tool and a joined-up approach to creative climate action across the&nbsp;world.   Internal Vision <p>As an open mindset is not something that can be delivered by an Openness team but should be embedded across the organisation, we’ve created an internally focused strategy to help JB integrate the necessary tools and processes. This way of working will open new doors for staff as well as for external collaborators and partnerships.</p><p>We started by looking at the systems they use (e.g. a ‘<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/content-is-king-queen-and-everything-inbetween-3c2fc4b1e19c">System Ecosystem</a>’) and thinking about ways digital could augment and support collaboration inside the organisation. We are considering the overlap between internal work practices and external engagement and planning for the remix and reuse of documentation for the good of the external strategy. We’re also advising on software choices that can help JB staff manage the complexity of JB’s work, both now and in the&nbsp;future.</p>cc-by We Are Open&nbsp;Co-op<p>We know that our way of working is becoming more common, but there are peculiarities in the world of non-profit that have to be taken into account when doing digital transformations towards openness. Though still works in progress, we are establishing the groundwork to help JB staff learn about open principles and practices. We are preparing ourselves for a deeper engagement on these topics in&nbsp;2022.</p> Next year <p>We are pleased that JB is eager to continue working with us and are thus beginning to write phase plans for 2022. On the tools side of things, we are still collaborating closely with our friends at <a href="https://outlandish.coop">Outlandish</a>. Together we will be supporting JB as the organisation begins its journey through the double diamond and into the world of open&nbsp;source.</p><p>Wondering how We Are Open can help your organisation on the path to digital transformation? <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">Get in&nbsp;touch</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-and-creative-climate-platform-116640a62132">Open and Creative Climate platform</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Technical and philosophical differences around recognition Image CC BY We Are Open&nbsp;Co-op<p>Recently, the WAO team took the opportunity to update the <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/Badge_platforms">badge platforms page</a> on Badge Wiki, a knowledgebase for the Open Badge community. As the ecosystem continues to evolve we’re seeing some early platforms fall by the wayside and new platforms emerge. This is to be expected after a decade of maturity.</p><p>The image at the top of this post is a simple visual explanation of how the ecosystem is changing as we move towards version 3.0 of the Open Badges standard. It builds on work by <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/File:Badges-and-credentials.png">Don Presant</a>, which itself builds upon work by <a href="https://clalliance.org/blog/taking-another-look-at-the-digital-credentials-landscape/">our&nbsp;members</a>.</p> Let’s define&nbsp;terms   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> — “an open standard for digital credentials. They can represent information found in physical credentials, such as a passport or license, as well as new things that have no physical equivalent, such as ownership of a bank account.” In other words, Verifiable Credentials can be used for pretty much anything from something showing you turned up to an event, through to your passport or driving&nbsp;license.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Open_Badges">Open Badges</a> — a “standard [which] describes a method for packaging information about accomplishments, embedding it into portable image files as a digital badge, and establishing an infrastructure for badge validation.” In other words, a visual, provable way to represent a skill, relationship, or identity.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_badge">Digital Badges</a> — “a validated indicator of accomplishment, skill, quality or interest that can be earned in various learning environments.” In other words, a visual image which represents something on a platform. It may or may not be based on a standard which makes sense outside of that platform.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdegree">Microcredentials</a> — “a qualification [focused on] a specified professional or career discipline and typically comprises one or more sources of accelerated educational experiences.” In other words, an ‘umbrella’ term used mainly in Higher Education to refer to new forms of recognition of learning.  <a href="https://www.openrecognition.org/">Open Recognition</a> — the use of Open Badges and other technologies “to build an open and learning society, based on the recognition of the talents, skills and aspirations of individuals, communities and territories.” In other words, using badges in ways that are different to using them only as ‘credentials’.   What’s the technical difference? <p>Open Badges and Digital Badges are both visual. Without some kind of image to represent them, they do not exist. Verifiable Credentials, on the other hand, may use images, but do not have to. This changes how they can be used, and how they are likely to be used. Organisations may choose to validate skills in a way akin to a database rather than an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_portfolio">eportfolio</a>.</p><p>Another difference is with the underlying metadata standard. Version 3.0 of the Open Badges standard aligns with the Verifiable Credentials standard, with both providing a way to validate authenticity. The great thing about the move to Verifiable Credentials is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifiers">decentralised identifers</a> can be used (as well as email addresses) to identify recipients. This is much more sustainable in the long term, and foreshadows developments that we’ll see around digital identify before&nbsp;2030.</p> What about Microcredentials and Open Recognition? <p>Universities and colleges deal in ‘credentials’ so the word ‘microcredential’ is attempt by post-compulsory formal education to make sense of the new world of recognition and credentialing.</p><p>A ‘microcredential’ is simply a friendly term for something which is technically identical to an Open Badge, <a href="https://www.blockcerts.org/">Blockcert</a> (Open Badge on the blockchain), digital certificate, or any other form of representing achievement. A microcredential is not a separate technical standard.</p><p>Likewise, Open Recognition is not a separate technical standard but rather a philosophical position about the nature of recognition in society. It continues the aim for ‘lifelong learning’ that was embedded in the original <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">Mozilla Open Badges whitepaper</a>, and is somewhat at odds with the idea of a ‘credential’.</p><p>Instead of credentials being bestowed upon individuals by institutions, Open Recognition seeks to “create the conditions for individuals to be in control of their own recognition, to establish their identity and agency, whether formally (within institutions) or informally (across communities).”</p><p>Some in the Open Recognition community are concerned about the move to align Open Badges v3.0 with the Verifiable Credentials standard. For example, in the <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d">Keep Badges Weird community</a> (a project WAO is working on with <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>), Serge Ravet comments:</p><blockquote>Do VCs provide a significantly better answer to the “currency” of a claim than Open Badges? I remain to be convinced. IMO, Open Badges are good enough, and as the old saying goes: if it’s ain’t broken don’t fix&nbsp;it!</blockquote><p>Philippe Petitqueux goes further, wondering whether a move from human-based trust to machine-based ‘trust’ is worthwhile:</p><blockquote>Badges are a medium to make visible a lot of things, including aspirations, passions, talents, commitments, resources, skills, recognitions…if you want to use verification functions for certifications, why don’t you use the VC without putting badges in it, or use a blockchain. An Open Badge should live, not gather dust in a&nbsp;drawer.</blockquote><blockquote>And if a badge is fake, it’s up to the humans to say so, the humans in the community of practice or professional who can spot a crook. That’s what endorsements are for. It’s amazing that in open badge projects, especially American ones, I don’t see any use of endorsements. Why is that? But I don’t know every project and I could be&nbsp;wrong.</blockquote><p>Philippe’s comparison of the system he knows best (in France/Europe) compared to the “American ones” is telling. Different countries and cultures have varying expectations when it comes to education, skills development, and the recognition of learning.</p> Summary <p>So far, Open Badges up to v2.1 of the standard has accommodated a wide variety of use cases. The move to v3.0 is a decisive move towards the ‘credentials’ end of the spectrum, perhaps to the detriment of those seeking to focus on ‘recognition’.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Verifiable Credentials can eventually help represent the entire spectrum of use cases which has enabled the Open Badges community to flourish. The challenge here is partly technical, but it’s also philosophical: what does it mean to represent yourself&nbsp;online?</p><p>Why not <a href="https://app.participate.com/discussions/open-badges-3-0/68917656-db8f-4932-88fd-153fdb54e285">join the discussion</a> in the Keep Badges Weird community and share your thoughts?</p><p>Badge texture image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reflecting-on-the-evolving-badges-and-credentials-ecosystem-6efac4d673d3">Reflecting on the Evolving Badges and Credentials Ecosystem</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>GHP Guardianship Blog<br>John Phillips and Jo Spencer</p>



 Does international travel only ever involve independent adults? 



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for trusted sharing of verifiable data and the use of digitally-enhanced credentials. Check-in apps may or may not be a temporary requirement whilst we get on top of the pandemic, but the need to present a combination of tickets, visas, identity “documents” and vaccination certificates has always been a challenge for travel and other scenarios. The more you have to show, and the more complex the rules that need to be applied, the more complicated it becomes for all involved. The need to “open-up” safely and support domestic and international travel, as vaccinations roll out widely, gives us the opportunity and need to consider how best to build trusted travel information sharing solutions based on global standards, open software and governed participants and rules.</p>



<p>One of the realizations and perspectives resulting from nearly 2 years of work on guardianship (for minors or adults who need care) is that our societies and economies are not made of independent adults alone, and yet that is all too often an implicit assumption in the way we design and build solutions using digital interactions. Having come to this realisation, we now see this challenge everywhere that digital solutions and interactions are proposed. We need to consider how best to provide support for dependent minors and adults and their guardians in travel, as we should for all affordances in human life.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://lnkd.in/gfwuM-qi">Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint</a> is an international effort of more than 120 people from many organizations and countries. A few months ago, we (Jo Spencer and John Phillips) were asked by chairs working on the Blueprint to write an addendum for guardianship to consider how travel for accompanied and unaccompanied minors and adult dependents might best be enabled with digital health and travel passes.</p>



<p>After several months of work, incorporating the team from the Sovrin Guardianship Working Group and others, with valuable insights from several airlines and people working with International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Guardianship addendum is ready for formal publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can download the&nbsp;<a href="https://live-trustoverip.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GHP-Guardianship-Addendum.pdf">Addendum PDF</a>&nbsp;directly or find it on our&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/deliverables/">Tools &amp; Specifications page</a>.</p>



<p>The GHP Blueprint provides a comprehensive framework for the processes of registration, credential construction and travel planning catered to the use of digital and physical verifiable credentials. However the first release doesn’t cater for supported travel and the resulting process and credential implications.</p>



<p>Travel by accompanied and unaccompanied dependents is all too often not considered by designers – it’s not part of the ‘normal’ flow. A minor consequence of this is poor journey experiences and inconvenience for the carers and their dependents, the major consequence is that it exposes vulnerable people to exploitation and travel companies to risk and liability.</p>



<p>The addendum looks to add value into the GHP Blueprint in the consideration of supported travel. It uses the approach and “mental model” developed within the Sovrin Guardianship Working Group and articulated in the ESSIF-Lab Framework&nbsp;<a href="https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-pattern-list">Mental Models</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The expectation expressed in the addendum is that as travel restrictions are eased, we will see a large up-tick in family travel and hence addressing the need for parents holding digital and digitally-enabled credentials was worth addressing. During the development of the addendum it became obvious that existing processes and practices followed by airlines and others are often informal and most written considerations are aimed at the specific case of travelling minors (rather than travelling dependent adults). The use of digital credentials would need to be able to add levels of trust into the process of registration-departure-travel-arrival and provide practical enhancement and efficiencies, without creating a burden. Current transit processes are generally not focused on providing proof of guardianship statuses, even for unaccompanied travel scenarios.</p>



<p>Applying the developed models of guardianship, using the flexibility of Verifiable Credentials and the trusted mechanisms of sharing VCs, can provide the ability to add guardianship credentials into the travel process (or not) without breaking the existing approach and complicating the technical details defined in the Blueprint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In future releases of the Blueprint, we’ll look to incorporate considerations of supported travel and guardianship throughout the Blueprint. For now, the addendum provides an overview of the implications and insights into how accompanied and unaccompanied travel scenarios can be enhanced, efficient and trusted.</p>

  <p>Currently available technology enables global trade to become fully digital. To support this, technical standards must be created, and rules and legislation must be harmonized internationally. Public administrations are to invest in digitalization to the same extent as those trading and also the numerous service providers around trade. The outcome will be promising,  but one success factor is close collaboration between the various players.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bpb.de/nachschlagen/zahlen-und-fakten/globalisierung/52543/entwicklung-des-warenhandels">volume of globally produced goods and services</a> has approximately doubled in the past 30 years and trade has more than tripled. Many areas of production and trade have been digitized, but in the absence of a universal approach to digital networking, siloed systems have been implemented, creating countless ‘digital islands’. Data is still transferred between the participants’ computer systems on printed documents or as unstructured PDFs. This burden is caused by the lack of interoperability and needs to be overcome, if the potential of digitalization is to be fully leveraged, and to change processes to become safer, more reliable, more sustainable and less expensive. Addressing this challenge would also support preventing criminal or dubious business practices, such as trade-based money laundering, fraud or sustainability claims which are difficult to verify. It will also serve to make trade finance a great deal more accessible to SMEs and so help to close the so-called ‘trade finance gap’ and would also spur sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>Over the same period of time, the past 30 years, information and communications technology has developed very dynamically. While home computers were expensive in the early 1990s and mobile phones were luxury goods, smartphones are now the global standard. Almost all of the performance parameters of these handheld computers exceed those of the supercomputers of the 1990s at drastically reduced energy consumption. The miniaturization and integration of circuits now allows networked sensors and actuators to be connected to machines and everyday objects, which are also becoming increasingly available everywhere. This is the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). Machines ‘talk’ to each other and also interact via smartphones, wearables or voice commands with humans. Ubiquitous computing has become a reality. Data processing can now happen everywhere, at all times and for all purposes!</p>
<p>Again, over the same period, internet and <a href="https://www.dstgb.de/Publikationen/Dokumentationen/Nr.%20148%20-%20Mobilfunk%20-%20Gestern%20-%20Heute%20-%20Morgen/Doku_148_mobilfunk_030518.pdf?cid=6eo">mobile networks</a> have developed just as rapidly. While the focus at the start of digital mobile communications was still on voice transmission, this is now a marginal quantitative event, accounting for less than 1% of the data volume generated in the networks. Data transfers predominate, connectivity speeds and data amounts per month are being sold, the call minute has become obsolete as a billing unit. High quality mobile networks have been commissioned on a global scale. <a href="https://gulfnews.com/special-reports/how-satellites-could-revolutionise-high-speed-internet-for-the-unconnected-know-the-benefits--and-risks-1.1623153273647">Satellite constellations</a> are being put in the sky and will complement mobile networks to entirely close existing connectivity gaps. Every point on the earth’s surface will be networked with high bandwidth and low latencies. Production facilities in Germany, copper mines in Zambia, container ships in the middle of the Pacific and aircrafts flying over China or Brazil will as a result become participants in a continuous data exchange. </p>
<p>This data exchange, running everywhere, at any time and for any purpose can be called ubiquitous networking. Through combining ubiquitous computing and ubiquitous networking, endpoints for human interaction with processes modelled in software become available everywhere. Also machine to machine interactions, more precisely between the software processes running on them, become available everywhere and at any time.</p>
<p>Decentralized business networks, DLT, IoT, AI</p>
<p>The administration of foreign trade takes place within a multitude of systems, most of which are operated in the data centers of trade participants and their service providers. Paper or paper substitutes with poorly structured data are still used in most instances to transfer data between systems. A PDF file is an example of a paper substitute. Although this file is generated and transmitted digitally, it often only replaces the slow mail delivery and does not readily support programmed end-to-end processes. Also the providers of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have insufficiently addressed this challenge so far. Although datasets can be exchanged between the ERP systems of sellers and buyers, this scenario seems to lack technical standards or “neutral ground”. Often data transmissions entail a legal background, for which time stamps are desired along with a legally binding signature. The development of <a href="https://www.tradefinanceglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Periodic-Table-WTO-TFG-DLT-Trade-2020.pdf">distributed business networks</a>, featuring a certain degree of decentralization and being located between ERP systems may close this gap.</p>
<p>In the future, decentralized business networks will serve as orchestration means for most complex business processes between stakeholders and service providers. Business interactions related to financial services, logistics services, insurance, customs clearance, inspection certification, certifying origin and other required services can be undertaken within these distributed systems. Required data will be entered into and retrieved from these networks. This will obsolete re-keying of data and data quality will increase as a consequence. For most service providers in the supply chains, decentralized networks may become the primary point of sale. </p>
<p>Generally, the networks are underpinned by a distributed ledger, which restricts system entries to consensus based append only mode, on the basis of predetermined, programmed rules. This creates ‘technical trust’ and will allow the automation of cross-organizational business processes on an unprecedented scale. Smart contracts determine the agreed rules and defined procedures for business processes in code and will be programmed across company boundaries.</p>
<p>A number of technical standards and protocols already exist for exchanging data between different networks, the participants’ back-office systems and the environment’s IoT data sources and sinks. Others are in the design stage and are being developed. The end-to-end use of ISO standards and compliance with United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) <a href="https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/tf_recommendations">recommendations</a> is becoming a prominent quality feature of trading systems. Certification of the standard conformity of these systems may become a service. Extensive data permeability between the networks is the goal, and zero configuration scenarios may become a possibility through standardization. Efficient access to data facilitates the use of artificial intelligence alongside prescriptive and predictive analytics. Use cases could be around fraud deterrence, meeting regulatory obligations without effort, and enabling promising big data based applications. Paper as a means of data sharing will be considered old fashioned and eventually become obsolete. Or even suspicious. But how will the wet ink signatures look like in this new world? How will a data transfer or a data based transaction become legally valid?</p>
<p>Digital identities</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">Digital identities</a> for organizations, people, objects and software processes will be means to grant access rights to numerous systems and networks and to the transactions managed on them. Directory services, which today assign role based access privileges in software systems, and regulate access to organizations' resources and services, will gradually be replaced by external services for digital identities, and so migrate into the decentralized space between the companies. Roles and privileges will in this way be exposed in a programmable and verifiable way to the outer world, into a fabric of digitally rendered services. </p>
<p>In simple terms, a digital identity consists of one <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">identifier</a> (or many) and several <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a> attached to it. Both components have been extensively standardized by the W3C. As the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a company’s globally unique identifier it will serve well as root of an organization’s identity. The verifiable Legal Identifier will allow to amend the LEI by verifiable credentials, some of which can grant an organization’s employee access to transactions in third-party systems. The verifiable credentials granting access or certifying facts are digitally signed by those granting or certifying, and hence programmatically verifiable by the stakeholders of the respective transactions by means of software processes This can therefore take place  automatically, reliably and audited.   </p>
<p>An example from the field of digital identities illustrates this: To process a letter of credit, a bank will need to access several business networks in which the purchase order, commercial invoice, bill of lading and certificate of origin are all digitally recorded. The access rights to the respective transactions in these third-party systems will be transferred into the bank’s digital identity as a set of verifiable credentials as soon as the buyer specifies in a B2B-network or letter of credit network that the bank has been commissioned to issue the letter of credit pertaining to the transaction. The bank may then delegate the access right to these datasets to its employees involved in the process, by transferring a corresponding verifiable credential into their personal digital identity. This will allow the bank’s employees or even the bank’s software autonomous processes to act on their behalf.</p>
<p>The transaction conducted by means of a digital identity relies on an X.509 certificate, which is part of a chain of trust that ends at the trust root. The authorization and authenticity of the transaction carried out by these means is cryptographically guaranteed and is likely to be covered in Germany by the eIDAS implementing act and the legal directives issued for this purpose. Equivalent regulations in non-European legal areas would be necessary and should be asserted, produced and enacted.</p>
<p>Creating network effects</p>
<p>Similar questions about ‘statutory congruence’ arise when using electronic records for trade documentation. Little progress can be made if the use of electronic records for bills of lading and consignment bills is legally admissible in the exporting country, while the importing country enforces a fallback to expensive and slow paper processes for legal reasons. The legal basis for doing business in globally strung networks should be standardized. In 2017 the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) presented a proposal for national laws to be adapted, the <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records">ML-ETR</a>, i.e to cater for globally harmonized legislation on the transfer of property titles securitized in negotiable trade instruments.</p>
<p>The vision of an internet of trade also requires considerable joint efforts on a technical level to become a reality. Technical standards ensure interoperability and should be jointly developed and also deflated where several existing standards compete for the same purpose. A technical commercial language of uniform vocabulary, semantics and syntax is desirable as it would significantly ease, cheapen and accelerate the interlinking of the multitude of systems and networks. An example is the core business vocabulary in the <a href="https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/docs/casestudies/gs1_epcis_source_to_shelves.pdf">EPCIS standard from GS1</a>.</p>
<p>Trading parties and their service providers, such as banks, insurers, logistic service providers and inspectors are facing major changes. These will impact internal IT and process landscapes, qualifications of employees involved in trading processes and products offered. Public administrations and customs authorities should play a leading role in this process and ideally set a global course. <a href="https://peppol.eu/about-openpeppol/history-of-openpeppol/">Peppol</a> is a European example for this.</p>
<p>The ICC has taken up the role as a global convenor of the numerous standardization bodies working towards these goal. The <a href="http://dsi.iccwbo.org/">ICC Digital Trade Standards Initiative</a> has started operations in mid 2020.</p>
<p>The changes will be so sweeping that even large organizations and enterprises will not be able to make a difference on their own. To create a network of networks and realize the full potential of  network effects, all parties must cooperate in a coopetion effort. COVID-19, besides being a regrettable misery for many, has worked as an unprecedented accelerator for global digitalization efforts.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>World trade will become almost entirely digitalized and networked in the course of the next decade. Siloed systems and paper-based documentation are becoming increasingly sidelined and will soon be deemed in arrears. From the convergence of different technologies, a nervous system of the world economy is emerging and is about to be woven with ever increasing density.</p>
<p>The ability to participate digitally in commercial trade is becoming critical and requires companies to embrace new processes and skills. Public administrations should seize the opportunitiy and rapidly progress their digitalization efforts and promote technical standards. Global cooperation among the large variety of stakeholders around trade is required.</p>

 Me2B Alliance Awarded $100K Grant for US Pre-K-12 Benchmark&nbsp;to Research School Utility Apps’ Data Sharing 
 Internet Society Foundation grant strengthens Me2B Alliance’s efforts to&nbsp;uncover how mandated technology is treating sensitive student data 
<p>November 23, 2021 09:00 ET | Source: <a href="https://me2ba.org">Me2B Alliance</a> </p>
<p>SAN DIEGO, Nov. 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — <a title="Me2B Alliance" href="https://me2ba.org">Me2B Alliance</a>, a non-profit standards and advocacy organization focused on safe and respectful technology, today announced that it has been awarded a $100,000 grant by the Internet Society Foundation. The foundation funds initiatives that strengthen the Internet in function and reach so that it can effectively serve all people.</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance will utilize the grant to complete its “U.S. EdTech Industry Benchmark: Data Sharing in Primary &amp; Secondary School Mobile Utility Apps.” The research aims to raise awareness about harmful data sharing practices by uncovering how sensitive student information is being treated by school utility apps in grades pre-k through 12.</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance strives to bring everyday people (Me-s) into its Safe and Respectful Tech Specification development process so that the voice of Me-s drives the definition of safe and respectful technology. Me2BA’s mission is to create a safe and just digital world through standards development and independent testing&nbsp;of technology. The Internet Society Foundation grant will help validate Me2BA’s work toward ensuring that the Internet is safe, and the products produced for use on the Internet such as apps and websites, are trustworthy and respectful.</p>
<p>Children in grades pre-k through 12 are among the most vulnerable Internet users. They are often obligated to use web-connected tools, including school utility apps, for day-to-day communication. Without proper standards in place, these children are susceptible to privacy risks.</p>
<p>The risks to children and parents are real. Earlier this year the Me2B Alliance Product Testing team audited and analyzed a random sample of mobile applications used by 38 U.S. schools in 14 states. <a title="The analysis" href="https://me2ba.org/school-mobile-apps-student-data-sharing-behavior/">The analysis</a> found that the majority (60%) of school apps were sending student data to a variety of third parties without the knowledge of the students, parents or even the school. 58% of the third parties receiving data were high risk advertising and analytics entities.</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance’s “U.S. EdTech Industry Benchmark: Data Sharing in Primary &amp; Secondary School Mobile Utility Apps” will build on those previous findings by expanding its scope to include schools across the nation. The expected outcome is to reaffirm that school&nbsp;utility&nbsp;apps&nbsp;are,&nbsp;in fact, abusing the privacy of students&nbsp;and parents&nbsp;across the U.S.&nbsp;by rampantly&nbsp;sharing&nbsp;personal&nbsp;information&nbsp;with multiple third-party vendors.</p>
<p>The research will identify current common practices by school utility apps relating to several factors, including:</p>
 
 How much data sharing with third parties is&nbsp;occurring 
 Who student data is being shared with 
 What kind of data is being shared 
 If privacy&nbsp;policies are accurately reflecting&nbsp;the&nbsp;observed&nbsp;behavior 
 
<p>In selecting the Me2B Alliance’s application for funding, the Internet Society Foundation acknowledges that Me2BA’s work is in line with the Foundation’s efforts to ensure that the Internet is open, globally connected, secure, and trustworthy.</p>
<p>“We are proud to have been selected to receive the ISOC Foundation grant through this competitive process,” said Lisa LeVasseur, executive director at Me2B Alliance. “The support validates our ongoing commitment to producing meaningful research and establishing best practices for safe and respectful technology to protect not just children and parents, but every person who interacts with Internet-connected tech.”</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance invites experts, business leaders and individuals interested in advancing standards in&nbsp;safe and&nbsp;ethical data and mobile and Internet practices to visit its&nbsp;<a title="" href="https://me2ba.org/membership/">website</a>&nbsp;to learn more about Me2B Alliance membership, current Me2BA research, its educational tools, and its advocacy work.</p>

	<p>As we’ve been performing independent product audits over the past year and a half, we received some push-back on our passing criteria related to the automatic translation of IP address to geographic location. Vendors felt that automatically calculating the user’s geographical location was, in fact, a benefit. However, in our specification, that behavior will receive a failing score. At an impasse, we decided to conduct some validation testing with Me-s. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Through qualitative and quantitative research, we did, in fact, confirm that our passing criteria reflects Me-s’ sensitivities around automatic location calculation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more about it in our latest Spotlight Report,&nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/spotlight-report-3-me2b-alliance-validation-research-consumer-sensitivity-to-location-tracking-by-websites-and-mobile-apps/">“Spotlight Report #3: Consumer Sensitivity to Location Tracking by Websites and Mobile Apps”</a>. This research quantifies and qualifies public opinion of location tracking in a variety of different contexts within web and mobile technology. Key findings include:&nbsp;</p>
 
 72% of people for websites and 68% of people for mobile apps do not consider location tracking to be acceptable before an account is created.&nbsp; 
 55% of people consider it “creepy” when websites know their location when they first open the site.&nbsp; 
 Location sensitivity is context and control sensitive, so that people are more comfortable with location tracking when it is necessary (ex. directions, deliveries, weather, traffic) and when they are asked for permission.&nbsp; 
 81% of people for websites and 68% of people for mobile apps used at least one negative term to describe location tracking including creepy, bad, annoying, scary, and confusing.&nbsp; 
 
<p>See this <a href="https://me2ba.org/most-people-feel-negatively-about-location-tracking/">press release</a>&nbsp;for more highlights of the report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Constant validation of our standard with Me-s is crucial to producing a safety specification that reflects the sensibilities of everyday people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Research is the foundation of our efforts to create standards for safe and ethical technology. We think location tracking on app open is wrong, but as a standards organization that is the voice and advocate of people across the internet, we don’t trust our opinions alone. We can only be sure by conducting research on how people — Me-s in our parlance — really feel. In this case, the research clearly shows we are right. The extensive findings in this survey validate that our scoring standards are solidly based on how people really feel about location tracking.”</p>
<p>Lisa LeVasseur, Executive Director, Me2BA</p>
<p>This research is one of several validation studies to confirm and quantify the public’s desire for a safer, more respectful digital world. Stay tuned and become a part of the movement as we continue to conduct research that allows us to set standards to ensure human dignity in connected technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> are two of the popular open source repositories that can help propel development of decentralised identity products and services. Aries is a toolbox of several blockchain-agnostic repositories that allow for trusted online peer-to-peer interactions based on decentralized identities and verifiable credentials. The project grew out of work that was happening in Indy to create technologies for managing decentralized identity. Aries was moved to graduated status by the TSC in February 2021. Indy graduated in 2019 and provides a specific blockchain purpose-built for identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seeing the growth in interest for these two projects, Hyperledger Foundation has partnered with member company <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> and its team of deeply experienced developers and architects to develop this free, multi-course curriculum to help developers and architects gain a deeper understanding of decentralized identity, with a deep dive into Aries and Indy. Registration and preparation information can be found on this <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Workshops">Workshops page</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These two four-hour, beginning level hands-on workshops provide opportunities to install and run the Indy and Aries components just like you would if you were making a real Indy-based network or Aries-based application. They introduce the necessary Git repos as well as how to use the Indy Command Line Interface (Indy CLI), run the Aries toolbox and create and issue a verifiable credential. They also introduce some current projects using Aries and Indy to help you accelerate your understanding of decentralized identity and build the skills necessary to successfully make changes to the underlying code with hands-on guidance to develop your own projects.</p>



<p>About the courses</p>



<p><a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Build+Your+Identity+Solution+Using+Hyperledger+Aries">Build Your Identity Solution Using Hyperledger Aries</a><br>Thursday, January 20, 2022<br>8 AM to noon Pacific </p>

<p><a href="https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYtc-mgrzstHd3QrzUXhkjOgclh0S72TAKZ">Register for free</a></p>



<p>The second in the series is a four-hour course that advances your skills related to Hyperledger Indy node code and the Indy SDK. It also covers the commonly used cryptography libraries contained in Hyperledger Ursa, the Plenum ledger and how to interact with and change the repositories and code.</p>



<p>Topics also include:</p>



  Install and build with Indy SDK  Introduction to libindy, indycli etc  Indy VDR (replacement for Indy-SDK)  Making changes to Indy node code  Build and IndyTest the changes locally  How to get involved in the community further with chats, helplines, and meetings  



<p>Both courses do have several must-have prerequisites, including the installation of docker, installation of Indy-CLI, installation of rust, and the download of important repositories. This can be done independently, or you will have the opportunity to connect with instructors during pre-course office hours on a dedicated helpline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These new courses are the first community workshops offered by the Hyperledger Foundation for free in an effort to expand the use, contributions, and maintainer community of Hyperledger Indy and Aries. Recordings of the courses will be made available at the conclusion of the instructor-led events.</p>



<p>Registration for the free course is limited to 100. Registration links and further information about the prerequisites and course materials can be found at <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Workshops">https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Workshops</a>.</p>

 Terms 



<p>PII/SD – a broader capture of personal data to include Personally Identifiable Information (<a href="https://piwik.pro/blog/what-is-pii-personal-data/#what-is-personally-identifiable-information-(pii)?">PII</a>) and (personally) Sensitive Data (SD). Examples: medical or financial records or location history</p>



 Introduction 



<p>Several problems currently remain unsolved in the ToIP stack and SSI in general, which appear a natural fit for a digital equivalent of a “Notary public” as a trusted independent agent (or agent/agency), which may be a combination of human and computational services.</p>



<p>In the SSI book scenario, “Alice sells the car to Bob”, the transaction is completed between Alice and Bob directly. They individually deal with car financing, payment, ownership exchange, and license transfer themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This paper builds on that scenario with “Bob buys a house from Alice”. A home purchase is an example of a more complex, real-world transaction. In the non-SSI world, it typically involves formal agreements and can require personal guarantees, exchanging PII through a Lawyer or “Notary Publique/Public Notary”.</p>



<p>A Notary acts as a trusted 3rd party for both Bob and Alice. The Notary’s duties include ensuring documentation is complete, issues are resolved (state of the home/property), creating a sale contract, doing various searches and registration updates, overseeing fund transfers, paying taxes, etc.</p>



<p>The rationale for working through an SSI version of a home sale is to explore how to structure online transactions in a privacy-preserving manner while preventing the following scenario:</p>



  A Financial transaction between individuals fails– Alice agrees to a financial transaction with Bob to provide a service via a direct person-to-person peer-DID (“contextual” identities) connection with some VC/proof exchange to establish trust, but otherwise avoiding the exchange of PII or root identity.  Bob accepts payment from Alice, then dissolves the relationship by tearing down the communication channel, wipes any record of Alice or their own contextual identity (peer DID), does not provide the service and when eventually found by Alice, disputes the agreement.  



<p>As a side benefit, this scenario also explores the Digital Notary role as a transaction assistant, acting as a trusted delegate of both Bob and Alice.</p>



 Problem 



<p>The direct Bob/Alice interaction model of “Alice sells the car to Bob” was intended to show that SSI interactions can handle real-world transactions. The example includes a person-to-person transaction using DIDS that includes a car as an SSI entity in its own right, with its own independent identity and related records.</p>



<p>Given that base, how does SSI handle the more complex day-to-day transactions, including inter-personal and person-to-organization transactions?</p>



<p>Online Transactions and the ability to negotiate – Currently, a standard way of handling online interpersonal transactions is via a service like PayPal. The problem is that the individual frequently has no control over the transaction “contract” nor the ability to negotiate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A case in point is buyers and sellers using PayPal as a transaction broker, where “Legal Agreements for PayPal Services” primarily protects PayPal vs. Buyers, Sellers or the actual money transfer.</p>



<p>This problem is resolved in “human space” via agreements negotiated directly or through a 3rd party, including penalties or holdbacks (or performance bonds).</p>



<p>Privacy – Bob and Alice are most likely strangers who, for most interactions, only need to establish contextual identities, with trust established for the current context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In human space, transactions that can result in (financial) harm (such as selling a home) require bank-level KYC level identification verification.&nbsp; This is required to reach either party should terms and conditions in a contract not be met or damages sought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As was debated at IIW 33, you only have complete control of your personal data (and privacy) if you don’t interact with anyone or anything, in person or digitally.</p>



<p>The human space solution is to interact via a mutually agreed trusted 3rd party.</p>



<p>This also serves to address the problem for Bob and Alice, that they may not be aware of all the tasks that are required in a transaction that does not result in injury to one or both parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What could a digital, SSI version of the human space solution look like?</p>



 Requirements for the Solution 



<p>Buying and selling a house has potential complications which could financially impact the Buyer or Seller. So the overall requirement is to protect the buyer and seller through:</p>



  Ensuring that all financial and non-financial issues related to the property and home are known and transparent to the Buyer and Seller  That the parties in the transaction MUST be identified to a bank-level “know your customer” to ensure complete transparency and accountability, including that:&nbsp;  The Seller is, in fact, the owner and is authorized to sell  That there are guarantees, with enforcement, on redressing financial and physical problems with the home and property after closing the sale  That the Seller will be paid, in full by the Buyer  That the Buyer is entitled to purchase the property (citizenship requirements)    That the privacy and PII/SD data of the Buyer, Seller (and any other parties) must not be disclosed to other parties in the transaction.  That any disputes about the property or home are known and addressed  That all documentation, taxes and other process steps are completed correctly.  The buyer and seller do not personally have to be experts on houses, properties, or a house sale’s legal ramifications.  That the solution provides a framework for semi or fully automating the transaction process, contracts and other agreements, that provides for governance as an integral component  Provide a mechanism for different jurisdictions to provide a model and mechanism for organizations to incorporate governance controlled contracts, terms and conditions    



 Solution(s) 



<p>Note: &nbsp;For this discussion, a Digital Notary is a service that spans the range from a human Notary Public with digital tools to a fully computational home sales process and contracting service, realizing a complete service as a “smart contract”. The same is assumed of other services in this Scenario.</p>



<p>The following is proposed:</p>



<p>An independent agent (Digital Notary) works as a trusted intermediary for parties in transactions within a framework that allows for partial or complete automation of the transaction workflow, including support for formal or “smart” contracts.</p>



<p>The Digital Notary is a first-class SSI entity that can establish communication channels with the parties and supporting services, including establishing trust and exchange of Verifiable Credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Digital Notary (software components) and its collection of related services must be subject to, and certified by, governance authorities (or delegated agencies) for the jurisdiction(s) in which they will operate.</p>



<p>A Digital Notary may collect “know your customer”/”Foundational Identity” PII data from the Buyer and Seller to do the following:</p>



  Bind the buyer and seller to terms and conditions in the house sales contract such that they can be “reached” in the case of a dispute or where “performance bonds” (or equivalents) are required  Obtain delegation from the Buyer and Seller to collect and verify with financial institutions, land registry and financial Lien registries any and all documentation concerning the potential pitfalls about the buyer, seller and the house/property. This may include delegation to make and receive payments on behalf of the parties.  



<p>The current practice for non-digital house sales provides PII (root identity class information) of the Buyer, Seller, and potentially other parties in the sales contract/agreement and related “paperwork” distributed to the Buyer and Seller.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this proposal, privacy can be increased through the Notary holding (in trust) the only copy of the complete documentation, including full PII/SD information. The Buyer and Seller receive depersonalized copies.</p>



<p>Disputes on the transaction would be via the Notary of record or delegated to another trusted 3rd party (Lawyer, Courts, etc.) through formal means.</p>



 



 Solution Workflow 



<p>Bob and Alice have agreed that Bob will buy Alice’s house. They have collected the required information and are ready to proceed:</p>







  Bob and Alice create a session with a Digital Notary (DN) Service, where a list of qualified Digital Notaries which can handle house sales in their (governance) jurisdiction(s) are presented. Both parties work to select and agree on the Digital Notary (DN) used.  The selected DN is instantiated and establishes connections with Bob and Alice, establishing trust as a licensed, governed entity using standard SSI workflow.  The DN establishes the specifics of the house sale transaction from Q &amp; A with Bob and Alice, including collecting initial information on the property and house, which may be in the form of documents, claims or VCs, plus any other pertinent information to establish the “components” needed to complete the transaction and any conditions.  The contracts (and other document types) made available for the transaction are from a jurisdiction governed repository of templates, including contract types, terms, clauses, permissible conditions,&nbsp; plus supporting documents, executables, etc. that are required (and optional) and are compatible with the transaction.    The DN requests the required level of identity and delegation authority to complete the transaction  Bob and Alice are requested to provide “know your customer” level (aka “foundational”) identities and grant access to the underlying identity claims to the DN, which the&nbsp; DN verifies with the Issuer(s)  Bob and Alice are asked to delegate the DN the rights to act on their behalf for specified financial transactions, access to house-related information registries and to update or create new entries with specified agencies and services. This may involve using Foundational class identifiers.    The DN interacts with Bob and Alice to collect information to determine the clauses, terms and conditions of the (house sales) contract, which may be constrained by the jurisdictional template(s).  This may include resolution of issues with the property (roof repair) prior to the sale or conditions (a property survey is required, which must not find blocking issues)    The DN may construct manual or automatic logic on steps taken (and verified) and payments to be exchanged as part of the contract  This will likely include the handover of the property and occupancy steps for the new owner (Bob).&nbsp;  This may include holdbacks or performance bonds on post-sale warranties for work done or unknown defects    Bob and Alice (crypto) sign the contract.&nbsp;  The contract is now in execution mode, which will use notifications and events with Bob’s and Alice’s personal Agents to inform each of the obligations, confirm completion of clauses in the contract with completion events from those Agents.  Bob and Alice get copies of the contract(s) and other documents related to the house sale where Bob, Alice and any other parties are de-identified.  The DN registers the contract within the DN trust framework with all the related documentation, including “foundational” identities of the parties    On completion of the contract (including expiry of any conditions, the DN archives the house sale artifacts and “dissolves”&nbsp;  Access to the house sale archive for non-performance of the contract or later discovered issues may be requested with a jurisdiction controlled court order or equivalent.    



 Pros, Cons and Vulnerabilities 



<p>Pros</p>



  Provides an SSI “pattern” of allowing PII information to be used in any interaction between parties in a manner via an independent entity that uses has mechanisms to capture and use PII without disclosure outside the transaction.  Provides a mechanism to immediately use human notaries (or equivalent) as the “glue” using SSI to connect with Bob, Alice and all the related services and agencies in an SSI transaction contract, with the ability to migrate over time to fully automated digital notary/SSI contracts, starting with simple online purchases and moving to more complex contracts over time  



<p>Cons</p>



  “Smart” Contracts are just in their infancy and primarily focused on crypto-coin and currency exchange to non-crypto, so how they evolve is speculation.&nbsp;  



<p>Vulnerabilities</p>



  Unknown – However, the intent is that all the components of the “contract framework” and “digital notary” concepts are that all the components would be 1st class SII components and subject to the same rigour and security standards.

 Why Trust Over IP is even more profound than we thought 



<p>by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielhardman/">Daniel Hardman (LinkedIn link)</a>, Principal Ecosystem Engineer, SICPA</p>







<p>I became involved with the self-sovereign identity movement in 2016, and I have been lucky enough to witness many of its milestones — the finalization of the VC and DID specifications, the launch of Sovrin and Hyperledger Indy, the advent of production deployments and serious interoperability, the invention of peer DIDs and KERI and BBS+ credentials, the implementation of the exciting communication technology now known as DIDComm…</p>



<p>In this list of exciting events, I’ve long felt that the launch of the Trust Over IP Foundation deserved special mention. I coauthored two of the first public papers about the Trust Over IP Stack. For me, the vision represented a first and best effort to articulate and focus the principles that undergird all our decentralized and self-sovereign ambitions.</p>



<p>Yet despite this enthusiasm, I’ve recently realized that I’ve been underestimating our potential impact. Surprising but true.</p>



<p>In January of 2021, I joined SICPA to work on the problem of digital cash — not cryptocurrency, but bits-and-bytes versions of a euro, a dollar, a rupee, a real. Of course I took with me all my love for decentralized identity, DIDs, credentials, governance, and peer-oriented protocols.</p>



<p>As I learned this new problem domain, I saw a need for undergirding trust infrastructure; digital cash and its ownership needs verification, much like verifiable credentials do. That meant I needed primitives analogous to identity’s verifiable data registries. I also saw the need for identifiers and connections, and atop them, rich protocols — similar to the credential-oriented ones I’d appreciated in identity, but now having a monetary focus. For example, we obviously needed a protocol for buying and selling, another for negotiating a price, another for putting a value in escrow… And of course the big vision for cash was a trustworthy ecosystem, quite similar to the ones I’d been advocating in identity.</p>



<p>The more I pondered, the strong the parallels and resonances became. Permeating this new stack of value was the same need for governance, the same need for privacy and oversight, and the same opportunity to reset power imbalances by emphasizing peers and decentralization.</p>



<p>I looked at the Trust Over IP stack diagram with fresh eyes. And I saw that, like the funny English expression, “Can’t see the forest for the trees,”&nbsp; perhaps our perfectly reasonable focus on the details of credential implementation was distracting us from a profound generalization that the name of our foundation, “Trust Over IP,” had suggested all along:</p>



<p>We are about trust over underlying tech primitives — not just about identity or credentials.</p>



<p>It is true that credentials are a profound innovation — one that we’ll need in a digital cash stack, for sure. And it’s also true that identity is a key enabler of trust. But money taught me that these key components are&nbsp;necessary, not&nbsp;sufficient. With money, I also want verifiable mechanisms like escrow and insurance. That’s true even (perhaps especially) when I’m transacting with a faceless stranger.</p>



<p>I also pondered what perspective I might have acquired if my job shift had been to the problem of fake news, or education, or supply chain integrity, or healthcare, or academic and scientific research. And I realized that the same realizations would likely have surfaced from any of those perspectives. Each of these fields aspires to a dynamic and ecosystem. Each needs an expansive catalog of composable workflows that produce and consume trust. Such workflows depend on secure connectivity, which in turn derives from data formats, cryptographic algorithms, public commitments, and so forth. They all need governance, from the top of the stack to the bottom. And in all cases, trust is an emergent property of combining these patterns carefully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That led me to imagine a revised version of the Trust Over IP stack:<a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1MrxTKHywQ5qO6gAYvCOvvQVC5KBNHpoEzF0uWwzEv2c/edit"></a></p>







<p>This isn’t actually much of a departure from our original formulation; it just focuses more on the principles that characterize a layer, rather than on the specific mechanisms we might assume. And I hope it lets us see the forest for the trees. </p>



<p>I don’t know that my diagram is all that profound or unique to me. Other smart people in the space have begun saying similar things, and perhaps we’ll find a different way to explain that works even better. But I do think that experience and time are having a beneficial effect on all of us. The Tech Stack Working Group of Trust Over IP Foundation recently began debating a revision to our framing of this stack, and I am thrilled to hear many profound generalizations emerging from the discussions. The world desperately needs trust over IP, and I think we’re well on our way to delivering it.</p>

<p>There are 23,748,232 NFTs on the OpenSea marketplace, each with a different level of quality and technical construction. Some are secure, made for longevity, and technically sound. Many are not – subjecting buyers to hacks, rug pulls, broken images, and missing metadata. </p><p><a href="https://www.fungyproof.com/">FungyProof</a> surfaces this information for users so they can make more informed decisions and improve the quality of their existing NFTs. <a href="https://app.fungyproof.com">Check out the Fungyproof app</a> to discover information about your own NFTs!</p> Not all NFTs are created equal <p>When purchasing NFTs, most users simply look at the associated digital asset (art, song, ticket, etc.) or the creator before pulling the trigger. But an NFT is much more than a single boilerplate Smart Contract. NFTs actually consist of custom logic for token trait randomness (e.g. Chainlink VRF) and Smart Contract properties, linked metadata, linked assets such as images, animations, audio files, 3D files, and more. The manner in which Smart Contract logic is written and external assets are linked varies with each NFT. Combined, these properties make up the NFT’s “Mint Conditions.”</p><p>Want to learn more about how an NFT is constructed? Read this <a href="https://learn.fungyproof.com/">NFT Primer</a>.</p> Token grading can inform NFT buyers <p>Most users are flying blind when purchasing or selling visual media NFTs today, often using subjective measures or social signal to influence buying behavior. With Fungyproof's grading algorithm, users can start to make more informed, data-driven decisions for more intelligent purchasing. Grading a token consists of running the token’s “Mint Conditions'' through the FungyProof grading algorithm. This algorithm is a weighted, score-based system, which assigns a grade based on the technical implementation of a token as well as a few other factors such as energy usage (gas efficiency) and asset retrieval latency. For a full list of the 30+ data points checked, take a look at the <a href="https://fungyproof.notion.site/Grading-Rubrics-f348a35f8b164bb3ab97dec36e6a6e08">grading rubric</a>.</p> Cases protect and enrich your NFT assets  <p>FungyProof Cases enrich existing NFTs, digitally binding to the asset to protect it and help it stand out from the rest. The first set of cases will enrich your NFT by backing it up to decentralized storage solutions (IPFS + Filecoin). This immortalizes the NFT’s Mint Conditions and improves asset and metadata storage, thus improving your NFTs grade. Future cases will enable other enrichments such as carbon offsets, Arweave permaweb storage, attaching encrypted data, earning achievements, and more.</p><p>Cases are a new token standard developed by the Fungyproof team, known as a Non-Fungible Enrichment (NFE) that enables NFTs to own other NFTs. With cases, you can associate new data to your token without having to wrap or otherwise affect it. Once an NFE is bound to a token, any data associated with the NFE, such as the token backup, is then tied to the NFT provably and immutably.</p><p>The team's first set of cases include the standard FungyProof Case and the limited Neon Cases, which support ERC721s and many non-standard NFTs (CryptoPunks, CryptoKitties, etc.). Over time, more cases will launch with new functionality, rarities, and support for more chains. Cases are currently only available on FungyProof, but in the future the team plans to offer the option to "unbind" Cases, allowing users to remove and trade them on marketplaces. </p> Making data accessible through an open registry <p>The registry is a public service that allows anyone to view all of the information about an encased NFT. This information includes a token’s Mint Conditions, bound enrichments, provenance, and more. The registry is accessible through the FungyProof app, API, or on-chain through an NTF’s case via the enrichmentURI contract property.</p><p>The registry is designed for a few use cases:</p>  Buyers purchasing an NFT who want to browse the registry for NFT grades to select one that has been selectively upgraded  Sellers who want to ensure their NFTs are high quality and technically sound for the long-term and protect their reputation  Marketplaces that want to add information for their users    Using Ceramic to Append Metadata  <p>The glue between the FungyProof Case and the NFT registry is the Ceramic metadata. When binding a Case to an NFT, FungyProof needed a mutable metadata storage solution. Changes that occur to the NFT's data -- such as grading, new enrichments, and transfers – need to be appended to the metadata creating a historical audit trail. </p><p>Using Ceramic, FungyProof has created one of the first implementations for dynamically appending metadata to an NFT over time. When you bind a case to an NFT, a metadata file is also generated and stored with it. As the NFT and its value changes, or new enrichment types are available, the Ceramic stream can be updated. This opens the door to unlimited possibilities for enrichable NFTs.</p> What's next for Fungyproof? <p>FungyProof is just getting started. Future plans include new types of enrichments, browser extensions, marketplace and wallet integrations, economic incentives for community contributions, and more.

<p>The OpenID Foundation is delighted see the Financial Data Exchange’s recent announcement that&nbsp;<a href="https://financialdataexchange.org/FDX/News/Press-Releases/Financial_Data_Exchange_Releases_FDX_API_5.0.aspx"> FDX’s Financial-Grade API Security Specification v3.4 (companion to FDX API v5) supports the FAPI 1.0 Advanced and CIBA standards</a>:</p>
<p>“Alignment with Globally Interoperable Standards –&nbsp;The FDX API Security Specification v3.4 now references, supports and recommends utilization of the OpenID Foundation’s Financial-grade API (FAPI) security standard for securing traffic to APIs and for the authentication of end users (FAPI 1.0 Advanced &amp; CIBA protocols)… FDX alignment with these recognized global standards will further interoperability and adoption of the FDX API.”</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://financialdataexchange.org/">Financial Data Exchange</a>&nbsp;(FDX) is a non-profit industry-led initiative in the US and Canada to facilitate the development of open banking in these jurisdictions, “by unifying the financial services ecosystem around a common standard for the secure and convenient access of permissioned consumer and business financial data.” FDX is following in the footsteps of other leading markets like the United Kingdom, Australia, and Brazil that also use the Financial Grade API to enable open banking on their way to open finance.</p>
<p>The FDX community will benefit from enabling these mature standards to enable the consumer-directed sharing of financial and other sensitive data, while leaving the option open for international interoperability. The OpenID Foundation looks forward to continued collaboration with FDX and their members to facilitate the implementation of OpenID standards in North America. The OpenID Foundation warmly welcomes FDX and its members to participate in the FAPI Working Group to ensure the standard continues to meet the needs of the US and Canadian markets, as well as the global community.</p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2021/11/18/fdxs-financial-grade-api-security-specification-v3-4-companion-to-fdx-api-v5-supports-the-fapi-1-0-advanced-and-ciba-standards/">FDX’s Financial-Grade API Security Specification v3.4 Supports the FAPI 1.0 Advanced and CIBA Standards</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a>.

<p>OSLC PROMCODE is ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS OSLC Lifecycle Integration for Project Management of Contracted Delivery (OSLC PROMCODE) TC [1] are pleased to announce that OSLC PROMCODE Version 1.0 has been approved as OASIS Committee Specification 02. It includes corrections for some embedded links, but no text changes from Committee Specification 01 (CS01).</p>



<p>Global software delivery is commonplace today. With ever increasing pressure on the delivery of software projects for faster delivery, lower cost, and improved quality, it is becoming common for software delivery to be performed with collaboration of multiple organizations. The PROMCODE specification is intended to provide a common interface to exchange project management data across organizational boundaries for management of contracted software delivery.</p>



<p>This three-part specification defines the overall approach to PROMCODE (PROject Management of COntracted DElivery) based on the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) Core v3.0 specification [4], which was recently published as an OASIS Standard.</p>



<p>The documents and related files are available here:</p>

<p>New Zealand cybercrime continues to grow with the government cyber incident tracking agency, CERT, reporting a 14 percent increase in scams and fraud in the last quarter.</p>



<p>Fraud awareness this week is important for raising awareness of the potential risks Kiwis are facing with increased online activity.</p>



<p>This just shows how critical digital identity trust is in a world that is rapidly becoming more digital, Digital Identity New Zealand executive director Colin Wallis says.</p>



<p>Secure digital identities are an important foundation for the digital economy and with so much business, communication and purchases happening online it is more important than ever to be able to trust in peoples digital identity, he says.</p>



<p>“Having a secure, privacy-aware and trustworthy digital identity system will be important for enabling the economy. This is why Digital Identity NZ members are collaborating to provide feedback via the submission process on the government’s proposed digital identity framework.</p>



<p>“We are also hosting a large conference in May next year on digital trust, bringing together experts in digital identity, privacy and security, which are all needed to create trust.”</p>



<p>Digital Identity NZ is a not-for-profit member association in the NZ Tech Alliance. Wallis says it is working to create a country where people can express their identity using validated and trusted digital processes.</p>



<p>Identity fraud has increased a staggering 86 per cent in the last financial year, while investment fraud has risen by 37 per cent over the same period.</p>



<p>A total of 79 percent of New Zealanders are concerned about the protection of their identity and use of personal data by organisations, according to survey commissioned by Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ).</p>



<p>Walls says there is public concern and some frustration about how their personal data is shared online. Change in behaviour is occurring with 73 percent of Kiwis claiming to have made a change to their online behaviour because of privacy concern.</p>



<p><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2019/05/Digital-Identity-Yabble-Benchmark-Research-Infographic-May-2019.pdf">Their recent survey</a>&nbsp;found 85 percent of respondents said there was a lack of transparency, as well as concern in having to share data with so many organisations.</p>



<p>Additionally, only one in 20 New Zealanders have a fully satisfied experience with registering new accounts. Nine out of 10 New Zealanders find the idea of being more in control of their digital identity appealing.</p>

	 Most People Feel Negatively About Location Tracking in&nbsp;Websites and Apps According to New Research from Me2B Alliance 
 Spotlight Report highlights disapproval of location tracking without consent&nbsp;across various age groups, genders, and economic backgrounds 
<p>November 16, 2021 09:00 ET | Source: Me2B Alliance </p>
<p>What you need to know:</p>
 
 Most people do not consider it acceptable for websites (72%) and mobile apps (68%) to be aware of your physical location before an account is created 
 55% of survey participants say it’s “creepy” when websites know their location when they first open them 
 Overall, participants are more comfortable sharing their location information if the mobile app or website asks for permission, or if location information is relevant to the task at hand<br>
(examples: Maps, ordering delivery, checking weather and traffic that understandably require a specific location) 
 Depending on the scenario, respondents preferred that websites or mobile apps not remember their location, or only track their location when they are actively using the website or app 
 
<p>SAN DIEGO, Nov. 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —&nbsp;<a title="" href="https://me2ba.org/">Me2B Alliance</a>, a non-profit standards and advocacy organization focused on safe and respectful technology, today published a Spotlight Report which illustrates the significance of permission, relevance, and control when it comes to location tracking in websites and mobile apps. According to Me2BA’s research, 55% of people say it is “creepy” when websites know their location when they are first opened. In total, 81% of respondents used at least one negative term, including creepy, bad, annoying, scary, and confusing, to describe location tracking in websites. 68% used those same negative terms to describe location tracking in mobile apps.</p>
<p>The Spotlight Report, “<a title="Consumer Sensitivity to Location Tracking by Websites and Mobile Apps" href="https://me2ba.org/spotlight-report-3-me2b-alliance-validation-research-consumer-sensitivity-to-location-tracking-by-websites-and-mobile-apps/">Consumer Sensitivity to Location Tracking by Websites and Mobile Apps</a>”, was developed to validate the Location Commitment scoring criteria in the&nbsp;<a title="Me2B Alliance Safe &amp; Respectful Technology Specification" href="https://me2ba.org/flash-guide-2-what-is-the-me2b-respectful-tech-specification/">Me2B Alliance Safe &amp; Respectful Technology Specification</a>. The specification, produced by the Me2B Alliance’s Respectful Tech Spec Working Group, is designed to provide a standard for measuring safe and ethical behavior in connected technology. The core of the research was an online survey of 363 gender-balanced participants, aged 18 to 60+ and from various economic backgrounds, representing every state in the United States except Alaska and Montana.</p>
<p>Quantitative and qualitative studies were conducted to achieve a better understanding of consumers’ perception and tolerance for location tracking by digital technologies, such as websites and apps. The research explores participants’ understanding of what a location request is, how consumers feel about location tracking, and under what circumstances is location tracking acceptable.</p>
<p>Key takeaways from the Spotlight Report:</p>
 
 People tend to have negative feelings toward a website or app that “knows your physical location when you first open it” 
 People are more tolerant of location sharing if they have an account with a website or app 
 When asked open-ended questions about whether location tracking is acceptable, people repeatedly highlighted a desire to give consent before sharing their location. The most common terms used in those open-ended responses were “ask” and “ask permission.” 
 Context serves an important purpose. People tend to be willing to provide location information for convenience’s sake if respectful practices are in place. Consent must be given and there must be a legitimate and understandable need for location information. i.e., GPS maps, delivery, checking weather of traffic in a specific location 
 
<p>“Research is the foundation of our efforts to create standards for safe and ethical technology,” said Lisa&nbsp;LeVasseur, executive director of Me2B Alliance. “We think location tracking on app open is wrong, but as a standards organization that is the voice and advocate of people across the internet, we don’t trust our opinions alone. We can only be sure by conducting research on how people —Me-s in our parlance — really feel. In this case, the research clearly shows we are right. The extensive findings in this survey validate that our scoring standards are solidly based on how people really feel about location tracking.”</p>

	 <a></a>1. Abstract 
<p>“I don’t want my location to tracked, but I give my location out constantly.”</p>
<p>“Location consent is intrusive – often the locations shouldn’t be relevant.”</p>
<p>“If I don’t feel comfortable, I should have the right to deny it’s access.”</p>
<p>“I might be Googling something real quick at work, and I’m like, “why do they need to know my work location?””</p>
<p>“So they’re obviously just tracking me…. it’s unnecessary and I never asked for it.”</p>
<p>These quotes represent sentiments from our research that illustrate the significance of permission, relevance, and control for respectful technology behavior.</p>
<p>This research was conducted to validate the Location Commitment scoring criteria in the Me2B Alliance Respectful Technology Specification<a>1</a>. The objective of the study was to understand if the requirements and passing criteria of select location tests in the Me2BA Respectful Technology Specification are appropriate. Toward that end, we conducted quantitative and qualitative studies of consumers’ perception and tolerance for location awareness<a>2</a> by digital technologies. The studies explored participants’ understanding of what a location request is, how consumers feel about such awareness, and what are the specific parameters and scenarios that make location awareness acceptable.</p>
<p>The core of the research was an online survey of 363 people, in which we looked at respondent’s sentiments towards websites or mobile apps that are location aware, explored how having an account affected respondent’s feelings about location awareness, and examined how different scenarios and contexts might affect respondent’s choice of what location information was acceptable, when, and for how long.&nbsp; We also reviewed other interviews and focus groups studies conducted by the Me2B Alliance, in which participants discussed the kinds of information they share with digital technologies. Two primary research questions guided our work:</p>
<p>1) How do people feel when a website or mobile app automatically knows their location?</p>
<p>2) Under what conditions is it acceptable for a website or mobile app to know one’s location?</p>
<p>Key findings from our research include:</p>
<p>3) Participant sentiment is more negative than positive towards a website or app that “knows your physical location when you first open it”.&nbsp; The terms used to describe websites and apps that are immediately location-aware were more often negative than positive. 65% of respondents had an overall negative sentiment towards a website that knew their location upon first open; 52% of respondents had an overall negative sentiment towards a mobile app that knew their location upon first open. In addition, four of the top five terms used were negative (Creepy, Scary, Annoying and Bad), with “Convenient” being the only positive. 30% of respondents indicated that it was “Convenient” for a mobile app to know location information upon first open; this may reflect the element of agency involved in selecting and installing apps creating more tolerance around location awareness in apps versus websites.</p>
 
 About 70% of respondents indicated it was unacceptable for either a website or an app to know their location before the creation of an account – a “Me2B Marriage”.<br>
 
 Respondents were more tolerant of location sharing if they had an account than if they did not. If they did have an account, respondents were more comfortable with mobile apps knowing their physical location (45% Yes vs 35% No) than websites (34% Yes vs 45% No). However, 45% of respondents still felt it was unacceptable for websites to know their location even with an account. For both websites and mobile apps, “Maybe” responses jumped from 4% (website) and 5% (mobile app) to 20% (both) when respondents have an account, which suggests that having an account increases tolerance for location awareness.&nbsp; These findings validate the importance of the Me2B Marriage state as meaningful context for how people experience their Me2B relationships. 
 The specific context in which location information is requested – including the website/app’s need for location information – makes a difference in how accepting or tolerant people are towards sharing that information.&nbsp; Participants were more comfortable sharing their “home address” or “exact location” for scenarios where location awareness was relevant.&nbsp; Depending on the scenario, respondents preferred that websites or mobile apps know or remember their location either not at all (“never”), or “only when I am using the site”.<br>
 
 Terms used to describe when location awareness is acceptable highlighted agency and permission, as well as issues of trust and safety, and the importance of specific contexts. The two largest term clusters were “Ask” and “Ask Permission,” while other leading clusters were around related terms such as: Allow, Access, Consent, Reason or Good Reason, as well as: Security, Trust, Privacy, Safe and Safety. Popular, context specific terms included: Delivery, Ordering, Weather, Directions and Map.&nbsp; For those who selected “Maybe” when asked if it is acceptable to share location information, key reasons were the ability to give permission, and whether location information was required for use.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Our research confirms that location awareness is something people are sensitive to, and that people prefer to have control over the location data being shared. Website and mobile app consumers are aware in most cases that technologies may track their location.&nbsp; The specific context in which this information is requested, and, in particular, the relevance of the location information to the task, affects how accepting people are of sharing their location information – and to what degree, and for what length of time.&nbsp; People are more negatively inclined towards a website or mobile app that automatically knows their location – but, again, context matters. Convenience is a primary factor, while such sites are also seen as “Creepy, Scary, Annoying and Bad.” Key variables that make location awareness acceptable are asking permission and having a valid reason for needing this information.</p>
<p>Based on this research, we find that, for people to consider it acceptable for a digital product to know their location, two essential conditions must be met:</p>
 
 The person must have agency over granting access to location information, and 
 There needs to be a legitimate and understandable need for location info. 
 
<p>Our research supports the scoring rubric in the Me2BA Respectful Technology Specification. Based on this work, we are confident that the current scoring for passing/failing behavior related to a website or mobile app’s location awareness in the Me2BA Respectful Technology Specification accurately reflects the tolerances and sensitivities of individual Me-s and works towards ensuring respectful behavior for digital technologies.</p>
 <a></a>2. Introduction 
<p>The Me2B Alliance (“Me2BA”)<a>3</a> is a nonprofit creating a safe and just digital world through standards development and independent technology testing. At the core of our work is our<br>
Respectful Technology Specification<a>4</a>, currently in development, which provides an objective standard for measuring safe and ethical technology behavior. The Specification consists of a series of tests that evaluate how a connected product or service is behaving towards the people that use it. This helps individuals understand how technology is treating them, and helps businesses build technology that is safe for and respectful to the people that use it.</p>
<p>In particular, the Respectful Tech Specification tests each Me2B Commitment<a>5</a>, including the commitment of location sharing. Among other things, the set of tests for the Location Commitment addresses whether or not the individual has the opportunity to provide permission prior to the sharing, or derivation, of location information with a website or mobile app. Permission is a core attribute of respectful commitments<a>6</a>. Websites typically notify users by asking for permission (often through the browser); mobile apps often reference an individual’s existing location permission settings, activating a device pop up if permission is needed.</p>
<p>In our rounds of product testing against the nascent specification, we received objections from some vendors (“B-s”) for receiving failing scores due to websites “knowing” location (in this case, deriving from the IP header) without the user’s consent or awareness. The vendors argued that automatic derivation of an individual’s location via the IP header is beneficial to and desired by users.&nbsp; The research described in this report was developed to explore consumer perspectives, and to determine whether the scoring in the specification is sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to understand if the requirements and passing criteria of select location commitment tests in the Me2BA Respectful Technology Specification are appropriate. Toward that end, we conducted quantitative and qualitative studies of consumers’ perception and tolerance for location awareness by digital technologies. The studies explored participants’ understanding of what a location request is, how consumers feel about such awareness, and what are the specific parameters and scenarios that make location awareness acceptable.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>3. Research Design 
 3.1. Methodology<br>
 
<p>Our research combined qualitative and quantitative approaches. The core of the research was an online survey of 363 people. We also reviewed other studies conducted by the Me2B Alliance, pulling relevant information from focus groups as well as interviews, with an emphasis on sessions where participants discussed the kinds of information that people share with digital technologies. Two primary research questions guided our work:</p>
 
 How do people feel when a digital technology automatically knows their location? 
 Under what conditions is it acceptable for a digital technology to know one’s location? 
 
 <a></a>3.2. Quantitative Research – Location Awareness Acceptance Survey 
<p>The Location Awareness Acceptance Survey, launched via SurveyMonkey on June 10, 2021, contained 23 questions.&nbsp; 363 participants completed the survey. The survey had three main parts. The first two questions involved sentiment analysis –respondents were asked to select from a list of positive and negative adjectives to describe websites or mobile apps that are location aware. The second part involved four questions exploring how having an account affected respondent’s feelings about location awareness. The final section contained eight scenarios involving location awareness for mobile apps and websites. For each scenario, respondents were asked to indicate if it was acceptable for an app or website to know their location, and to specify what level of detail (i.e. from precise location up to country level) and for how long. See Appendix B for the full Survey Questionnaire.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>3.3. Qualitative Research – Focus Groups and Interviews 
<p>In addition to the online survey, we also reviewed previous qualitative studies in which we interviewed people about their understanding of the kinds of information that they share with digital technologies. In particular, we reviewed 12 interviews conducted in October 2020, as well as the content of subsequent focus groups with ten of these interviewees. The focus group members met for three sessions, conducted over Zoom, during the summer of 2021. While location tolerance was not initially a planned topic for the focus groups, participants occasionally brought It up organically. We also included questions about location tolerance in the final focus group session.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>3.4. Participants 
<p>For all Me2BA studies, we seek participants who have a home broadband connection, regularly use at least two Internet-enabled devices, do not work in the technology sector, and do not live in a large, urban, technology center. Participant recruitment for the quantitative survey was conducted via SurveyMonkey. For our focus groups and previous interviews, we recruited participants via the&nbsp;online&nbsp;platform, UserInterviews.com, which enables screening, participant communication, and incentive payment. Each survey, interview or focus group participant was paid $35 USD for each one-hour session. See Appendix C for the complete Me2BA screening survey.</p>
<p>Of the 363 volunteer participants that completed the Location Awareness Acceptance survey, 180 identified as female and 183 as male. Respondents ages ranged from 18-29 (35%), 30-44 (39%), 45-60 (17%), and over age 60 (8%). Respondents were all from the US, representing every state except Alaska and Montana. Half (50%) of the respondents indicated they earned between $25,000 and $99,999 per year, with 21.8% of these in the under $49,000 bracket.&nbsp; 20% of respondents indicated that they earned under $25,000, 15% earned over $100,000, and 15% preferred not to answer the income question. Almost all of respondents (97%) completed the survey on their mobile phones or tablets – 58% were using iOS Phone / Tablets and 39% used Android Phone/Tablet. Less than 3% were using their laptops – 2% on Windows Desktop/Laptop and 0.3% on MacOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our qualitative research included reviewing the content of 12 previous interviews, as well as focus groups with ten of these interviewees. Focus group participants included two groups of five participants, two men and three women each, all living in the United States. The ages of the participants ranged from 23 to 70. Profile snapshots of the participants who are quoted in this report are in Appendix D.</p>
<p>For the survey portion of the study, participants agreed to the standard SurveyMonkey consent release. For the interviews and focus group research, each participant reviewed a copy of the Me2B Alliance consent form and gave verbal consent to participate in this study. Audio recordings of participants’ verbal consent were saved as separate audio files and are retained by study personnel. Consent forms can be found in Appendix E.</p>
 <a></a>3.5. Data Analysis 
<p>Survey data from the SurveyMonkey questionnaires was downloaded to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analyzed for significant patterns around location awareness and tracking.&nbsp; We further analyzed this data by gender, age, income bracket and U.S. region. We also analyzed comments made in prior interviews and focus groups and in open-ended, textual survey answers.</p>
<p>In addition, we used the <a href="https://search.carrot2.org/%22%20%5Cl%20%22/workbench">Carrot2 Clustering Workbench program</a><a>7</a> with the LINGO algorithm to examine open-ended comments from the survey responses. The LINGO algorithm creates well-described flat clusters and is available as part of the open source Carrot2 framework.&nbsp; We used the Clustering Workbench program to create content clusters from an Excel file, tune clustering parameters, and then export results into a new Excel file. A list of terms and phrases from the cluster analysis is in Appendix F.</p>
 <a></a>4. Results 
 <a></a>4.1. Sentiment Analysis 
<p>For the first two questions in the survey, respondents were asked to describe a website or mobile application that knows their location when they first open it. Respondents were provided with a randomized list of five positive and five negative adjectives and were able to choose multiple options. Our objective was to discover how people feel about a website or a mobile app that wants to know their physical location. We were careful to balance negative terms against positive terms that have a similar emotional weight, to avoid skewing the participant toward one side or the other.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the above charts show, survey respondents tended to select negative terms to describe a technology that knows their location at a greater rate than positive terms for both website and mobile apps. 81% of respondents chose at least one negative term to describe this behavior in websites and 44% selected at least one positive term. They were less likely to select negative terms when describing a mobile app (68%) versus a website, but slightly more likely to select a positive term for mobile apps (53%) than for a website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The top 5 terms to describe websites and mobile apps that know your location immediately were mostly negative – Creepy, Scary, Annoying and Bad – with one positive – Convenient. “Creepy” was by far the most selected term – used by 55% of respondents to describe websites and 41% of respondents to describe mobile apps. The next most common terms were “Scary” (45% for websites and 32% for mobile apps) and “Annoying” (38% for websites and 32% for mobile apps). The terms that selected the least were “Confusing” (11% for both websites and mobile apps) and “Friendly” (10% for both websites and mobile apps).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term “Convenient” was chosen more frequently (30% of the time) for mobile apps than for websites (20% of the time). The implication here is that the utility of having location awareness on a mobile app is higher or more evident than for a website. App users must download the software to their mobile apps and some of these apps, such as map apps, require location information to be useful. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The negative term that was used the least was “Confusing”. Few respondents (11% for both websites and mobile apps) selected “Confusing” to describe a website or mobile app that immediately knows a user’s location. The implication is that users do not find this behavior from their technology to be illogical, and that it may be expected that the technology will know or attempt to determine your physical location.</p>
<p>We were also curious about any associations between the negative terms “Creepy” and “Scary,” and the more positive terms “Convenient” and “Helpful.” Would people be willing to put up with “Creepy” and “Scary” behavior if they also found it “Convenient” and “Helpful”? As Table 3 shows, we learned that this was the case less than 20% of the time, and that there is very little difference between website and mobile app users.</p>

<p>Net sentiment was calculated by subtracting the number of negative terms from the number of positive terms selected for each response and counting the number of responses that were positive, negative or neutral. A neutral sentiment of zero would indicate that the response had the same number of positive and negative terms. Overall, participants selected mostly negative terms to describe technologies that were location aware – 52% of the adjectives selected for location aware mobile apps were negative, and 65% of the terms selected for location aware websites were negative. Location awareness was more tolerated in mobile apps than in websites – positive net sentiment was at 37% for mobile apps and only 27% for websites.</p>
 <a></a>4.1.1. Sentiment by Gender 
<p>When we analyzed sentiment by cohort groups, we found very little difference between male and female respondents. Both gender groups were more negative than positive in their sentiments towards immediate location awareness, especially for websites.</p>

<p>As seen in figures 5-8, the net sentiment score, calculated as the number of positive terms selected by a participant minus the number of negative terms, was similar for both men and women. Tables 4-7 show how frequently each term was chosen, and how often at least one positive or negative word was selected. These tables demonstrate that male and female survey participants chose similar negative terms, at similar levels, to describe immediate location awareness in websites and mobile phones. Overall, men were slightly more favorable towards location awareness in websites, while women were slightly more accepting of location awareness for mobile apps.</p>
 <a></a>4.1.2. Sentiment by Age 
<p>We also looked at the data by age group and found that, in general, the older the cohort, the more likely they were to select negative adjectives to describe website and app location awareness.&nbsp; Notably, however, the 30-44-year-old cohort were the most tolerant to immediate location awareness – even more so than those younger than them.</p>

<p>One interesting finding is that people over the age of 60 were much less likely to find location seeking behavior “Convenient”. For websites, only 3% selected “Convenient” while the other age cohorts were in the 20-25% range. And for mobile apps, 13% selected “Convenient” while the other cohorts were in the 30-35% range. In sum, our survey data suggests that age is a better predictor of sentiment towards mobile app and website location awareness than gender.</p>
 <a></a>4.1.3. Devices 
<p>Since a majority of respondents (98%) used mobile phones to complete the survey, we also segmented sentiment by device.&nbsp; Android and iPhone users both used more negative than positive terms to describe websites and mobile apps that were immediately location aware. Overall, negative terms were chosen between 65-85% of the time (depending on which device was being used, and whether it was used on a website or a mobile app), while positive terms were chosen only 43-56% of the time. Negative terms were used slightly more frequently to describe websites (around 80 and 85% of the time) than mobile apps (around 65 and 73% of the time).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We did find a small difference in sentiment towards immediately location aware apps and websites based on device. Android users were slightly more likely to use a negative term than iPhone users – with a difference of 3.5% for mobile apps and 5% for websites. They were also slightly less likely to use a positive term – with a difference of 3.7% for websites and 6.7% for mobile apps. The choices of specific terms were quite similar across both Android and iPhone users, most often with a difference of just a few percent. A few points do stand out, however. Android users were more likely to choose the term “Bad” to describe websites and mobile apps that were immediately location aware. They were also more likely to use the term “Creepy” and “Scary” to describe mobile apps that were location aware. This negative impression is supported by some of our focus group comments, provided in section 3.6, below.<br>

 <a></a>4.2. How Having an Account Affects Tolerance of Location Awareness 
<p>Four survey questions investigated whether having an account affects the acceptability or tolerance of immediate location awareness, for both mobile apps and websites.&nbsp; Respondents were overwhelmingly more sensitive to having apps and websites know their location data when they did not yet have an account. If they did have an account, respondents were more comfortable with mobile apps knowing their physical location than a website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A majority of respondents did not consider it acceptable for mobile apps and websites to be aware of your physical location at first use, before an account is created – 68.3% for mobile apps and 72.5% for websites. A very small number (5% for websites and 4% for apps) said “Maybe” it would be acceptable for a website or mobile app to know your physical location at first use. The reasons for this were varied. Website users said location awareness would be acceptable if they trusted the site, if location awareness was necessary or useful, and if they gave their permission. For mobile app users, permission was also a primary factor. Mobile users also wanted their consent to be clearly documented.</p>
<p>While a majority of respondents were against immediate location awareness without an account, those numbers went down significantly once a user had an account. With an account, 45% of respondents felt that it was acceptable for a mobile app to know your location, and almost 35% found this acceptable for websites. The percentage of people who indicated “Maybe” it was acceptable for a technology to know your location after you’ve created an account went up to 20%, for both websites and mobile apps. In this case, the most cited reasons for finding location awareness to be acceptable were if the application requires location to function or if users were able to explicitly give permission either via opt in or device settings.</p>
 <a></a>4.2.2. “Maybe” it’s OK – Analysis 
<p>We also conducted a closer analysis of the reasons and explanations given by the 179 respondents that chose “Maybe” it was OK for a website or mobile app to know your location – both upon first use, and after an account has been created.</p>
<p>Over 80% (147 out of 179) of the “Maybe” responses referred to situation where users had an account, indicating that having an account was an important initial factor. Almost 60% (87 out of 147) of the reasons why location awareness “Maybe” acceptable when a user already had an account involved some sort of “permission,” with the answers evenly divided for both websites and mobile apps. Around 35% of responses (64 out of 179) indicated that some use or purpose were necessary. Again, these responses related mostly (55 out of 64) to cases where users already had an account.</p>
<p>Overall, people indicated that they would be OK with sharing location information if they were able to give their permission or if the location information was somehow necessary or required. Not all answers explicitly used the term “permission” or “required”. For example, some respondents wrote “if I approve” or “if I have enabled location services,” which indicates permission, or “when ordering food” or “depends on what the app is used for,” which indicates a reasonable need. Generally, responses that included terms such as: “allow”, “let”, “permit”, “choice” or “ask” were counted among those that require “permission” and responses including terms such as: “use”, “need” or “require”, or that mention a specific scenario, were counted among those that indicated a reasonable need for the data. Raw responses from the survey responses that indicate “Maybe” can be found in Appendix&nbsp;G.</p>
 <a></a>4.3. Location Tolerance Scenarios 
<p>The survey included eight scenarios in which participants were asked if it is acceptable for a digital technology to know their physical location. Some of the scenarios, such as delivering groceries, had a more obvious need for location data, while for others, the need for exact location was not as clear. For each scenario, we inquired about the level of location detail that it was acceptable for the website or mobile app to have. Specifically, for each scenario, we asked if it was OK for the website or mobile app to know the respondent’s country, state, zip code, home address, exact location, or none of these. We also asked respondents about the specific context or duration of location awareness – “never”, “one time only”, “only when I am using the app/site”, “for a limited period of time” or “all the time.” Respondents were able to select multiple options for acceptable location information.</p>
 <a></a>4.3.1. When Location Information May Be Necessary 
<p>The survey presented three different scenarios in which location information is relevant – although the user’s current physical location may not be necessary. These scenarios included: (1) ordering groceries, (2) checking weather and traffic at a vacation destination and (3) sending a gift to an out-of-town friend.</p>
<p>Scenario 1: Ordering Groceries&nbsp;</p>
<p>When ordering groceries from an online store, the assumption is that the store needs to know where to deliver the groceries. In typical cases, the delivery address and home address are the same. The shopper may or may not be at the delivery location when the order is placed. In this scenario, the shopper is ordering groceries to be delivered to their home, and the website or app is requesting the shopper’s physical location.</p>



Figure 21: “Is Location Awareness OK?”<br>
Ordering Groceries
Figure 22: “Ok to Remember Location?”<br>
Ordering Groceries



<p>When ordering groceries online, respondents were pretty specific about what was acceptable. For instance, over 50% of respondents found it acceptable for the technology to know one’s “home address”, while all other choices were selected by fewer than 40% of respondents. In particular, only 31% thought having one’s “exact location” known was OK.&nbsp; Similarly, most respondents (56%) said it was OK for the site to know or remember their physical location “only while they were using the site,” and the remaining options were all chosen by fewer than 20% of respondents. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario 2: Weather and traffic in vacation location&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assumption is that your vacation location is outside your local vicinity, and the website or mobile app does not need to know your physical location if you want to see weather or traffic reports there. However, your physical location may be relevant if a map of your route is being mapped. &nbsp;</p>



Figure 23: “Is Location Awareness OK?”<br>
Traffic/Weather
Figure 24: “Ok to Remember Location?”<br>
Traffic/Weather



<p>When checking weather or traffic reports at an out-of-town location, less than 25% of respondents thought that it was acceptable for the site to know their “exact location,” and even fewer, about 17% thought it was OK for the site to know their “home address”.&nbsp; Most (40%) found knowing the zip code to be acceptable, while “state” (35%) and “country” (32%) were chosen by a slightly lower percentage. Almost 50% of respondents found it acceptable for the app to know or remember their location “only when I am using the app.” Other options were chosen by less than 20% of respondents. People may be tolerant of location awareness in this type of app because they also use it to check local conditions as they move about an area.</p>
<p>Scenario 3: Sending a Gift&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are buying a gift to send to an out-of-town friend, the assumption is that the technology does not need to know your physical location.&nbsp;</p>



Figure 25: “Is Location Awareness OK?” – Gift
Figure 26: “Ok to Remember Location?” – Gift



<p>When buying a gift to be delivered to a friend in a different town, respondents found that it was acceptable for the technology to know their physical location pretty infrequently – about 22% chose “home address” and around 15% chose “exact location.” The other choices – zip code, city, state and country – were chosen by around 30% of respondents. And finally, 27% chose “None”.&nbsp; In this scenario, the biggest percentage of respondents – 42%-&nbsp; indicated it was OK for the site to have their info “only when I’m using the site.” Three of the remaining categories – “For a limited period of time,” “One time only,” or “Never” – were chosen by around 20% or respondents, while only 14% indicated it was OK for the site to know or remember their location “All the time”.</p>
 4.3.1.1. Comparing Across 3 Location-Necessary Scenarios<br>

<p>Comparing across these three scenarios, we find that having the technology know one’s home address was acceptable to the most people (53% of respondents) when ordering groceries – which makes perfect sense, as the home address is where the groceries most likely need to be delivered.&nbsp; Outside of this particular case, roughly 28 – 40% of respondents generally found it acceptable in these scenarios for a website or app to know their zip code, city, state or country. Respondents were the most sensitive to giving out their exact location information when sending a gift out of town. In that scenario, having the site know a “Your exact location” was chosen by only 14% of respondents, and 28% – the highest percent of the three scenarios – indicated that “None” of the choices were acceptable.</p>

<p>Most respondents, when presented with these three scenarios, indicated a preference for the site to remember or know their location “Only when I am using the site” – this option was selected by 42-56% of respondents.&nbsp; In other words, in these scenarios, roughly half of shoppers would prefer that sites not know or remember their location information when they are not using it.&nbsp; The remaining options – “One time only”, “For a limited period of time”, “Never” and “All the time” – were generally selected by around 20% of respondents. Again, respondents were the most tolerant of location awareness in the ordering groceries scenario, where only 9% found it to be “Never” OK for the site to know their physical location, and 19% felt that it was OK “All the time”.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>4.3.2. When Location Awareness is Not Necessary 
<p>Scenarios 4 – 8 in the survey involved cases where a website or mobile app may request location information even when this information does not appear necessary. These scenarios included: (1) when you are watching a video, (2) creating a new email account, (3) using an online coupon at a new e-commerce site, (4) downloading software and (5) downloading educational software for a child. This final scenario was included due to our recent research on mobile apps developed for schools, which found that many of these apps exposed student information8. The response choices presented in these scenarios were the same as with the earlier scenarios – people were asked about the degree and duration of location awareness, with the option to select multiple answers.</p>

 4.3.3.2. Location Acceptance by Location Use Duration 
<p>The percentage of responders choosing how long it was acceptable for a technology to know or remember location was also relatively consistent across scenarios. A majority of responders (65-84%) felt that it was either “Never” acceptable for a service provider, website, or mobile app to know or remember their location, or acceptable “Only when I am using the site”.&nbsp; Specifically, roughly 36-49% of respondents selected “Never” and 28-35% selected “Only when I am using the site”. The most sensitive case was the unfamiliar e-commerce site – almost 50% of respondents felt that it was “Never” acceptable for a new e-commerce site to know or remember their location information.&nbsp; In the first set of scenarios, where location awareness was reasonable, up to 19% of respondents felt that the technology could know or remember their location “All the time”. In contrast, in this set of scenarios, not more than 11% of respondents found that acceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 <a></a>4.3.4. Comparing Across All Scenarios 
<p>We found some interesting similarities and differences in how participants responded to scenarios where location awareness seemed more relevant (scenarios 1-3), versus where location awareness was not as necessary (scenarios 4-8) – especially when looking at how sensitive respondents were to the level of location detail provided. &nbsp;</p>
 
 Ordering groceries 
 Weather and traffic in a vacation location 
 Sending a gift to an out of town recipient 
 Watching a video 
 Creating an email account 
 Using an e-commerce site/app 
 Downloading software 
 Downloading an educational app 
 
<p>For example, the geographic information – country, state, city and zip code – had a relatively similar percentage of responses (20-40%) for all eight scenarios (figures 27 and 38, tables 18 and 20). On the other hand, participants were more comfortable sharing their “home address” or “exact location” for scenarios where location awareness was relevant (scenarios 1 –3) and the range in those cases was quite large – from 14% – 53% – depending on scenario. In those scenarios where location information was less relevant (scenarios 4-8), participants were consistently less comfortable sharing “home address” or “exact location” (chosen by around 10-12% of respondents) (figure 38, table 20). Similarly, in scenarios where location awareness was less relevant, 20-26% of participants consistently felt that “None of these” location options were acceptable to share (figure 38, table 20).&nbsp; In the first three scenarios – where location information was more clearly relevant – the percentage of participants who specified “None of these” location options were acceptable varied quite a bit – from 9% – 28%, depending on the specific scenario (figure 27, table 18) These differences indicate that location awareness is something respondents are sensitive to, and the specific context in which this information is requested – and how apparent the need for location information is – makes a difference. These findings reveal how people prefer to have control over the degree and duration of location sharing.&nbsp;</p>
 <a></a>4.4. Open-Ended Survey Comments 
<p>The final question on the survey was&nbsp;open-ended, asking: “Generally, what needs to happen for it to be OK for a website or a mobile app to know your physical location?” Most respondents reiterated their recognition that the website or app’s need for location information to function was a reasonable condition for providing that information. Additionally, many responses (see sample below) indicate that people want&nbsp;to have&nbsp;the ability to&nbsp;explicitly allow&nbsp;location awareness&nbsp;through actively opting in or providing permission.</p>
<p>“I do feel like my location is always tracked, through numerous sites. You disclose your location to strangers on eBay and other sites all the time. You also disclose it to numerous businesses routinely. I don’t want my location to be tracked, but I give my location out constantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Why does this app need my location? For marketing or is the information stored in a database? Our personal information is sold to companies all the time. Why wouldn’t our locations be as well?”</p>
<p>“If they’ve disclosed clearly that is a condition of use, and it confirms it will no longer track, if I [can] opt out of it, then it’s acceptable.”</p>
<p>“It is only ok when I am fully aware that it is tracking me. If I don’t feel comfortable, I should have the right to deny it’s access.”</p>
<p>For a deeper look, we used the Carrot2&nbsp;Clustering Workbench program to identify word clusters and highlight common themes in the responses. The following image&nbsp;indicates the prevalence of various terms and phrases:</p>
<p></p>
<p>57 clusters were created from 361 responses. The most common terms were “Ask” (39 responses) or “Ask Permission” (23 responses), indicating that individuals are by far more comfortable with location awareness if they have been asked to give permission. “Allow” (12 responses),&nbsp;“Access” (11 responses)&nbsp;and “Consent” (9 responses)&nbsp;also indicate potential action on the part of the individual to allow access to location information.&nbsp;Other terms that were frequently used included “Service” (13 responses) “Reason”&nbsp;or “Good Reason”&nbsp;(16&nbsp;responses) and “Purpose” (5 responses), which indicates that if the service had a reason to use the location information it would be acceptable for the website or app to know it. Terms such as “Delivery” (12 responses) and “Ordering” (11 responses”) indicate specific scenarios where the app or website might need to know the location in order to deliver a product. Terms such as “Weather” or “Weather app” (13 responses), “Directions” (6 response) and “Map” (5 responses) also indicate scenarios where a specific location might be required. Clusters including “Security” (10 responses),&nbsp;“Trust” (10 responses), “Privacy” (9 responses) and&nbsp;“Safe” or “Safety” (10 responses) indicate a concern around risk.&nbsp;A complete list of cluster terms and phrases can be found in&nbsp;Appendix&nbsp;F.</p>
 <a></a>4.4.1. Qualitative Analysis – Focus Groups and Interviews 
<p>We also drew quotes from interviews and focus groups that were relevant to the location awareness topic. Detailed information about the focus group participants is in Appendix D.</p>
<p>One focus group participant described their perception of tracking behavior, expressing a preference for location tracking on a computer, because “on your computer…you’re just in that one location anyway,” whereas on a mobile phone, once consent is given “that might stay there and they’ll keep tracking you forever.” (Janice, 7/19/21)</p>
<p>One respondent was explicit about the intrusive nature of location consent, and the importance of relevance: “I do feel like the location consent is…very intrusive because a lot of times whatever I might be looking at, the locations shouldn’t be relevant. If I want to take it to the next step and map out directions, or find a store in my area or something like that, I can see why they might want to confirm my location… But when it’s upon opening up a new app or a new website, I find it very frustrating, especially when it’s a website and I’m on a laptop… I might be Googling something real quick at work, and I’m like, “why do they need to know my work location?” (Tammy 7/19/21)</p>
<p>Many respondents felt that location awareness acceptability depended on the purpose of the website or mobile app, and whether the location awareness was necessary to provide useful information: “Like if it’s a shopping app to locate a store closest to you” or “…if&nbsp;I’m using any type of&nbsp;ride-sharing&nbsp;program, they need to kind of know where I’m at” (Kristin 7/19/21) “GPS type apps, they’re&nbsp;gonna need my location, you know? So, is it kind of a level playing field? Depending on what the app is, because some of them would have to have&nbsp;information about you.” (Janice 5/26/21)</p>
<p>More than one respondent noted the persistent tracking behavior of Google, especially related to having an Android phone.&nbsp; “I once a month&nbsp;now&nbsp;get an email from Google, which tells me my itinerary of places…. And I never asked for that. And so they’re obviously just&nbsp;tracking&nbsp;me…. You know, but it’s unnecessary and I never asked for it.” (Janice 7/19/21) “I’ve gone to the store and then within 15 minutes of getting home, Google&nbsp;[is]&nbsp;sending me a consumer feedback opinion survey asking me: Was&nbsp;I at this store and did I buy anything and&nbsp;“Can&nbsp;you take a picture of your receipt? … I mean their confidence isn’t high enough to say, “Yes, this was [Walter],’ but if you fill out the survey then they can close that gap and they now have 100% confidence…. And they’ll give you…$0.75 of Google Play store credit, so “see, it was totally worth it now,” right? ….Sometimes it’ll be a day or two later. But this morning I literally had one like 10 minutes after I got home.&nbsp;I had a notification it’s like&nbsp;‘Hey,&nbsp;where were you out here and which one of these stores in this plaza did you stop at?’&nbsp;So it was a physical purchase.&nbsp;Yep, just by having an Android phone in my pocket, you know.”&nbsp;(Walter 7/18/21)</p>
 <a></a>5. Insights&nbsp; 
<p>The research described in this report was developed to explore consumer perspectives towards location sharing with digital technologies and to&nbsp;validate passing criteria of specific location tests in the Me2BA Respectful Technology Specification.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two primary research questions guided our work:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do people feel when a website or mobile app automatically knows their location?</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When is it acceptable for a website or mobile app to know one’s location?</p>
<p>Key insights from our research include:</p>
 
 Participant sentiment is more negative than positive towards a website or app that “knows your physical location when you first open it”.&nbsp; The terms used to describe websites and apps that are immediately location aware were more often negative than positive. In addition, four of the top five terms used were negative (Creepy, Scary, Annoying and Bad), with “Convenient” being the one positive. 65% of respondents had an overall negative sentiment towards a website that knew their location upon first open; 52% of respondents had an overall negative sentiment towards a mobile app that knew their location upon first open. 30% of respondents indicated that it was “Convenient” for a mobile app to know location information upon first open; this may reflect the element of agency involved in selecting and installing apps creating more tolerance around location awareness in apps versus websites. Android users were slightly more likely to use negative terms to describe location aware apps and websites than iPhone users, and age appears to be a better predictor of sentiment than gender. We found very little difference in sentiment between male and female respondents. When looking at sentiment by age group, we found that, in general, the older the cohort, the more likely they were to select negative adjectives to describe website and app location awareness.&nbsp; Notably, however, the 30-44-year-old cohort were the most tolerant to immediate location awareness – even more so than those younger than them.&nbsp;  
 About 70% of respondents indicated it was unacceptable for either a website or an app to know their location before the creation of an account – a “Me2B Marriage”.<br>
 
 Respondents were more tolerant of location sharing if they had an account than if they did not.&nbsp; If they did have an account, respondents were more comfortable with mobile apps knowing their physical location (45% Yes) than websites (34% Yes). 45% of respondents, however, still felt it was still unacceptable for websites to know their location even with an account. For both websites and mobile apps, “Maybe” responses jumped from 4% (website) and 5% (mobile app) to 20% (both) when respondents have an account, which suggests that having an account increases tolerance for location awareness.&nbsp; Even though we weren’t testing for it, these findings validate the importance of the Me2B Marriage state as meaningful context for how people experience their Me2B relationships. 
 The specific context in which location information is requested – including the website/app’s need for location information – makes a difference in how accepting or tolerant people are towards sharing that information.&nbsp; &nbsp; Participants were more comfortable sharing their “home address” or “exact location” for scenarios where location awareness was relevant.&nbsp; Depending on the scenario, respondents preferred that websites or mobile apps know or remember their location either not at all (“never”), or “only when I am using the site”.  
 Terms used in response to a general question about when location awareness is acceptable highlighted agency and permission, as well as issues of trust and safety, and the importance of specific contexts. The two largest term clusters were “Ask” and “Ask Permission,” while other leading clusters were around related terms such as: Allow, Access, Consent, Reason or Good Reason, as well as: Security, Trust, Privacy, Safe and Safety. Context specific popular terms included: Delivery, Ordering, Weather, Directions and Map. Specific quotes from interviews and focus groups also illustrate the significance of permission, relevance, and control in order for a digital technology to feel respectful.&nbsp; &nbsp; These include: 
 
<p>“I don’t want my location to be tracked, but I give my location out constantly.”</p>
<p>“Location consent is intrusive – often the locations shouldn’t be relevant.”</p>
<p>“If I don’t feel comfortable, I should have the right to deny it’s access.”</p>
<p>“I might be Googling something real quick at work, and I’m like, “why do they need to know my work location?””</p>
<p>“So they’re obviously just&nbsp;tracking&nbsp;me…. it’s unnecessary and I never asked for it.”</p>
 <a></a>6. Conclusion 
<p>Our research demonstrates that location awareness is something people are sensitive to, and that people prefer to have control over the location data being shared.&nbsp; Website and mobile app consumers are aware in most cases that technologies may track their location. The specific context in which this information is requested, and, in particular, the relevance of the location information to the task, affects how accepting people are of sharing their location information – and to what degree, and for what length of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People are more negatively inclined towards a website or mobile app that automatically knows their location – but, again, context matters. Convenience is a primary factor, while such sites are also seen as “Creepy, Scary, Annoying and Bad.” Key variables that make location awareness acceptable are asking permission and having a valid reason for needing this information. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on this research, we find that, in order for people to consider it acceptable for a digital product to know their location, two essential conditions must be met:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 1. The person must have agency over granting access to location information, and 
 2. There needs to be is a legitimate and understandable need for location info. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, our research supports the scoring used in the Me2BA Respectful Technology Specification. Based on this work, we are confident that the current passing/failing behavior related to a website or mobile app’s location awareness in the Me2BA Respectful Technology Specification accurately reflects the tolerances and sensitivities of individual Me-s, and indeed defines respectful behavior relating to the collection and use of location information.</p>

Snapshot: Self-Described “Nerd” / “Still a Kid”<p></p>
<p>Walter is a 34-year-old business trainer in Hazlet, NJ. He expressed himself with humor, answering questions gleefully or with wry cynicism at times. He said that he has “too many” accounts; when asked how many he selected the option for between 51 and 100. He stood out for the sheer number of products and services he could name at once that he uses. He understands that they all track him and is moderately cynical about most of it.

<p>“I’ve gone to the store and then within 15 minutes of getting home, Google&nbsp;[is]&nbsp;sending me a consumer feedback opinion survey asking me: Was&nbsp;I at this store and did I buy anything and&nbsp;“Can&nbsp;you take a picture of your receipt? … I mean their confidence isn’t high enough to say, “Yes, this was [Walter],’ but if you fill out the survey then they can close that gap and they now have 100% confidence…. And they’ll give you…$0.75 of Google Play store credit, so “see, it was totally worth it now,” right? ….Sometimes it’ll be a day or two later. But this morning I literally had one like 10 minutes after I got home.&nbsp;I had a notification it’s like&nbsp;‘Hey,&nbsp;where were you out here and which one of these stores in this plaza did you stop at?’&nbsp;So it was a physical purchase.&nbsp;Yep, just by having an Android phone in my pocket, you know.”</p>

<p>Tammy is a 42-year-old faculty coordinator from Philadelphia, PA. She estimated that she has somewhere in the range of 51 to 100 accounts, most personal accounts but manages many accounts for her university. In that role, she is responsible for reading online policies, but for her personal use she typically just skims privacy policies and terms of service for items specific to the use of her financial information, credit cards and her email address. Her understanding of her technology relationships appears to be typical of an educated consumer. She Is aware that she is being tracked—she used the term “virtual footprint”—and is skeptical of how companies might user her Information. She worries about credit card breaches, but generally is complacent about what she needs to do to get onto a website or app.</p>


Relevant Quotes:&nbsp;<p></p>
<p>“I do feel like the location consent is…very intrusive because a lot of times whatever I might be looking at, the locations shouldn’t be relevant. If I want to take it to the next step and map out directions, or find a store in my area or something like that, I can see why they might want to confirm my location… But when it’s upon opening up a new app or a new website, I find it very frustrating, especially when it’s a website and I’m on a laptop… I might be Googling something real quick at work, and I’m like, “why do they need to know my work location?”&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
Snapshot: Cynical Survivor<p></p>
<p>Kristin is a 50-year-old, retired woman who lives alone in Trafford, PA (near Pittsburgh). When she was working she processed property and casualty insurance claims. She suffers from Multiple Sclerosis. Her disability causes her to rely on delivery services since her mobility is limited. She is an avid Amazon customer and refers to it as her “personal assistant.” She says that she is unconcerned about online fraud or digital harms because she has few assets to lose and feels she needs to live online to survive. She frequently participates in paid marketing studies including programs that pay her to track her technology use. She considers her relationship to technology to be “not good” because her phone and other devices often break on her. She spends a lot of time trying to set up her phone personalization the way she wants “as opposed to what the phone wants me to do” and finds over time this can cause problems.</p>

<p>requires my permission<br>
I want to have the option of them knowing or not. For some things like grocery deliveries of course they need your location!&nbsp; When I am the one looking for a specific website of app, I am more likely to give location info<br>
The person using the app should be given the option to opt into sharing location.<br>
It’s disclosed that knowledge of my whereabouts are a condition of use<br>
It needs to be specifically allowed and then I will judge based on the circumstances. Any app or website that tries to do so without permission is automatically untrustworthy.<br>
Secure and safe that nobody can hack and have some privacy<br>
It needs to tell me what it needs the location for in the app and depending on the use (weather app, survey app I trust) I will accept it. It will also depend on whether I trust that company with my address or not.<br>
when I need directions from where I currently am to where I want to go<br>
when sending items on e-commerce. whenever your using GPS or tracking miles ran/walked.<br>
There has to be a compelling reason and a business need to know.<br>
ask permission<br>
getting directions, baNking, shipping<br>
Has to be a reason I find reasonable<br>
Depends on privacy policy and trustworthiness.<br>
only when using the app<br>
my permission<br>
only if you confirm they can have access to that info<br>
It needs to be location specific for weather or maps/gps/traffic.<br>
Emergency reason only<br>
I need something delivered in person.<br>
To allow it<br>
If something ordered is being delivered to my home.<br>
strong security and trust of website/app<br>
Ok<br>
when it is critical for the app to work<br>
with need to know event.<br>
I look back at my answers and I feel like I’m inconsistent. I do feel like my location is always tracked, through numerous sites. You disclose your location to strangers on eBay and other sites all the time. you also disclose it to numerous businesses routinely. I don’t want my location to be tracked, but I give my location out constantly. why does this apps need my location? for marketing or is the information stored in a database? our personal information is sold to companies all the time. why wouldn’t our locations be as well?<br>
Feel secure with that<br>
If you purchase the app or when you are using it<br>
I need to give consent<br>
That I actually get to allow to set the settings&nbsp; myself<br>
If that is useful for me.<br>
none<br>
Ask permission<br>
If it asks how much you want to have your location tracked<br>
It needs to be on a case by case basis and only upon my approval<br>
If it really needed, if it safe people will say yes . My kids are little so unnecessary I don’t want to share all my data or address.<br>
Ask permission<br>
Explicitly ask and explain in plain English all the ways it will be used.<br>
When you are getting a delivery<br>
I need to be asked permission and knowing my location needs to be necessary<br>
It needs to request permission to collect that data and I will decide if it is acceptable for that specific situation<br>
When I’m searching directions<br>
no,what if they use it to there bad intentions<br>
the service must need my location to function (like a GPS) or for info it needs to verify eligibility or maintain legal requirements (like regional laws, GDPR) and it provides a prompt for me to grant access<br>
I don’t think they should<br>
I need to be purchasing something that is dependent on my location (i.e. Placing an order to be delivered to my location)<br>
If you give them permission or it’s vital for&nbsp; function<br>
I need to be able to give permission, and have several choices about how much info and when it is available<br>
Na<br>
it has to be a trusted and reputable site that won’t misuse my information<br>
it needs to only be for apps where it makes sense that they need that information.<br>
The app or services should ask for permission to access your location and for how long<br>
It needs to ask, and more importantly RECEIVE approval from me to have access to any of that information<br>
Ask permission<br>
they need a reason that is beneficial to me, not them.<br>
100% safe app<br>
safety is important<br>
Getting deliveries<br>
If it’s an app or website that needs to know.&nbsp; A website just to buy things doesn’t need to know my location just the shipping location.&nbsp; Apps that have as nothing to do with location (like an arcade game( don’t need to know where I am or what country I’m in even.<br>
they need to disclose why location is needed and permission to access location information to be granted<br>
If I have chosen to share my info<br>
Your permission<br>
Safe and have a purpose<br>
I don’t think it is okay for a website or an app to track my address.<br>
Never<br>
If something is being delivered to me, for the time, weather, or gps<br>
If I’m getting something delivered<br>
It needs to provide me with a service that depends on location<br>
Upfront information with the legal right to not sale you information to third parties without your consent each and every time<br>
I am ordering something to be delivered. An educational&nbsp; App need to k ow state standards not physical&nbsp; Location<br>

If the situation needs my physical location such as weather or delivery<br>
Giving permission and an actual beer such as shipping and delivery<br>

If it’s using that location to send me something or download correct information.<br>
Data should be private.<br>

It needs to be useful to me. If not why does it need it.<br>

I need to give consent in some way, all my devices block any attempts to get location access by default so I already have this ability. However I see it as a red flag if a non location-based app (like a video app) asks for my location at ALL.<br>

I’m not sure<br>
Tge website or mobile app needs to have a real reason to know my address that is tied directly with what the service does (like a shipping address). The website or app should not remember my location without asking and I allow it. The app or website should really have an actual need for my location for purposes other than ads, collecting personal data, etc.<br>
must be important and not sketchy<br>

 <a></a>Appendix G: Open Ended Responses from scenarios 3-6 
<p>Let’s say you have an account on a MOBILE APP, and the app appears to know your physical location. Is this OK?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe (please Respond)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I know I’ve put my info in or have agreed to them knowing my location&nbsp; Only when asked&nbsp; If they’ve disclosed clearly that is a condition of use, it’s acceptable&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depends on the app and purpose of locating&nbsp; Depends on what it is using it for&nbsp;</p>
<p>if is being used to track my miles when running can be acceptable when in used and allowed p&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay for directions app while it’s being used &nbsp; Depends on privacy policy and trustworthiness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’re on the go so it makes a little more sense. But I could be on my phone at home so it wouldn’t make a difference in that way&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If it is for gps/directions&nbsp;</p>
<p>If asked&nbsp; When I give explicit permission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same answer as the previous question&nbsp;</p>
<p>if it requested and was given permission previously&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same as above&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you allow your location to be known&nbsp; shopping apps, yes. streaming apps, I understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If i have allowed it to know my location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same answer as above it depends on whether I have a reason for wanting or needing the app to know my location.&nbsp; if you entered your location its ok&nbsp;</p>
<p>For apps that need my location but it should ask first every time&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depends on if I agreed to that&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still depends on why it needs it and what it’s using it for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>Weather app is fine others I don’t know&nbsp;</p>
<p>maps&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I let it&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have granted permission&nbsp;</p>
<p>If u allow access&nbsp;</p>
<p>depends&nbsp;</p>
<p>depends on if location is necessary for the app to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>O&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depends on how useful it is for me&nbsp; depends on what the app is used for&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only if I allow&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I allowed it&nbsp;</p>
<p>if i allow it&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have given permission&nbsp;</p>
<p>only if I allow it&nbsp;</p>
<p>Na</p>
<p>only ok if I have previously given location permissions&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same as above&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it’s like social media and we want to post where we are, insurances that want to know how we drive, app that track miles to get rewards, or a game like Pokémon go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if I allow it&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it’s necessary in order to use the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>again, if I think it is okay then it is okay. if I dont give permission it is annoying&nbsp; if I gave it permission in the sign up process&nbsp;</p>
<p>only if I’ve specifically let them know my location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only if I gave explicit permission&nbsp;</p>
<p>depends on if its a food app or rewards app like this&nbsp;</p>
<p>You obviously want your GPS to know your location, but that’s more information than some random app needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have allowed to app to know my location&nbsp;</p>
<p>if u set the setting for it&nbsp;</p>
<p>only if I gave the app permission&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok&nbsp;</p>
<p>It depends on why I am using that website&nbsp;</p>
<p>Permission based&nbsp;</p>
<p>Convenient but not preferred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if I give it permission&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have allowed it&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have enabled location services in the app that is fine, and usually I select only when I use the app is running GPS/location OK&nbsp; Depends on whether I have given them permission to know.&nbsp; Helpful for map locations&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depends on the app, okay for apps that requires location for proper service such as google maps. Not okay for apps that has no business in knowing my location such as offline games&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have them permission&nbsp;</p>
<p>if it needs my location like amazon or a weather app&nbsp; Depends on purpose of app&nbsp; For my weather apps yes but the majority of apps do not need to know your location.&nbsp; needs to ask permission&nbsp; tracking….why&nbsp; If you agree to it&nbsp; If you opt in &nbsp;</p>
<p>You download a new mobile app and before you create an account, it appears to know your physical location. Is this acceptable?</p>
<p>Maybe (please specify)</p>
<p>please see 1st answer&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depends on privacy policy and trustworthiness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you allow your location to be known&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same reason as above&nbsp;</p>
<p>I trust them&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depends on how useful it is for me&nbsp;</p>
<p>If site is for travel or location of goods&nbsp; or services&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I gave it permission&nbsp;</p>
<p>if it asked permission first&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depends on location settings&nbsp;</p>
<p>Permission based&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because it’s going off the actual computer&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maybe (please specify)</p>
<p>If they’ve disclosed clearly that is a condition of use, and it confirms it will no longer track, if I opt out of it , then it’s acceptable&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depends on privacy policy and trustworthiness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thats scary&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a opt-out selection&nbsp;</p>
<p>if it requested and was given permission previously&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you allow your location to be known&nbsp;</p>
<p>I f you were asked permission&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depends how or why I’m looking at that app but let’s face it iPhone is always located&nbsp; by apple products &nbsp;</p>
<p>Access&nbsp;</p>
<p>O&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depends on how useful it is for me&nbsp;</p>
<p>If site is for travel directions. or location of services&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Na&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;did it ask for permission first?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Depends on my risk exposure. If it’s an US entity, I probably don’t care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Permission based&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If allowed&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;depends on the kind of app&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;if it uses the ip area…maybe….some other way sounds intrusive&nbsp;&nbsp;if it uses the ip area…maybe….some other way sounds intrusive&nbsp;</p>

 SIOP special calls have been making a steady progress, Following are notable changes introduced to a SIOP v2 spec 
 Introduced DID Resolution method as part of RP Registration metadata section. When SIOP request is signed, RP’s <code>client_id</code> can be a DID and SIOP can obtain a key signing the request from RP’s DID Doc. The rest of the RP metadata must be obtained from a <code>registration</code> parameter in the SIOP request. 
 Introduced Dynamic SIOP Discovery metadata option. When RP has pre-obtained SIOP’s issuer identifier, it can use OpenID Connect Discovery to obtain SIOP’s metadata, namely <code>authorication_endpoint</code>. When Dynamic discovery is used <code>iss</code> in the ID Token in SIOP response must be a SIOP issued identifier and NOT <code>self-issued.me/v2</code> 
 OIDC4VP specification has been stable with minimum changes. Work on a spec how to issue VCs using OpenID Connect (which has an option to use Credential Manifest) is also happening, so stay tuned!

<p>Author: Wenjing Chu, ToIP Steering Committee Member, LF Edge Governing Board Member, Sr. Director of Technology Strategy at Futurewei</p>



<p>The <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lf-member-summit/">Linux Foundation Member Summit</a> (LFMS) is an annual gathering I always look forward to because it offers organizations and open source community leaders an opportunity to cross domain boundaries and collaboratively manage our common investment in open source. We learn strategies from each other on how to face our biggest common challenges.</p>



<p>But of course, this year wasn’t like any other.</p>



<p>Covid-19 was the elephant in the room. Most of our partners outside of the U.S.—the EU, APAC, even Canada—could not join us in person. For most attendees—including me—this was their first in-person conference since the pandemic began (last year’s LFMS was cancelled at the last minute). But that also meant having the masks, the questionnaires, and yes, vaccine passes (unfortunately, not <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GHP_Interoperability_Blueprint.pdf">Good Health Pass</a> compliant).</p>



<p>What has been happening while we’ve been holed up at home? In this year’s LFMS, two themes stood out:</p>



  The safety of open source software. Numerous high profile, high impact digital system vulnerabilities occupied news headlines in the last year. Software supply chain, especially open source supply chain security, is identified as by far the most urgent shared challenge in open source.&nbsp;  Countering the retreat from collaboration on open source and open standards. Whether caused by the spillover of international tensions into open source, or by the lack of personal interactions during the pandemic, either way we need to restore it. We need more collaboration, not less.  



<p>The relevance of ToIP is clear here: I would go so far as to say that the very center of the open source community’s collective attention is trust. This is true no matter whether it is in the fight against the pandemic in Public Health, the safety of open source software supply chain, FinTech, AgStack (agriculture), public education, green tech, open voice interfaces, or global collaboration in open source and standards.</p>



<p>In that vein, let me share takeaways from several ToIP community members who attended LFMS along with me:</p>



 Judith Fleenor, Director of Strategy Engagements, ToIP Foundation 



<p>“Listening to all the keynotes and speaking with other project leads, I feel there is so much synergy with the Trust Over IP dual stack interoperability design and what other Linux Foundation projects are working on. The hot topic on everyone’s mind is security and digital equality. Interest in creating a landscape of digital trust to help with the challenges the world is facing was high, whether that be in product supply chain, FinTech, AgTech, resource management, health credentials, enterprise identity and access management or software supply chain. The Trust Over IP dual stack has a place in all those ecosystems. I left feeling what we are doing at ToIP is more relevant and needed now than ever.”</p>



 Jim St. Clair, Executive Director, LF Public Health 



<p>“It’s exciting to be able to leverage the groundbreaking work we’ve done in ToIP to develop the ‘trust stack’ to apply that to a broad range of open source health solutions, enabling new ways to incorporate privacy and consent into healthcare delivery. This is especially applicable in LMIC (low and middle income) countries, where digital identity offers a new mechanism for patient identification and delivering health benefits while protecting privacy and self-sovereign identity”.</p>



 Michael Nettles, Senior Vice President for the Policy, Evaluation and Research Center of ETS; ToIP Steering Committee Member 



<p>“The promise of making high quality educational content available and accessible offers the greatest prospect for addressing the national and global challenges of teaching, learning, assessment and recognition. In my inaugural 2021 Linux Foundation summit, I appreciated the opportunity to hear, visit with and learn from new and emerging colleagues and friends from around the globe, about the vast opportunity and potential offered by an expanding open source culture and society, and challenges of identity, security, financial sustainability and the ongoing need for invention.<br><br>The summit was abound with evidence of the benefit of collaboration across industries for addressing common technology, human and content challenges, and also how greater access to knowledge and exposure is leading to expansion of opportunities for learning, invention and commerce. I am looking forward to applying these lessons at the intersection of education and public policy and broadening working to expand the audience of participants.”</p>



 Kaliya Young, Ecosystems Director, Covid Credentials Initiative;<br>Chair, ToIP Good Health Pass Interoperability Working Group 



<p>“In 2004, I went to my first Open Source Convention (OSCON) to promote and represent Identity Commons. I think it was there that I met Brian Belendorf for the first time – I went for many years after that. Being at the LF celebration felt like ‘OSCON for grown-ups’. Many of the people I had first met there were also in Napa last week.&nbsp; The session that I found most interesting were asking about how the open source side of LF and the newly brought in open standards JDF part played well together and about the governance and leadership of process in the foundations communities. ”</p>



<p>This year is the 30th anniversary of Linux (the operating system), and of course the Linux Foundation organized a celebration to mark the occasion. It is also a time for reflection (Confucius says, 三十而立). If we compare today’s technology landscape with that of 1991, we’d agree that technology has marched forward at a remarkable pace for the benefit of humanity. In LF Executive Director Jim Zemlin’s words (my rephrasing, sorry), the easy problems have all been tackled in the last 30 years—only the hard ones remain. I believe one of the hardest remaining nuts to crack is a general purpose trust infrastructure for the Internet. That is our mission at the ToIP community. So my biggest takeaway from LFMS was: let’s get on with it!</p>

<p>Following the&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2021/09/23/trust-over-ip-foundation-issues-its-first-tools-for-managing-risk-in-digital-trust-ecosystems/">September announcement of its first tools for managing risk in digital trust ecosystems</a>, today the ToIP Foundation announced three more pairs of tools to assist in the task of generating digital governance and trust assurance schemes:</p>



  The&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TOIP-GF-Matrix.xlsx">ToIP Governance Framework Matrix</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ToIP-Governance-Framework-Matrix-Companion-Guide-v-1.0.pdf">Companion Guide</a>.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ToIP-Trust-Assurance-and-Certification-Controlled-Document-Template-ToIP-Approved-V1.pdf">ToIP Trust Assurance and Certification Template</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ToIP-Trust-Assurance-Companion-Guide-ToIP-Approved-V1.pdf">Companion Guide</a>.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ToIP-Trust-Assurance-Criteria-Matrix-Template-ToIP-Approved-V1.xlsx">ToIP Trust Criteria Matrix Template</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ToIP-Trust-Criteria-Matrix-Companion-Guide-TCMCG-ToIP-Approved-V1.pdf">Companion Guide</a>.  



<p>“These three new tools—each with its accompanying Companion Guide—are explicitly designed to simplify and streamline the process of developing robust governance for any digital trust community building on ToIP infrastructure,” said Scott Perry, co-chair of the ToIP&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">Governance Stack Working Group</a>&nbsp;(GSWG) and a certified WebTrust auditor. “They can help turn a job that often takes years into one that takes weeks or months.”</p>



<p>The physical credentials we use today, such as credit card and driver’s licenses, have governance frameworks and trust assurance schemes built by governments and industry associations over many years. Now we are moving to digital credentials verified using cryptography, we need to make the process of adapting these existing governance frameworks—or creating new ones explicitly tailored for digital life—much easier and faster.</p>



<p>“Governance is both simple and complex. Everyone has their own ideas of what Governance is and should be. The complexity comes when multiple parties need to agree on what it is and should be,” said Savita Farooqui, GSWG member and primary author of the Governance Framework Matrix. “The Governance Framework Matrix divides the problem in small chunks and provides a flexible framework to define governance and seek agreements.”</p>







<p>The Governance Framework Matrix is a recipe for setting the process of governance in motion.&nbsp; Without a starter set of governance topics to drive discussion and consensus, governing bodies stall in its formation.</p>







<p>The Trust Assurance Companion Guide explains in detail, in plain language, how accountability is generated from community participation in a governance framework.</p>



<p>“The Trust Assurance Template and Companion Guide is akin to the ‘Cliff Notes of Accountability’,” said Drummond Reed, GSWG co-chair. “When you combine it with the Trust Criteria Matrix, it means you don’t need to be a cybersecurity audit professional to grasp what is needed to meet the accountability requirements of your digital trust ecosystem.”</p>

  <p>As we’ve heard from our partners throughout this interview series, the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative in Africa has been a success for all involved. It is, however just the start. It has been a model showcase for how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across the world can gain ‘financial inclusion’ through Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs). The World Bank’s definition of financial inclusion for businesses is that they ‘have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way’.</p>
<p>While financial inclusion for SMEs across the world is a desirable end goal in its own right, it is also important to recognize that the impact of this initiative – when it is rolled out more broadly across multiple emerging markets – will go far beyond the SMEs and financial institutions involved. It has the potential to positively impact the broader economy by significantly strengthening the global supply chain. Let me explain how these two concepts are linked. </p>
<p>The lack of a universal identity prevents SME growth and overseas trade</p>
<p>SMEs make up 90% of businesses globally. However, without legal credibility or a way to officially prove their identity across borders, many of these businesses struggle to access finance, form partnerships or trade overseas – particularly for those in developing markets where a higher risk factor may be perceived. Banks are prohibited from offering them trade finance without undergoing painstaking and costly Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering checks – processes which are hampered without a verified identifier. As a result, the gap between the demand and supply of global trade finance is growing and has now reached <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-11/global-trade-finance-gap-widens-to-1-7-trillion-on-covid-19">$1.7 trillion following a 15% rise since 2018</a>.</p>
<p>The launch of the business identity initiative has illustrated this problem with a focus on Africa. However, it’s important to remember that this is a global challenge faced by SMEs and banks all over the world. And as a result, countless SMEs are prevented from engaging within the global supply chain – whether that is because they can’t invest, scale, or form the necessary partnerships – due to one simple factor. An inability to prove who they are. </p>
<p>The LEI supports expansion of global supply chains and traceability of suppliers</p>
<p>As we’ve seen in Africa, a profusion of benefits arise when financial institutions facilitate the issuance of LEIs to SMEs by becoming <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/validation-agents">Validation Agents</a>. Which is why financial institutions should now be motivated and encouraged to use this model to deliver a globally recognized identity to their SME customers. Not only will it give SMEs broader access to financial services – a clear benefit to banks – but it has the wider impact of enabling SMEs to apply for trade finance and establish contractual, regulated agreements with banks, payments networks and trading partners. The result will be greater participation in domestic and international markets and a bolstered flow of inbound capital, which can then be used to further fuel the market’s economic development. </p>
<p>Imagine a world where millions more SMEs were able to scale and trade, with trust, internationally. How many more – both in terms of volume and diversity – products and services would be available to us all through the global supply chain, and what would the impact of increased competition be on service and price? It’s an aspirational thought and one which lies within reach. By opening up cross-border trading opportunities to more SMEs, the LEI can be seen as a critical – and immediately available – tool in the drive to create a much broader and more competitive supply chain for businesses worldwide. Additionally, using a global open identifier would help bring transparency to supply chain relationships – a critical component of sustainable supply chain monitoring and reporting.</p>
<p>What’s needs to happen next?</p>
<p>All change has to start somewhere – and the success of the first iteration of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative in Africa shows what great potential lies ahead for the global supply chain and subsequently the world’s economy if financial institutions across more countries take up the reins and drive it forward.</p>
<p>The result of greater financial inclusion among SMEs will be a strong, more diverse, transparent and competitive global supply chain ecosystem. Consequently, we could expect to see the positive impact – financial growth and prosperity – across all types of companies across all regions of the world. </p>
<p>Now that the initaitive has been set in motion, GLEIF invites more financial institutions to explore the benefits of becoming a Validation Agent to support – and derive the benefits from – broader financial inclusion among SMEs. GLEIF continues to seek dialogue with governments, NGOs, banks and other stakeholders interested in either expanding the LEI initiative across Africa or in replicating the model in other developing countries. We’re here to help.</p>

 Individual Learner, Communities of&nbsp;Practice <p>Our members are well known for our work on Open Badges, and so we wanted to award badges based on the skills and competencies <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/hello-world-6b5c8caed8db">our intern</a>, Anne, develops during her time with us. Although we outlined some ideas of potential badges before she joined us, we had a hunch that reflective badging, (e.g. awarding assessments based on her as an individual and needs for her future references) would be more beneficial than creating badges in&nbsp;advance.</p>Earn this badge! Design by Bryan Mathers of We Are Open, licensed under&nbsp;CC-BY<p>We Are Open has been all about badges lately! Not only have we been working with Participate on the <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/feed">Keep Badges Weird</a> social learning experience, we’ve also been co-creating badges with Anne. This post outlines how we’ve approached each of&nbsp;these.</p> Co-creating and self awarding badges for our&nbsp;intern <p>In <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tao-of-wao/s02-episode-03-keep-badges-weird">a recent episode</a> of the Tao of WAO podcast, Doug and Laura discussed the value of self-awarding badges. We’ve found that speaking with learners when they are especially motivated or encouraged provides valuable insight into the challenges that person might be experiencing. Self-awarded badges are an opportunity to endorse a learner’s reflective insight as something that provided value to the issuer. They also allow for iteration of the credentials themselves.</p><a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/issuing-open-badges/">Issuing Open Badges</a> by Bryan Mathers is licenced under&nbsp;CC-BY-ND<p>Based on the badges we’d outlined, for example, Anne awarded herself three of the six first-month badges we thought of in advance. She convinced us to combine badges, pointing out that our initial ideas were too “micro” and that that level of granularity wasn’t as valuable to&nbsp;her.</p><p>Anne also awarded herself a “Shadow Jumping” badge, something we wouldn’t have thought of ourselves!</p><blockquote>Description: This badge is issued to people who have “gotten over themselves”. This badge is issued to people who have messaged the entire organization, commented on other people’s work, written public blog posts and otherwise shown that they trust their own instincts and&nbsp;voice.</blockquote><blockquote>Criteria: The earner can self-assign this badge when they start to feel like a part of their organization.</blockquote><p>Anne reflected that her hesitancy to “jump over one’s own shadow” is partially shaped by growing up in a patriarchy. Indeed, women (as well as non-binary folks) often learn from a young age to be more restrained, to not trust their own decisions and be doubtful about their voice. Another aspect of her reflection was that traditional schooling and “normal” work environments reassert hierarchical modes of thinking that seem antithetical to “openness”. Both of these reflections led us to think about how Badges are a great way to work against learned patterns. As we co-create badges, we are also helping the learner to reflect on patterns in society that influence their behaviours.</p><p>The value of co-creating badges with the learner is that badges can be shaped to the needs of the outcome. Learners might expect something outside of the learning objectives a creator attaches to an internship or other learning content. As goals are individual and often intrinsic — focusing on the learners requires co-creation together with&nbsp;them.</p> Co-creation in Communities of&nbsp;Practice <p>In the <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/keep-badges-weird-e26a1b055ff5">Keep Badges Weird</a> community, we are beginning to badge what are called “Value Cycles”. The idea is that activities that happen within communities that are useful to others, and as people participate in these activities, they are creating value for themselves, others and the community at large. We’re particularly interested in the intersection from co-creation and collaboration in a community to being recognised for that co-creation.</p>Keep Badges Weird badges by Bryan Mathers of We Are Open is licensed under&nbsp;CC-BY<p>This exploration is front and center in the <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d">Keep Badges Weird</a> community, with learning activities for people who are <a href="https://app.participate.com/assignments/badge-curious/0152dc95-b28d-4bd8-b151-00068fcd5349">Badge Curious</a> and for those who wish to learn more about Value Cycles in Communities of Practice (e.g. <a href="https://app.participate.com/assignments/cop-curious/140ca80f-4030-4558-af7a-9757ecca3ed5">CoP Curious</a>). The <a href="https://app.participate.com/pages/value-creator">Value Creator activity</a> goes straight to the heart of what it means to be a community member and asks the learner to be useful in a community they are interested in. As with our intern’s “Shadow Jumping” badge, we’re asking people to step outside of a learned behaviour (i.e. waiting to be called on before speaking up or to be invited into a community)..</p><p>We don’t know what kind of conversations will start to emerge when people start to contribute and co-create, but we’re interested to find out! Come on the <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d">Keep Badges Weird</a> journey with us. Earn the badges we’ve already established and co-create badges together alongside other community members by <a href="https://app.participate.com/assignments/build-a-badge/f18f1427-1f32-40ce-9fc2-2b4691eb97d9">building your own&nbsp;badges</a>.</p> Conclusion <p>The great thing about badges is that they can recognise behaviours that just aren’t within the usual domain of we call ‘credentials’. In addition, not only is there a huge amount of value in recognising these behaviours, but also in badges providing a motivational element for individuals who might want to display that behaviour.</p><p>Our examples in this post cover behaviours relating to confidence and working openly, but badging can work for almost any kind of pro-social behaviour. For example, it’s <a href="https://inspirekindness.com/world-kindness-day">World Kindness Day</a> later this week, and kindness is definitely something we should recognise!</p> Next steps <p>Questions?

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Editor’s Note: This is the final blog posting covering the 2021 FIDO Developer Challenge. We invite you to read the previous blog posts to learn more about past stories:</p>



  <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/announcing-the-fido-developer-challenge-for-developers-across-the-globe/">Announcing the FIDO Developer Challenge for Developers Across the Globe</a>  <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-developer-challenge-welcoming-teams-to-the-implementation-stage/">FIDO Developer Challenge: Welcoming Teams to the Implementation Stage</a>  



<p>This year’s FIDO Developer Challenge reached a successful conclusion, with a ceremonial event during <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/authenticate-2021-conference/">Authenticate 2021</a> in Seattle. The recorded <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-developer-challenge/">video</a> of the ceremony is available now, and we’re pleased to share more detailed stories of the three finalists as well as the rest of the teams that made it to the final stage.</p>



 Leaders of the Top Three Teams. 



<p>Gold Winner – Lockdrop</p>



<p>Lockdrop, a company based in Toronto, Canada, strengthened their document transfer service using end-to-end encryption with WebAuthn as an MFA authentication option. The team wants to help businesses and people exchange larger datasets easily and securely, a problem that is prevalent across most industries and results in people falling back to insecure and/or archaic forms of data transfer such as email, fax, CD-ROMs (yes, CD-ROMs!), and USB sticks.</p>



<p>Silver Winner – Shaxware</p>



<p>Shaxware is a company located in Tokyo, Japan. They created a Proof of Concept, fashioning the Japanese National ID Card (My Number Card) into a FIDO roaming authenticator. They proposed to extend WebAuthn by using the external IC card as a primary digital certificate.</p>



<p>Bronze Winner – SoundAuth</p>



<p>SoundAuth is the team name for a company (Trillbit) based in Boston with R&amp;D staff stationed in India. This team built a FIDO MFA solution that leverages data over sound technology to provide a seamless user experience while eliminating the need to rely on an additional hardware token or internet connectivity.</p>



<p>From the initial pool of applicants, fourteen teams from eight different countries (Canada, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, USA, Vietnam) competed throughout the FIDO implementation stage – including the three finalists detailed above. There were also many concepts that did not make the top three yet have shown compelling ways to leverage the strength and usability of FIDO Authentication. Examples include:</p>



  a FIDO and AI-based remote test proctoring system (India)  a web payment system, leveraging FIDO-based digital wallet (France)  a FIDO-based online note-taking apps for developers (Vietnam)  FIDO-based VPN access (South Korea)  FIDO and AI-based assisted technology for visually impaired people (South Korea)  



<p>Thanks and final thoughts</p>



<p>The 2021 FIDO Developer Challenge was made possible by the support and active engagement from the event <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-developer-challenge-our-sponsors/">sponsors</a> – who not only helped fund the event operations and prizes, but gave hands-on feedback and guidance as judges. Thanks also to the W3C and WebAuthn community for guidance and support through the FDC Discord Channel – it was great to see so many people weighing in to help these development teams.</p>



<p>We were very pleased to have built off of our prior developer hackathon efforts in Korea, to have brought the challenge global, and to have added&nbsp; a focus on public APIs. The Challenge demonstrated that the combination of open technology coupled with the entrepreneurial vision of a developer will result in inspiring outcomes and innovation. We look forward to expanding this effort in 2022. Please don’t hesitate to reach out (<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/contact/">https://fidoalliance.org/contact/</a>) should you have any feedback or suggestions on the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Evaluating the total number of DIDs and the impact on the overall utility of the Energy Web Token&nbsp;(EWT).  Decarbonizing power grids with… software? <p>Surprisingly, the biggest blocker in decarbonizing the electric grid is the lack of connectivity and shared standards, not the lack of new renewable energy resources. The energy sector needs a secure, scalable way to identify the growing number of clean energy resources, verify attributes about them (like location, capabilities, and financial relationships), and manage permissions and/or behaviors based on those attributes. In short, modern grids need an identity and access management solution tailored for the sheer volume and diversity of clean energy resources in the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Legacy approaches are not up to the task; it’s simply not feasible for any single company or platform to manage everything, and relying on point-to-point integrations between individual systems is too costly and complex to manage at scale. This is exactly why we are building open-source tools to unlock the full potential of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) with the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS).</p> What are&nbsp;DIDs? <p>A DID is a digital, verifiable identity that is user-generated and not coupled to any centralized institution. It can be used to identify any object or subject, such as a person, an organization, a device (an electric vehicle on a smart meter), and non-tangible assets (like contracts). DIDs allow users to have control over both their identities and any data associated with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Instead of a central entity being in charge of issuing identities and verifying credentials for each identity, any individual or asset can create an identity, and then establish verified credentials over time through interactions with peers or authorities on a trusted, decentralized network.</p><p>A DID resides in a DID registry, which in the case of Energy Web, is on the Energy Web Chain. Because Energy Web DID technology is developed based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">established W3C standards</a>, it is flexible enough to work with any technology and use case within the energy sector and outside&nbsp;it.</p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about DIDs, here’s a website that simulates and explains how they work, the <a href="https://did-explainer.energyweb.org/#/default-dashboard">Energy Web — DID Explainer</a>. You can also dive into details in our Gitbook (<a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/foundational-concepts/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity — Energy Web Digital Infrastructure (gitbook.io)</a>)</p> What is the DID business&nbsp;model? <p>Energy Web DIDs are created and controlled by users. They are free to use and open source. Anyone can use our entire DID tech stack and the Energy Web Blockchain without paying for it, except for the blockchain transaction (gas) fees. This would be the equivalent of launching a website on your own server, using free, open-source technologies like Linux, MySQL, and WordPress. It’s perfectly possible, but people and companies rarely do it, because this approach is inconvenient and cumbersome. It takes a lot of effort to launch a website like this, and it takes a lot of effort to maintain it. In the end, this approach tends to be quite expensive after considering all the time, effort, and associated risks.</p><p>What usually happens is users buy services from specialized providers. In the website example, users can buy pre-configured virtual servers from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services or Azure or decide to buy a managed website service from a website builder like Wix or Squarespace. These services come with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) that guarantees the level of service users can expect such as website uptime, storage space, or the number of CPU cores. Users pay for convenience and reliability delivered by the specialized service providers because after considering all the costs and risks, this tends to be a cheaper solution.</p><p>At Energy Web, we understand that in order to have any meaningful adoption of enterprise applications using decentral technology, a DID-based tech stack has to be offered in a convenient and reliable way as well. This is why we’re developing the Decentralized Service Level Assurance (DLSA) solution. With this solution, users will be able to subscribe to professional-grade services delivered by specialized service providers. More about&nbsp;DSLA:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/whats-new-in-ew-dos-c7abc2f1f623">What’s new in&nbsp;EW-DOS?</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/the-utility-of-the-utility-token-for-utilities-69c9be603a59">The Utility of the Utility Token for Utilities</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/how-companies-benefit-from-participating-in-the-public-ew-dos-infrastructure-c7f31735a196">How companies benefit from participating in the public EW-DOS infrastructure</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/its-coming-quality-of-service-guarantees-for-decentralized-technologies-c0e133ebe644">Coming soon: quality-of-service guarantees for decentralized technologies</a>  <p>The main purpose of DSLA is to support DIDs using EW-DOS infrastructure. Therefore, we believe that the total number of DIDs in the ecosystem will be a good proxy for evaluating the economic activity on the Energy Web stack and the overall utility of the Energy Web Token&nbsp;(EWT).</p> DIDs in the energy&nbsp;sector <p>The first, primary users adopting DIDs on the open-source EW-DOS infrastructure will be enterprises operating in the energy sector. This is happening because of the groundbreaking transformation in the energy industry: customer spend on clean energy is on track to eclipse utility spending on all&nbsp;energy.</p><p>Customers are investing in clean energy assets. These assets are the future of the energy sector: battery storage, smart AC, electric cars and charging stations, solar systems, the list goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>A fundamental challenge faced by energy companies is caused by the fact that most of these clean energy assets are not integrated with market participant operating systems. Energy Web solves this problem by building operating systems for energy grids using DID-based, open-source software and standards. Open-source digital infrastructure makes it possible for customer-owned assets to enroll and participate in coordinated grid operator programs:</p><p>In the future, each energy sector stakeholder and eventually each asset will have its own DID. This includes consumers, companies operating in the space (grid operators, aggregators, renewable energy installers, EV charging network operators, independent power producers), solar systems, batteries, EVs, EV chargers, smart meters, and smart thermostats.</p><p>Energy Web has already implemented DID infrastructure for the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) in their <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/california-grid-operator-launches-new-demand-flexibility-platform-enhancements-to-flex-alert-system-e01ae8030da0">Flex Alert program</a>. We’re also working on rolling out DIDs for Australian Energy Market Operator (<a href="https://energyweb.org/aemo/">AEMO</a>). This architecture also underpins <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/catalonian-grid-operator-electra-caldense-energy-web-and-bamboo-energy-announce-grid-flexibility-51c75e5bcc25">ELECTRA CALDENSE</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/elia-group-and-energy-web-launch-multi-year-strategic-partnership-be2c5d87395f">EV DASHBOARD with ELIA</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/austrian-power-grid-and-energy-web-foundation-launch-proof-of-concept-to-use-distributed-energy-d9a378f5f5ee">APG</a>.</p> Potential demand <p>We estimate, that by 2030 there can be between 200 million and 1.2 billion DIDs using the Energy Web tech stack. Around 83% of them will belong to energy assets like electric cars, solar PV systems, smart meters, and the rest (about 17%) will belong to people interacting with these assets. Here’s the logic behind our estimates:</p><p>First, we took data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance and Rocky Mountain Institute that forecast the total number of green and flexible energy-related devices. All the devices that would potentially use DIDs. These devices&nbsp;include:</p>  Storage System Installations  Electric Vehicles  EV Chargers  Smart Thermostats (AC /&nbsp;Heating)  Water Heaters  HVAC  Water Heaters  Commercial Appliances  Commercial Lighting  Solar PV Inverters  Wind Turbines  Smart Meters  <p>The industry forecasts that the total number of devices will grow from 2.2 billion in 2022 to 3.8 billion in&nbsp;2030.</p><p>Given the strong network effects of DID technology, the exponential rate of adoption should be expected. Therefore, we assumed 3 scenarios for the adoption of the EW tech&nbsp;stack:</p>  The optimistic scenario, where we assume the DID usage to increase 8% month to month (for every 100 DIDs we assume 108 DIDs next&nbsp;month)  The pessimistic scenario, with a 6% monthly usage&nbsp;increase  The “in the middle” scenario, with a 7% monthly&nbsp;increase  <p>For all 3 scenarios, given Energy Web’s existing footprint in several of the world’s largest energy markets, we assume a starting point market share of 0.1% (1/10 of a percent) in 2022 for the commercial, B2B applications and 0.02% (2/100 of a percent) for domestic applications and smart&nbsp;meters.</p><p>Then, we estimate how many additional DIDs will be issued to people interacting with the assets. This number ranges between 0.1 (we assume in that case that 1 person will manage 10 devices) and 1 (1 person per device). On average, we expect 1 person to interact with around 5&nbsp;devices.</p><p>This means that in 2022 we’re expecting to issue a total of around 728,000 DID for devices and people. We believe reaching close to 1 million DIDs in 2022 is feasible based on our current pipeline and recently completed project. For example, the above-mentioned CASIO Flex Alert can reach all California residents, close to 40 million&nbsp;people.</p><p>Based on the adoption scenario, we arrive at 3 different numbers of DID in&nbsp;2030:</p>  201 million DID and a market share of 4% for the conservative scenario,  almost 500 million DIDs and a 10% share for the “in the middle” scenario&nbsp;and  1.2 billion DIDs and a 25% market share for the optimistic scenario  <p>Here is the breakdown of different types of devices using our DID, for all 3 scenarios.</p>pessimistic“In the&nbsp;middle”optimistic<p>The goal of issuing 200 million and more DIDs is very ambitious but doable by 2030. The middle adoption scenario assumes issuing almost 83 million DID to individuals by 2030. For context, this means onboarding around 16% of the existing customers of energy companies that are the current members of Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>To put these numbers in perspective, we compared them to the entire IoT market (the energy sector devices are just a subset of the broader market of connected IOT devices). The total number of connected IoT devices is expected to reach 27 billion by 2025, growing from the current 12 billion already connected devices. [source: State of IoT 2021: Number of connected IoT devices growing 9% to 12.3 B (iot-analytics.com)]</p><p>This means that in 2025 all the energy assets will account for just 10% of the total IoT market, and the EW DIDs’ share will be only around 0.04% (4/100 of a percent) (yes, the tiny purple line on the chart&nbsp;below).</p><p>Given the fact that energy-related devices underpin every aspect of our professional and personal lives, it is quite possible that Energy Web DID technology will be adopted by many other industries and sectors thanks to its flexibility, security, and focus on privacy. A shared, open-source solution widely used by regulators, grid operators, energy companies, solar installers, EVs, and consumers would be much welcomed by industries like agriculture, logistics, smart appliances, and many&nbsp;more.</p><p>Finally, Energy Web is a non-profit organization, and there’s no need to charge high fees and extract value to generate profits for shareholders. The value-added by DSLA and DID solutions will be transferred back to the Energy Web community. This means a win-win situation for existing and new users of the platform: thanks to DSLA, there will be no downsides or disincentives for using DID technology. Instead, there will be very strong, positive network effects, making our ambitious DID adoption and related decarbonization goals possible.</p><p>If you care about climate change and support our mission, here are additional resources explaining how you can <a href="https://lab.energyweb.org/">get involved!</a></p> About Energy&nbsp;Web <p>Energy Web (EW) is a global nonprofit organization accelerating a low-carbon, customer-centric electricity system by unleashing the potential of open-source, decentralized technologies.

<p>TL/DR:</p>  The London upgrade is coming to the Energy Web Chain (EWC) on November&nbsp;10th.  This update will modify the transaction fee market, and keep the EWC aligned with the latest developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.  If you are running an EWC node, you must <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/706478224/Updating+the+Client">update it to a London-compatible client</a> and <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/2568257551/Chainspec+update+for+London+Hardfork">update the chainspec</a> as soon as possible. EWC validators have already completed all the necessary updates.  If you are an EWC user or EWT holder, no action is required.  <p>In August 2021 the Ethereum mainnet implemented the London upgrade, which introduced <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/07/15/london-mainnet-announcement/">five improvement proposals</a> that modified the way transaction fees and gas refunds are handled. Combined, these updates improve the overall performance and usability of EVM blockchains (including the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain).</p><p>In September 2021, after observing the successful Ethereum upgrade, <a href="https://validators.energyweb.org/">the EWC validators</a> voted to adopt London on the EWC as well. Since then the EWC validators have successfully implemented the upgrade on the <a href="https://volta-explorer.energyweb.org/">Volta test network</a> and are now preparing for the upgrade to occur on the main&nbsp;EWC.</p><p>The EWC London upgrade will occur <a href="http://explorer.energyewb.org">at block 14,735,788</a>, which will occur on or around Wednesday, 10 November (the precise time will depend on block time variation). All full node operators must <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/706478224/Updating+the+Client">update their node to a London-compatible client</a> and <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/2568257551/Chainspec+update+for+London+Hardfork">implement the London chainspec</a> prior to the transition block. Due to subtle variations in the EWC block time, it is recommended to perform the update several days prior to the expected transition date.</p> FAQ <p>Who does this announcement impact?</p><blockquote>This announcement only impacts people or organizations that are operating a full node on the EWC. All EWC node operators should update the client and chainspec as soon as possible. As of the time of publication, all EWC validators have already completed the necessary updates to successfully implement the London upgrades.</blockquote><p>If I’m an EWT holder, but I’m not operating my own full node, is there anything I need to&nbsp;do?</p><blockquote>No, if you connect to the EWC via the public RPC and Metamask, an exchange (including Kucoin, Kraken, Liquid, Bitmart, or Hotbit), a web wallet (e.g., MyCrypto), or hardware wallet (e.g., Trezor, Ledger) then you do not need to take any&nbsp;action.</blockquote><p>Why is the London upgrade happening on the&nbsp;EWC?</p><blockquote>The <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">EWC is a public, proof-of-authority EVM blockchain</a> and it benefits from adopting the latest upgrades and improvements from the wider Ethereum community. The EWC validators voted to adopt the upgrades contained in the London upgrade in September 2021.</blockquote><p>What will happen before, during, and after the&nbsp;upgrade?</p><p>As mentioned above, the decision to proceed with the upgrade is made by the EWC validators via the <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/technology/the-stack/trust-layer-energy-web-chain/energy-web-chain-governance">established governance process</a>. After the decision is approved and before the upgrade occurs, all EWC validators and other node operators will update their node clients and chain specs. During the upgrade (i.e., at the specified transition block), the new rules defined within the improvement proposals will take effect, creating a “new and improved” version of the EWC. There are no expected operational or performance impacts to the EWC during the upgrade. Following the upgrade, users and node operators can continue to interact with the EWC as&nbsp;normal.</p><p>If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please get in touch via our <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/psraNwqGqp">Discord</a> channels.</p> About Energy&nbsp;Web <p>Energy Web (EW) is a global nonprofit organization accelerating a low-carbon, customer-centric electricity system by unleashing the potential of open-source, decentralized technologies.

<p>Fall 2021: COVID vaccination acceptance criteria across the world are inconsistent. An independent 3rd party criteria evaluator solves this using a different approach to “Zero-Knowledge Proof”.</p>



 List of Contributors

 Executive Summary 



<p>In principle, Verified Credentials (VCs) are standardized so that a VC for COVID-19 health status (status = vaccinated or negative test or positive anti-bodies) is accepted by all jurisdictions. However, in the July/Aug 2021 timeframe, most provincial, state, continental and national jurisdictions are defining incompatible acceptance criteria. While this lack of compatibility may resolve over time, it is the current reality and will probably repeat in other VC domains.</p>



<p>With the currently defined Issuer/Holder/Verifier interaction, supporting different acceptance criteria per jurisdiction requires some potentially undesirable solutions. Two examples:</p>



  Generation of jurisdiction-specific VCs from potentially multiple Issuers for travel  Verifiers making requests for richer credential data (with Holder consent) for the Verifier to use jurisdiction-specific evaluation criteria, which significantly increases the potential for private data exposure and capture by “bad actors.”  



<p>The credential data required for the different acceptance criteria reviewed was 95% common. The evaluation criteria reviewed could be supported by a combination of standard data queries and procedural logic.</p>



<p>It is proposed to use a “rules engine,” ideally as a separate component (Verifiable Claim Evaluator or VCE) in the Issuer, Holder, Verifier, Ledger VC workflow, to provide an independent, 3rd party evaluation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The VCE acts as a “Digital Notary (or Notary Public)” in that it is an entity certified and trusted by Governance Authorities and processes private and sensitive information, rendering a result, while protecting the client’s (Holder’s) privacy.</p>



<p>The Verifier presents the evaluation criteria (Claims Expression) to the VCE, and the Holder presents credential data to the VCE.</p>



<p>The VCE executes the expression against the data and returns the result and execution log to the Verifier and Holder. Ideally, the result is a simple pass/fail.</p>



<p>This solution provides a path to a single VC, where Verifiers can apply different evaluation criteria against VC credential data that is transparent, secure, and preserves data privacy.</p>



 Problem 



<p>The reality of COVID-19 vaccines, tests and acceptance across countries, states and provinces is much more complex in August-2021 than anyone expected in August-2020. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_COVID-19_vaccine_authorizations">21 vaccines</a> “approved” for emergency use somewhere in the world and more in development. However, in many countries, only two or three vaccines have been approved by their federal health authority, biased towards vaccines manufactured within their borders.</p>



<p>Different jurisdictions are currently basing what they will accept from international travellers, primarily based on their own local public health policies. Some specific examples:</p>



  US Center for Disease Control (CDC), Cruise Lines (&amp; others following CDC)&nbsp;  Only Moderna and Pfizer vaccines  No mixing of vaccines (e.g., two shots: AstraZeneca, followed by Pfizer – widely practiced in Canada, Spain, UK, …)    France  AstraZeneca, but not if manufactured in India    



<p>The good news is that the capture of vaccine and test manufacturing data, plus what is recorded at the time of vaccination or administering an infection or recovery test, is being driven by a worldwide convergence on medical data structure, of which the Fast Healthcare Interoperability (FHIR) schema(s) is a leading example.</p>



<p>A substantial problem, which is outside the scope of this paper, is that there is little agreement on technical (smartphone) and non-technical (paper) solutions for presenting VCs are accepted (in general and COVID-19 related VCs in particular), even within borders.</p>



<p>The vaccine/test/recovery use cases, which have been a driver for VC design and implementation for the last 18 months, defined assumptions/goals, which have culminated in the Good Health Pass.</p>



  Vaccines and tests approved and administered in one jurisdiction will be accepted in others.<br>  The ideal privacy-preserving VC presentation&nbsp; and acceptance criteria (across jurisdictions) is:  Vaccination status or Anti-body/recovery test status: pass  COVID-19 infection test status: negative<br>    If the Verifier requires more data, it can request consent from the Holder for access to some or all of the VC credentials (and their data), for which it can apply jurisdiction-defined evaluation criteria.  



<p>Some observations on these assumptions, based on the recent acceptability decisions outlined earlier.</p>



<p>1 – Universal COVID-19 vaccine/test/recovery interoperability is a policy (political) problem that technology cannot solve and suggests this may not be true, even long-term.</p>



<p>2 – 1+2 Is conceptually the correct answer but is not being adopted across enough leading jurisdictions to become the worldwide standard, which, again, may not be true even in the long term.</p>



  One solution would be to have VCs Issued for each jurisdiction, with jurisdiction-specific evaluation criteria embedded with the VC. This addresses the data privacy issues of point 3 (below)<br><br>However, this leads to an explosion of VCs across jurisdictions and the potential problem of different jurisdictions only accrediting Issuers within their jurisdiction (which creates a nightmare for travellers).<br>  The GHP “Pass” fails to be privacy-preserving as name and date of birth are included along with pass/fail  



<p>3 – Has several privacy and transparency issues</p>



  The Verifier may legitimately require some Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive personal data to do their evaluation. However, there is no guarantee that the Verifier will not identify or re-identify the Holder with that data or record it for future use.<br>  The Verifier, in the current workflow, is opaque to how it uses the credential data. No mechanism exists to present how they will evaluate the data during the acceptance of the VC, nor is there a governance mechanism defined to ensure fair and equitable evaluation.  



 Scenarios/Use Cases 



<p>Note: while other use cases could be added to support the idea of a 3rd party evaluation rules engine, the GHP use case(s) are (at least initially) strong enough on their own for this Position Paper.</p>



 Non-Technical Requirements (Business, User)&nbsp; 



<p>The VCE’s role is to be an intermediary between the VC Holder and Verifier to process a VC held by the Holder to provide either:</p>



  Evaluation of a VC’s claims to a Verifiers criteria (health status)  Repackage VC claims to a Verifier’s schema requirements  



<p>Note: In many ways, a VCE supports a Verifier-controlled version of VC presentation (vs. the existing Issuer/Holder centric model). This could also be viewed as an example of a Smart Contract</p>



<p>Its role is to accept data (VC &amp; claims) from the Holder and either an evaluation criteria or transformation expression against that data from the Verifier and returns a defined result without revealing PII or sensitive data.</p>



<p>What the Verifier can request is subject to governance. The Verifier cannot request the return of PII or sensitive data, either barred by jurisdictional governance (can’t ask for birthdate or criminal records), or, where allowed by governance, without consent of the Holder</p>



 Solution 











<p>Assumptions:</p>



  A VClaim Evaluator (VCE) is a component that is an intermediary in the Holder/Verifier workflow which acts as a proxy in both directions. The VCE  Intercepts requests or responses between Holder and Verifier where it plays an active role  Acts as a transparent proxy. For example, establishing authentication, authorization and trust between the Verifier and Holder&nbsp;    



<p>The APIs and protocols of the Holder/Verifier workflow are retained, with extensions and possibly alternate APIs to support the model (design and implementation detail).</p>



  The Issuer issues a VC to the Holder which contains a relatively rich set of claims data that includes all the data required during evaluation by any arbitrary evaluation of a certain type (e.g., Good Health Pass). In the case of the GHP, the claims data is a superset (vs. a minimal set) of COVID-19 vaccination, infection and antibody test data.<br>  A Verifier has created an evaluation expression as a file and stores and registers it (with a signature) on the ledger.&nbsp;  The expression could be a JSON or XML definition or an executable (e..g., JavaScript, Python)  The expression returns a JSON object which can contain results from the evaluation.  The expression must be available in human-readable form and must be signed via a crypto hash of the contents    To meet the needs for evaluation expression capability in the known use cases, the evaluation (rules) engine must be capable of:  Basic query capability and on the VC credential data&nbsp;  Procedural logic on the returned data (e.g., to determine a pass/fail status) and crafting a JSON response    



<p>Workflow</p>



  A Holder makes are quest to the Verifier (request to approve Global Health Pass)  The Verifier requests a VCE sandbox to instantiate a VCE of a specified type (and possibly version), establishing trust and validating that the VCE is certified and the right version, etc. and registers its result endpoint with the VCE  The Verifier and Holder establish trust  The Verifier notifies the Holder that it will use “proof by VCE” plus a reference to the VCE.  The Holder registers its result endpoint with the VCE    The Verifier makes a “VCE proof” request to the VCE, with the following parameters:  Reference to the evaluation expression (on the ledger)&nbsp;  The VC required from the Holder  (optional/TBD) an expression tailored request for the VC claims data required    The VCE  Requests the expression from the ledger and verifies it  Asks for the Holder for consent the relevant VC credential data    The Holder&nbsp;  Evaluates and responds (consents) to the VC credential data request and returns the data via a container (e.g. ACDC) to the VCE    The VCE  Issues a consent receipt  Evaluates the Verifier expression  Returns the results and audit log of the evaluation to both the Verifier and Holder    



 Pros, Cons and Vulnerabilities 



  Pros  Allows arbitrary expressions against a known VC credential data model/schema  Drives agreement on a single VC credential data schema (which may be easier to attain than agreement on VC acceptance criteria  Privacy-preserving – supports access to PII and sensitive data for evaluation without revealing that data outside the VCE  Provides transparency on how VC acceptance criteria are evaluated and an audit<br>log    Cons  Requires more credential data to be included in a GHP VC than the current model.&nbsp;  Assumes agreement on a common VC Credential data schema.  Cannot address the “political” problem of Country X not accepting VC credential data from Country Y (which is also true of the current GHP model)    Vulnerabilities  Subject to abuse without enforced governance    



 Solution Requirements 



<p>Governance:&nbsp;</p>



  All VCEs (and likely all components of this type) must be a validated and approved component, evaluated by a governance authority or authority certified agent/agency  



<p>Component Security:</p>



  The VCE must be a “sibling” to the Holder and Verifier in terms of protocols, trust exchange, authentication and authorization, signing requirements, etc. conceptually, but may have design and implementation differences due to functionality.&nbsp;  The VCE must be signed, including a cryptographic hash of its executable to ensure no tampering.  



<p>Data Privacy provisions:</p>



  A VCE Is a temporary object which is instantiated on request and is “destroyed” on completion:  Execution environment – ideally executes in a 3rd party “sandbox”  Lifetime – released on completion of an evaluation  Data Access – No write access to persistent storage (may have internal cache)  Access to the component is via API calls to provide inputs and retrieve results (errors, state/status)  Evaluation results are returned to participating parties (Holder and Verifier, but could be others) which must register callbacks to receive API output and audit logs    



<p>Technology:</p>



  The technology and evaluation expression language, syntax and format for the evaluation engine are entirely open.&nbsp;  It is desirable that for a given Rules Engine that uses expressions for a given purpose, that there are standards such that multiple VCEs (or other “Rules Engines”) can fill the same role. Inversely it would be useful for Rules Engines for different purposes could use the same language/syntax/format (e.g., JavaScript)&nbsp;  



<p>COVID-19 VC evaluation capabilities:</p>



  The evaluation (rules) engine must support procedural logic and generate (and consume) data/query requests via APIs in a web environment, including against DDE Data Containers (e.g. ACDC)

<p>When I first came across <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a>, I was still a student at the University of Applied Sciences in Utrecht. I had never contributed to open source, and only minimally understood how the process of contributing and maintaining even functioned. Now, only two years later, my company (<a href="https://animo.id/">Animo</a>) specializes in building SSI solutions using Hyperledger Aries and other SSI technologies, and I am one of the core contributors to a lot of the open source libraries built on top of it.</p>



<p>In this blogpost I’m going to share what it’s like to be a maintainer for the Hyperledger Aries project. You’ll learn how you can start contributing and maybe even set yourself on a path to becoming a maintainer.</p>



 The ecosystem 



<p>Hyperledger Aries provides standards and protocols focused on holding and exchanging verifiable credentials, but it is much more than that. Hyperledger Aries provides the foundation for peer-to-peer interactions, exchange of verifiable credentials and secure messaging. It provides standards through the so-called <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Aries RFCs</a> and has open source implementations in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go">Go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx">Rust</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">.NET</a>.</p>



<p>Aries uses <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0005-didcomm/README.md">DIDComm</a> for a secure messaging protocol, but <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm is a lot more than just a way to exchange credentials</a>. Once you start getting a sense of the enormous potential of DIDComm, it’s difficult not to get excited. Aries provides you with an agent that helps you manage your digital interactions, just like your browser helps you interact with the web.</p>



<p>At <a href="https://animo.id/">Animo</a>, we’re leveraging Aries at the core of almost all of our projects. We contribute to several open source frameworks, develop applications on top of these frameworks and build end-to-end solutions using verifiable credentials. For example, we recently started a pilot with the <a href="https://odyssey.org/past-editions/odyssey-2020/public-safety-and-security/inclusive-safety-communities">Centre for Emergency Control Room Innovation</a> that leverages DIDComm for secure communication and exchange of location between the emergency call centre staff and a qualified volunteer. Although we are involved with several Aries frameworks, we have a particular expertise in (and fondness for) Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ).</p>



<p>We use AFJ for most of our projects. We’ve contributed a lot to it because, simply put, we saw the potential of the framework and someone needed to do the work to get it there. Being a maintainer of a project means more than just contributing code.It means you’re responsible for the overall direction and vision of the project. Maintainers concern themselves with the roadmap, the place of the project within the ecosystem and coordination of working group efforts and calls. On a more operational level, there’s also a lot of reviewing pull requests, addressing github issues, answering questions on Rocket.Chat and writing documentation. If this sounds time consuming, that’s because it is. But putting in the effort is essential to creating long lasting, structurally sound code that can be freely used by anyone to build amazing things.</p>



<p>Contributing to a project hosted by Hyperledger, specifically, means you get a lot of the needed infrastructure other projects might not have. There is a wiki for meeting notes, a Zoom account for our meetings, GitHub repos, unlimited CI minutes, a chat platform, and assistance from the Hyperledger staff when needed.</p>



 Becoming a maintainer 



<p>I can recommend that every developer be involved with open source, and every company invest in open source software. Open source software provides the foundation for almost all software in the world, and is essential for a world where self-sovereign identity becomes a standard.</p>



<p>Besides, working on open source software can be a really good learning experience. You get to work with some of the greatest minds of the industry on the future of digital identity. Maintaining and contributing to Hyperledger, and open source in general, has been really valuable for me. There is something magical about how open source works, and how we can work together towards a shared goal, even if you’re halfway across the world.</p>



<p>I can imagine that sounds a bit intimidating. Luckily, you don’t have to start out this way. You can start the way we all do, by quietly listening to working group calls until you find something you want to participate in. Once you decide you’d like to become a contributor or a maintainer, you’ll find that communities will be happy to help you get started.</p>



<p>Here are some of my personal tips to get involved with a Hyperledger project. I’ve used the AFJ community as an example throughout.</p>



  Attend working group calls – Working group calls are the perfect place to introduce yourself and show your ambition to contribute to the project. This is also the place to stay up to date on the current and planned work of the project. (<a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ARIES/Framework+JS+Meetings">AFJ Meetings</a>)  Get familiar with the codebase – Even though it can be daunting and hard to make sense of a project at first, it is important to get familiar with the project. You should make it as easy as possible for maintainers to review your initial PR and get it merged! (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript">AFJ Repository</a>)  Answer questions on Rocket.Chat – Help other people get started with the project and answer their questions! You learn a lot by finding answers to other people’s questions. And also don’t hesitate to ask questions yourself. There are a lot of people with very specific domain knowledge eager to answer your questions. (<a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries">Aries Channel</a>, <a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries-javascript">AFJ Channel</a>)  Look at open issues – Knowing what to work on can be complex when getting familiar with a new project. Github issues often describe missing features or bugs, which can be a great way to find the first item to work on. In AFJ, we currently have more than 70 open issues,&nbsp; all waiting for someone to pick them up. (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/issues">AFJ Open Issues</a>)  Read about the topic – Read about the topics that underpin the project. For SSI, I recommend reading the <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self Sovereign Identity</a> book. If you’re ready to get a bit more in-depth, I recommend to start reading the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Aries RFCs</a>. These are fundamental for contributing to any Aries project.  



<p>My best advice is to experience it yourself. Even the smallest pull request is valuable to a project and can give you the confidence to keep going. And, before you know it, you’re the maintainer of a project yourself.</p>



<p>If you have any questions, or if you’d like to make contributing to open source software your job, you can reach me at timo@animo.id. We’re always looking for motivated and ambitious people to join our team and are always happy to help new contributors get started.</p>

A decentralized social graph protocol to describe the relationships between users and entities will be a critical backbone for this. </p><p>Using Ceramic, CyberConnect is building a new decentralized social graph protocol. This critical piece of web3 infrastructure is blockchain-agnostic and openly accessible for developers to build decentralized social networks and other apps in the Metaverse.</p><p>Want to get the latest updates on CyberConnect? Follow the team on <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberConnectHQ">Twitter</a>!</p> The downfalls of today's gated social networks  <p>The rise of global social network giants has empowered the centralized tech cartels to misuse user data, infringe on user privacy and impose censorship. As reported after the investigation by Cambridge Analytica, Facebook collected social graphs and personal profiles from millions of users without their consent, with the end goal of fueling more directed political advertising and inappropriately profiting from the personal data of their users. The current landscape of web2, filled with centralized social networks, has deviated from the principle of the World Wide Web. Namely: to enable the decentralization of information on a large scale.</p> CyberConnect Protocol: A user data solution for Web3.0 <p>In the early web2 era, there were isolated social graphs for each social application, but people quickly got tired of registering and redeclaring friends on every new site. Thus, the optimal solution at that time was to consolidate all the relationships onto one app, i.e. Facebook. As soon as Facebook gained mass adoption and realized the value of the social graph it owned, the company swiftly changed its policy and shut down its API to protect itself from future competition. The initial promise of a shared social graph was broken, and the door to the world's largest social data was closed for good.</p><p>To combat this paradigm, CyberConnect aims to empower Web3 social networks to be decentralized, censorship-free, and self-sovereign. CyberConnect is proposing a new decentralized social graph protocol, a web3 infrastructure that is blockchain-agnostic and openly accessible to all. The goal is not to build a one-for-all social network. Instead, CyberConnect welcomes all web3 citizens and dApps to contribute to the protocol, building social networks and Metaverses collaboratively.</p><p>As the next stage of web3 begins to take shape, the CyberConnect protocol will offer decentralized options for how data is used and perceived with the following features:</p>  Publicly accessible: the decentralized social graph data will be publicly accessible for all dApps as an add-on feature for developers to leverage user connections to grow beyond their existing user base  Self-sovereign: while the social graph data is open to all, only users have full control over their own social graphs (i.e., adding, deleting, and updating the connections)  Blockchain-agnostic: instead of tying to a single blockchain, the protocol is created for a multi-blockchain ecosystem to support connections from anywhere  Decentralized governance: inspired by Ethereum’s vision, CyberConnect will commit to the ideals of shared security, permissionless systems, and decentralized governance, which will shape the roadmap and development of the protocol   Token-incentivized: in order to support the long-term development of the CyberConnect Protocol, CyberConnect will introduce a token-incentivized model in the beginning stage to fairly reward all contributors who help bootstrap the social graph  Options for privacy-preserving features: CyberConnect knows some users care about their connection data more than others do, and as such is actively researching the technical solutions for enabling privacy-preserving features in the future  Play socially with friends and see your rank in web3 games Using Ceramic to build a decentralized social graph database  <p>At the heart of CyberConnect is a tamper-proof data structure that efficiently facilitates the creation, update, query and verification of user-centric data. Long-term data retention on CyberConnect is guaranteed through Ceramic’s blockchain anchoring and a custom data pinning service. </p> Multi-account identity <p>CyberConnect also uses Ceramic and the platform's 3ID DID method to ensure that users are authenticated and authorized to write data streams. The 3ID DID handles secure key rotation (different from blockchain private key) so that users are not at risk of losing their transactional private key and thus access to all their corresponding social data. 3ID DID also supports cross-chain, multi-wallet use cases so that users can connect accounts into a seamless identity structure, ensuring CyberConnect is future proof.</p> Identity index for composability <p>CyberConnect also uses IDX, Ceramic's identity protocol, for easy user data indexing and integration with other protocols and applications. IDX provides a unified interface for application developers to query data within an user's namespace, both within and outside of CyberConnect.</p> Universal social graph index <p>CyberConnect also sources and curates social graph data from platforms including Foundation, Rarible, and even web2 platforms such as Twitter. The aggregation of all this data creates a rich and unique user experience. For example, imagine a social platform that is able to provide every user with an automatically generated "suggested user list" based on who they have bought NFTs from historically, who they've transacted with (sent/received tokens or NFTs), and who they follow on other platforms like Rarible and Twitter. This is dramatically different from most new social platforms being created in today's centralized architecture, in which you start from scratch at every opportunity. </p><p>CyberConnect also indexes higher dimensional network data, which allows it to generate new connection suggestions based on existing social graphs. This curation and indexing aims to combine both the user-owned publicly accessible social graph with other off-chain data from across web2 and web3 applications.</p>Get content recommendations based on a personal social graph<p>This universal social graph index is exposed to application developers through an API gateway. Developers can easily build a new "instagram for NFTs" without worrying about building and managing the corresponding database to store contact lists and follows. As such, CyberConnect accelerates time to value for application developers, allowing them to focus on content curation and recommendation algorithms based on the social graph data. Similarly, developers can focus on game experience instead of social components, using CyberConnect to import existing friends lists, similar to Steam.</p> What's Next for CyberConnect <p>Beyond the CyberConnect Protocol, the CyberConnect team has also recently announced CyberChat, a trustless, decentralized chat app that helps round out the social ecosystem for web3. CyberChat enables users to log in with a blockchain wallet, create their user profile based on on-chain data, and frictionlessly send chat messages while interacting with the blockchain. With CyberChat, decentralized projects and DAOs can now manage their communities on a crypto-native basis.</p><p>For more information, read the official white paper on the <a href="https://cyberconnect.me/">CyberConnect website</a>.

Many of these organizations have contributed directly or indirectly to the W3C DID 1.0 specification for one simple reason: the DID layer of cryptographically verifiable identifiers is foundational to the common infrastructure we are building together and on top of; therefore, this spec is an integral part of DIF’s and ToIP’s shared vision for an empowered, secure and interoperable future, and in line with <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/">W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles.</a><br></p><p>As such, DIF and ToIP support the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 1.0 specification becoming an official W3C Recommendation. DID 1.0 represents the efforts of over thirty active W3C Working Group contributors over the past two years— on top of contributions from dozens of others in the W3C Credentials Community Group and its predecessors for several years before that. This is a significant milestone in the digital identity sector. Having common ground for development, particularly in terms of interoperability, allows work to continue with renewed energy and focus. It also mitigates the risk of shifting goalposts, which seriously hinders long-term development, investment, and widespread adoption. <br></p><p>DIDs are a critical part of a technical foundation for the products and activities of many of our members.

We acknowledge also the work done by numerous, forward-thinking organizations who have already built working implementations using the provisional specification, thereby laying the foundations of new infrastructures for “identity data”. We believe DIDs will change the course of digital identity by building in better user controls, portability, and interoperability at the lowest possible level, while also offering increased security and simplicity for implementers and service providers. This advancement unlocks new opportunities for our digital lives, and we look forward to leveraging DIDs and other technologies developed in the community to champion a new class of user-first, self-owned digital identity systems.</p><p></p><p>Signed,</p><p>Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) &amp; Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)<br></p><p>October, 2021<br></p>

 Reference Libraries 

<p>Some of our most important work at Blockchain Commons is on specifications that improve the interoperability and resilience of cryptocurrency wallets. Our reference libraries allow developers to incorporate those specifications into their own code.</p>

<p>SSKR Security Review. However, there’s one more thing required before our libraries can be used in production releases: security reviews. Our vision is that third-party developers using our libraries will work with us to contract a security review from a third-party. They can take advantage of all the libraries already reviewed, and then they can increase that selection with a review of their own. Our sustaining sponsor, <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, began that process this quarter by arranging a security review for our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir">bc-shamir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">bc-sskr</a> libraries through <a href="https://radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security (ROS)</a>.</p>

<p>The folks at ROS tested our software and noted potential security problems. We then worked with them to close all issues that we felt were a priority. Because Blockchain Commons is dedicated to transparency, we have published the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/reviews/2021-security-review.pdf">review</a> and our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/SECURITY-REVIEW.md">response</a>, which includes a listing of issues that we resolved, as well as those we did not (and why). Thanks to this review, we feel that the <code>bc-shamir</code> and <code>bc-sskr</code> libraries are the first of our reference libraries ready for production deployment.</p>

<p>Project Nayuki Port. We also released a minor new utility library, a port of the Project Nayuki QR library into Swift as <a href="https://github.com/blockchaincommons/QRCodeGenerator">QRCodeGenerator</a>. We’d discovered that Apple’s native iOS QR generation is inefficient for QR codes where individual segments require different optimization. Nayuki does the right thing, by individually optimizing each segment, so we ported it over as a replacement for the native Apple libraries, for use in our own code and by other developers.</p>

 Reference Apps 

<p>Our reference apps provide exemplar use of our specifications (and libraries).</p>

<p>Seed Tool Updates. The release of Seed Tool was one of our big events in Q2. In Q3 we’ve continued that work through two notable upgrades, releasing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/README.md#version-history">1.1 in July, 1.2 in August, and 1.2.1 in September</a>. Some of the biggest updates included arbitrary key derivation, preset SSKR schemes, and developer functions that make it easier to test out QR &amp; UR-based requests and responses. We also added our first Ethereum support, through the ability to derive Ethereum private keys and addresses from your stored seeds. Our updated <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/MANUAL.md">Seed Tool Manual</a> describes all of the latest functionality.</p>

<p>QRTool Updates. Seed Tool wasn’t the only reference app to get attention; <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QRTool</a> also received some minor updates in July, though those largely took the form of minor bug fixes. Updating QR Tool to use the Project Nayuki library port will be our next big update for QR Tool, sometime in the future.</p>

 Bitcoin Utilities 

<p>Other utilities make it easier to use Bitcoin and other blockchain and crypto-technology.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Standup Updates. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts">Bitcoin Standup</a> was one of Blockchain Commons’ first releases. It automates the installation of a secure Bitcoin Core setup on a Debian Linux device or virtual machine . However, Bitcoin Core is always changing, requiring occasional updates. Our newest version of Bitcoin Standup, 0.8.0, updates the scripts to work well with Bitcoin Core 22.0 (which made some changes to its code signing).</p>

<p>However, Bitcoin Standup 0.8.0 does more than that. We’ve always imagined Standup as an engine that can install a wide variety of cryptocurrency and blockchain applications, and the new version of Standup offers the opportunity for the first such addition: <a href="https://cypherpunkpay.org/">cypherpunkpay</a>, an easy and accessible server for receiving Bitcoin payments. This addition, though just a starting point, was one of the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> projects initiated by our 2021 interns, to offer cyryptocurrency support for activists.</p>

<p>Gordian Server Officially Released. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server</a> project took Bitcoin Standup as a jumping-off point and offered the same ability to easily install Bitcoin Core on the more accessible macOS UI. Like Bitcoin Standup it’s intended as the heart of a self-sovereign setup, where you can control both your wallet and your server. We released Gordian Server in some preliminary versions in 2020, but we’ve now polished it to improve its stability and ease of use, and have released it as the Feature-Complete <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases/tag/v1.0.0">1.0.0</a>. Like our newest Standup release, this version of Gordian Server has also been updated to work correctly with Bitcoin Core 22.0.</p>

 Learning Resources 

<p>One of Blockchain Commons’ goals has always been to improve the developmental understanding of Bitcoin. We also extend that goal to our own releases by working to make our specifications as accessible as possible.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Translations. Our popular <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course</a> has brought numerous developers into the industry. We’re thus thrilled to offer complete translations in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/portuguese-translation/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/spanish-translation/es">Spanish</a>. This enormous amount of work was the product of a number of volunteers, some of whom were also working with us as interns, which means that the <a href="https://hrf.org/">HRF</a> should again be thanked for their support. We hope that these translations will help bring Bitcoin development to the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world, which seems particularly important given El Salvador’s recent move to Bitcoin as a currency. (Learning Bitcoin also enjoyed quite a few minor edits as a result of the translations, as well as updates to include i2p and some recent revisions, resulting in our release of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/releases/tag/v2.1.0">version 2.1</a>; we’ve also got plans for <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/TODO-30.md">3.0</a>.)</p>

<p>New SSKR Docs. Shamir’s Secret Sharing is a critical element of #SmartCustody in today’s digital-assets world, which is why our SSKR library received our first security review. We’ve also been expanding our docs to talk more about how and why to use secret sharing (and why not to). Our newest <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-overview.md">SSKR docs</a> include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">Designing SSKR Share Scenarios</a>, which discusses many models for sharing (including all of the default scenarios now found in SeedTool), and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Dangers.md">SSKR Dangers</a>, which talks about why we ultimately prefer multisigs to secret-sharing.</p>

 Building to Specifications &amp; Laws 

<p>Specifications and supportive references are the first steps in bringing new ideas to the industry. To reach their fullest potential, those ideas eventually have to become something more …</p>

<p>DID Standardization. The DID specification, which is currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">1.0 candidate recommendation</a> for an international standard, is our next big technical step forward for self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, big centralized companies such as Apple and Google have taken notice and unsurprisingly raised complaints. We’ve offered some support with language and with championing the hard work already done, though the heavy lifting continues to be done by the editors, including Drummond Reed, Manu Sporny, Amy Guy, and Markus Sabadello.</p>

<p>Principal Authority. Many specifications and standards need legal support to reach their fullest potential. Our work in Wyoming has resulted in the state legislature arriving at a legal definition of digital identity that centers on the concept of principal authority. This quarter, we released <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">a paper</a> on how principal authority defines self-sovereign identity, and what the next steps are. (We also presented the paper and testified about it to the Wyoming legislature.)</p>

<p>eResidency &amp; Other Testimony. Overall, we’ve been thrilled to be working with Wyoming, creating some of the first and best laws for supporting blockchains, cryptocurrency, digital identity, and digital companies. In a <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2021/S19-2021092109-01E-Residency.pdf">recent presentation</a>, we urged them to leverage the infrastructure they’ve created into an eResidency program that can extend these benefits to companies worldwide. In other testimony for Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas, and the Netherlands we have provided support new laws for DAOs, updates to GDPR regulations and have advised how to avoid vendor lock-in and future-proof technology.</p>

 Other Future Expansions 

<p>Finally, we’re also looking to the future in other ways.</p>

<p>Ethereum Expansion. As noted, we’ve expanded Gordian Seed Tool to support Ethereum key derivations. We’ve also been experimenting with selling some self-sovereign-identity NFTs to raise funds for Blockchain Commons. Generally, this all demonstrates our goal of bringing many of our philosophies, architectures, and models to the Ethereum blockchain. In particular, we believe that #SmartCustody, and especially SSKR, could help Ethereum, which has a lot of its own challenges for responsible key management, such as the lack of true multisig. If you’d like to support our expansion into Ethereum, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a> and let us know why you did (or watch for upcoming NFT auctions!).</p>

<p>Second Intern Program. Finally, we’ve just completed our second summer’s intern program, and we’re thrilled to have another batch of interns who we helped to introduce to the world of blockchain development and who in turn helped us push forward projects such as our Learning Bitcoin translations and revisions. They also: produced a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Secure-Development-Setup-macOS">secure development setup guide</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Pseudonymity-Guide">pseudonymity guide</a> that offered more support for activists and HRF; developed a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli">mori-cli program</a> for leaving behind your digital assets; worked on creating a stable version of Esplora; and more. Some of our 2021 interns have already gone on to other paid work in the field; we’re looking forward to seeing what they create next!</p>

<p>Thank you, as always, for your interest in Blockchain Commons and the improvement of the entire blockchain field. If you like what we’re doing, we again encourage you to become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Github sponsor</a> so that we can continue forward with our work of making the industry independent, private, interoperable, and resilient!</p>

<p>As I write my first newsletter to you as Digital Identity New Zealand’s Executive Director, I’m acutely aware that I am familiarising myself with the controls as I operate them. Michael left large shoes to fill, so my feet will have to grow! I’ve been away from Aotearoa a while, so it’s good to be back and appreciate the progress being made. In my time away, I was privileged to lead an international digital identity industry organisation; one of the very few that operate a digital identity trust framework. So, you’ll understand how excited I was to arrive back in time to see the <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_116015/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">Digital Identity Trust Framework Bill</a>&nbsp;progress through Parliament to its current Select Committee stage.<br>&nbsp;<br>I look forward to joining you on that journey and bringing some learnings from my previous gig along too. I expect it to be DINZ’s key focus these next few months. Stakeholder collaboration is the key to success in the case of Trust Frameworks, so you can be sure that I’ll be looking for opportunities where DINZ can play a role.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would also like to remind the community that nominations for the DINZ Executive Council are currently open. All member organisations&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2021/10/07/executive-council-nominations-now-open/">can nominate a representative</a>. Please help shape both the history and future direction of Aotearoa’s Digital Identity sector by submitting your nomination using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2vbc4LJwrENW5a6VxGOUhsG2wj9ZQCljN9uyjm9YzwuqXNg/viewform">online form</a>. The deadline for nominations is 5pm Thursday 28 October. Online elections will follow, and the new Council will be announced at our Annual Meeting on Thursday 2 December. If you are a member and would like to attend the Annual Meeting&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-nz-annual-meeting/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=2c3334cb9a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_04_24_COPY_05&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-2c3334cb9a-118146817">please register beforehand</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>As many of you will be aware, the <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_116015/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">Digital Identity Trust Framework (DISTF) Bill</a>&nbsp;was introduced to Parliament, has had its First Reading and the Select Committee is now accepting public submissions. This is great news and something that industry in general has encouraged and now welcomes. There is no better time to join and get involved in Digital Identity New Zealand to help shape this piece of the country’s tech history.<br>&nbsp;<br>To that end, DINZ received a request from the Department of Internal Affairs to circulate to its primary member contacts some information about the Select Committee schedule and process. DINZ duly did so on October 15th and now wishes to share that with the wider community. Have your say on the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Bill by <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/make-a-submission/document/53SCED_SCF_BILL_116015/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">making a submission</a>&nbsp;before 2 December 2021.<br></p>

Our “CoP Curious” course explores <a href="https://wenger-trayner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/11-04-Wenger_Trayner_DeLaat_Value_creation.pdf">value cycles</a> and our “Badge Curious” course goes through the ins and outs of open badges and digital credentialing.</p><p>Although the theory and practice of badges and CoPs play central roles in our community content, it is the people who join a community who shape that community’s culture and direction. We’re excited to discover how this experiment breeds new value for social learners of all stripes. We’re eager to learn how we can support someone who is trying to get an organisation to start thinking about upskilling in a non-traditional way. We’re hopeful that we can deliver a better understanding of how CoPs actually function while showing how badges can work to build trust through recognition.</p>Thinking about Community of Practice Value Cycles as gears.

<p>We recently had the honor to host a presentation from our Canadian counterparts in Ontario about their technology roadmap for their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-id-ontario">Digital Identity (ID) program</a>.</p>



<p>The aim of their program is to “make accessing online and in-person services simpler, safer and more secure”, and they’re aiming to introduce Digital ID later this year.</p>



<p>They’ve been busy since their announcement in October 2020, hosting roundtable discussions with large market participants, surveying and consulting with the public and small-to-medium businesses, developing a tech roadmap to get questions and input from private-sector partners, and publishing the technical tools they’re going to leverage.</p>



Ontario’s simplified version of how Digital ID will work.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-id-ontario">Read more on their website.</a>



<p>The recent presentation to the ToIP Foundation was to further their goal of aligning and interoperating with the broader market for digital identity. They recognize the importance of market engagement,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-digital-id-technology-and-standards">technology standards</a>, and of partnering with the private sector in building a digital identity ecosystem. Ultimately, all this will help drive end user adoption and the delivery of value.</p>



<p>The presentation covered:</p>



  A summary of findings from government-led public consultations on digital identity  An overview of Ontario’s Digital ID technology roadmap, and discussions about the technology stacks and infrastructure  Ontario’s proposed conceptual model for digital identity, and the principles that inform&nbsp;it  



<p>The presentation emphasized how the Government of Ontario’s digital identity strategy and roadmap is building upon the ToIP&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">dual-stack model</a>. It was exciting and gratifying to see a major public sector organization contributing to a digital identity ecosystem based on the interoperable open standards that are the heart of our efforts here at the ToIP Foundation. Equally, we hope that Ontario will benefit through exposure of their efforts to our worldwide presence—and further inspire others to adopt decentralized digital trust infrastructure.</p>

 Any web developer knows the drill: In order to access an API, you need an&nbsp;API-Key. <p>This is true for e.g. Google Maps (or any other service) and has been copied by more decentralized services like The Graph Protocol. As the application developer, it is your responsibility to create an API Key which grants access to the service and allows assigning the queries to your&nbsp;account.</p><p>The picture below shows the process: The browser makes a request to the application server, which in turn calls the API with an&nbsp;API-Key.</p>browser to app server to API&nbsp;server<p>This authorization scheme works really well in the scenario in which there is an application server. What about&nbsp;DApps?</p> The difference with&nbsp;DApps <p>A Decentralized Application (DApp) typically has no application server. The logic is all on the client and the data is in some distributed storage system like a blockchain or IPFS. This is great in theory, but as most users do not have an IPFS node or an RPC node running locally on their computer, it is difficult for them to use such applications without some services being involved (e.g. <a href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a>, <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/">Alchemy</a>, <a href="https://www.quicknode.com/">Quiknode</a>).</p><p>The typical setup then looks something like&nbsp;this:</p>API key is stored in the&nbsp;browser<p>This of course is a problem for the application developer who has paid for the account to which the API key belongs. As any user of the DApp has to get access to the API Key, some users might be mischievous and misuse the access rights to the&nbsp;service.</p> Replacing API Key with Authentication <p>A more secure mechanism is to replace the API Key with user authentication. Each user has to send a login token to the API Service, which uniquely identifies them and allows the API Server to make sure only authorized users can access the&nbsp;service.</p><p>This could be achieved with public-facing services like Azure Active Directory or AWS IAM (collectively IAM System or IAMS) but it is cumbersome and requires a separate configuration for each API Service and IAMS. By default, nobody has access to your User Directory, and that is the way you want to keep it. So in order for an API Service to use your IAMS tenant you would need to configure it especially for&nbsp;this.</p><p>There is no way, in a centralized IAMS, to create a setup in which an API service is granted access to all IAMS tenants without their explicit&nbsp;consent.</p> Decentralizing the authorization system <p>That is where a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/digging-deeper-into-self-sovereign-identity-and-access-management-e6eefbac631e">decentralized IAMS</a> (e.g. <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">Switchboard</a>) comes into play. In a decentralized IAMS, the user information is not stored on the server, so there is no need to give the API Server access to anything; the information is held by the users themselves in the form of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a>.</p><p>The role definitions or access rights are saved in publicly accessible, censorship-resistant storage. The most important part is that the definitions must be signed by one of the delegated authorities. When a definition is read, it must be possible to tell if it is genuine or&nbsp;not.</p><p>In such a scheme, the API access would look like&nbsp;this:</p>the request contains a bearer token instead of an API&nbsp;key<p>The browser attaches a claim to the header of the request; which the API server can verify in the roles' definition database. <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">In the current implementation of Switchboard</a>, the role definitions are stored on the Energy Web Chain in the Energy Name Services (ENS) smart contracts.</p> The advantages to the developer <p>From a developer’s perspective, this is great news. They can control who accesses the API services they’re paying for and even set different access levels for paying customers and visitors.</p><p>While many API services already allow setting different access levels per API Key, there is no way for the developer to control if there are any malicious users among the user base. It is pretty trivial for a malicious developer to extract API Keys from a DAPP and reuse them for their own&nbsp;profit.</p><p>This might not be a problem yet because there are very few real DAPPs and among those even fewer are popular enough to be the target of an attack, but this will change with the growing adoption of blockchain and other decentralized systems.</p> Conclusion <p>If you are a developer and want to write a DApp because you believe in decentralization or simply because you find the serverless concept really cool, then you probably are using API-Keys in your front-end. If this is the case, then you should consider the security risk the publication of the API-Key in your front end represents and ask yourself if it would make sense to switch to a user authentication scheme.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/api-access-security-for-dapps-cfcfa928623c">API access security for DApps</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>Munyaradzi Kamhozo is Account Relationship Manager at NMB Bank Limited, a registered commercial bank based in Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>NMB Bank’s role in this initiative is to act as the Validation Agent, working with the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as the Local Operating Unit (LOU), to issue SME clients with globally recognized digital business identities. Project partners GLEIF, Cornerstone Advisory Plus and Cenfri supported NMB Bank Limited to complete the required qualification process. </p>
<p>The LEI presents a significant opportunity to help close the current trade financing gap and support more SMEs to engage in international and domestic trade. NMB Bank Limited saw that potential, which drew them to the Validation Agent role, supporting its key objectives to create a market leading proposition for its SME client base, foster greater financial inclusion in the region and support the growth and formalization of the Zimbabwean economy. </p>
<p>How could this LEI initiative improve domestic and international trade out of Zimbabwe? </p>
<p>Most Zimbabwean SMEs rely on an international supply of raw materials. At least 80% of our SME customers engage with international suppliers on a regular basis. Currently, however, if an SME in Zimbabwe completes a telegraphic transfer to a supplier based in Europe, the correspondent bank will have to validate the identity of the Zimbabwean business and, without an established form of legal identity, this process can take up to a month.  </p>
<p>The LEI initiative will help by building trust in both the global financial ecosystem and in key supplier relationships. Using an LEI can significantly reduce the time correspondent banks take to validate the identity of the SME, ensuring that they can quickly access key supplies without building up excessive interest on local currency loans which, for SMEs in Zimbabwe, range from 40 per cent to 60 per cent per annum depending on the financial institution. </p>
<p>The benefits of the LEI also apply to Zimbabwean exports. By obtaining an LEI, SMEs can increase their international visibility and credibility with new overseas clients. All buyers must screen new suppliers to validate that they are who they say they are. With an LEI, this process will be faster and simpler than ever before. This will help to create new opportunities for our exporters, enabling them to foster new markets and grow domestic and international trade. </p>
<p>How is the LEI initiative helping NMB Bank compete and/or differentiate itself in the financial services marketplace? </p>
<p>One of the principal benefits of being a Validation Agent is that NMB Bank is now able to offer an entirely new service to our SME clients which allows them to save significant time when partaking in international transactions and opens opportunities to access trade finance, something which none of our competitors can offer currently. Addressing these key pain points will help us grow our client base and deliver an attractive proposition to SME customers. </p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, becoming a Validation Agent meant NMB Bank also had to undertake a comprehensive training program to get us up to speed with GLEIF’s regulatory standards. This has allowed us to realign our internal processes with an international standard of best practice. We can now set the standard for due diligence processes in the region. </p>
<p>By supporting SMEs as part of the Validation Agent role, NMB Bank is also actively supporting the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s National Financial Inclusion strategy, which aims to increase financial and economic inclusivity in the country. </p>
<p>What long-term potential do you see in the LEI initiative, both for banks and SMEs in Zimbabwe?</p>
<p>Zimbabwe, like many African countries, has a sizeable ‘informal economy’. It is estimated that around 80.8% of those employed in sub-Saharan Africa work within the informal sector.  Unfortunately, this means businesses operating in this sector lack the credentials necessary to grow and often find themselves losing money when undertaking cross-border transactions. In the long term, we can see the LEI helping to formalize our economy. With a globally standardized identifier, our businesses can prove their legitimacy and engage in regulated trade, leading to the generation of more money for the businesses and their employees. </p>
<p>We also believe that the LEI will have long term impacts on access to trade finance. SMEs currently struggle to access finance as they are perceived as ‘too risky’ by international lenders. As a result, the current trade finance gap in African stands at $81 billion.  When we apply for credit lines for our SME clients with an LEI, the screening process undertaken by the Development Finance Institutions to identify the applicant will be much simpler, meaning SMEs can access more trade finance, faster than ever before. This will also allow many businesses to be freed from the control of loan sharks as more legitimate lines of credit become available to them. </p>
<p>For banks, in particular, the LEI initiative will help to streamline onboarding processes. By adopting the role of Validation Agent, banks can provide a faster and more efficient experience for new clients by handling the LEI issuance process internally. Banks will also benefit from a simplified approach to establishing automated beneficial ownership systems, in line with Zimbabwe’s national project to do so. This means the initiative will contribute significantly to supporting Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism. </p>
<p>What kind of change in Zimbabwe would you like to see result from broad LEI adoption among SMEs?</p>
<p>Overall, we want to see accelerated financial inclusion in line with Zimbabwe’s National Inclusion Strategy. Broad adoption of the LEI is a big step towards achieving this.  </p>
<p>The formalization of Zimbabwe’s economy as a result of LEI adoption will not only benefit banks and SMEs, but the entire population. At an international level, a formal economy means more taxes are paid, which, in turn, means our government can invest more into key infrastructure projects to support the growth of the nation, improving the standard of living for all. </p>
<p>We’d also like to see a change in the perception of Zimbabwe in international markets. Our national mantra is ‘open for business’. We want to be seen in this way. Currently, we are seen as a risky market in the eyes of international lenders, banks and suppliers. The LEI presents an opportunity to help us overturn this perception. If the world knows who you are, the opportunities will flow in.</p>

 Reimagining Capitalism Series: Rebalancing the Relationship Between Government, Markets, and Communities  This post expands on the fourth key pillar for building a new economic paradigm as outlined in <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Our Call to Reimagine Capitalism</a>. Read the first post in this series, “An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and Economy”&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">here</a>. <p>By Audrey Stienon, Associate, Reimagining Capitalism</p> Understanding society’s mutual responsibilities within the context of&nbsp;COVID-19 <p>Throughout the course of the pandemic, our lives have changed in ways that would have been nearly unthinkable when the crisis began. We entered lockdowns believing that it would be impossible to sustain such a drastic change to the status quo for more than a few weeks; and yet here we are, a year and a half later, with many of the rituals and requirements of social distancing still in place, having largely adapted to living in this new&nbsp;normal.</p><p>Across history, pandemics have been an existential threat to societies precisely because, beyond a staggering death toll, they have the power to strain to the point of collapse the three legs on which, like a stool, society stands: representative governments that set and enforce the rules for how diverse people wish to live together and advance their collective wellbeing; markets that mobilize decentralized incentives to generate and distribute wealth, goods, services, and knowledge across society; and communities that unite people across shared identities and build inclusive spaces where people can find a sense of belonging, support, and&nbsp;meaning.</p><p>These three legs are all social constructs that vary in shapes and sizes across countries, but our experience in learning to live with COVID illustrates the key ways in which each is essential to our ability to make it through a crisis like the pandemic. Government coordinated the formal public health response even as publicly funded biomedical research provided the basic building blocks for the vaccines, which the government then distributed across the country. The markets and businesses innovated to meet rapidly changing needs in a socially-distanced world — enabling many employees to work from home, promoting contactless delivery, and even mass-producing necessities like hand sanitizer and ventilators. And communities across the country adopted new norms and behaviors to support and protect the safety of their&nbsp;members.</p><p>Even so, the monumental difficulties that we have faced in effectively responding to the pandemic have drawn attention to the challenges undermining the support each leg provides to society. Necessary government coordination was undercut by partisanship, polarization, and ideological self-sabotage. Markets proved to be overly reliant on brittle supply chains and failed to ensure that the immense wealth created by a small subset of companies because of the crisis trickled down to struggling communities. And many communities — driven by a deep mistrust of government, companies, and even other communities in our society — rejected and fought against the adoption of public health precautions to the detriment of us&nbsp;all.</p><p>We may yet get through the worst of this public health crisis, but if history is any guide, we are certain to feel the reverberations of COVID long after the threat of the virus has been brought fully under control. If we are to make it to the other side of this challenge with our society still standing as a thriving liberal market democracy, we must shore up and strengthen all three of these&nbsp;legs.</p> What happens when we saw off two legs of a three-legged stool? <p>The types of governments, markets, and communities that ideally support democratic societies have much in common. All three are strengthened in environments of vibrant competition — be it competition between political ideologies and policy options, business models and technological innovation, or options for environments where people can build connections and a sense of belonging. This implies that all three thrive when everyone has the right to participate, challenge the status quo, and offer new ideas of how to do things&nbsp;better.</p><p>They also all share a common vulnerability to concentrations of power which — as American history and current events can attest — are inevitably used to exclude and stifle competition: unopposed political power will silence opposing views and opinions through tools like voter suppression; monopolistic market power will be used to prevent rivals from threatening profits; community power will be used to erect protectionist barriers — including discrimination, segregation, and outright violence — to avoid having to share community benefits with perceived outsiders.</p><p>Since each leg struggles to regulate itself to prevent such corrosive concentrations of power, they are each dependent on the other two to act as checks on power that can protect competition. Representative governments, responsible for securing everyone’s basic and equal rights, can enact and enforce rules against discrimination and monopolies that require communities and markets respectively to remain open to new members and ideas. Competitive markets both create and connect a diverse range of communities and political interest groups who share the common interest of opposing government or community efforts to empower one group over all others. Inclusive community needs and preferences inspire the new ideas of government and markets, and community members have the power as voters, protesters, consumers, investors, and employees to mobilize if the other two pillars fail to meet their&nbsp;demands.</p><p>All this implies that the wellbeing of a democratic society — as well as any hope of building a democratic society in which the equal participation of all of its members is truly valued — rests on the collective strength of these three legs. Should any one of them fail, our democracy will begin to&nbsp;crumble.</p><p>In recent decades, we have become overly dependent on markets to meet society’s needs. For decades, conservative politicians, economists, and many business leaders sold Americans on the idea that markets were more efficient and less prejudiced than either government or communities. In response, policymakers, business leaders, and a large number of community representatives acted to systematically shift the societal responsibilities of government and communities onto markets by restricting the activities of these two legs. Government capacity to provide public services, earn income through taxes, or regulate was limited, while the distress of communities asking for support and to have their concerns addressed was&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>Although markets are remarkable and powerful tools, they will never be capable of single-handedly upholding societal wellbeing — just as no one could hope to sit comfortably on a stool balanced entirely on one leg. Markets will always be shaped by government rules and community norms and values, and — rather than making markets stronger — weakening the other two legs has only engendered a version of markets with few checks to prevent either the concentration of economic power or the use of that power to limit competition from other businesses, political ideologies, or societal norms across all of society. As a result, our country is one in which our markets no longer provide widespread wealth and opportunity and in which neither our restrained government nor economically starved communities have the capacity to provide support or new opportunities to the people that markets have been unable to reach. This has fueled mistrust in markets incapable of delivering the shared prosperity that was promised, in governments unable to respond to the demands of their constituents, and in other distressed communities increasingly seen as competitors for scarce resources and government attention.</p><p>As America makes its way out of the pandemic and we prepare ourselves to confront the challenges, like climate change, looming ahead, we must all as individuals, voters, companies, communities, and governments make a concerted effort to strengthen the social foundations on which we stand. This will entail deepening the communal ties that bind us to each other, reinvigorating the governing bodies that allow us to work together towards common goals, and, finally, redesigning our markets so that they generate wealth not for its own sake, but for the sake of increasing the wellbeing of every person in our&nbsp;society.</p> Finding our&nbsp;balance <p>To that end, Omidyar Network aims to support organizations working to reimagine and rebalance the responsibilities that government, markets, and communities have in supporting social wellbeing. Driven by a deep appreciation for the importance of of each of these legs, we aim to help develop ideas and expectations about the economic roles each can play to support society; to advance the implementation of new rules that strengthen their capacity to act on these roles; and to invigorate counterweights and checks on concentrations of economic power across&nbsp;them.</p><p>(To learn more about how we believe ideas, rules, and power interact to shape our economy and democracy, consider reading the <a href="http://%20https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">first installment in this series&nbsp;here</a>.)</p><p>First, we need a stronger understanding of the respective roles of markets, government, and communities in the economy, as well as insight into how to strengthen their capacity to fulfill these roles after decades of underinvestment and neglect. Rather than having to choose between market or government solutions to their economic challenges, communities must be able to work with government to access and help design market systems that prioritize the wellbeing of the many rather than the&nbsp;few.</p><p>We therefore have partnered with a range of organizations developing new ideas on how to design a socially-driven economy built on a more equitable distribution of power across society. Notably, we support the work of Xavier de Souza Briggs, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/program/metropolitan-policy-program/">Metropolitan Policy Program</a>, who is identifying strategies to mobilize stakeholders from across the economy — including civil society, business leaders, worker organizations, and local and federal government agencies — around the common goal of revitalizing struggling metropolitan communities. Similarly, the <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/think-tank/corporate-power/">Roosevelt Institute</a>, for example, is leading on research exploring the consequences of power imbalances between public, community, and market actors, while <a href="https://www.demos.org/what-we-do/policy-and-research">Demos</a> is working to develop institutions for building community power over economic decisions. Meanwhile, Omidyar Network has created the <a href="https://omidyar.com/the-community-infrastructure-fund-for-mutual-aid/">Community Infrastructure Fund for Mutual Aid</a>, a learning project that aims to explore how to equitably address the socio-economic needs of communities while providing the essential infrastructure for organizations that have stepped up meet these needs where other institutions have failed&nbsp;them.</p><p>Second, we aim to revitalize competitive markets grounded by their responsibilities towards stakeholders across society. To this end, we have supported efforts to advocate for changes in the rules governing markets to allow businesses and other market actors to pursue goals beyond just short-term profit maximization. <a href="https://www.citizen.org/">Public Citizen</a>, <a href="https://justcapital.com/">JUST Capital</a>, and the <a href="https://www.valuereportingfoundation.org/">Value Reporting Foundation</a>, for example, are advocating that government mandate that companies disclose information on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues and on their political spending. Such disclosures would make it easier for people who invest in companies, as well as the general public, to hold companies to account for how their activities impact society. Similarly, <a href="https://bcorporation.net/about-b-lab">B Lab</a>, an organization known for certifying businesses that advance a social purpose (B Corp), is advocating for policies to reform rules of corporate governance so that business leaders take a greater range of stakeholders into account when making their decisions. Finally, we continue to invest in organizations working to strengthen regulation that can curb the power of tech platforms, including the <a href="https://www.economicliberties.us/access-to-markets/#">American Economic Liberties Project</a>, <a href="https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/">Open Markets Institute</a>, and the <a href="https://www.economicsecurityproject.org/antimonopoly/">Anti-Monopoly Fund</a> at the Economic Security&nbsp;Project.</p><p>Finally, we are working with organizations strengthening the power of stakeholders from across society to influence the role that markets play in&nbsp;society.</p><p>One piece of this work involves building the power of communities to influence the shape of markets and the behavior of market actors. <a href="https://communitychange.org/about/">Community Change</a> and the <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/">Action Center on Race and the Economy (ACRE)</a>, for example, are building the power of communities of color to shape economic decisions and move us closer to a more inclusive democracy and economy. Meanwhile, recognizing that working people both constitute their own community and are key members of their own local communities, the <a href="https://www.californiaworkerpower.org/">California Coalition for Worker Power</a> is mobilizing worker centers, worker advocates, labor policy experts and labor unions to ensure that every worker in California has the power to come together and improve their work conditions and their communities. Finally, <a href="https://faithinaction.org/issue-campaign/economic-dignity/">Faith in Action</a>, seeks to mobilize faith-based communities to fight against an economy of exclusion and instead create a moral economy based on a new set of values, beliefs, and identities.</p><p>The second element of this work entails building the power of stakeholders who can work within markets to hold them accountable to a wider range of social values. For example, organizations such as the <a href="https://theshareholdercommons.com/">Shareholder Commons</a> and <a href="https://www.iccr.org/">Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR)</a> equip the people and organizations who invest in businesses with the tools to use their power as shareholders to engage with companies on their ESG performance. Similarly, <a href="https://www.forthelongterm.org/">For the Long Term</a> is working to support public fiduciaries and other government entities that invest in markets on behalf of citizens and public sector workers — such as public pension funds or state and municipal treasurers — to more actively pressure companies to behave in ways that serve their beneficiaries and contribute to public wellbeing. Meanwhile, organizations like <a href="https://www.leadershipnowproject.org/">The Leadership Now Project</a> are engaging directly with business leaders themselves to mobilize their existing power to strengthen American democracy.</p><p>For all our failings, America’s response to the COVID pandemic has shown that each of the three legs still has the strength to support our society, even during a destabilizing crisis. That said, we must not take this stability for granted. We celebrate the incredible work of our grantees in this space, and commit to continuing our work to maintain a more balanced&nbsp;system.</p><p>Read more: <br><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-building-counterweights-to-power-83e7234aa958">Pillar Three: Building Counterweights to Power</a><br><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-building-counterweights-to-power-83e7234aa958">Pillar Two: Building an Anti-Racist and Inclusive Economy </a><br><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-grounding-our-economy-in-a-new-ideas-and-values-99596c8dabe8">Pillar One: Grounding Our Economy in a New Ideas and Values</a><br><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and&nbsp;Economy</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-rebalancing-the-relationship-between-government-markets-and-cfc852658f5f">Reimagining Capitalism Series: Rebalancing the Relationship Between Government, Markets, and…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In Support of Tech Whistleblowers Who are Holding Tech to&nbsp;Account</p><p>Digital technology today is more widespread, more convenient, and more ubiquitous than ever before. With a strong Silicon Valley heritage, Omidyar Network recognizes that the promise and the ethos of technology has always been about it being a distributed good, empowering and connecting people all over the world. But as most people have experienced first-hand, today’s tech ecosystem is out of&nbsp;balance.</p><p>While technology pervades nearly every aspect of our lives, it remains largely unregulated with little oversight. A handful of tech giants wield tremendous, unchecked power, and has chosen repeatedly — in contravention of the original ideals of the tech community — profit over consumer, social, and market health. This outsized market dominance, social, and political power has the potential to threaten our individual freedoms, economies, and democracies.</p><p>With little competition, regulation, or other countervailing checks and balances, Big Tech has too much influence. Until recently, these platforms largely avoided meaningful public oversight which has allowed them to do as they wish, often at the expense of consumers, start-ups, and their employees.</p><p>Even as Big Tech’s reach has extended further and faster, it has remained largely opaque. We have had a nagging feeling that the harms they cause are known to them — and are far worse than the public could imagine. That has been validated as truth by a series of courageous whistleblowers who have spoken out and delivered evidence of wrongdoing and misconduct. We stand by them as they have put everything on the line to hold these tech giants to&nbsp;account.</p><p>For those who are considering blowing the whistle, we know that it is a difficult, and often dangerous and expensive decision. That’s why we supported tech leader and whistleblower, Ifeoma Ozoma, and her many partners in creating <a href="https://techworkerhandbook.org/">The Tech Worker Handbook,</a> a collection of resources for people “who are looking to make more informed decisions about whether to speak out on issues that are in the public interest.”</p><p>We are grateful to the brave people who have called out Big Tech for its bad behavior. They are an important part of creating systemic checks and balances for Big Tech. Because of them, policymakers are taking notice and taking action to rein in their excessive power and restore trust and balance in digital&nbsp;markets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/in-support-of-tech-whistleblowers-who-are-holding-tech-to-account-7fa5f66eac1c">In Support of Tech Whistleblowers Who are Holding Tech to Account</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>The Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) is proud of its ongoing transparency initiatives. Namely its open approach to providing unrestricted access to the latest LEI data from around the world with the Quarterly LEI System Business Reports, which are made publicly available free of charge. Through this ‘LEI in Numbers’ blog series, GLEIF aims to highlight key data from the latest report, explaining trends and profiling successes from the global LEI rollout. </p>
<p>The latest report, covering Q3 2021, shows positive growth in the volume of LEIs worldwide. More than 60,000 LEIs were issued in Q3, representing a quarterly growth rate of 3.3%. This steady increase is welcome news as it is common for issuance levels over the summer months to slow. As a result, the total active LEI population is now 1.88 million. </p>
<p>For a further summary of the past quarter’s data, the below infographic contains the key statistics from Q3 2021. </p>

<p>In Q3, Iceland was the largest growth market for LEI issuance, with one of the highest growth rates seen in 2021 (30.8%). This is another significant quarterly increase for Iceland. Between Q1 and Q2, it doubled its growth rate from 9.2% to 19%. This regional growth was driven largely by strong competition among LEI issuers.</p>
<p>Aside from growth in new LEI issuance, renewal rates grew across EU jurisdictions (65.5%, up from 65.0% in Q2) and non-EU jurisdictions (63.0%, up from 62.9% in Q2). The average renewal rate of jurisdictions with more than 1000 LEIs globally remained steady. This consistently high level of LEI issuance and renewals across multiple regions is testament to the maturity of the Global LEI System and its increasingly central role in bringing trust to ecosystems. </p>
<p>In Q3, a new issuer was onboarded into GLEIF’s network of Local Operating Units (LOUs): NordLEI. Previously, NordLEI had been operating as a registration agent in the Nordics before adjusting their status to LOU to actively drive greater LEI adoption across Northern Europe. </p>
<p>For the full report which includes further detail on the status of LEI issuance and growth potential, the level of competition between LEI issuing organizations in the Global LEI System and Level 1 and 2 reference data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Reports page. </p>
<p>If you are interested in reviewing the latest daily LEI data, our Global LEI System Statistics Dashboard contains daily statistics on the total and active number of LEIs issued. This feature now enables any user to review historical data by geography, increasing transparency on the overall progress of the LEI.</p>
<p>For further detail, or to access historical data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Report Archive. We look forward to sharing our progress each quarter as we continue to drive LEI adoption in 2021.</p>

				 <p>OKP4 takes on a European dimension by opening an office in Munich</p>
<p>While OKP4 is beginning to deploy its first use cases in France, particularly in agriculture and logistics, the company is now opening a German subsidiary in Munich. This is an opportunity for the company, specialized in the creation and animation of Data Spaces, to take on a European dimension that can be very essential when it comes to data issues.</p>
<p>OKP4 has officially launched its German subsidiary in Munich at the beginning of October 2021, in collaboration with SCE Space Cooperative Europe, founding member of aNewGovernance. OKP4 GmbH, the new subsidiary of the young Toulouse-based company, will be able to deploy OKP4’s Data Spaces offerings on the German market, particularly in agriculture and industry.</p>
<p>The creation of this subsidiary was also an opportunity for OKP4 GmbH to welcome Onecub, another founding member of aNewGovernance, into its capital for their expertise in digital identity management and consent management.</p>
<p>OKP4’s goals in Germany are clear: to establish Data Spaces projects within German organizations, but more importantly, to reinforce OKP4’s position as a reference in Europe about governance and Data Spaces management for organizations.</p>
<p>Emmanuel MONDON and Markus HAUSER of SCE seized this opportunity to organize a real learning expedition with interesting meetings such as: Invest in Bavaria (the development agency of the state of Bavaria), The Bayerischer Bauernverband (the Bavarian Farmers’ Union), and innovation consulting structures such as ARTTIC or EURA AG.</p>
<p>The founders of OKP4 GmbH also met with the heads of the TUM World Agricultural Systems Center (Hans Eisenmann-Forum for Agricultural Sciences) to discuss agricultural data sharing ecosystems and to consider academic collaborations in the context of European innovation projects (Eurostars 3 and Horizon Europe).</p>
<p>The European network of actors working on Data Spaces continues to grow and shows a growing dynamic with even more collaborations and more partnerships. Data Spaces are the future!</p>

<p>Earlier this year a popular vote has rejected a proposed law on electronic identification (<a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/digital-identity-scheme-faces-scepticism-around-data-privacy/46399636"> results </a>).&nbsp; It was however very clear that a new solution has to be found soon as e-ID can be an important enabler for multiple use-cases and accelerate digitalisation of many daily processes for both the individuals and organisations, if done correctly.</p>
<p>Federal Department of Justice and Police (FDJP) has started a <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/zielbild-e-id.html">public consultation</a>, which should inform Federal Council’s upcoming policy decision.&nbsp; A discussion paper “on the target vision for an e-ID” has been <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/dam/bj/en/data/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf.download.pdf/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf">published</a>, which explores a number of different options and approaches to the future of electronic identity.&nbsp; Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp; (SSI) has been highlighted as one of the possible options and a number of questions has been raised.</p>
<p>It was a great opportunity for DIDAS to provide in-depth commentary to the proposed vision and contribute our collective ideas and expertise to help make a well informed decision. Our submission (in German) is available <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stellungnahme-DIDAS-FINAL-V1.0-website.pdf">here</a></p>
<p>So what did we advocate for?</p>
<p>For us, the members of DIDAS, it was crucial to emphasise that the upcoming policy decision will determine the future of digitalisation efforts in Switzerland and, consequently,&nbsp; its position at&nbsp; international level. The authors of the discussion paper have proposed 3 “levels of&nbsp; ambition”:</p>
 
 e-ID ( secure identification option without media discontinuity&nbsp; – e.g. identity card that can be used in the digital world&nbsp; + login) 
 e-ID linked to other state-regulated proofs&nbsp; ( basic electronic identify + cryptographically linked additional attributes – e.g. driver’s license, diploma, COVID certificate, criminal record, etc) 
 Ecosystem of digital proofs&nbsp; ( e-ID is just one credential, other credentials that are independent of the e-ID are possible, government and private bodies can issue credentials&nbsp; ) 
 
<p>It’s very clear to us that only the Ecosystem of Digital Proofs (Level of Ambition 3) represents the actual ambition that is worth pursuing – creation of a true, future-proof and flexible foundation for digital Switzerland.&nbsp; To create such an ecosystem it’s important to adopt the right approach ( principles, technology, governance model, etc) and&nbsp; make sure that the government plays the appropriate role and enables rather than hinders the future growth and success of this ecosystem.</p>
<p>We have made strong argument in favour of focusing on adopting SSI principles and best practices as the foundation for Ambition Level 3.&nbsp; We highlighted and outlined both the advantages that this will bring ,as well as the open questions that still need to be addressed. E.g. on technology and legislation level.&nbsp; We know that SSI is not perfect yet, but we need to focus on the rapid progress that is being made ( as well as contribute to it) in order to create solid foundation that will last for years to come rather than make a short term decision in favour of something better understood but not designed for the ownership and privacy of the data, open ecosystems, transparent governance and flexibility.&nbsp; We are fully convinced that given the timeframe to draft and implement the future legislation we have ample opportunity and time to get it right!</p>
<p>We further argued that the Government will play an important, enabling role for the ecosystem and by adopting SSI can safely focus on the attributes (or verified credentials) that it has historically been providing. Thus facilitating a smooth transition from a paper-based world to&nbsp; a future, where verifiable data enables new levels of efficiency and flexibility without negatively affecting privacy for both the individuals and organisations.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to the future collaboration with relevant governmental agencies and policy makers that are engaged in decision making process. We’ll continue to explain and promote SSI. Many of our members already implement solutions using SSI principals and technology stack – we happy to provide this expertise to help build the true digital foundation for the future of Swiss Confederation.</p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>We spoke with Alberta Abbey, LEI Analyst, Data &amp; Analytics, LSEG to discuss how this initiative will support wider adoption of globally recognized business identities, in the form of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs), across Africa and how to encourage more entities across Africa to obtain LEIs.</p>
<p>LSEG performs an important role in the Global LEI System as a LEI Issuer, also known as a Local Operating Unit (LOU). LEI Issuers are accredited by GLEIF to issue LEIs to legal entities, supplying registration, renewal and other services, and acting as the LEI system’s primary interface with legal entities. They also work in cooperation with Validation Agents, a new operational model within the system which allows financial institutions to obtain and maintain LEIs for their clients, to support their issuance workflows. </p>
<p>What was LSEG’s role within this flagship initiative? </p>
<p>As the LEI issuing organisation, we provide training and ongoing support to the African Validation Agent.</p>
<p>Why did you decide to become involved with the initiative?</p>
<p>LSEG joined this initiative to facilitate wider LEI adoption across Africa. By demonstrating the uses and benefits of LEIs, our aim is that this project will encourage more entities across Africa to obtain LEIs. We started the project with a partnership approach, which we intend to continue beyond the pilot.</p>
<p>As the 2nd largest issuer of LEIs globally, this project is a good opportunity to partner with the African agent to make LEIs more easily accessible across the continent.</p>
<p>As the LEI Issuer in the Africa LEI initiative, what benefits does LSEG hope to realize through its participation, for itself and also for the banks and SMEs in the region? </p>
<p>We’re pleased to be working with NMB Bank, which is the Validation Agent. Through the collaboration, we’re providing the platform that gives entities in the region access to obtain LEIs, thereby making their status internationally verifiable through GLEIF.</p>

 Digital trust summit a call for action to address Aotearoa’s digital identity challenges. 



<p>The Digital Trust Hui Taumata/Summit will headline next year’s Techweek22 festival and provide an opportunity for a cross-section of stakeholders to share insights on building a thriving trust economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scheduled for the 19th of May at TSB Auditorium, and with a one-day programme featuring keynote talks, panels, use cases and roundtable discussions, the Digital Trust Summit is a must-attend event for all those invested in the future of New Zealand’s digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>Personal data is the new currency of the digital economy. Used effectively, this data can deliver benefits for individuals, businesses and government. But as Aotearoa reaches its digital adolescence, pertinent questions remain:</p>



  How will identity, security and experience integrate?  How can citizens maintain sovereignty over their personal data?  What underpins a successful transition toward open finance?  How will Te Ao Māori be woven into Aotearoa’s Digital Identity?  What are the global opportunities for New Zealand as a ‘trusted digital economy’?  



<p></p>



<p>The speed of our digital transformation and the benefits it delivers for society has much to do with trust. That is to say, declining trust in the way personal information is secured, validated and applied will prevent us from realising the collective economic benefits of digital. With an undoubtedly kiwi flavour, the Digital Trust Hui will seek to answer these questions and more with the help of local and international leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In December 2019, members elected the first Digital Identity NZ Executive Council. The Council is the governing group for the association; providing guidance and direction as we navigate the developing world of digital identity in Aotearoa. Each Council member is elected for a two-year term, with elections held annually and results notified at the AGM in December. So, as we approach the end of the year it is time for us to call for nominations for the Council seats coming up for re-election.<br><br>This year, there are seven&nbsp;positions up for election, x3 positions in the Major Corporate, x3 positions in the Corporate Other, and x1 position for the SME/Start-up category.<br><br>When we formed the Executive Council we asked that you consider electing a diverse group of members who reflect the diversity of the community we seek to support. You did that. The power of that diversity has shone through in the work of the Council this year, especially as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.<br><br>As the Council has considered its own makeup, we’ve identified a number of areas where diversity, as well as expertise in the digital identity space, might help us better serve the community. Nominations from those involved in the business and service sectors and kaupapa Māori organisations are especially encouraged. We also encourage suggestions from young people within your organisations, as the viewpoint of young people is extremely essential and relevant to the work we perform. Digital Identity NZ has a policy on Board diversity which you can read&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6cd211649fd1d09c759c0112f&amp;id=50a0dc76a6&amp;e=40f3555481">here.</a><br><br>Once elected in December, one of the first responsibilities of the new Council will be to elect a new Chair for the EC Council or consider re-electing the current chair. Following the departure of David Morrison, who served as Chair of our organisation since 2018, in February 2021, the council elected Ben Tairea as the new Chair, and both are excellent Kairahi (guides/counsellors/leaders). Currently supporting Ben diligently are Sat Mandri, co-chair and Tamara Al-Salim, deputy chair and their serving terms are through to 2022.<br><br>2022 is a pivotal year for digital identity with the introduction of the Digital Identity Bill and further development of the ecosystem. We are looking forward to some stellar nominations to help us in exploring and pursuing the best opportunities for Digital Identity NZ to make a positive difference in 2022 and beyond. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>Corporations, Capital Markets, &amp; the Common Good — How We’re Working to Reorient the Rules and Rebalance Power in Our&nbsp;Economy</p><p>By Chris Jurgens, Director, Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>At Omidyar Network, we believe business can be a powerful force for good. This is a belief rooted in Pierre Omidyar’s founding of eBay and in Omidyar Network’s decade of experience investing in impact-oriented entrepreneurs. Businesses play an essential role in creating profitable solutions that benefit customers, address societal problems, sustain quality jobs, and support healthy communities.</p><p>We’ve seen particularly powerful examples of this during the COVID crisis, as corporations mobilized their research and development capabilities to invent new vaccines and leveraged global supply chains to distribute them at unprecedented speed and scale. Thousands of companies small and large responded to the needs of their employees, their customers, and their communities with compassion and&nbsp;care.</p><p>But while many individual businesses are making a positive impact, at the macro level, our corporations and capital markets are not delivering the societal outcomes we need. The current paradigm of shareholder-driven capitalism is serving as an engine of inequality and a major impediment to addressing our most pressing societal challenges — persistent structural racism, a fraying social contract, and an accelerating climate crisis. Many of these problems have only been exacerbated by the pandemic.</p><p>Essential workers have been on the frontlines of sustaining our economy through the depths of this crisis, at significant risk to themselves and their families, despite an economic system that too often does not fairly value or respect their contributions to it. In this country, the average <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/windfall-profits-and-deadly-risks/">grocery store cashier makes about $11 an hour</a>, and a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/3/15872260/health-direct-care-jobs">home health care aide</a> makes $25–27,000 a year — levels where it’s hard to make ends&nbsp;meet.</p><p>Meanwhile, the stock market has soared during COVID, and the richest shareholders have added <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/the-wealth-gains-that-made-2020-a-banner-year-for-the-richest-1">$4 trillion</a> to their wealth in just the last year. Most essential workers have not meaningfully benefited from this windfall. The top 10% of the income distribution own of 84% of stock, while half of Americans own none and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-race-and-ethnicity-business-us-news-ap-top-news-69fe836e19a8dfe89d73e8e4be6d480c">Black households</a> own only 1.9%. While we are starting to see encouraging signs of a reviving economy, most Americans have fallen further behind in the last two years and overall <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/covid-pandemic-made-racial-income-inequality-much-worse">inequality has worsened</a>.</p><p>We are seeing these outcomes — more concentrated wealth and power, declining economic mobility — because our economic system has been designed to produce them. W. Edwards Deming, a pioneer of <a href="https://deming.org/category/systems-thinking/">systems thinking</a>, stated that “every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets.” The version of capitalism that currently governs our markets is designed not to produce societal wellbeing, but to maximize returns to shareholders.</p><p>Over the last several decades, a set of beliefs, norms, rules, and laws have served to codify and entrench the idea that a business’s primary objective should be maximizing financial returns for equity holders in markets with minimal government intervention, and that this orientation will both deliver optimal outcomes for business and markets as well as for society writ&nbsp;large.</p><p>This model has failed. It is based on the wrong ideas, driving the wrong decisions, and delivering exactly what you would expect — wealth for shareholders, but problems for society. To fix this, we need to rewire the rules and incentives that are driving the&nbsp;system.</p><p>The Path Forward, from Individual Solutions to Systems&nbsp;Change</p><p>At Omidyar Network, we spent a decade supporting the growth of impact investing and working to harness the power of business to drive positive social and environmental outcomes. We’re proud of that work. But we’ve realized that the efforts of even the most well-intentioned companies and investors to contribute to positive impact won’t ultimately succeed at the scale we need unless we fix the underlying rules and incentives that wire the markets in which they operate — rules that too often reward decisions which generate financial returns for shareholders but are harmful for&nbsp;society.</p><p>The current system constrains what individual businesses or investors can achieve on their own — because the system is designed to reward returns to shareholders and punish actions which deviate from that result. We’ve seen time and again that this system is resilient, and it will strike&nbsp;back.</p><p>Just ask former CEOs <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/76cddc3e-d42e-11e7-a303-9060cb1e5f44">Paul Polman of Unilever</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankvangansbeke/2021/03/20/sustainability-and-the-downfall-of-danone-ceo-faber-12/?sh=107f7feb5b16">Emmanuel Faber of Danone</a>, among the most visionary champions for corporate purpose and stakeholder-centric decision making. Both pushed their companies to prioritize stakeholder and societal outcomes as part of long-term value creation strategies, and both were punished by activist investors who saw this as violating the orthodoxy of short-term profit maximization.</p><p>Individual businesses are fundamentally constrained by the pressures of competition and the demands from our capital markets. They can move on win-win scenarios, where investments or policies that improve ESG outcomes can also be clearly shown to benefit the bottom line. But let’s be honest. Not everything can be a win-win. Often, there’s a direct tension between what insatiable profit-maximizing market forces demand in the short-term and what delivers value for long-term investors and other stakeholders. In this context, we can’t rely on the voluntary actions of corporate leaders alone — we need structural solutions which change the incentives.</p><p>We also recognize the need to address both sides of the impact coin. We believe investors can contribute to tremendous positive impact by investing in solutions that solve societal and environmental problems — but this risks being outweighed by the <a href="https://29kjwb3armds2g3gi4lq2sx1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/210922_IMP_Negative-Investor-Contribution_Discussion-doc.pdf">negative impacts</a> generated by those financial sector actors that drive extractive speculation, prioritize short-term distributions to equity holders over long term value creation, and powerfully reinforce the current paradigm of profit maximization without regard for societal costs. Unless we address the rules that both enable positive impact, and curb negative impacts, our markets won’t deliver the outcomes we&nbsp;need.</p><p>That’s why as part of our commitment to <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Reimagining Capitalism</a>, Omidyar Network is committing $10 million to a new focus area: Corporations, Capital Markets, and the Common Good. The vision for this work is to reshape the rules that govern markets to incentivize corporations and their investors to contribute to the common good, curb the pressures that drive businesses to contribute to negative outcomes on people and the planet, and empower stakeholders to hold companies accountable for their impacts on&nbsp;society.</p><p>To realize this vision, we’re shifting our work with business and investors to two upstream issues which we think are critical to systems change — shifting policy and shifting&nbsp;power.</p><p>Reorienting the&nbsp;Rules</p><p>We think three shifts are key to rewiring the rules that drive corporate and investor decision&nbsp;making.</p><p>First, the rules — particularly those defining <a href="https://theshareholdercommons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-Shareholder-Primacy-to-Stakeholder-Capitalism-TSC-and-B-Lab-White-Paper.pdf">fiduciary duty</a> — should reinforce that corporations are accountable to workers, customers, suppliers, and communities — not solely shareholders. Second, the rules should drive businesses to <a href="https://impactmanagementproject.com/">systematically account for their impacts on people and planet</a>, so that companies can better manage their impacts, and stakeholders can hold those companies accountable. Third, the rules need to curb pressures from capital markets that reinforce short-termism, drive excessive financialization, and enable outright extraction to benefit speculators at the expense of stakeholders and&nbsp;society.</p><p>This is why we are partnering with a range of advocacy organizations — including <a href="https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/">Americans for Financial Reform</a>, <a href="https://bcorporation.net/about-b-lab">B Lab</a>, and <a href="https://www.valuereportingfoundation.org/">The Value Reporting Foundation</a> — seeking to shift corporate governance rules, create a harmonized system of mandatory <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2021/06/10/500352/sec-broad-authority-require-climate-esg-disclosures/">ESG disclosure in the US</a> and globally, and build a <a href="https://bettermarkets.org/">fairer financial system.</a></p><p>Rebalancing Power</p><p>In addition to shifting policy, it’s also critical to shift power — particularly by strengthening stakeholders’ voice in corporate and investor decision making. We think this means strengthening <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ON_POV_PDF-2020.pdf">structural bargaining power for workers</a>, increasing <a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Worker-Voice-and-the-Corporate-Boardroom.pdf">worker voice in corporate governance</a>, and in seizing opportunities to make more workers owners themselves.</p><p>This also means shifting the investment management industry to focus more clearly on serving the needs of the vast majority of investors (by number, if not by assets under management) who are working people saving for their retirement and their children’s education. These days, most such individuals are highly diversified investors saving for the long-term through passive investment strategies through which they own the entire market. What matters most for such investors’ long-term wellbeing and financial security is neither chasing alpha nor minimizing tracking error in an index — it’s the health of our societal systems. It’s employers that provide quality jobs, an economy that delivers broad-based prosperity, stable democratic governance, and a planet that isn’t beset by climate catastrophe.</p><p>Those interests of the average investor are fully in line with the long-term orientation of building a more sustainable, inclusive capitalism. There is a tremendous opportunity to leverage the voice of those individual investors via more active stewardship by the fiduciaries that vote their shares and represent their interests in engaging companies and fund managers. Truly representing these investors’ interests would mean making long-term investments in growth, focusing more on worker wellbeing, and <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Moving-Beyond-Modern-Portfolio-Theory-Investing-That-Matters/Lukomnik-Hawley/p/book/9780367760823">addressing systemic risks</a> like the climate&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>Mobilizing the power of these long-term shareholders is essential to countering the pressure from those financial sector actors bent on “<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/stock-buybacks-from-retain-and-reinvest-to-downsize-and-distribute/">downsize-and-distribute</a>” tactics like squeezing workers, prioritizing public company share buybacks over long-term investments, or stripping the assets from privately-held companies to fund dividend recapitalizations that juice short-term returns.</p><p>This is why we’re partnering with organizations like the <a href="https://www.iccr.org/">Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility</a> (ICCR) and <a href="https://theshareholdercommons.com/">The Shareholder Commons</a> that are working with institutional investors to drive a more systemic, forceful investment stewardship agenda.</p><p>Finally, if we are going to shift corporate and investor decision making, we also believe we need to look at the whole picture. Privately-owned firms represent a <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/articles/articles_publictoprivateequityintheusalongtermlook_us.pdf">large and growing proportion of our economy</a>, but they lack the accountability mechanisms — like disclosure regimes and shareholder engagement — we have for public markets. That’s why we’re focused on increasing transparency and strengthening accountability mechanisms in private markets — particularly in the context of the private equity industry. We’re exploring how to work with private equity firms and their limited partners on strengthening the industry’s attention to stakeholder and societal issues, as well as advancing policy ideas that can help improve transparency for investors and mitigate risks to stakeholders.</p><p>That’s why we’re exploring opportunities to enable private equity firms and their LPs to better measure and benchmark the ESG performance of their portfolio companies. Simultaneously, we’re supporting advocacy to ensure workers’ interests are protected by working with partners like the <a href="https://www.united4respectef.org/">United for Respect Education Fund.</a></p><p>Building a new capitalism</p><p>Over the last several decades, we’ve built an economic system to optimize market efficiency and maximize shareholder returns and hoped it would also yield the societal outcomes we want. That hasn’t worked, full stop. We need to stop designing our society to serve the wellbeing of markets and restructure our markets so that they serve the wellbeing of&nbsp;society.</p><p>We see this work to shift the rules that drive corporations and capital markets as an important complement to Omidyar Network’s commitments to shifting ideas and ideology by creating a <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">new economic paradigm</a>, <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ON_POV_PDF-2020.pdf">strengthening worker power</a>, and <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Omidyar-Network-POV_Platforms-and-Power_2.7.2020.pdf">checking concentrated market&nbsp;power</a>.</p><p>Changing this system will take time, energy, and engagement from everyone that has a stake in it — particularly those whose voices have been excluded.</p><p>We aspire to play a role supporting those change-makers that are seeking to shifting policy and shifting power as two key pieces of a new economic architecture. And we are eager to partner with all of those who share our vision of building an economy that works for everyone.</p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>Barry Cooper is a Technical Director at the Centre for Financial Regulation and Inclusion (Cenfri), an independent, not for profit think tank which works on African financial sector development.</p>
<p>Cenfri has a wide reach across Africa, holding relationships with both regulators and Financial Service Providers (FSPs). Cenfri’s role in the initiative was multifacted and involved finding candidate banks in suitable jurisdictions where the initiative could have the most impact on MSMEs and act as a demonstration case; engaging with regulators regarding the initiative; leading working sessions with the selected bank to guide them through the LEI process and address any challenges; and report writing and validation; among others.  Cenfri and Cornerstone Advisory Plus’s evaluation mechanism successfully identified suitably regulated markets and FSPs that have a strong interest and investment in their micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) clients. </p>
<p>Why did you decide to become involved with the initiative?</p>
<p>Cenfri has done a lot of work on identity, anti-money laundering (AML), counter financing of terrorism (CFT), know-your-customer (KYC) and MSME finance issues and this opportunity resonated with our work. In addition, we strive to lead on best and next practices and were greatly attracted to this initiative as this was the first in Africa, and provided a significant opportunity to shape key practices. </p>
<p>How does your organization benefit from its involvement in the LEI initiative?</p>
<p>Involvement in this initiative benefits Cenfri as we gain unique learnings from prototyping the process, helping to inform our approaches to solving MSME finance issues, particularly in our focus countries in Africa, which include Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>The LEI initiative has also provided a tool that we can recommend to institutions and regulators to address AML-CFT, compliance and de-risking challenges. In addition, Cenfri obtained its own LEI, which we can benefit from using ourselves. </p>
<p>What problems does LEI usage enable SMEs in Africa to overcome in the medium to long-term?</p>
<p>There are 54 states in Africa, each with their own incorporation bodies and registries, which each have varying processes and idiosyncrasies. Reliable verification and further incorporation of information for due diligence and risk management processes require high local country skill levels, can take significant time and is prohibitively costly and hence employed more in larger transactions. MSME, and even some corporate, transactions in Africa are either not progressed or are subject to default assumptions of higher risk. </p>
<p>LEI usage enables MSMEs to obtain a much stronger identity which is globally accessible, trusted and verified. Local banks have deep expertise in their national systems, risks and processes. The LEI harnesses this knowledge in a globally accessible format. The LEI is positioned to overcome risk management information asymmetries enabling better formal trade flows through more accessible trade finance, more accurate finance risk ratings, reduced unfavourable risk premiums, limited transaction delays and fewer outright rejections. It also helps to create more visibility for MSMEs and increases opportunities to trade and connect with partners they may otherwise not have been able to connect with. In addition, it can solve compliance challenges for AML-CFT by ensuring they are adhering to the highest standards globally.</p>
<p>What would the African SME landscape look like if Africa’s $81bn trade finance gap could be narrowed? What would this mean for the regional economy?</p>
<p>Narrowing the $81bn trade finance gap could have material implications for the African economy and its people, with the potential to enable significant growth and competitiveness in international markets. The question remains whether changes in trade activity would be inclusive with positive impact at the lowest income levels or if the benefit would be limited to primary industries and existing corporates, benefitting established social strata. Positive measures, like the LEI, are intended to help MSMEs to participate on a fair footing, promoting sustainable growth and economic diversity. Contributing over 50% of employment worldwide according to the World Bank, a small increase in the size and income of MSMEs can have a significant impact on employment levels and enable the supply of services more efficiently throughout markets. Narrowing the trade gap should link with fostering intra-regional trade between African countries to further enable inclusive growth and development.</p>
<p>What opportunities could be created for the people of Africa if all SMEs could be equipped with globally recognized business ID?</p>
<p>Equipping all SMEs with an LEI will create a universal, continent-wide, robust and interoperable global identity. We see the unlocking of significant latent business and employment opportunities not only for global trade but particularly for trade within the Africa region which in the past has been systemically difficult between 54 states. The LEI will greatly enhance the accessibility and competitiveness of MSMEs not only globally but within their countries and the region. As mentioned previously, moderate MSME growth can have a significant impact in employment across diverse economic sectors and particularly at the lower income levels. Through enhanced networking effects the LEI can also result in better distribution of goods and services across countries, enabling access to additional local, sustainable products and services for Africans.</p>

<p>How we keep pace with changes in digital technologies, and how they are used in our economy and across our communities, will have a strong impact on Aotearoa New Zealand’s future prosperity.</p>



<p>The potential benefits from digital ways of working are exponential. They will help improve lives, expand consumer and career choices, and contribute to solving wider issues, such as climate change.</p>



<p>Our government is embarking on a journey to create&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3628718/national-strategy-digital-twin-and-skills-shortages-on-nz-tech-minister-s-mind.html">A Digital Strategy for Aotearoa</a>&nbsp;that seeks to respond to the social, economic, education and cultural opportunities from digital technology, along with the risks that these technologies can bring.</p>



<p>The strategy will endeavour to set out key goals, priorities and activities for the short to medium term (two-five years), as well as longer term results (out to 2031 and beyond).</p>



<p>The overarching framework for the strategy will consist of three pillars:</p>







 
 
<p>As we have stated previously,&nbsp;Identity&nbsp;along with&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Security&nbsp;is one of the three core elements of&nbsp;Trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the Digital Strategy for Aotearoa begins to take shape, DINZ will be at the centre of the conversation around why a thriving Digital Identity ecosystem is an essential element in achieving the strategic vision of&nbsp;enabling all of Aotearoa New Zealand to flourish and prosper in a digital world.</p>
 



 

 
 



<p>In other news,&nbsp;I’m sad to say that I will be stepping down as Executive Director for Digital Identity New Zealand this month and someone very well known to many people across the Digital Identity community,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-wallis-7921274/?originalSubdomain=uk">Colin Wallis</a>, will be stepping into my shoes.</p>



<p>Colin is a Kiwi who has been overseas for a few years and has recently returned.&nbsp; For the last five years up until mid-June, Colin led the<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, a globally acknowledged Trust Framework Operator of conformity assessment and Trust Marked schemes for Identity, Credential and Consent Management Service Providers.</p>



<p>Building on 21 years of contribution to international standards and industry consortia, Colin will continue to maintain some of his other leadership positions across the consortium space in Information Security, Privacy and Trusted Identity.&nbsp; While leading Kantara he was a member of the OECD’s<a href="https://www.internetac.org/members">Internet Technical Advisory Committee</a>&nbsp;amongst others and will continue his contributions to standardisation into ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27/WG5 Identity Management and Privacy technologies.</p>



<p>Before heading off overseas, Colin worked in the Government’s digital identification programmes, initially at the State Services Commission and later at the Department of Internal Affairs (Government Login Service, iGovt and RealMe), where he has regularly represented New Zealand in international fora.</p>



<p>With his depth of knowledge and experience, it will surprise no-one that Colin was named in One World Identity’s Top 100 Influencers in Identity.</p>



<p>I’d like to welcome Colin into the role and wish him all the best.</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

<p>The Ceramic community is committed to providing the best possible developer experience for building Web3 data applications. Over the past few months, the community has made significant upgrades to Ceramic's emerging open source developer tools and data standards ecosystem, including replacing the popular IDX.js client with a more powerful and flexible set of tools. This post describes the best ways to build applications on Ceramic today as of October, 2021.</p> The Web3 data architecture <p>The primary difference between Web3 and Web2 applications is their data architecture. Web3 applications rely on a user-centric ("self-sovereign" or "sovereign") data storage architecture. In this model, application data is hosted on a decentralized network, stored with each individual user, and is written to and queried by applications client-side. This contrasts to Web2 applications, which rely on an application-centric design where all data for all users of an application is stored in a single database server siloed to that application. </p> What's needed to build sovereign apps? <p>Therefore, building Web3 data apps requires a few foundational primitives:</p>  Network for decentralized data availability with fast mutability  Protocol for identity-centric, model-based data storage and retrieval  Client for performing CRUD operations on users' stores at runtime   User-centric data models <p>As you can see, Web3 data applications are built on the concept of data models for storing and retrieving structured data from user-controlled storage. Web3 takes a model-based approach vs. an application-based approach in order to allow for simple data reuse and composability across applications. It's much easier for applications to share individual data models with other applications (e.g. <code>user profile</code>, <code>social graph</code>, <code>skills</code>, <code>linked blockchain accounts</code>) than it is to force these applications to share entire databases containing all different kinds of data, many of which are not shared between applications. </p><p>Creating a great developer experience around building applications with user-centric data models is important to accelerating adoption of this new Web3 data architecture. Tools that improve the developer experience and increase cross-application data interoperability include: </p>  Tooling to create and deploy data models  Tooling to share, discover, and reuse data models   Example: Decentralized social network <p>As a simple example of how this all works, let's consider a decentralized social network. Behind the scenes this application can be reduced to just four data models, where each user maintains their own data in their own store for each model:</p>  <code>PostList</code>: stores an index of a user's posts  <code>Post</code>: stores a single post  <code>Profile</code>: stores a user's profile  <code>FollowList</code>: stores a list of users they follow   Application deployment and usage <p>To deploy this data application, a developer would deploy each of these data models to Ceramic. After they're available on the network, they can be used by any application to CRUD a user's data store for that model. For example, if another developer is building a new social network and wants to bootstrap it with existing users and content, they can simply reuse the same data models as the initial social network and their application will be able to automatically load and support storage interactions on this existing data. This is how multiple applications can collaborate on shared data sets, and how open data standards and protocols can emerge from any developer in the community.</p><blockquote>For an example of two applications building on the same data models to achieve data interoperability, try the <a href="https://self.id">Self.ID</a> and <a href="https://dns.xyz">DNS</a> applications. Any change to data in one application is automatically reflected in the other.</blockquote> IDX: ID-centric, model-based storage protocol <p>Ceramic provides a decentralized network for data availability with fast mutability, the foundation upon which Web3 data applications can be deployed and run. About a year ago the Ceramic community first introduced <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-11/CIP-11.md">CIP-11 "Identity Index"</a>, commonly referred to as the <code>IDX protocol</code>. It specifies a protocol for identity-centric, model-based data storage and retrieval implemented on top of Ceramic – the second requirement for building sovereign applications.</p> IDX.js: The most popular IDX client <p>IDX protocol (CIP-11) is just a specification and not working code. To make the protocol usable by application developers, the <a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a> team created IDX.js, a runtime library for performing CRUD operations on users' data stores – the third and final requirement for building Web3 data applications. They also created supporting tools such as the IDX CLI, and a reference application, <a href="https://self.id">Self.id</a>, to showcase IDX.js and related Ceramic technologies.</p><p>By serving as a simple entry-point to building applications on Ceramic, adoption of IDX.js has accelerated in lockstep with growth of the Ceramic ecosystem and has become the most popular way to build applications on Ceramic. Almost all of the applications currently deployed on Ceramic mainnet are using IDX.js.</p>Usage of IDX.js has accelerated with usage of Ceramic Why change a good thing? <p>In an attempt to offer more features, service more use cases and provide the best developer experience, the scope of IDX.js grew beyond simply providing a bare-bones implementation of the IDX protocol to a point where it became unnecessarily monolithic and opinionated. </p><p>As a result, IDX.js and associated libraries <code>idx-constants</code>, <code>idx-tools</code>, <code>idx-cli</code> are being deprecated. They are replaced by a new collection of tools outlined in the rest of this post.</p><blockquote>If you are currently using IDX.js and/or 3ID Connect, there is no rush to upgrade your code. There are no breaking changes to the IDX protocol itself, and the data interactions of the new libraries are fully compatible with IDX.js.</blockquote> DataModels: Open source for data models <p>DataModels allows developers to create, share, reuse, and discuss open source data models for Ceramic applications that can be used with the IDX protocol, enabling cross-application data interoperability.</p> DataModels Registry <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels">DataModels Registry</a> is an open-source, community-created repository of reusable application data models for Ceramic. It provides a single place where developers can openly register, discover, and reuse existing data models – the foundation for interoperable applications built on shared data models. Currently the registry is implemented as an open source Github repository dual-licensed under MIT and Apache 2. In the future, it will be decentralized on Ceramic.</p> Installation &amp; Usage <p>All data models added to the registry are automatically published to <code>npm</code> under the @datamodels organization. Any developer can install one or more data models by using the <code>@datamodels/model-name</code> convention, making those models available for storing or retrieving data during runtime with any IDX client, including DID DataStore or Self.ID, both of which are described below.</p>Install DataModels from the @datamodels npm org DataModels Forum <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/discussions">DataModels Forum</a> is located within the DataModels Registry repository. Every model in the DataModel Registry has its own discussion thread which the community can use to leave reviews, have discussions, discuss upgrades, etc. Developers can also post <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/discussions/categories/ideas">ideas</a> for DataModels to solicit input from the community prior to adding it to the Registry.</p> Glaze: Ceramic Developer Suite <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/overview/">Glaze</a> is a suite of low-level developer tools for building applications on Ceramic. Glaze aims to provide developers with more flexibility and control by unbundling IDX.js into smaller, more specific packages.</p> DID DataStore.js: Core IDX client <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/did-datastore/">DID DataStore</a> is a bare-bones IDX runtime client – a stripped-down replacement for IDX.js – with less scope and fewer dependencies. If you've used IDX.js, you'll notice that DID DataStore does not come bundled with default data models, such as <code>basicProfile</code>, nor does it support CAIP-10 blockchain accounts links out of the box. If you want to use DID DataStore with data models or blockchain accounts you will need to separately install these as packages. If you want a more bundled, drop-in solution similar to IDX.js, see Self.ID below.</p> DataModels.js: A runtime for DataModels <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/datamodel/">DataModels.js</a> is a runtime library that simplifies the process of using data models in your application. It is frequently used with DID DataStore, and supports a few useful runtime features for DataModels:</p>  Availability – ensures the data models used your application are available on your Ceramic node, so they can be used with a Ceramic or IDX client, such as <code>DID Datastore</code>  Aliasing – allows developers to assign human-readable names to their data models, so they can more easily be used within application code instead of needing to reference data models via their <code>streamID</code>  <blockquote>If you've used IDX.js or the IDX CLI, DataModels serves as a replacement for running the <code>idx bootstrap</code> command or using similar bootstrap files, and eliminates the need to create aliases at runtime.</blockquote> More Glaze Tools   <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/development/#devtools-library">DevTools</a> is a library for managing the full lifecycle of DataModels, such as creating custom models, adding to existing or creating new schemas and definitions, and publishing DataModels to any Ceramic node.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/development/#cli">Glaze CLI</a> is an upgraded command line interface that is designed to support Glaze development flows. It provides more functionality than the core Ceramic CLI, and adds native functionality for DataModels and DID Datastore.   Self.ID: Bundles for building Ceramic apps <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/overview/">Self.ID</a> is a suite of high-level bundles that simplify the development process for building Ceramic applications. </p> Self.ID Core: Read-only bundle <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/read/">Self.ID Core</a> is a package that comes pre-installed with everything you need to build applications that read data from accounts on Ceramic. Self.ID Core offers cross-platform support, but read-only APIs. If you are currently using IDX.js, Self.ID Core is very similar. It includes: </p>  Ceramic client: <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/javascript/http/">JS Ceramic HTTP Client</a> with all required setup. The only thing you need to do is pass in your node's <code>CeramicURL</code>  IDX client: DID DataStore.js  DataModels runtime: DataModels.js  Popular DataModels: <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/identity-profile-basic">Basic Profile</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/3id-keychain">3ID Keychain</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/identity-accounts-crypto">Crypto Accounts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/identity-accounts-web">Web Accounts</a>  Popular utilities: Support for CAIP-10 blockchain accounts    Self.ID Web: Browser bundle <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/write/">Self.ID Web</a> extends the Self.ID Core bundle with write APIs and provides built-in user authentication. Self.ID Web only supports browser applications, and is now the most popular bundle for building Ceramic applications.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a>: Browser-based, cross-chain user authentication system that is compatible with blockchain wallets. 3ID Connect allows users to connect one or more blockchain accounts from any chain to their Ceramic decentralized identity. 3ID Connect supports all EVM chains and other blockchain platforms such as NEAR, Cosmos, Filecoin, and Tezos.   More Self.ID Tools   <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/utilities/#image-interactions">Image Utilities</a>: for uploading images to IPFS, storing them in multiple sizes and resolutions, and retrieving one most desirable to your application UI. Great for optimizing application performance when handling images such as user profiles photos. Sometimes you want to show a full-resolution image (e.g. profile page), and other times you only low-res thumbnails (e.g. dashboard).  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/self.id/tree/master/packages/3box-legacy">3Box Legacy Profiles:</a> A utility function for loading a legacy 3Box profile as a BasicProfile. Previously, this was provided by IDX.js.   FAQs  Which library should I use? <p>If you are already familiar with IDX or are more advanced in your development needs, DID DataStore is likely a better option; it offers the most flexibility and new features will be implemented there first. If you use custom data models (schemas and definitions), you should get familiar with the new set of tools for data models including the DataModels Registry and DataModels.js.</p><p>If you are just getting started with Ceramic and IDX, Self.ID should provide a smoother experience. It allows you to build Web3 data applications without having to understand all the concepts in order to have a working setup. You should still learn about Ceramic and the rest of the ecosystem if you want a better understanding of the full set of possibilities.</p> What should I do now? <p>IDX.js and related packages are being deprecated. Moving forward new features and improvements will only be implemented in the Glaze and Self.ID packages. We recommend that you update your app to use the new packages whenever possible.</p> Join the developer community <p>The Ceramic community is passionate about building Web3 data applications. If you want to learn more about anything mentioned in this post, encounter any issues trying to use the new tools, either for a new project or migrating from IDX.js, please <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">join the Ceramic Discord</a>!</p><p>To get started building Ceramic applications, head over to the developer documentation for <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/overview/">Glaze</a> and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/overview/">Self.ID</a> now!</p>

Bild: Diskussion über die Sicherheit von Wallets für digitalen Identitäten Aktuelle Diskussion und&nbsp;Kontext <p>Am 23. September 2021 hat die Bundesregierung erstmals den digitalen Personalausweis und Führerschein für das <a href="https://my-digi-id.github.io/index.html#mobile-app">ID-Wallet</a> einer breiten Öffentlichkeit vorgestellt und es war für kurze Zeit möglich einen Personalausweis und Führerschein in das ID-Wallet abzuleiten. Hierbei ist es leider zu Problemen gekommen, da die Nachfrage um ein vielfaches höher als angenommen war. Im weiteren Verlauf haben Mitglieder rund um den Chaos Computer Club (CCC) die ID-Wallet, sowie die zugrundeliegende Technologie in einem <a href="https://lilithwittmann.medium.com/mit-der-id-wallet-kannst-du-alles-und-jeder-sein-au%C3%9Fer-du-musst-dich-ausweisen-829293739fa0">Artikel</a> kritisiert. Da das Lissi Wallet hier genannt und gezeigt wurde, möchten wir eine Einordnung schaffen, einen Überblick über die angesprochenen Probleme geben und potenzielle Lösungen diskutieren.</p> Abgrenzung ID-Ökosystem der Bundesregierung und “Schaufenster sichere digitale Identitäten”. <p>Seit 2019 führt das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi) ein Projekt zur Förderung neuer digitaler Identitätslösungen durch. Nach einer sechsmonatigen Wettbewerbsphase, für die sich jede Institution in Deutschland bewerben konnte, wurden vier Projekte zur Förderung im Rahmen der <a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Navigation/DE/ProgrammeProjekte/AktuelleTechnologieprogramme/Sichere_Digitale_Identitaeten/sichere_digitale_ident.html">Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten</a> ausgewählt. Die ausgewählten Projekte (im folgenden Schaufensterprojekte) sind Forschungsprojekte, die mit über 120 involvierten Institutionen gemeinsam innerhalb von drei Jahren neue Lösungskonzepte für digitale Identitäten erforschen und umsetzen, darunter zahlreiche Institute mit dem Schwerpunkt IT-Sicherheit. Folgende Projekte nehmen am Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten teil: <a href="https://www.once-project.de/">ONCE</a>, <a href="https://id-ideal.hs-mittweida.de/">ID-Ideal</a>, <a href="https://www.sdika.de/">SDIKA</a> und&nbsp;<a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a>.</p><p>Parallel dazu hat die Bundesregierung im <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/975188/1824788/372199dfb12ff630da046dae6ae2849d/2020-12-03-europaeisches-oekosystem-digitaler-identitaeten-data.pdf?download=1">Dezember 2020</a> ein eigenes ID-Ökosystem rund um die ID-Wallet gestartet. Das <a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/Webs/PA/DE/verwaltung/projekt_digitale_identitaeten/projekt_digitale_identitaeten_node.html">BMI</a> beschreibt das Projekt wie folgt: “Bürgerinnen und Bürger können künftig persönliche Daten und digitale Nachweise verschlüsselt in ihren Smartphones speichern und dann selbstbestimmt, sicher und einfach für Online-Dienste von Unternehmen und Behörden verwenden.”</p><p>Das <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi Wallet</a> ist bisher nicht Teil des ID-Ökosystems der Bundesregierung und wird überwiegend im Rahmen des Schaufensterprojekts “IDunion” genutzt und weiterentwickelt. Es ist bisher nicht darauf ausgelegt offizielle Dokumente wie den Personalausweis und Führerschein zu speichern und dies war bisher für Endanwender*innen auch nie möglich. Ziel der Schaufensterprojekte ist es allerdings genau dies in Zukunft zu erreichen und dafür entsprechende Sicherheitsmechanismen zu entwickeln.</p><p>Insofern sind wir für jede Kritik an der Lissi Wallet sehr dankbar und nehmen die von Lilith Wittmann und Fabian Lüpke, der unter dem Pseudonym “Flüpke” im Internet Auftritt, geäußerten Bedenken ernst. Gleichwohl ist es sehr wichtig diese immer im Kontext der verschiedenen Anwendungsfälle und deren Vertrauensniveaus zu betrachten!</p> Probleme und mögliche Lösungswege <p>In ihrem <a href="https://lilithwittmann.medium.com/mit-der-id-wallet-kannst-du-alles-und-jeder-sein-au%C3%9Fer-du-musst-dich-ausweisen-829293739fa0">gemeinsamen Artikel</a> sowie einer <a href="https://github.com/Fluepke/ssi-poc">Proof of Concept (PoC) Implementierung</a> sprechen Lilith und Flüpke mehrere Probleme der Walletlösung an. Wir möchten diese Probleme nochmal kurz in eigenen Worten erklären und mögliche Lösungsoptionen aufzeigen.</p> 1. Verifizierung von anfragenden Parteien <p>Bei verifizierten Dokumenten in einem ID-Ökosystem ist ein wichtiger Aspekt, dass die ausstellende Partei nicht in die Präsentation eines Nachweis gegenüber der anfragenden Partei involviert ist. Für den Prozess der Anfrage und der Präsentation wird eine direkte Kommunikation mit Ende-zu-Ende Verschlüsselung zwischen Nutzer*innen und der anfragenden Partei genutzt. Um die benötigten Schlüssel für die sichere Kommunikation auszutauschen, wird hierzu oftmals ein QR-Code genutzt, welcher Nutzer*innen über einen bereits bestehenden sicheren Kommunikationskanal übermittelt werden&nbsp;muss.</p><p>Beschriebenes Problem: Sollte der sichere Kanal kompromittiert werden, kann dies einer Angreifer*in erlauben, eine sogenannte “Man-In-The-Middle-Attacke” durchzuführen. Hierzu tauschen Angreifer*innen Schlüssel und Endpunkte aus und präsentieren Nutzer*innen einen gefälschten QR-Code, welcher das Ergebnis der Abfrage und damit die persönlichen Daten umleiten. Das Problem besteht darin, dass Nutzer*innen grundsätzlich keine Möglichkeit haben, die anfragende Partei innerhalb der Wallet zu authentifizieren und Betrüger*innen sich als beliebige Institution ausgeben könnten um persönliche Informationen anzufragen. Die Verantwortung den initialen Kommunikationskanal zu überprüfen liegt somit auf der Nutzerseite.</p><p>Mögliche Lösung: Um die Legitimität einer Anfrage verifizieren zu können, müssen sich anfragende Institutionen zuvor in einem öffentlichen Register z.B. mit öffentlichen dezentralen Identifikatoren (DIDs) registrieren. Die öffentlichen DIDs können durch eine vertrauenswürdige Partei (z.B. einem <a href="https://esignature.ec.europa.eu/efda/tl-browser/#/screen/tl/DE">Vertrauensdiensteanbieter</a>) in einer “Trusted List” zertifiziert werden. Das Wallet von Nutzer*innen kann bei neuen Anfragen die Authentizität über die entsprechende “Trusted List” validieren und Nutzer*innen die verifizierte Identität der anfragenden Partei anzeigen.</p><p>Grundsätzlich wäre auch denkbar, dass nur verifizierbare Institutionen hoheitliche Dokumente abfragen dürfen. Ob dies in der Realität sinnvoll wäre ist zu diskutieren. Alternativ müssen Nutzer*innen darüber aufgeklärt werden, dass die anfragende dritte Partei nicht verifiziert werden kann und die Daten nur geteilt werden sollten, wenn Nutzer*innen dem Kontext der Anfrage vertrauen. Mit der zunehmenden Offenheit der Ökosystems ergeben sich somit auch zusätzliche Risiken für Nutzer*innen.</p> 2. Der Missbrauch von verifizierten Daten: <p>Wenn Informationen mittels einer verifizierbaren Präsentation mit einer dritten Partei geteilt wurden, dann erhält diese Partei die angefragten Klardaten (z.B. Name, Geburtsdatum) und eine entsprechende Signatur vom Aussteller der Informationen, um zu überprüfen, dass die erhaltenen Informationen unverfälscht sind.</p><p>Beschriebenes Problem: Angreifer*innen, welche verifizierte Identitätsdaten abfangen konnten, können diese missbräuchlich verwenden. Dieses Problem unterliegt der Annahme, dass ein Angriff, wie in Punkt 1 beschrieben, möglich und erfolgreich war.</p><p>Bestehende Lösung: Jede verifizierbare Präsentation eines verifizierbaren Nachweises ist mit einer Nonce versehen, die sogenannte Replay-Attacken verhindert. Die Angreifer*in ist somit nicht in der Lage mit den gestohlenen Daten weitere Anfragen zu beantworten und neue verifizierbare Präsentationen zu erstellen. Sie kann ausschließlich die gestohlenen Klardaten nutzen. Da schon durch die Preisgabe der Klardaten ein Schaden entstehen kann, ist es trotzdem notwendig den unter Punkt 1 beschriebenen Angriff auszuschließen.</p> Wie geht es&nbsp;weiter: <p>Neben den aufgezeigten Lösungsansätzen gibt es sicher noch eine Reihe weiterer Möglichkeiten und auch das beschriebene Angriffsszenario ist, wie bereits erwähnt, je nach Anwendungsfall differenziert zu bewerten.</p><p>Sowohl im ID-Ökosystem der Bundesregierung als auch in allen Schaufensterprojekten kommen sogenannte “selbstbestimmte” Identitätslösungen (kurz SSI) zum Einsatz. Viele andere Staaten weltweit, entwickeln derzeit ähnliche Lösungen. Deutschland geht dabei keinen Alleinweg.</p><p>Grundsätzliche Problemstellungen werden z.B. global auf dem halbjährlich stattfindenden <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW) diskutiert. Der nächste IIW findet vom 12. — 14. Oktober statt. Wir möchten gern alle Beteiligten aufrufen sich hier zu treffen, um offen und konstruktiv über die Lösungsansätze zu sprechen.</p><p>Darüber hinaus werden wir im Rahmen der Schaufensterprojekte gemeinsam mit zahlreichen Institutionen die bestehenden Herausforderungen lösungsorientiert angehen und begrüßen konstruktive Kritik und die Beteiligung der Öffentlichkeit. Nur gemeinsam können wir erfolgreich ein Fundament für unsere digitale Gesellschaft schaffen!</p><p>Das Lissi Team freut sich auf eine konstruktive Diskussion.</p>

 Investment in transportation, agriculture, healthcare, and education should take priority over investment in surveillance technologies. <p>While artificial intelligence (AI), a signature technology of the 4th Industrial revolution (4IR), has been projected to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2020/01/13/the-future-is-intelligent-harnessing-the-potential-of-artificial-intelligence-in-africa/">transform</a> the socioeconomic landscape of Africa by creating <a href="https://oecd-development-matters.org/2021/02/09/developing-an-artificial-intelligence-for-africa-strategy/#:~:text=Africa%20has%20a%20unique%20opportunity,economic%20problems%20that%20Africa%20faces.">new efficiencies</a> in the public and private sectors, it has some way to go to live up to this hope. Instead of exciting <a href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/news/36-million-boost-for-ai-technologies-to-revolutionise-nhs-care/">public-led</a> applications such as the use of AI by the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom to fight diseases, the most promising applications of AI in Africa are, not surprisingly, private sector-dominated. From behemoths like <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/07/mapping-africas-buildings-with.html">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/facebooks-ai-team-maps-out-where-everyone-in-africa-lives/">Facebook</a> to smaller startups, private firms are attempting to create impact at scale in Africa through applications such as <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2020/03/05/meet-africas-bot-builders-the-startups-pioneering-chatbot-solutions-on-the-continent/">chatbots</a> in healthcare and the financial industry and AI <a href="https://african.business/2021/04/agribusiness-manufacturing/drones-and-ai-move-africas-farmers-to-greener-pastures/">drone-empowered</a> disease surveillance in agriculture. As I’ve explained <a href="https://paradigmhq.org/4th-industrial-revolution-readying-africa-for-the-emerging-ai-decade/">elsewhere</a>, African countries will falter in their quest for an AI-led 4IR economic boost if they neglect investments in foundational 2nd and 3rd IR technologies such as efficient transport systems, power grids, and reliable broadband connections for a critical mass of the population. The 4IR does not happen in a bubble; it feeds upon successful integration with 2nd and 3rd IR technologies. Little wonder, then, that the most visible public-private partnership in AI deployment for societal good during the Covid-19 pandemic was its use for <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/news/latest-news/research-news/2020/2020-12/ai-helps-to-identify-new-covid-19-hotspots-in-gauteng.html">disease surveillance</a> in Johannesburg — within Africa’s most advanced economy where 2nd and 3rd IR technologies are better developed than in most of&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>A huge part of AI’s ineffectual public sector-led impact in Africa is poor <a href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/statisticalcapacity/">statistical capacity</a>, which might be a good intervention point for AI capacity-building grants for the continent. Government and other public statistical agencies are poorly equipped to keep accurate and granular records in critical sectors such as economic indicators, health data, environmental data, and even transportation data. AI systems <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2021/09/03/can-national-statistical-offices-shape-the-data-revolution/">feed</a> on large, accurate, and digitized datasets to produce insights for development, and in Africa today, the organizations with the capacity to harness such data power are typically in the private sector. We probably should not expect a replica of a UK NHS intervention in Africa anytime soon. There doesn’t seem to be enough political will to build efficient public statistical systems in Africa. The only exception seems to be in biometric surveillance.</p>Photo: <a href="https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/security-cctv-camera-monitoring-system-with-panoramic-view-of-a-city-on-blurry-gm962263118-262802771?utm_source=pixabay&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=SRP_image_sponsored&amp;referrer_url=http%3A%2F%2Fpixabay.com%2Fimages%2Fsearch%2Fbig%2520brother%2520surveillance%2F&amp;utm_term=big%20brother%20surveillance">Pixaby</a><p>It seems ironic that one of the most extensive public sector-led applications of AI in Africa is the implementation of biometric surveillance technology. Many African cities have become urban experiments in the deployment of AI-powered biometric surveillance. A few examples will suffice. In 2019, Police in <a href="https://africacenter.org/spotlight/surveillance-technology-in-africa-security-concerns/">Uganda</a> bought $126 million worth of CCTV surveillance technology from telecommunications firm Huawei to help control crime in Kampala, the country’s capital. In Nairobi, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/specials/connected-world/government.html">Kenya</a>, Huawei has also implemented a new communications network which links 1,800 surveillance cameras with 195 police bureaus and 7,600 police officers. In <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-05-09-big-brother-south-africa-will-not-only-be-watching-you-hell-also-share-your-biometric-data-with-the-cops/">South Africa</a>, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHA) draft identity management policy proposed that biometric information recorded by numerous surveillance cameras installed in public spaces across the country will be linked to the DHA’s population register and this database shared with the Police. In <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202003/biometrics-and-digital-id-in-africa-this-week-increasing-cctv-surveillance-new-id-document-contracts">Madagascar</a>, Huawei is also installing over 1,000 CCTV cameras in the country’s major cities. Other African countries which have deployed <a href="https://africacenter.org/spotlight/surveillance-technology-in-africa-security-concerns/">surveillance</a> technology include Algeria, Botswana, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p><p>A conspicuous thread linking many of these projects is Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. Many of these surveillance projects are linked with Huawei’s <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/watching-huaweis-safe-cities">safe cities</a> project, a Chinese-led global partnership in security infrastructure. China has been a major partner in Africa’s economic renaissance, having built <a href="https://africacenter.org/spotlight/surveillance-technology-in-africa-security-concerns/">about 70%</a> of the 4G telecommunications infrastructure on the continent. The Infrastructure Consortium for Africa <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/02/chinese-firms-african-labor-are-building-africas-infrastructure/#:~:text=Chinese%20enterprises%20have%20dominated%20the,toward%20African%20infrastructure%20development%20projects.">estimates</a> China’s contribution to infrastructure development financing at $25.7 billion in 2018, about a quarter of the total $100.8 billion committed to infrastructure projects. China is also emerging as perhaps Africa’s most important trading partner, with an estimated <a href="http://www.sais-cari.org/data-china-africa-trade">$200 billion</a> worth of trade in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>China will remain an important partner for Africa. Nevertheless, it does not seem right that in the poorest continent on the planet, the most visible, public-led 4IR implementation is in security — and is simply a tool to maintain authoritarianism in many countries. Security is not the most urgent problem confronting Africa. Indeed, there are those who would argue that Africa’s security challenges are exacerbated by poor governance. The same local political will that has brought about these security investments in Africa can also be brought to ensure that 4IR impacts are more strongly felt in public sectors such as transportation, agriculture, healthcare, education — probably Africa’s greatest needs. A good place to start might be in partnerships to strengthen public statistical capacities and international knowledge transfers critical for the success of AI applications in Africa. The China-African partnership might be more meaningful if some of the agenda setting is African and recognizes that implementing effective public sector AI applications which improve the livelihoods of ordinary people will improve security better than a thousand biometric surveillance systems.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/big-brother-a-critique-of-the-4th-industrial-revolution-in-africa-fdcd1a5fdddd">Big Brother: A critique of the 4th Industrial Revolution</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>We spoke with Yann Desclercs, Managing Director, Cornerstone Advisory Plus to discuss how broad adoption of the LEI in the African financial system could help to reduce the continent’s trade finance gap. Cornerstone Advisory Plus is an advisory firm based in Cote d ́Ivoire, West Africa. It specializes in compliance advisory and training services for private and public sector institutions, including regulators and financial sector supervisors.</p>
<p>As part of the multi-stakeholder initiative, Cornerstone Advisory Plus assisted with the coordination of the project in collaboration with the other project partners. In addition, the Cornerstone team provided technical content and insight, facilitated stakeholder engagements and conducted data analysis with a special focus on compliance and KYC data. Cornerstone Advisory Plus also brought a francophone West African and international perspective to the project. </p>
<p>Having worked on the ground with financial institutions in Africa, what impact could broad LEI usage have on the broader financial system?<br>
African financial institutions are struggling to access international correspondent banking networks, either because they do not have the critical size required in terms of volume of activity, or, more importantly, because they are not always fully compliant with international AML and KYC standards and sanction regimes. As a result, the African financial system is widely perceived as high risk by the international financial community. International banks have therefore formed the assumption that establishing links with these institutions would lead to costly due diligence processes, which would outweigh the potential additional revenue generated by transaction fees. The outcome of this risk vs reward analysis usually prevents these banks from establishing links with African financial institutions and can lead to them severing ties from existing relationships, a phenomenon known as ‘de-risking’. </p>
<p>Broad usage of the LEI can provide greater transparency in the African financial system. This would help improve the risk assessments for individual entities together with the perception of system itself, opening it up to a worldwide network of international financial institutions. This would certainly help support the effective inclusion of African financial institutions in the global economy.</p>
<p>Do you think the broad usage of the LEI could also have an impact on SMEs in the region?<br>
Of course. As we know, de-risking has a huge impact on African economies and SMEs in particular, which make up the largest economic subset. A recent report from AfDB and Afreximbank shows that the continent’s trade finance gap is estimated at US$81bn, largely due to compliance and KYC issues and de-risking.  SMEs are the most affected by this issue. Reversing the trend of de-risking by fostering transparency of the African financial system through the broad adoption of the LEI could help to reduce the trade finance gap for SMEs and wider African economies.</p>
<p>How can the LEI initiative help banks with their internal processes? How can they become more efficient as a result?<br>
Banks that participate in this LEI initiative and take on the role of a Validation Agent can leverage their existing KYC process to obtain LEIs for their customers, with minimal to no additional steps, depending each bank’s KYC framework. As a result, participating banks can obtain strong global business IDs for their customers and help them to address globally recognized verification processes, all while streamlining their internal processes for periodic KYC renewals and ongoing customer information updates. </p>
<p>Another key benefit of equipping clients with an LEI is the simple identification of parental links between corporations using the GLEIF database, which can prove particularly useful in establishing beneficial ownership links as required by FATF recommendations and most jurisdiction’s laws. All these efficiency gains in the KYC process could eventually lead to greater cost efficiency by reallocating compliance resources proportionally and utilizing an effective risk-based approach as per FATF’s first recommendation, which is translated into most international  and national laws.</p>
<p>What strategic benefits can banks realize by participating in the LEI initiative? How does it help them grow revenue, opportunities or market share?<br>
Participating banks can benefit from improved risk perception within the international financial community, ultimately leading to increased trade capacity and corresponding market share. They can also develop a competitive edge by offering their customers globally recognized business IDs, delivering additional benefits for their SMEs and corporate customers. </p>
<p>This competitive edge coupled with the enhanced trade capacity could lead to significant growth in both market share and revenues, subject of course to an aligned and appropriate commercial, marketing and communication strategy.</p>
<p>What kind of ID services could an African bank anticipate developing once it has equipped its SME customers with LEIs?<br>
The sky is the limit. However, for the purpose of this interview, let’s focus on existing platforms such as the MANSA repository created and managed by a partnership led by Afreximbank. The MANSA repository is a single source of the primary data required for the conduct of customer due diligence on African entities including financial institutions, corporates and SMEs. Subject to an agreement between MANSA initiative and GLEIF, the LEI could be offered as an option/choice for the identification verification part of the repository. The LEI being an internationally recognized global business ID, it could potentially add on to the already established reputation of the MANSA repository and fast track the onboarding for all entities who already have an LEI.</p>
<p>This fast-tracked onboarding process could apply to any other national or regional ID platform on the continent. To achieve this in practice, discussions need to be conducted between GLEIF and the platform managers around the continent in order to establish collaborative avenues in order to reach an LEI-based onboarding process in the existing ID platforms.</p>

Photo by Kelly Sikkema on&nbsp;Unsplash<p>Imagine a world where our oldest and youngest Americans get the care they need. A world where racial inequities are something we work to face and heal rather than exacerbate. Imagine a world where our public schools and universities provide excellent educations that set our students up for success. A world where new businesses can flourish and research and development lead to incredible breakthroughs promoting well-being in science and technology. And imagine a world where our roads, bridges, and drinking water are safe and our infrastructure helps to mitigate the looming climate crisis. This world doesn’t have to be a dream. It is possible if we view our government as a force for social good — intended to benefit the largest number of people in the largest possible way — and our tax policy as a means to get&nbsp;there.</p><p>What we decide to do together and how we choose to pay for it reflects what we value as a society. It is how we express our democratic priorities for the collective good. It signifies our priorities and considerations of fairness and reciprocity. And it signals how we treat the most privileged versus people who are left behind or left out; individuals and businesses; investors and employees. Unlike almost any other government policy, tax squarely answers the question: “What (if anything) do we owe to each other?”.<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn1">[1]</a></p><p>Tax is a complicated and often emotional issue because it tends to be a proxy for the collision of two core but divergent concepts that guide American society: the roles of individual responsibility versus the common good. Beyond that, tax is also one of the most visible representations of the role of government in our lives, and it sets key incentives for many aspects of our economy and&nbsp;society.</p><p>Our government is not just an abstract, remote bureaucracy. Under democratically legitimate governance, it represents all of us. Government is intended to be a means to enact our collective will, and one of the critical ways we can build a “more perfect&nbsp;union.”</p><p>More practically, our government is responsible for maintaining our nation’s roads and bridges; keeping our air, food, and water safe; taking care of our veterans; conducting and funding research that can lead to medical and technology breakthroughs, new energy technologies, and critical vaccines; providing health care and education; and much more. Our government is what makes our market economy possible, providing a stable currency of exchange; enforceable contracts and property rights; and consumer protections. Our government has a profound impact on our everyday lives. It has played an even more important role during the Covid pandemic, keeping families and small businesses afloat during these challenging times, just as it has in wartime and other past emergencies.</p><p>But good government is not free. It must be adequately funded to carry out its charge effectively.</p><p>With sufficient revenue, we could pay for programs and services that give every American a chance to get ahead: creating jobs that pay a livable wage; investing in education and making college affordable; shoring up our safety net programs for the long term; reducing poverty; and protecting people who have been marginalized by our current systems. To make these government services accessible and responsive, we need quality civil service and civil servants — which also cost&nbsp;money.</p><p>We recognize that our government does not always live up to these ideals. Often, it falls short because it is not adequately funded. For decades, conservative politicians and thought leaders have been advocating for smaller government, which erodes its ability to function properly. At the same time, political pressures can sway policymakers to do the bidding of special interests at the expense of those with less influence or&nbsp;power.</p><p>We believe in the role of government and the value it can bring. Tax policy is a critical means to achieve a healthy and stable democracy, economy, and shared values. Americans agree. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/321041/new-high-government-solve-problems.aspx">According to a September 2020 survey by Gallup</a>, “For the first time in Gallup’s 28-year trend, a majority of Americans think the government should do more to solve the nation’s problems. As the U.S. continues to struggle with the coronavirus pandemic, the resulting economic downturn, and racial injustice issues, 54% of U.S. adults favor increased government intervention.”</p><p>For these reasons, we believe US tax policy should be guided by four core principles that reflect the values of a democratic country; values that center the well-being of the many over the benefits of a privileged few.</p><p>Omidyar Network’s Principles for Fair and Equitable Tax&nbsp;Policy</p>  People with less shouldn’t pay more than people with&nbsp;plenty.  Wealth should not be rewarded more than&nbsp;work.  Big businesses should pay their fair&nbsp;share.  Tax expenditures should build toward the future we want for&nbsp;all.  <p>The Current Situation</p><p>Our tax code furthers the divide between the haves and the have-nots — not just in the size of their wallets, but also in how they relate to and support each other. This can and has led to erosion of our sense of shared belonging and reciprocity.</p><p>In a variety of important ways, our tax code is not aligned with our American values of fairness and equity.<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn2">[2]</a> It contributes to a corrosive inequality (across incomes, wealth, geography, gender, and race) that undermines our social fabric and our democracy, which in turn creates openness to authoritarian responses and solutions, <a href="https://institute.global/policy/themes-we-think-will-shape-2018">a theme the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change warned of in&nbsp;2018.</a></p><p>If we look at our federal tax system as a whole and for individual taxpayers, it is, broadly, progressive<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn3">[3]</a>. People with higher incomes tend to face higher tax rates on their income. For instance, the bottom 20% of households pay just 0.9% of their income in federal taxes, while the top 1% of households pay one-third of their income in federal&nbsp;taxes.</p><p>However, rates do not tell the whole story. From a <a href="https://www.epi.org/explorer/taxes">tool created by the Economic Policy Institute</a> to examine how US taxes and spending affect income inequality:</p><p>Decades of corporate tax cuts and increases in payroll taxes, which are less progressive, have weakened the equalizing effect of the federal tax system. Those taxpayers who derive most of their wealth from capital assets enjoy preferential tax rates while flat taxes on consumer goods, such as the gas tax, disproportionately harm those at the bottom of the income distribution. And the decline in corporate tax rates also explains why some analyses of the absolute richest households (the top 0.1% or the Forbes 400, for example) show their tax rates are actually lower than those faced by typical taxpayers.</p><p><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/substantial-income-of-wealthy-households-escapes-annual-taxation-or-enjoys#_ftn1">Because of our upside-down tax code</a>, in many cases, as Warren Buffet famously pointed out, people who have lower incomes end up paying a higher share of their income in taxes than people who have higher&nbsp;incomes.</p><p>We also tax income generated from labor at a higher rate than capital generated from wealth and investment. And businesses can take advantage of loopholes to avoid taxes that most employees cannot, again preferencing those with&nbsp;power.</p><p>What We Believe &amp; What We Should&nbsp;Do</p><p>Our society, democracy, and the functioning of our economy depend on citizens knowing that our social contract is being honored, and that there is fairness and reciprocity and opportunity for all, not just for some. The current tax code and its outcomes, however, do not live up to this standard; rather, they undermine trust and stand in the way of shared prosperity.</p><p>We know it requires much more than a fair tax code to build an equitable and inclusive economy. Often, tax is an output, redistributing money as a result of other economic policies. Ultimately, we believe we will have better outcomes if we focus upstream, building the markets and systems we want rather than trying only to remedy their unequal outcomes on the back end. So we view tax policy as a, “Yes,&nbsp;and.”</p><p>To that point, Omidyar Network also works on issues like expanding <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ON_POV_PDF-2020.pdf">worker power</a>, reshaping markets so that they incentivize businesses to contribute to the <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism-4/">common good</a>, and <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Omidyar-Network-POV_Platforms-and-Power_2.7.2020.pdf">reining in monopoly power</a> to increase competition and spark innovation.</p><p>In our effort to <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">reimagine capitalism</a> and seed a new economic paradigm, we argue that our government must govern markets in ways that prioritize the public good. We also call out the failings in our economic system that foment economic insecurity, exacerbate inequality, and deny opportunity, and as we have recently experienced, has resulted in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/10/capitol-insurrectionists-jenna-ryan-financial-problems/">the consequent openness to authoritarian siren&nbsp;songs</a>.</p><p>Omidyar Network, in alignment with our <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Call to Reimagine Capitalism in America</a>, believes our <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2012/04/19/11404/the-federal-tax-code-and-income-inequality/">tax code currently reinforces wealth and income inequality</a>. We believe instead it should promote fairness, reciprocity, and a renewed social contract based on mutual trust between individuals and government. We urge our funding partners, current and future grantees, and policymakers at the local, state, and federal levels to consider the following principles when evaluating, advocating, and enacting tax&nbsp;policy:</p>  People with less shouldn’t pay more than people with&nbsp;plenty.  <p>The current tax code doesn’t ask enough of the&nbsp;wealthy.</p><p>This is grounded in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility">Peter Parker Principle</a>: With great power comes great responsibility. Before Spiderman, even Adam Smith, the Father of Economics and Capitalism wrote in The Wealth of&nbsp;Nations:</p><p>“[I]t is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion”, because a tax on “the luxuries and vanities of life [which] occasion the principal expense of the rich… would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be anything very unreasonable.”</p><p>We believe we have mutual obligations to each other that should be reflected in our tax code, and that wealthy individuals have a responsibility to pay their fair share. People with higher incomes and assets should have both higher nominal and effective tax rates. Our tax code should reflect our values and reinforce broadly shared prosperity for the many, not just the privileged few.</p><p>2. Wealth should not be rewarded more than&nbsp;work.</p><p>Currently, our tax code gives preferential treatment to wealth-holders by taxing capital income at lower rates than labor income. This is true nominally through lower statutory rates and substantively through lower effective rates. This not only fuels inequality but disincentivizes work and deemphasizes investment in the real economy at the expense of increasing returns for shareholders.<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn4">[4]</a></p><p>Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman wrote, “Less capital taxation means that the wealthy — who derive most of their income from capital — can mechanically accumulate more. This feeds a snowball effect: wealth generates income, income that is easily saved at a high rate when capital taxes are low; this saving adds to the existing stock of wealth, which in turn generates more income, and so&nbsp;on.”</p><p>Research suggests that many CEOs who take a $1 salary are rewarded with stock, option, or bonus packages that match — or even outweigh — the cash they sacrifice on a pay stub.<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn5">[5]</a> One 2011 <a href="https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2011-7.pdf">study</a> of 50 executives concluded that the average “$1 CEO” gives up $610k in salary but gains $2m in other “not-so-visible forms of equity-based compensation.” These skewed compensation schemes are a predictable response to the incentives in our tax&nbsp;code.</p><p>There are many potential policy remedies to bring capital and labor taxation more in balance, and in turn, reduce economic inequities. Reflecting this principle, we support equalizing the treatment and rates (nominal and effective) between labor income and capital gains, which would likely entail raising tax rates on&nbsp;capital.</p><p>3. Big businesses should pay their fair&nbsp;share.</p><p>As with individuals, we suggest that large companies who earn more should pay&nbsp;more.</p><p>Part of that belief is based on an obligation to the common good but also acknowledges that many companies benefit from a range of government-provided services or investments (like the internet, highways, the postal system, government-sponsored research) that contribute to their ability to get off the ground, their profitability, and their basic operations.</p><p>Our tax policies and a raft of <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/tax-policy/tax-expenditures">tax expenditures</a>, both large and small, create a broad labyrinth of incentives to catalyze smart investments, support research and development, foster competition and competitiveness, slow the pace of climate change, and fuel our economy<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn6">[6]</a>.</p><p>At its best, tax policy can motivate businesses to hire people who would otherwise have a hard time finding work, including veterans and people with disabilities; encourage them to invest in communities that have been overlooked and left out; bring jobs home from overseas; promote clean energy to address our growing climate crisis; and help small business owners get started and&nbsp;succeed.</p><p>We are an organization founded by an entrepreneur. We believe our tax policies should help new businesses get off the ground, and we share the goal of fostering a vibrant, dynamic start-up economy. In alignment with The Tax Foundation, we too believe our<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/tax-policy-entrepreneurship/"> tax code should be seen as a vehicle for accelerating economic growth and dynamism</a>.</p><p>For decades, economists posited that higher individual and corporate tax rates stifle entrepreneurship and new start-up formation. The opposite is true. Data shows if you overlay corporate tax rates with rates of new business creation, you’ll see that as <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/historical-corporate-tax-rates-brackets/">corporate tax rates decreased over time</a>, so <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/trends-in-new-business-creation/">did new business creation</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn7">[7]</a></p><p>Additionally, evidence on the effect of tax on entrepreneurship is mixed at best, as the <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/more-evidence-that-you-cant-lure-entrepreneurs-with-tax-cuts">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a> has&nbsp;noted:</p><p>150 executives surveyed by <a href="http://www.endeavor.org/blog/about-insight/">Endeavor Insight</a>, a research firm that examines how entrepreneurs contribute to job creation and long-term economic growth, said a skilled workforce and high quality of life were the main reasons why they founded their companies where they did; taxes weren’t a significant factor.</p><p>Our government and our tax policies provide the infrastructure for new businesses to not only get started, but to thrive. From support for R&amp;D, to roads and bridges that move goods, to public services and universities that educate our students and working people, to basic elements and institutions that guarantee rule of law and the enforceability of contracts and private property, our government and our tax policies champion corporate opportunity.</p><p>With that opportunity again comes an obligation for corporations to pay their fair share. The corporate share of federal tax revenue has dropped by two-thirds in 60 years. Corporate tax revenue accounted for 32.1% of federal revenue in 1952, but by 2012, the share of corporate tax revenue had fallen to 9.9%, according to the Office of Management and&nbsp;Budget.</p><p>Why? It’s not because businesses are less profitable, or less competitive (In 1952, post-tax corporate profit was 8.6%; in 2012, it was 11%<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn8">[8]</a>). Rather our tax code now has enshrined a range of loopholes and exemptions that not only allow, but encourage, corporations to avoid or evade taxes.<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn9">[9]</a></p><p>In 2020, 55 of the nation’s largest and most profitable corporations — including FedEx, Nike and Archer-Daniels-Midland — paid no federal corporate income tax, <a href="https://itep.org/55-profitable-corporations-zero-corporate-tax/">according to</a> the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy. This was legal. It was not&nbsp;fair.</p><p>Tax avoidance schemes involving tax havens in places like the Cayman Islands are estimated to cost as much as $100 billion a year in lost revenue, according to a <a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/files/REPORTTaxHavenBanksJuly1708FINALwPatEliseChgs92608.pdf">US Senate subcommittee</a> report from&nbsp;2008.</p><p>We do not fault them for taking advantage of the laws as written to minimize their tax obligations. They are behaving legally and rationally given the system’s rules. But we believe the laws themselves should change to better reflect our shared&nbsp;values.</p><p>While corporations can reduce the amount they owe in taxes in a variety of legal ways, we believe that avoiding fair taxation should not be a badge of honor. As billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban said, “While some people might find it distasteful to pay taxes, I don’t. I find it patriotic.”</p><p>Growth over the past 60 years has actually <a href="http://www.epi.org/files/2013/ib364-corporate-tax-rates-and-growth.pdf">been stronger when corporate tax rates were higher,</a> according to the Economic Policy Institute.</p><p>We need to close loopholes and strike the right balance in our corporate tax policy so that businesses can remain competitive while fulfilling their obligation to the broader community for the benefit of most Americans.</p><p>4. Tax expenditures should build toward the future we want for&nbsp;all.</p><p>There is always a push and pull with our tax code. Above, we spoke primarily about how we can pull back bad behavior and promote fairness. We also can use tax policy and tax expenditures to push good behavior forward and toward the outcomes we want as a&nbsp;society.</p><p>According to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), the projected cost of the tax expenditures in 2020 was $1.795 trillion, with $172 billion in corporate expenditures and $1.62 trillion in individual expenditures.<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn10">[10]</a> The US tax code in recent years annually enshrines between 280–300 separate tax expenditures, roughly 60% of which are aimed at individual taxpayers, and the other 40% at business taxpayers.</p><p>The three biggest individual tax incentives by dollar amount are for employer-sponsored health plans, earnings on defined contribution pension plans, and reduced rates on dividends and long-term capital gains (see principle #2 above). A number of them are broad-based and well-intentioned, for instance, home mortgage interest deductions to promote home ownership, charitable contributions, or several more recent corporate tax expenditures, aimed at encouraging companies to repatriate income and jobs from overseas and remove intellectual property loopholes to avoid paying US tax. Others are quite narrow, for instance, commuting to work by&nbsp;bicycle.</p><p>However, in any broad analysis, like the vast majority of our tax code, tax expenditures tend to favor the wealthy and well-connected corporations. <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52493">According to the Congressional Budget Office</a> (CBO), on the individual taxpayer side, the top 1% of earners receive 17% of the benefit from individual tax expenditures. Lobbyists have wrangled expenditures for their clients’ special interests, including special depreciation schedules for corporate jets, loopholes that allow inversions, subsidies for fossil fuels, and deductions for CEO bonuses, as well as regular tax law that allows wealthy owners to depreciate their ownership of multi-billion-dollar sports&nbsp;teams.</p><p>Instead of being unduly swayed by corporate lobbyists, we encourage policymakers to examine tax expenditures with a holistic lens toward the future we want to build. We suggest the questions below as a guide so that expenditures are a vehicle for prosperity, fairness, and equity in our tax&nbsp;system:</p>  How can tax expenditures help close the racial wealth gap and address the systemic inequities that marginalize Black, Brown, and poor families?  How can tax expenditures help us mitigate and adapt to a rapidly changing&nbsp;climate?  How can tax expenditures spur research and development to prepare for the future, and invest in the real economy (while correcting for current shortfalls that allow R&amp;D investments to be opaque on tax returns)?  How can tax expenditures spark innovation to create the tech we want in service of the common&nbsp;good?  How can tax expenditures promote economic mobility and growth for the many, and improvement of the safety net for the least fortunate?  How can tax expenditures more generally reinforce a fairer, more progressive tax&nbsp;system?  <p>The recent changes to and expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) provide one clear answer to these questions. If made permanent, the CTC could “dramatically <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5743308460b5e922a25a6dc7/t/600f2123fdfa730101a4426a/1611604260458/Poverty-Reduction-Analysis-American-Family-Act-CPSP-2020.pdf">reduce childhood poverty</a> and improve children’s chances of upward intergenerational mobility, increasing both their future earnings and the corresponding tax revenue that will be collected on it.”<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn11">[11]</a> These are the types of tax expenditures that can have a dramatic, positive impact on our society for many Americans.</p><p>In theory, our tax code is “race-neutral.” However, it builds on a toxic legacy of policies that unfairly and unequally distribute resources. <a href="https://apps.urban.org/features/race-and-taxes/">Recent analysis by the Tax Policy Center </a>shows a variety of ways in which tax policies also exacerbate <a href="http://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/">income and wealth inequalities</a> stemming from <a href="https://next50.urban.org/question/structural-racism">long-standing discrimination</a> in areas such as housing, education, and employment. According to a <a href="https://ncrc.org/holc/">study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition</a>, three out of four neighborhoods redlined on government maps 80 years ago continue to struggle economically.</p><p>Educational outcomes are also linked to redlining. <a href="https://www.edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai21-363.pdf">The Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University found that districts and schools located in formerly redlined neighborhoods have lower average test scores</a>. Today, 44% of Black families own their own home, compared to 74% of white families. To encourage more Black families to buy homes and build wealth, we could give a credit for first-time home buyers instead of a deduction for mortgage interest, which benefits borrowers buying bigger&nbsp;homes.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>As policymakers consider new tax policies, we suggest they meet the following tests:</p>  Does it benefit the many, not just the privileged few?  Does it address collective challenges, not just individual ones?  Does it reduce wealth and income inequalities, rather than increase them? Does it promote upward mobility for&nbsp;all?  Does it help achieve our shared values (e.g., reducing child poverty, creating good jobs, equity across race and&nbsp;gender)?  Does it foster innovation, economic growth, and investment in the real economy, rather than incentivize shareholder primacy and stockpiling cash and&nbsp;profits?  Does it preserve the principle of progressivity in our tax policy&nbsp;overall?  Does it discourage “bad behavior” and mitigate externalities (e.g., carbon tax, sin taxes on alcohol and cigarettes, financial transactions tax)?  <p>We are committed to applying this test to our own advocacy work related to revenue-focused policies at the federal and state&nbsp;level.</p><p>Tax policy must be reformed so that it is fairer and more equitable. We believe restructuring our tax code can take many forms, and while we do not prescribe specific policy recommendations or rates here, we do commit to greater transparency in our own work related to tax<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn12">[12]</a>, and to honoring the principles outlined above. There is much that we as philanthropists, our grantees, advocates, lawmakers, and regulators can do so that every American has a fair chance to prosper and thrive and we no longer have to imagine that world, we can live in&nbsp;it.</p><p>_____________________________________________________</p><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftnref1">[1]</a> A riff of T.M.

That night together they dreamed up a vision of the future where festivals were powered by solar, venues were off-grid and covered in flowers, museums were community energy providers, artists were united as beacons for&nbsp;change.</blockquote><p><a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> are currently helping JB with two strands of work. The first strand, which we can discuss here, involves digital transformation that includes hiring a digital product team. If you, or anyone you know, might be interested in applying for any of the roles, check out <a href="https://apply.workable.com/julies-bicycle/j/984AF66A8C/">JB’s recruitment page</a>. The first position is currently live, and more positions will be released over the next few weeks and&nbsp;months.</p><p>The second strand, led by <a href="https://outlandish.com">Outlandish</a> and to which we’re contributing, involves work with a large commercial music organisation.

While they are looked after by a specific member of the JB team, they have been developed by freelancers based on the needs of particular projects and programmes.</p><p>Now, at a time when the urgency of the climate crisis is being felt everywhere, JB is creating their first digital team. This team will not only improve and expand Creative Green Tools, but potentially create new products and services.</p><p>Bringing this development in-house can be scary for not-for-profit organisations like JB.

<p>Authentication plays an increasingly important role in how governments are providing services around the world.</p>



<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit on Sept. 23, 2021, users, experts and vendors from around the world detailed how strong authentication helps to enable government services and new efforts to secure online identities. Users including the U.K. National Health Service (NHS), as well as the U.S. Government’s <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provided insights into the present and future of online authentication and digital identities.</p>



  



<p>In the opening session of the event, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance, outlined the strategic imperative for FIDO in government services around the world.</p>



<p>“COVID-19 created an imperative to really accelerate digital transformation activities,” Shikiar said. “When the pandemic hit all of a sudden, everyone was at home and all activity brought requirements for modern authentication schemes that go far beyond passwords, even beyond traditional multi-factor authentication.”</p>



<p>Shikiar noted that the FIDO Alliance standards align very well with global regulations and policies and there is a growing trend of government guidance for authentication that cites the use of FIDO.</p>



<p>“It’s important to enable trust in the government ecosystem,” Shikiar said. “This comes through the engagement FIDO does with different regulators and government bodies and ultimately will be manifested through the secure implementation of digital identity services to citizens worldwide.”&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Technology Helping to Push FIDO Strong Authentication Forward</p>



<p>A key path for enabling FIDO specification is via vendors that support government efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patrick Sullivan, CTO of security strategy at Akamai, commented that password credential stuffing attacks are very common. He noted that Akamai’s platform sees as many as a billion password attacks per day. That’s where multi-factor authentication and more specifically strong authentication based on FIDO Alliance standards play a strong role. Sullivan noted that there is a clear need to provide multi-factor authentication in a low friction environment where it’s delivered in the form factor of an app on a smartphone.</p>



<p>“We’re not asking users to carry around a hardware token to accomplish FIDO2 as we move in that direction, and by introducing less friction, there’s less risk of our users doing something anomalous,” Sullivan said.</p>



<p>Jeff Frederick, manager of solutions engineering at Yubico, noted during his session that in government, many agencies in the U.S use Common Access Card (CAC)/Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials that go beyond basic passwords. Frederick noted that FIDO2 standards, which are supported on his company’s YubiKey device, provide a strong impersonation resistant authentication protocol that uses public private key cryptography.</p>



  



<p>“It’s very similar to PIV/CAC and FIDO2 is an open standard that’s managed by the FIDO Alliance, so that any vendor can support this and use it today,” Frederick said. “It’s built into all major operating systems and all major browsers so there’s no middleware that you need to install to make this work and it’s just an easy to implement solution that will modernize the federal authentication infrastructure across the board.”</p>



<p>Making Identity and Authentication Less Taxing at the IRS</p>



<p>The IRS proofs and authorizes tens of millions of taxpayers every year, across both digital and non digital channels, according to Courtney Rasey, assistant to the director, Identity Assurance, Privacy Governmental Liaison, &amp; Disclosure (PGLD) at the IRS.</p>



<p>“None of those tens of millions of taxpayers who are calling the IRS are doing so just because they want to, it’s not really a fun weeknight activity,” she said. “They need to resolve an issue to meet their tax obligation and we know that, so we’re always striving to provide better service to taxpayers, to help them get the service that they need in the most convenient and efficient way possible.”</p>



  



<p>One way the IRS is looking to be more convenient to taxpayers is with its Secure Access Digital Identity (SADI) platform that was launched in June of 2021. Rasey explained that SADI leverages a Credential Service {rovider (CSP) that identity proofs the taxpayer and then provides the IRS with a digital identity credential.</p>



<p>“Users are eventually going to be able to access all IRS online applications utilizing that single digital identity credential,” Rasey said. “The IRS is moving more and more applications behind SADI throughout fiscal year 2022 and as we do move more applications taxpayers are going to be able to do so many things with just one credential.”</p>



<p>Moving Toward Zero Trust with Strong Authentication</p>



<p>In May, President Biden signed Executive Order 1402, which directs U.S. government agencies to improve cybersecurity. One of the primary provisions of the executive order is to move the federal government toward a zero trust architecture.</p>



  



<p>“When we talk about zero trust, we’re talking about an architecture where people and their devices aren’t trusted just by virtue of being inside an organization’s enterprise network,” explained Eric Mill, senior advisor, Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>



<p>Mill noted that in a zero trust model, people and devices are validated at each step and&nbsp; authentication is context-aware. The OMB is strongly encouraging the adoption of phishing resistant multi-factor authentication, with FIDO WebAuthn as a good alternative option in environments where CAC/PIV isn’t feasible.</p>



<p>“We’re pushing very hard on multi-factor authentication and we really view reliable authentication as a critical foundation of zero trust architecture,” Mill said.</p>



<p>In a Policy Deep Dive session, Jeremy Grant, managing director, technology business strategy at Venable, noted that there are a number of reasons why authentication is important to governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grant said that FIDO specifications can help governments to protect access to their own assets and can help to enable more high-value citizen facing services to the public.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think what we’re seeing in 2021, is a really different environment across the globe, where FIDO authentication is emerging, not just as another permitted option, but in many cases as a preferred choice of governments across the world,” Grant said.</p>



  



<p>How the National Health Service (NHS) uses FIDO</p>



<p>Among the areas in the world where FIDO is finding a home is in the U.K.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded medical and healthcare system in the U.K. and it has embraced FIDO standards to help improve human health.&nbsp; With the NHS Login service, citizens get a centralized identity for health services while the NHS app provides a simplified application for accessing and managing an individual’s access to health services.</p>



<p>Priyanka Mittal, technical architect for the NHS Login and NHS app, said that over the past 18 months there has been a 10-fold increase in the user base for NHS login as demand has grown during the pandemic.</p>



  



<p>Sean Devlin, tech lead for the NHS App, explained that initially the services started out using an SMS based two-factor authentication approach, but wanted to find a more seamless approach. NHS decided to use FIDO UAF and built out its own implementation, using eBay’s open source FIDO implementation as a starting point.</p>



<p>Devlin said that before using FIDO, users had to navigate as many as five different screens to get through a multi-factor authentication flow. With FIDO, it’s a single screen.</p>



<p>The NHS has also saved a lot of money by moving to FIDO. With over 500,000 FIDO logins per day, Devlin estimates that the NHS is saving on the order of £8,000 per day on SMS messaging costs.</p>



<p>Bringing FIDO Strong Authentication to Login.gov</p>



<p>FIDO specifications also play a pivotal role at login.gov, which is a single sign-on platform for U.S. government services.</p>



  



<p>Jonathan Hooper, login.gov Engineering Lead at the General Services Administration (GSA), explained that the authentication portal fronts over 200 sites across the U.S. government,&nbsp; spread across 27 different agencies. Hooper explained that starting in 2018,<a href="http://login.gov"> login.gov</a> began expanding the use of multi-factor authentication, including the WebAuthn specification.</p>



<p>“We don’t want to be ‘big brother,’ we want to make sure that we can protect users’ privacy and the things built into the protocol that helped to do that were very attractive to us,” Hooper said. “WebAuthn is also very cheap, it is much cheaper to do a WebAuthn authentication event than it is to do SMS by several orders of magnitude.”</p>



<p>Improving Digital Identity with FIDO</p>



<p>A FIDO-based approach for digital identity could soon be finding its way to Canada as well according to Joni Brennan, president, Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC). An effort currently underway is the Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) which is an information assurance framework.</p>



<p>“We think that there’s a great opportunity here to leverage an information assurance framework, coupled with FIDO Alliance driven specifications, to create and to verify that end to end experience that’s needed for&nbsp;digital ID adoption,” she said.</p>



  



<p>The need for secured digital identities was also highlighted by Amit Mital, special assistant to the President and senior director, National Security Council at the White House.</p>



<p>“Today, when we authenticate ourselves and identify ourselves, we might use one of dozens of popular systems,” Mital said. “</p>



<p>So the ecosystem itself is very decentralized, and it’s very unharmonized. It is also fundamentally unsecure.”</p>



<p>Mital said that there is a clear need for strong remote identity solutions that can provide easy, secure, affordable and reliable ways to identify consumers across digital systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s clear that there are a diverse and large number of scenarios that need digital identity and there is no single entity that can solve all these scenarios,” Mital said. “We need an ecosystem that brings together the best ideas and innovation from the private sector, both large companies and startups, as well as the government at both the federal and the state, the local, tribal and territorial lands.”</p>



<p>Wrapping up the day’s event, Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance, observed that there are a lot of conversations ongoing about&nbsp; different types of government services and their dependency on secure digital identity.</p>



<p>“Ultimately, identity and authentication are core to deploy new services at scale, in a way that meets the requirements for government agencies, and for citizens alike,” Shikiar said.</p>

 Project EDGE is setting the standard for a customer-centric grid architecture that maximizes the value — and impact — of distributed resources <blockquote>“Customers don’t want kilowatt-hours; they want… hot showers and cold&nbsp;beer.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://rmi.org/insight/negawatt-revolution/">Amory Lovins’ famous quip</a> highlights a paradox of the global energy transition: although hardly anyone gives a second thought to the machinations of the grid, consumer behavior is perhaps the most significant force transforming the electric utility industry.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-03/hyperdrive-daily-ev-adoption-outpaced-off-the-mark-outlooks">Each year actual adoption of electric vehicles, flexible loads, rooftop solar arrays, battery storage systems, and other DERs exceeds even the most bullish of predictions</a>. Transitioning to a decarbonized, distributed electricity system seems less like a wicked problem and more like an irreversible trend.</p><p>Case in point: the Ford F-150 Lightning. When the best-selling vehicle (a pickup truck, no less) in the most car-crazy country on Earth turns into a 180 kWh power plant on wheels with the ability to provide full-home backup power for over a week, distributed energy has officially gone mainstream.</p><p>There is no doubt that an <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/energy-transport-sustainability-10-predictions-for-2021/">ever-growing fleet</a> of DERs represents a massive opportunity to improve resiliency, lower costs, and reduce carbon emissions in grids across the world. Yet even as DERs get cheaper, more powerful, and more plentiful, they remain chronically underutilized.</p><p>Regulations like <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ferc-order-2222-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity-for-decentralized-technologies-to-accelerate-the-c35cf41527cb">FERC Order 2222</a> and frameworks like <a href="https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/Publications/Position%20papers%20and%20reports/TSO-DSO_ASM_2019_190416.pdf">Integrated TSO/DSO Coordination</a> have been developed specifically to address this challenge and tap into burgeoning DER resources in the US and Europe, respectively. Yet while FERC 2222 is ostensibly designed to remove barriers to DER participation in all energy markets, it has caused much hand wringing, delayed regulatory filings from every major ISO / RTO, and as yet, no tangible results. In Europe, progress on TSO/DSO coordination isn’t much further along. Despite plenty of <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/11/30/17868620/renewable-energy-power-grid-architecture">excellent work on conceptual frameworks</a>, hesitation remains amongst grid operators (and regulators) to lean into the transition.</p><p>Why? By and large, incumbents are focused on solving the wrong problem. Too often, the assumption is that the key to unlocking the full potential of DERs is some sort of optimization: How can we perfectly utilize lots of small-scale, flexible assets to balance the variable nature of large-scale renewables like wind and solar? That work is important, but it’s not the real barrier to redesigning our grids’ architecture and toolsets. Focusing on DER optimization is like debating the merits of Gmail vs. Apple Mail vs. Microsoft Outlook before you’ve solved a more fundamental issue: how to send and receive email through a common, narrow waist protocol.</p><p>Before we can optimize DERs, the grid needs its own equivalent of SMTP — an open protocol through which DERs of all shapes and sizes can seamlessly exchange data and integrate into markets. The solution may not be easy, but it is surprisingly simple: there needs to be a shared view of DER attributes, relationships, and behaviors across all participants so each can perform their respective function. Just as the physical grid evolved over a century ago, the best way to achieve this is through shared, public digital infrastructure, rather than leaving it up to individual companies to manage independently. We can all move better and faster when we move together.</p><p>To see the answer in action, look to Australia.</p><p>Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) is at the bleeding edge of the distributed energy world, and it’s only getting more advanced in the coming years. With the <a href="https://onestepoffthegrid.com.au/australia-leads-the-world-on-solar-per-capita-at-664-watts-per-person/">highest per capita penetration of solar PV in the world</a>, an incredibly <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/31/australias-energy-storage-installed-base-to-grow-more-than-five-times-by-2030/">mature storage market</a>, a<a href="https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/climate-change/net-zero-plan/electric-vehicle-strategy"> host of EV incentives</a>, and greatly expanded <a href="https://aemo.com.au/en/initiatives/trials-and-initiatives/wholesale-demand-response-mechanism">opportunities for demand-side market participation</a>, Australia is on pace to get <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/henbest-energy-2040-faster-shift-clean-dynamic-distributed/">nearly half of its electricity from DERs by&nbsp;2040</a>.</p><p>In a deregulated energy market like the NEM, there are lots of proverbial cooks in the kitchen. For any given customer who owns rooftop solar or storage, there’s a long list of stakeholders, including the DER manufacturer (or “OEM”), the DER installer, the local distribution utility (Distribution Network Service Provider, or “DNSP”), their energy retailer, perhaps an aggregator, and of course the Australian Energy Market Operator&nbsp;(AEMO).</p><p>Each of these parties, including the customer themselves, is interested in the DER for different reasons. The customer might primarily care about how the DER delivers comfort or economic benefit, the OEM cares about operational performance and warranties, the DNSP cares about the DER’s impact on network congestion, the retailer on tariffs and/or wholesale market exposure, the aggregator on its impact to deliver grid services or optimize its DER portfolio, and AEMO cares about its contribution (or lack thereof) to the aggregator’s portfolio delivery.</p><p>Today each of these stakeholders operates more or less in their own separate world with limited, if any, information about the others. Typically, the information each stakeholder has about the DER and its influence on their domain is protected; sharing is not encouraged and customers need to register separate accounts with each entity. This presents a number of problems.</p><p>The primary revenue opportunity for DER owners is providing one or more services in the NEM wholesale market via an aggregator. As more aggregators enroll more DERs into more services and markets, the collective impact on the distribution network can be detrimental if DER behavior is not informed by physical grid constraints. Even though they manage interconnection requests, the DNSPs don’t ordinarily enroll DERs to use for local services, so they don’t monitor or manage their behavior on an ongoing basis. Yet most customers would happily enroll in complementary local services programs for DNSPs to maximize their revenue potential.</p><p>So we currently have markets where participants often act in operational silos, and DERs are not utilized to their fullest potential. Data exchanges, where they exist, are accomplished through bespoke point-to-point integrations between each participant’s system. Maintaining alignment across all their systems, managing access and permissions, and establishing relationships is extremely costly relative to the value of any given&nbsp;DER.</p> Project EDGE: Overcoming the Barriers of Legacy Data&nbsp;Exchange <p>In <a href="https://energyweb.org/aemo/">Project EDGE</a>, Energy Web (EW) is working with AEMO, AusNet (a key DNSP), and Mondo (a large aggregator), to build a shared infrastructure for establishing identity, roles, and permissions for all market participants. Instead of the bilateral point-to-point integrations, we’re building a hub and spoke architecture in which each participant’s IT system integrates with a common, shared data exchange solution. In other words, the hub isn’t unilaterally controlled by any single party; rather, it’s built using EW’s Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS), which allows every single market player to participate by hosting nodes (i.e., servers) that facilitate data exchange between all parties’ internal IT and OT systems. It provides a shared, trusted view of identity, relationships, and permissions for different actors and components within the system. EW-DOS also streamlines message exchange, and allows AusNet (the distribution utility), and AEMO (the wholesale market operator) to coordinate on the utilisation of DERs simultaneously across local and wholesale services.</p><p>In EDGE, all participating organizations and DER assets are given a unique digital identity via <a href="https://did-explainer.energyweb.org/#/default-dashboard">decentralized identifiers, or DIDs</a>. DIDs not only contain information about the physical location and attributes of DERs, but also define relationships (e.g. mapping a given DER to a specific aggregator’s portfolio) as well as roles within the EDGE marketplace (e.g. permissions to send/receive, or read/write certain types of&nbsp;data).</p><p>On the aggregator side, DIDs act as a common anchor point for enrolling and operating DERs in multiple markets based on their technical capabilities and where they are connected in the distribution grid. On the grid operator side, DIDs help the DNSP pair enrollment information with actual, physical grid constraints — such as congestion or capacity limits on certain distribution feeder circuits — so AEMO can factor those constraints into wholesale market operations. In short, DIDs become the common currency — the narrow waist protocol — by which all parties develop a shared understanding of the system state and move forward from&nbsp;there.</p><p>DERs are interconnected physically to the grid. With EDGE, they are now also interconnected digitally to each other and to grid operators’ systems, unlocking a next wave of the energy transition. By leveraging a shared infrastructure, EDGE removes the traditional friction for identity verification and data reconciliation among aggregators, DNSPs, and AEMO. Being fully open source, there are no licence fees, which helps significantly reduce market operating costs, as well as competitive barriers for existing and new entrants. Having designed it to be protocol agnostic, the EDGE architecture is highly flexible, ensuring participants don’t need to reengineer their own systems to engage with&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the ongoing energy transition, decarbonization via renewable energy is an unstoppable runaway train. Meanwhile, decentralization — via connecting and leveraging low-carbon DERs at scale — is gaining major momentum due to growing investment by customers, and in part regulatory tailwinds from FERC Order 2222 and similar regulations. But despite their rapid growth, DERs too often remain islands unto themselves — myriad isolated outposts connected to the edges of the electricity grid, collecting data in siloed, private databases.</p><p>Before we can make use of that data to optimize DERs for local or system benefits, the grid needs a narrow waist protocol through which DERs can seamlessly and securely establish identity and share data amongst all stakeholders.</p><p>Grid operators from the U.S. and EU can and should look at what’s happening in the Southern Hemisphere with Project EDGE: DIDs anchored to public digital infrastructure provide the necessary on-ramp for DERs to be the integral grid-connected assets evangelists have been saying they are. What we’re building may be driven by the requirements of the NEM, but the open-source EW-DOS stack is directly relevant to any market looking for ways to better tap into DERs. If you’re a grid operator facing similar challenges or opportunities — however you want to look at it — come join&nbsp;us.</p><p><a href="http://energyweb.org">www.energyweb.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/canary-in-the-sunshine-australia-is-showing-the-rest-of-the-world-what-a-modern-grid-looks-like-ce95832cc017">Canary in the Sunshine: Australia is showing the rest of the world what a modern grid looks like</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Please peruse it, particularly the sections about your personal research focus and/or your company's specialty and products, opening issues, or PRs on GitHub wherever you feel a correction or addition is needed.  This is intended as a community resource, so PRs are open to your input, and feel free to share the document or subsections on the broader community!</p>
 H&amp;T group is looking for more technical engagement 
<p>Work on Decentralized Identities continues apace at H&amp;T. There are a number of item-based weekly calls discussing the details of various theoretical models, real-life challenges, and applied use-case scenarios for the sector. Anyone with interest is invited to join their calls and tackle the technical challenges ahead together.

 Both specs are ready to start implementing and being improved based on implementation feedback. 
 In OIDC4VP, progress has been made on using Presentation Exchange in the request-response syntax, for example, agreeing to include presentation_submission inside the signed ID token even when VP is being sent back separately as a VP Token. 
 In SIOP v2, some relevant discussions worth highlighting are how to use DIDs as Relying Party's (RP) client_id to resolve it and obtain RP's registration metadata; using universal links and trust frameworks to invoke SIOP instead of using custom URL schema.

<p>Submitted by SecureKeys' <a href="https://medium.com/@baha.abushaaban">Baha Shaaban</a>, edited by <a href="https://medium.com/@chris.lp">DIF's Chris Kelly</a>.<br></p><p>In short, ECDH-1PU is a key derivation process that allows for sender authenticity and enables a “<a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/11/what-is-perfect-forward-secrecy/#:~:text=Perfect%20forward%20secrecy%20means%20that,of%20the%20user's%20sensitive%20data.">Perfect Forward Secrecy</a>” mechanism, in addition to significant performance gains over JWS message nested in a JWE envelope, as used by existign ECDH-ES aproaches. This article walks through how ECDH-ES works step by step, showing how it achieves sender identity authentication using nested messages (JWS in JWE), and finally showing how ECDH-1PU is a better choice for authenticating the sender. This helps maintain the use of a single JWE message (without JWS) to meet the need for constrained agents (such as IOT devices) by reducing their communication footprint.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mathyaskurmann?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Mathyas Kurmann</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/post?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman">Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman</a> (ECDH) is a protocol that allows two parties to establish a secure and private channel over an insecure and observed network, and forms the basis for the secure encryption on many popular messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Signal and Skype… as well as DIDComm V1, which is being superseded by a more broadly interoperable V2. So-called “Diffie-Hellman” key exchanges ensure that messages sent over the channel they create can only be correctly interpreted by the sender and intended recipient, regardless of eavesdropping or security breaches on the communications channel.</p><p>As described in the<a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#message-encryption"> Message Encryption</a> section of the DIDComm v2 specification, the DIDComm protocol for transmitting Decentralized IDentifiers (DIDs) requires protecting a message using either Anonymous Encryption (aka `Anoncrypt`) or Sender Authenticated Encryption (aka `Authcrypt`). Either of these methods take different inputs and create a secure channel between two or more parties.</p><p>In the “AnonCrypt” handshake, there is no pre-existing “sender key” involved and it is intended for only the recipients of the message. This mechanism requires encryption with a Content Encryption Key (a “cek”) being wrapped with a key agreement mechanism using `ECDH-ES` for each recipient. DIDComm uses this “key-wrapping mode” with<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4.6"> ECDH-ES</a> to ensure only the intended recipients can decrypt the final message. The benefit of using `ECDH-ES` is that it's widely used and available in many crypto libraries for most modern languages. Building JWE envelopes using this type of encryption should be relatively easy using existing JOSE libraries in your preferred language.</p><p>“AuthCrypt'', however, requires a pre-existing (and published/discoverable) sender key to encrypt the message for the sender, and against which the sender can be authenticated. This encryption mechanism uses the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04"> ECDH-1PU</a> specification from IETF, the main topic of this article. As a growing number of independent implementations get announced, 1PU advances on the Standards Track at IETF and achieves maturity as a specification; for this reason, we are offering this educational resource so that understanding of its mechanisms can grow as well.</p> The all-important “Z” in ECDH-ES, first step in understanding ECDH-1PU <p>To understand how ECDH-1PU is significant, knowledge about the internals of ECDH-ES is required. ECDH-ES key agreement requires the sender to execute the following steps for each recipient to derive the key used to wrap the `cek`:</p><p>1. Generate an<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4.6.1.1"> ephemeral key</a> (aka `epk`).</p><p>2. Build `apu`, the producer (sender) identity. For Anoncrypt, this will represent the X value of `epk`, base64URL-encoded.</p><p>3. Build `apv`, the receiver (recipient) identity. It can optionally contain the recipient `kid`, base64URL-encoded.</p><p>4. Compute `Z`: the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4.6.2"> key derivation</a> process output of ECDH for each recipient using the above values with the **private** `epk` key and the recipient’s **public** key on the sender side. An example is found in<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#appendix-C"> appendix C</a> of the IETF RFC7518. On their end, the recipient will get the **public** `epk` and therefore does the same computation with their own **private** key.</p><p>5. Finally, the computed derived key is used to wrap the `cek`, the symmetric key used to encrypt/decrypt the payload content (the `ciphertext` section) of the JWE envelope .</p><p>So, to be clear, ECDH-ES takes as mandatory inputs an ephemeral key generated by the sender and the recipient's public key (a static long-lived key) to compute the key derivation `Z`; for this reason, the ES notation means Ephemeral-Static in ECDH-ES. This derivation fits neatly the requirement to protect messages for recipients without revealing the sender's identity (ie: no static sender key is used in the key derivation process when the recipient derives `Z`).</p> Key derivation beyond ECDH-ES to enable AuthCrypt <p>In the previous section, key derivation using an ephemeral key does not reveal who sent the message. This is useful for messages requiring anonymity of the author, e.g. a router agent receiving a message does not need to authenticate the sender in any way; its only purpose is to route the message to an end recipient. For this router agent, passing along Anoncrypt messages is acceptable.</p><p>In most cases, an end recipient requires authenticating the original sender. This means recipients will need to hold the sender's public key prior to receiving their messages in order to authenticate them. Since ECDH-ES does not involve the sender key, the only way to authenticate a sender is to nest a JWS in a JWE message which is “heavier” &nbsp;than a plain JWE-only message, i.e., more complex (i.e. expensive) to process and route.</p><p>Another, newer, option would be to use a new key derivation process that involves the sender's key.<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04"> ECDH-1PU</a> was introduced for this specific purpose; it uses the sender's static key in the key derivation process. The following section is dedicated to this process.</p> The Advantages of using ECDH-1PU (adapted from the DIDComm v2<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04#section-1"> Introduction</a>) <p></p><p>The advantages of public key authenticated encryption with ECDH-1PU<br>compared to using nested, signed-then-encrypted documents include:</p><p>Size and Efficiency</p><p>The resulting message size is more compact, as an additional layer of headers and base64url-encoding is avoided. &nbsp;A 500-byte payload when encrypted and authenticated with ECDH-1PU (with P-256 keys and "A256GCM" Content Encryption Method) results in a 1087-byte JWE in Compact Encoding. &nbsp;An equivalent, nested-then-signed-then-encrypted JOSE message using the same keys and encryption method is 1489 bytes (37% larger).</p><p>In both cases, though, the same cryptographics primitives achieve the same levels of confidentiality and authenticity, so these savings in code size, so crucial for constrained environments, come at no cost to privacy and security outcomes.</p><p>Increased Security</p><p>The generic composition of signatures and public key encryption involves a number of subtle details that are essential to security (namely, to the traits of Public Key Authenticated Encryption or<a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/12/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-iii/"> PKAE</a>). Providing a dedicated algorithm for public key authenticated encryption reduces complexity for users of JOSE libraries, which lowers the incidence of human error and design flaws with cybersecurity implications.</p><p>Flexibility</p><p>ECDH-1PU provides only authenticity and not the stronger security properties of non-repudiation or third-party verifiability. This can be an advantage in applications where privacy, anonymity, or plausible deniability are goals.</p> ECDH-1PU for sender authentication <p>Similar to ECDH-ES, the 1PU process executes key derivation to compute a Z but has 2 computations rather than 1, with the final result being formed by concatenating both as described here (Adapted from the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04#section-2.3"> Key Derivation</a> section of RFC7518):</p><p>1. The first is called `Ze`, which is the exact same key derivation as ECDH-ES using a private encryption provider key (`epk`) and the public recipient key on the sender side. (The recipient side will involve the public `epk` and the private recipient key).</p><p>2. The second is called `Zs`; in this second computation, we use the sender's static (long-lived) key instead of `epk`. So on the sender side we derive `Zs` by using the sender's private key and the recipient's public key. (The recipient side will use the sender's public key and the recipient's private key on their end).</p><p>The final `Z` is the concatenation of `Ze` and `Zs` which is then used in the key-wrapping, analogously to ECDH-ES.</p><p>There are special considerations in the process to protect against sender impersonation as described in Section<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04#section-2.1"> 2.1</a> of the draft:</p>  In Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode, the JWE Authentication Tag is included in the input to the Key Derivation Function as described in section Section 2.3. &nbsp;This ensures that the content of the JWE was produced by the original sender and not by another recipient, as described in the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4"> Key Management Algorithms Section</a> of the RFC.  Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode MUST only be used with content encryption algorithms that are compactly committing AEADs as described in the Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2-05"> specification</a>.  The AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 algorithms described in<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-5.2"> section 5.2</a> of RFC7518 are compactly committing and can be used with ECDH-1PU in Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode. Other content encryption algorithms MUST be rejected.  In Direct Key Agreement mode, any JWE content encryption algorithm MAY be used. This mode is NOT supported in DIDComm V2.  <p>The requirement to include the JWE Authentication Tag in the input to the Key Derivation Function implies an adjustment to the order of operations performed during JWE Message Encryption described in section 5.1 of [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516">RFC7516</a>]. &nbsp;Steps 3-8 are deferred until after step15, using the randomly generated CEK from step 2 for encryption of the message content.</p><p>To sum up, these considerations require:</p><p>1. The use of the `AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA` family of content encryption algorithms to encrypt the payload. Currently, JWE supports the following three algorithms in this family:</p><p>1.

This article walked through the implementation of ECDH-ES, showing how it achieves sender identity authentication using nested messages (JWS in JWE), and finally showing how ECDH-1PU is a better choice for authenticating the sender. This helps maintain the use of a single JWE message (without JWS) to meet the need for constrained agents (such as IOT devices) by reducing their communication footprint, as well as making it suitable where anonymity and privacy are of particular concern.<br></p><p>To find out more about joining the DIDComm Working Group at DIF, visit their page<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html"> here</a>, or follow their work on GitHub<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging"> here</a>.<br><br><br><br></p>

 California grid operator launches new demand flexibility platform enhancements to Flex Alert system, leveraging Energy Web technology <p>As climate change causes more extreme weather events, electric grid operators face greater challenges to maintaining system reliability. The U.S. has seen examples this year from a variety of immediate causes: February’s <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/14/texas-power-grid-conserve-ercot/">grid failure in Texas</a> from extreme cold, this summer’s grid challenges in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/new-york-heat-wave-nears-its-sweaty-peak-as-northwest-highs-ease?sref=vuYGislZ">New York City from extreme heat</a>, and reduced transmission capacity and power supply due to wildfires in the&nbsp;West.</p><p>These challenges show no signs of abating, and therefore grid operators need to pursue a variety of strategies to ensure the grid operates reliably in times of extreme stress. One of the tools that grid operators use is load flexibility: rather than treating electricity demand as fixed at any given time and adjusting supply to meet it, grid operators increasingly try to adjust demand as well. Demand flexibility takes various forms, ranging from <a href="https://rmi.org/the-california-blackout-that-wasnt/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=spark&amp;utm_content=spark&amp;utm_campaign=2021_07_01">utility demand response programs</a> to <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/california-governor-makes-emergency-bid-to-prevent-blackouts/">calls for the public to voluntarily conserve</a> in times of, especially, high&nbsp;demand.</p> Limitations of legacy demand flexibility systems <p>Among the programs in the latter category is one managed by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), which is responsible for managing the transmission grid across much of California and a small part of Nevada. That program, called <a href="https://flexalert.org/">Flex Alerts</a>, historically has worked as&nbsp;follows.</p>  If CAISO foresees that, because of the weather forecast, supply and transmission conditions, and expected demand, demand will be critically high relative to supply in the coming days, it calls a Flex&nbsp;Alert.  Calling a Flex Alert simply means that CAISO communicates a call to conserve electricity during specific critical hours. That communication takes several forms, including an email to Flex Alert subscribers and posts to social&nbsp;media.  The message is a request for consumers to voluntarily conserve during the specific hours. Consumers then conserve if, and as much as, they wish: CAISO has no ability to adjust consumers’ thermostat settings or take any other steps to force anyone to conserve.  <p>One limitation of this system has been that CAISO has had no visibility into how many consumers might try to conserve electricity. That is to say, when CAISO calls a Flex Alert, is the public paying attention? Will people try to save energy? The only way to measure the effect of the program has been afterward to compare the demand that CAISO would have expected if not for the Flex Alert to the demand that the system actually&nbsp;saw.</p> Advantages of California’s new Flex Alert&nbsp;system <p>CAISO now has deployed an improved Flex Alert platform based on Energy Web’s open-source technology stack. The new system has several advantages:</p>  Consumers can subscribe to receive either emails or SMS messages whenever CAISO calls a Flex Alert. Open and response rates are much higher for SMS messages than for emails, and therefore people who choose to subscribe to receive SMS messages on their phones are more likely to see a Flex Alert in time to conserve. Enrollment in either or both subscription options is simple for consumers.  Non-subscribers (e.g., people who see a Flex Alert message on social media) and subscribers can respond to the Flex Alert message, so CAISO has some insight into how much demand flexibility it might expect. This insight can become more accurate over time, as past response numbers can be correlated with observed demand reduction.  Subscribers have the option to provide the postal (ZIP) code where they live and see how response rates for their area compare to those for other areas. It also gives CAISO some insight into, in the aggregate, where conservation efforts are greatest.  Because the platform is designed with Energy Web’s approach to self-sovereign identity, CAISO cannot link personal data — email address or mobile number, or postal code — to response history. CAISO can view aggregated data about, for example, how many subscribers in a particular county responded to the most recent Flex Alert. However, CAISO has no ability to connect individual responses with personal information. This means that consumers can be more confident that when they participate (i.e., subscribe or respond to a Flex Alert) they are not creating a data trail for malign actors to&nbsp;mine.   Opportunities to expand demand flexibility anywhere <p>Our identity approach and the data protection it provides also are extensible to potential future&nbsp;uses.</p><p>First, digital identities can be assigned to IoT devices (assets) and integrated into the platform, if it were desirable to integrate other types of demand flexibility programs. This could allow, for example, secure communication directly with smart thermostats, which could then pre-cool automatically (or after the owner’s approval) and then conserve during critical hours. Likewise, electric vehicle charging could be shifted to non-critical hours, so long as charge levels are reached before the vehicle is&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Second, because the platform can be operated without anyone organization owning the data or excluding others from it, it enables other power sector stakeholders (regulators, local utilities, or others) to participate as well. For example, if a local utility wished to collaborate with CAISO and use the platform to know which customers and devices were participating in a demand response program, it could do that while keeping access to sensitive customer data limited to the appropriate parties.</p><p>Furthermore, this platform could facilitate compensation of consumers for the flexibility provided. This would depend on the relevant stakeholders (transmission grid operator, local utility, regulator) all being supportive, but the point is that the technology enables greater levels of reliable, measurable flexibility — all while ensuring appropriate privacy and data ownership — and is independent of whatever market or program design is applied by those stakeholders.</p><p>Finally, because the technology is open-source, it could be implemented by other grid operators, with or without Energy Web’s engagement. We see other places in the U.S. alone where the power sector might wish to enhance existing practices, like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/new-york-heat-wave-nears-its-sweaty-peak-as-northwest-highs-ease?sref=vuYGislZ">New York</a> or <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/14/texas-power-grid-conserve-ercot/">Texas</a>. But of course, the technology is not limited to the U.S. and could be useful anywhere that the ability to increase demand flexibility while maintaining privacy is desirable.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/california-grid-operator-launches-new-demand-flexibility-platform-enhancements-to-flex-alert-system-e01ae8030da0">California grid operator launches new demand flexibility platform enhancements to Flex Alert…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, Var Group entered the capital of commercio.network, one of the most innovative European blockchains. In fact, commercio.network is focused not on cryptocurrencies but rather on three crucial topics of digital transformation for companies:</p>
 
 E-identity. Identity management respecting privacy 
 E-signature The management of advanced electronic signatures 
 E-delivery Certified delivery of documents and proof of their existence 
 
<p>Var group, through its BlockIT company, became one of 100 independent validator nodes on July 4, 2020. The commercio.network blockchain &nbsp;instead of using electricity to validate its network, &nbsp;uses a new consensus algorithm called POS. This consensus mechanism consumes in a year what Bitcoin consumes in a minute, making it the most sustainable blockchain in the world and consequently the cheapest in the world as each transaction costs only a euro cent plus VAT</p>
<p>From July 4, 2021 Commerc.io srl offers the opportunity to all independent developers to use its commerce.app platform to create applications. commerce.app allows to solve the problem of wallet security through a fully-hosted platform based on HSM devices and programmable via API.</p>
<p>For developers participating in Var Group’s hackathon, commercio.io has provided two free online seminars consisting of 10 one-minute videos that explain respectively:</p>
<p>How to do business with blockchain :(in italian only) &nbsp;in which it is finally explained the substantial difference between blockchain and Internet and 36 use cases of applications to be developed related to 36 big problems that can be solved only through the blockchain of Commerce network. The video is available at the link <a href="https://commerc.io/farebusiness">https://commerc.io/farebusiness &nbsp; </a>Using the invitation code: VarGroup</p>
<p>How to make apps with blockchain:&nbsp; (in italian only) &nbsp;a seminar explaining how to use the Commerce.app , a managed wallet platform that provides a set of APIs to develop any application on Commerce.network. This platform allows developers to save 99% of time and cost to create any application after a few minutes and not months.

				 <p>I am proud to say our Board now spans 4 continents after Dixon joins us. This is a testimony to human-centric data infrastructure being on track to become a global standard.</p>
<p>As the Data Strategy and the Data Spaces are being put in place in Europe, as the new US Administration is questioning the operating practices of global platforms, as new digital public and private services are created the world over, it is critical our approach over Personal Data Sharing is truly Global, and brings elements which are not just influenced by the framework of the European Data Strategy we help shape, but is the mirror of the actual needs of individuals, tech-savvy or not, and the realities of a very competitive market. This is why we are thankful Dixon has agreed to join us, bringing his experience of Chief Evangelist of Personium which is the only open-source personal data store platform in Japan.</p>
<p>In parallel to his role at Personium, Dixon is a software engineer at Fujitsu Limited. Currently, he is also leading the MyData movement within Fujitsu.</p>
<p>After attending MyData 2018, he was moved by the passionate people involved and is now heavily involved in the overall MyData movement in Europe, Asia, and Global South. He also drives human-centric projects in areas like data interoperability, child data protection with UNESCO, and common data platform for the next pandemic.</p>
<p>Given his breadth of experience and alignment with a number of strategic sectors where aNewGovernance is currently developing ecosystems, I am sure, he will bring incredible contribution.</p>

				 <p>A Decentralized Key Management Infrastructure (DKMI) is essential to any SSI&nbsp;implementation. DKMI is the cryptographic infrastructure upon which the necessary&nbsp;authentication keys are exchanged between SSI actors. In 2020, a new type of ultra-secure,&nbsp;ledger agnostic DKMI made its way through the SSI community: Key Event Receipt&nbsp;Infrastructure (KERI). Currently being developed by DIF (the Decentralized Identity<br>Foundation) KERI is making its first appearance in real world applications as the first&nbsp;truly &amp; fully decentralized identity system.</p>
<p>With KERI Ecosystem components developers of SSI solutions will be able to:</p>
 
 move between networks and ledgers with your identifiers (can work with blockchain and non-blockchained networks) 
 delegate identifier to another identity (no matter on which network or system it was created) 
 provide key provenance log for production ready Verifiable Credential management 
 recovery from key lost through pre-rotation event 
 use your identifiers at scale 
 resolve any identifier through Distributed Hash Table algorithms without relying on centralize resolver or network. 
 operate with any type of Verifiable Credentials across network

				 <p>DOOR empowers participating entities in the ESSIF-Framework to establish trust by providing strong verifiable evidence and assurances on the origin and integrity of the presented verifiable credentials. DOOR achieves this goal by building a trusted layer between interacting parties that is based on strong cryptographic privacy-preserving tools. In this way, DOOR can enable the handling of VCs requiring higher level of assurances locally at the holder’s wallet.</p>
<p>We achieve the above goal by providing a new component on the Holder side that enables the use of hardware-based keys and offers the possibility to bind Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to the wallet of the holder. In this way, we transfer the root of trust of the SSI ecosystem purely on the digital wallet by considering an underlying Trusted Component as part of the wallet, without making any assumptions on the trustworthiness of the other layers.</p>
<p>Innovators can build on our extension to integrate hardware-based keys and bring trust to the holder’s wallets, thus, enabling the vision of a decentralized data protected approach for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Since the DOOR component is agnostic to the implementation of the wallet and the type of the VC Data Model considered (e.g. W3C or Indy), multiple SSI ecosystems can interoperate in a trustworthy manner. Overall, innovators can use our component to create a hardware-based trust anchor and build services that offer a high level of assurance.</p>

				 <p>The Aries Mobile SDK is a complete toolkit for cross-platform iOS and Android development using React Native. With this one SDK, developers can build mobile SSI solutions for any use case. The SDK contains reusable issuer, holder and verifier components as well as essential components for mobile development (e.g. deeplinking, state management, biometric wallet unlocking). Developers can either start from scratch or integrate a selection of components into their existing mobile app. The Aries Mobile SDK is credential format and DID method agnostic, it uses the latest open standards to break out of the Indy &amp; Aries ecosystem (e.g. W3C VCs, DIF PE, BBS+ Signatures).<br>The Aries Mobile SDK is 100% open-source, focuses on interoperability and open standards and is accessible for developers of any skill level. It aims to drastically lower the barrier of mobile SSI development.</p>
<p>The Aries Mobile SDK is built on top of Aries Framework JavaScript. Modules combine all recurring flows into high-level methods, allowing to e.g. create a connection and issue a revocable credential in a few lines of code.<br>The SDK uses DIDComm for secure and encrypted communication between agents. Aries protocols (AIP2.0) are used for creating connections and exchanging credentials (Indy, JSON-LD) and presentations (Indy, DIF PE). BBS+ signatures are used for W3C compliant privacy preserving VCs. Aries Askar provides encrypted storage as well as cryptographic methods used for encrypting DIDComm messages (V2 ready) and signing credentials (e.g. ed25519, bbs, p256, secp256k1). Interoperable mediation standards allow any agent to be used as a cloud-based connection point for mobile devices (e.g. ACA-Py, AF-GO). New React Native Codegen and Turbomodules are utilized to write a cross-platform wrapper around native rust libraries (Aries Askar, Indy Credx, Indy VDR) (design).</p>

<p>This summer, we’ve been iterating through an article intended to talk
about the success that Blockchain Commons has had working with the Wyoming
legislature to help to define a first-in-the-country legal definition
of digital identity.</p>

<p>The Digital Identity Working Group for the Wyoming Select Committee on
Blockchain meets again next week, on September 21-22, 2021. I will be
providing testimony there at 2pm MST. As a result, we’ve decided to
release the current draft of this article on digital identity and how
Wyoming has defined it using Principal Authority, with the goal of
helping to shape the agenda for digital identity for the next year,
both in Wyoming and elsewhere.</p>

<p>—Christopher Allen</p>

 

<p>In 2016, I wrote <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">“The Path to Self-Sovereign
Identity”</a>
to talk about the historic evolution from centralized identity to
user-centric identity and to define the next step: a self-sovereign
digital identity that was controlled by the user, not some third party.
In it I also offered <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md">10 Self-Sovereign Identity
Principles</a>
which have been widely accepted by the decentralized identity community.</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity has matured and grown considerably since, as I
chronicled in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">“Self-Sovereign Identity: Five Years
On”</a>.
There are now specifications, products, and entire companies supporting
the concept. However, recent legal efforts to define self-sovereign
identity may be just as important for catapulting it into the mass
market.</p>

 Defining Identity

paper much longer than this. The following are some various definitions
of identity drawn from the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/glossary-primer.md">RWOT
Glossary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Identifier: A label that refers to an entity and can be used to establish or maintain an identity. For example, a name or UID.</p>

  <p>Identity: A conceptual construct that enables the differentiation between distinct entities that are individually considered to be unique, but which may possess class or group characteristics. An identity gives these entities the ability to interact as peers in collaborative or competitive ways. It is not the entity that it represents.</p>

  <p>Identity, Digital: A digital representation of an entity, managed by digital tools, over which that entity has personal or delegated control.</p>

  <p>Identity, Functional: How we recognize, remember and respond to specific people and things.</p>

  <p>SSI: Self-sovereign identity. A decentralized digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority and whose information is portable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Digital identity is just one aspect of a complex, interconnected web of
different digital models. It’s not the same thing as identification
(where you prove you are a distinct entity with unique characteristics),
authentication (where you prove you were the same entity as before), or
personal data (which is information related to an identified or
identifiable entity).</p>

<p>Those other elements all need to be considered, but it’s digital
identity, and now self-sovereign identity, that gives us the linchpin to
do so.</p>

 Turning Digital Identity into Law 

<p>For self-sovereign identity to truly achieve international success, I
feel that it needs to not just be embraced by the technological sector,
but also to have a basis in law. In recent years, I’ve been progressing
toward that goal through work with various state and national
legislatures.</p>

<p>Collaborating with the Wyoming legislature has borne the first fruit.
This year they passed
<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">SF0039</a> on digital
identity, which the Governor signed into law and which went into effect
on July 1, 2021. It defines digital identity as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(xviii) “Personal digital identity” means the intangible digital
representation of, by and for a natural person, over which he has
principal authority and through which he intentionally communicates or
acts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So where’s the self-sovereign identity in that?</p>

<p>As with much legislation, it’s all about the careful selection of words.</p>

 Defining Principal Authority 

<p>To understand how Principal Authority relates to self-sovereign identity
requires insight into what Principal Authority is. The concept comes out
of English Common law. It appears in most Commonwealth countries but has
also found its way into the laws of other countries, including the
United States. It’s primarily used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency">Laws of
Agency</a>, an area of
commercial law where an agent is empowered to take on certain tasks.</p>

<p>As the name would suggest, Principal Authority first requires a
Principal: a person or entity. It then requires that entity have
Authority: some power. Principal Authority is thus the power derived
from a person or entity, which they can use or which they can delegate
out to others. When applied to digital identity, Principal Authority
says that a Principal has Authority over his identity — which is a clear
restatement of self-sovereign principles.</p>

<p>In fact, the recognition of a Principal is itself a statement of the
first of the principles of self-sovereign identity: existence. It
asserts that digital identity is always a representation of an actual
entity, who predates any digital representation, and who is also the
first and foremost beneficiary of that representation.</p>

<p>However, in drawing on the Laws of Agency, the concepts of Principal and
Principal Authority go beyond that. Because the person at the heart of
an identity has the ultimate power to control the self-sovereign digital
representation that they’ve created (and/or that they use), this means
that any others who exert Principal Authority over that identity data
are doing so only as agents of the Principal.</p>

<p>By focusing on Agency, the concept of Principal Authority also ensures
that the Principal always has the ability to revoke their delegation to
the agents whom they have temporarily offered Authority regarding their
identity. This is a requirement for other self-sovereign principles such
as portability, and it’s a real necessity in the digital world, where
we might need to delete personal data or to cancel Terms &amp; Conditions
that we signed without real, informed consent.</p>

<p>Altogether, this new definition of Principal Authority adds a lot of
nuance to self-sovereign identity, and much of that comes thanks to the
implicit incorporation of Agency.</p>

 Defining Control 

<p>In saying that a Principal has the ultimate authority to control their
digital identity, care also needs to be taken to define what that
control means. It means that a Principal has (or can delegate) the
Principal Authority to identify as that identity; to authenticate as
that identity; and to know the contents of the data held by that
identity.</p>

<p>However, any digital identity also exists as part of a larger ecosystem,
and the Principal does not have control over the larger ecosystem. They
cannot control how other entities rate, rank, or note the reputation
of their identity; and they cannot control comments, flags, or other
notes that other entities might attach to their identity.</p>

<p>Further, a Principal cannot necessarily prevent other entities from
creating new digital identities related to them, which may or may not
link to an existing identity. (Though states are increasingly
recognizing the limits of voluntary disclosure of information, digital
identity laws will ultimately never prevent a police station from
creating their own identity record related to a criminal, or a civic
authority from creating government-related identity records.)</p>

<p>In other words, self-sovereign identity, and the establishment of
Principal Authority over it, lays down boundaries for what the Principal
controls — boundaries that are much wider than those established for
digital identities controlled by third parties. However, those
boundaries still exist.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, control of a digital identity means that the Principal
can expect to maintain the continuity of that identity for as long as
they see fit, but in doing so must accept the battle scars inflicted by
interactions in a larger ecosystem that are implicit to the identity
itself.</p>

 Agents &amp; Their Duty 

<p>The ability to delegate Principal Authority, as revealed by the Laws of
Agency, may be as crucial to self-sovereign identity as the concept of a
Principal itself. It allows the empowerment of agents by a Principal —
who might be physical agents or, in the increasingly digital world,
virtual agents. But, it also institutes the core requirement that those
agents be working for the good of the Principal when they are exerting
Principal Authority over the identity holder’s identity data.</p>

<p>This concept of “duty” is crucial to the Laws of Agency. Duty requires
that an Agent only use their delegated Principal Authority as the
Principal requests, in a way that benefits the Principal, and with care
and due diligence, while frequently reporting back what they’ve done.</p>

<p>This is a notable change from the way that digital identities have been
treated traditionally. Compare that to banks, who represent you in
financial transactions, and then sell your spending data; compare that
to Facebook, who collects as much personally identifiable data and other
information as you’re willing to give them, then sells that to
advertisers; or compare it to Google, who infers personally identifiable
and demographic data based on the information you input into their tools
and the choices you make. In large part, you don’t even know what these
identity representatives and data holders are doing. In the world before
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">Europe’s GDPR</a> or <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California’s
CCPA</a>, you had little input into their
actions. Even now, with those early and rough attempts to protect
digital self-sovereignty, you’re typically opting-out, not opting-in —
which is barely agency at all —&nbsp;and you’re still not protected against
people who are self-serving nor those who are inferring information from
scattered pieces of data.</p>

<p>That’s because any duties currently required of the entities to whom you
grant agency over your data are quite minimal. Maybe there’s a duty of
privacy, maybe there’s a duty of safety, but in general they don’t need
to work in your best interest. That’s why we need to ensure that new
definitions of digital identity, particularly self-sovereign identity,
follow the Laws of Agency in ways that our current systems do not.</p>

<p>This sort of agent agreement needs to be part of delegation. To date,
this has been true to a limited extent with federation protocols such as
SAML and Oauth, but that needs to be extended to every person. Wyoming’s
digital-identity law is the first example of legislation that focuses on
Agency in this way, and that’s much of its power.</p>

<p>However, this isn’t a simple issue. Even with Agency-focused
legislation, we need to determine a source for duties. This article will
try to outline some of them, using not just the traditional duties of
agents, but also the self-sovereign principles themselves. However, it’s
a mere starting point, with a stronger legal foundation required.</p>

 Principal Authority &amp; The State 

<p>Before defining duties, it’s important to note one other interesting
element of Principal Authority and its foundation in Agency: it focuses
not just on a single person’s authority, but also on their ability to
delegate to and require duties from other entities. In other words, it’s
a peer-to-peer relationship; this relationship works within the context
of a state who recognizes the concept of Principal Authority, respects
its ability to enable Agency, and enforces its established duties.</p>

<p>However, though the state is involved, this peer-to-peer relationship
still lies in stark contrast to traditional property law, where property
is always in some way beholden to the state: the state might be the
original source for property, they might be able to reclaim it by
eminent domain, and they might be able to seize it through asset
forfeiture. Those ideas all run counter to the idea of self-sovereignty
— which is yet another reason that we choose to focus on the Agency of
Principal Authority, not property law, as the core legal metaphor for
self-sovereign identity.</p>

 Restating the Self-Sovereign Principles 

<p>The use of Principal Authority to empower self-sovereign identity
provides a legal foothold for many of my original 10 principles.</p>

<p>What follows is a restatement of the self-sovereign principles that
reorganizes the original ten as rights and duties that are suggested by
customs, expectations, and best practices, but which need to be better
codified to become true duties. It also proposes five additional duties
that could come from customs implicit in the Laws of Agency.</p>

<p>Together, these ideas may allow us to both better understand how to turn
the self-sovereign principles into concrete usage and also to more
easily translate them into duties bound by legislation.</p>

 The Rights of Self-Sovereign Authority 

<p>Some principles of self-sovereign identity are implicit in the idea of
a Principal.</p>

 
   Existence. The definition of Principal requires that there be a real entity at an identity’s heart. 
   Control. The definition of Principal Authority says that the Principal always retains control of an identity, within specifically defined boundaries, no matter who is holding it at a particular time. 
   Persistence. Because of their uncontested Principal Authority, a Principal may decide to have an identity last for as long as they see fit. 
   Consent. Anything that happens within the defined boundaries of the digital identity is implicitly with the consent of the Principal, who may delegate or revoke Principal Authority at any time. 
 

<p>Self-sovereign rights recognize that an identity exists to benefit its
Principal. These core principles likely derive explicitly from a
definition of digital identity such as that created by the Wyoming
legislature.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Identity 

<p>The remaining principles of self-sovereign identity can be stated as
duties owed to a Principal by an agent who has been granted Principal
Authority over an identity for certain purposes.</p>

 
   Access. An agent must provide the Principal with access to data related to their digital identity. 
   Transparency. An agent must be open about how they will administer a digital identity. 
   Portability. An agent must make a digital identity portable upon the request of the Principal. 
   Interoperability. An agent must use standard, interoperable protocols when making an identity portable, and should also use those interoperable protocols when interacting with other identity systems. 
   Minimization. An agent must minimize the data collected, stored, transmitted, and shared regarding an identity so that it only includes data that is strictly necessary in the context of a request made by the Principal. 
   Protection. An agent must place the protection of the identity above their own needs or desires. 
 

<p>Identity duties says that agents will tell you how they’re using your
identity, use it in the most minimalist way possible, and make it easy
for you to reclaim the identity. However, legislation may be required to
turn these best practices into duties bound by law.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Agents 

<p>The idea of Principal Authority itself suggests additional duties that
were not included on the original list of principles of self-sovereign
identity, but which are generally defined in the Laws of Agency to be
due from agents to Principals.</p>

 
   Specificity. An Agent will use Principal Authority to serve specific tasks as instructed by the Principal, or as required by Custom, and do nothing more with an identity. 
   Responsibility. An agent will serve those tasks with reasonable care and skill, with due diligence, and without further delegation. 
   Representation. An agent will act in the best interests of the Principal, without secret profit, and will not take on other responsibilities that might conflict with that. 
   Fidelity. An agent will serve those tasks in good faith. 
   Disclosure. An agent will maintain accounts and report their actions back to the Principal. 
 

<p>Agent duties say that agents will be trustworthy in their use of your
identity. These duties are more likely to implicitly be a part of any
legislation that was built atop the Laws of Agency.</p>

 Taking the Next Steps 

<p>Wyoming’s definition of personal digital identity helps us to lay more
foundation for self-sovereign identity, but it’s still just a starting
point.</p>

<p>There’s more to do.</p>

 Laws of Custom 

<p>To start with, the Laws of Agency are largely built on Laws of Custom,
which are as likely to be common law as any formally codified
legislation. When creating new laws related to self-sovereign identity,
we’ll be creating new Laws of Customs for the digital frontier, an area
that’s so fresh that the tradition of customs has been limited.</p>

<p>This creates real challenges, as we must decide what customs we want to
create and then we must develop them from common law to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_law">legal
customs</a> to (eventually)
codified duties. We can integrate these with the Laws of Agency, and we
can figure out how that interrelates with old common laws such as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_(law)">Use Laws</a>. We may even need
special courts to set these common laws and achieve remedies, such as
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Chancery">Court of
Chancery</a>.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, there’s a lot of work to be done here; recognizing the
existence of a Principal and the use of delegatable Principal Authority
bound by the Laws of Agency is just a starting place. New customs, even
though understood as best practices, will not automatically become legal
duties.</p>

 Open Questions 

<p>Beyond that, I’m not a lawyer. There may be other legal elements that
can support our definition of digital identity. Are there additional
duties that we could bring in? Are there fiduciary or agency laws that
we could leverage? Are there other legal models of interest we can draw
from, such as the UNCITRAL Model Law of Electronic Commerce approach,
which says that “The actions, promises, rights and obligations of a
person shall not be denied legal validity on the sole ground they are
effectuated through their digital identity”? These possibilities need to
be studied, preferably with the help of legal experts.</p>

<p>Even once we’ve fully defined digital identity, we still must consider
how digital identity may need to be more carefully protected. Are there
ways we can give specific protection to private keys used for signatures
and to express authority? Can we protect against the theft of private
keys that might allow impersonation or false witness? Can we prevent the
misuse of digital biometric or genetic information? Can we protect
against other “crimes of authority”?</p>

<p>There’s also a flipside: digital identity should give us some new
advantages not found in traditional identity. For example, there have
always been problems with individuals with low market power being at a
disadvantage when negotiating with larger parties. Can new digital
identity laws help start to resolve that imbalance?</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>One of the most important steps going forward will be to continue
working with the Digital Identity subcommittee in the Wyoming
legislature. However, I’d also welcome discussions with other states and
nations, to ensure that we have great definitions of digital identity
that support self-sovereign identity everywhere.</p>

<p>If this is important to you too, consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">supporting Blockchain
Commons</a> to make this a
reality.</p>

<p>The HOPR protocol is a layer-0 privacy foundation for the new generation of decentralized applications. The incentivized HOPR mixnet lets any application send data without leaking data or metadata. HOPR nodes will rely on Ceramic to track node payments without sacrificing user privacy. <br><br>Interested in learning more about the privacy protocol? Visit <a href="https://hoprnet.org/">HOPRnet.org</a> to run a node yourself.</p> Encryption is not enough for privacy  <p>Standard end-to-end encryption does not provide sufficient privacy, because it still leaks important metadata, such as who is exchanging data, when, and how often. Given enough metadata, global adversaries and private companies can identify your behavior across multiple applications, even when the content of the traffic you exchange remains encrypted. Services like VPNs can hide your information from your internet service provider (ISP) but can’t protect you from the general fingerprinting of your browser, mobile devices and websites visits on a daily basis. Over time, this online behavior creates a profile that can be traced.</p><p>HOPR addresses this challenge by ensuring all the data and metadata you produce and consume online stays private. To do this, HOPR feeds content through a state-of-the-art mixnet - the HOPR network. </p> The HOPR protocol <p>HOPR incentivizes node runners who relay packets using its own currency, the HOPR token. Messages routed through the network are embedded with HOPR tokens in the form of “tickets” to pay each node along the route. HOPR’s proof of relay mechanism ensures a node can’t claim a ticket until the data packet is relayed to the next downstream node. This creates positive incentives for nodes to be good actors in the network. Tickets are cashed out via an Ethereum compatible blockchain (EVM) but are not always valid. This probabilistic payment system ensures a node’s online behavior can not be analyzed using timing attacks.</p><p>To ensure privacy at any level of network usage, the HOPR network is constantly fed with cover traffic: arbitrary data which provides cover for real users. This is particularly important in the early years of the network, when usage will understandably be lower.</p><p>The HOPR Association has allocated 250M HOPR tokens to cover traffic, to be released over four years. These will be issued anonymously by nodes sponsored by the HOPR Association and routed through nodes based on multiple parameters including HOPR tokens staked, amount of channels open, and general connectivity.</p> Verify off-chain activity without compromising privacy <p>This incentivized cover traffic system, combined with proof of relay, is what sets HOPR apart from other privacy networks, which either lack the proper incentives to scale or end up compromising on privacy or decentralization. Privacy networks are very challenging to develop and then test - how can you monitor and verify node activity without sacrificing privacy? <br><br>This is particularly important for the development of cover traffic and the long-term economic balancing of the network. Since running HOPR nodes incurs electricity and internet bandwidth costs, it’s important to be able to distinguish between the kickstarter cover traffic (artificially high for the first four years) and real traffic (initially minimal, but growing as the network scales). <br><br>Tickets issued by cover traffic can be tagged as such and shared off-chain. This would allow analysis but prevent inspection by other nodes. The HOPR team needed a reliable way to implement this approach, since simply logging this information in a decentralized IPFS node, which anyone can add data, would allow &nbsp;information about cover traffic metrics to be skewed or manipulated by any party in the network.</p> Using Ceramic to create a decentralized monitoring tool for HOPR nodes <p>Using Ceramic, HOPR can propagate user-specific data and allow node runners to inspect and share their node's information as needed. To do this, nodes create a log entry in a Ceramic Stream, a DAG-based data structure for storing continuous, mutable streams of content on IPFS, every time they receive a particular message (for example, one with the cover traffic tag). Since this information is published with the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1">secp256k1</a> private key used by the HOPR nodes, this information can be connected to a HOPR node and verified as such. This prevents outside manipulation of data.</p><p>HOPR node runners can use the HOPR dashboard to see their node data, and by checking the Ceramic Streams pinned by their nodes, obtain meaningful information about the cover traffic sent to their nodes. In this way, Ceramic not only helps HOPR developers, but also allows users themselves to verify the state of the network without involuntarily compromising their privacy.</p><p>Previous iterations of HOPR testnets issued unverifiable cover traffic via a bot, which was cumbersome and of limited utility. Thanks to Ceramic, HOPR nodes can now easily compare notes and assess their own ability to connect to other nodes.</p><p>The HOPR Network is the first of its kind using Ceramic to log decentralized data for an open-source protocol, and we believe this approach can be used by any project which relies on peer-to-peer off-chain data, which would otherwise be unverifiable.</p> Using IDX to connect HOPR nodes to external accounts <p>Since HOPR nodes have their own private keys, which need to quickly sign and submit transactions on-chain, each node has a unique private identity. This is extremely important for privacy, but it also makes engaging with a community of node runners challenging. As a result, it wasn't trivial for the HOPR team to link HOPR node runners to another digital identity, enrich node runner data, or perform promotional actions linked to their <a href="https://stake.hoprnet.org/">staking program</a>, which would be trivial in a centralized (but not private) setting. This is where Ceramic provides a lot more flexibility.</p><p>The identities of HOPR node runners are private, but they don’t have to be anonymous. It’s possible to connect node runners with another digital identity, as long as that connection is verifiable.<br><br>The HOPR team has already started using Ceramic’s identity protocol, IDX, for this use case in a recent testnet on the Polygon network. HOPR nodes leverage IDX to connect to external Ethereum accounts outside of the HOPR network. With IDX, HOPR nodes now have the ability to sign an Ethereum account, enabling users to connect their nodes with an existing pseudonymous digital identity - real or not.</p> What's next for HOPR? <p>In the coming weeks, the HOPR team will start to test our cover traffic nodes, which will become the cornerstone for the HOPR network. The HOPR Association will continue to run testnets with the community to finetune the HOPR protocol. From there, node adoption and development of the protocol will continue alongside the community.

				 <p>Use bank-issued verifiable credentials to prove your identity when requesting and presenting your diploma.</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to extend the existing bank identity scheme yes (about 1000 banks) with the capability to issue verifiable credentials asserting bank-verified identities. This will allow graduated students to prove their identity when requesting their diploma (again as verifiable credentials). Subsequently, both credentials can be used in combination to prove the graduation and the identity of the holder of the diploma.</p>
<p>The bank identity credential can certainly be used in other scenarios, such as onboarding with insurance websites, car sharing, vacation flat rental services, or age verification for gaming.</p>
<p>The project will also underpin the service with a sustainable business model and the suitable security level. As a result, bank customers can enjoy the freedom of self sovereignty while financial institutions will have an incentive and security allowing them to contribute their tremendous reach of verified identity data to the European SSI ecosystem.</p>

				 <p>WorkPi helps people measure and identify their skill gaps by seamlessly integrating with e-learning-, assessment- or human resource (HR) platforms.</p>
<p>WorkPi analyses skills, characteristics and preferences of employees from every sector while storing this personal data in self-sovereign identity (SSI) wallets. Hereby, WorkPi will create the largest skill database in the world to provide people with personalised job education suggestions. We call it the ‘Internet of Skills’.</p>
<p>The project will build a unique aggregator tool that can normalise and analyse assessments, learning- and other HR tools to optimise their data model. They are aiming to build worlds largest skill &amp; performance database to be able to measure and match people with their ‘dream jobs’, cutting down on employee turnover and mismatch hirings in various industries.</p>
<p>SSI forms a cornerstone of their product, as data should be owned by the rightful owner.</p>
<p>Employees can now, through WorkPi, own their career related data wherever they work. Through a in-house developed method, called compute-to-SSI, they have enabled themselves to be able to learn from this private data.</p>
<p>By doing so, they have opened up new opportunities to be a core driver in the HR-tech market.</p>

				 <p>Decentralised Consent Management applied to centralised nationwide Electronic Health Record datastore and organ donation</p>
<p>Problem<br>There is a global shortage of organ. The need is much higher than the offer, even in countries where citizens and residents are all presumed donors. Even if 80% of the population are willing to donate, 61% have never expressed their consent. In this case, medical staff approaches family to ask for consent and the refusal rate is high.&nbsp;In addition, collected consents in the existing solutions have compliance issues. Consent extension module of EHR software vendor is too naive. Sometimes the consent is just a flag stored in the database. There is no way to prove the authenticity and the integrity of the consent. Public healthcare institutions are exposed to legal risks.&nbsp;Institutions still use paper based process. It is impractical and incurs administrative burden. There is 2000 complains per year in Luxembourg on the average and file a court case takes several days.</p>
<p>Solution<br>Zenlife eConsent is a turn key solution and we make it easy of manage the whole life cycle of consents and give them the probative value.</p>
 
 Design : Create dynamic consent form based on predefined schema 
 Distribute : Certify the form and customize it with personal data before distribution. Re-consent can be acquired by creating a new version of the form and distribute it again 
 Collect and Deposit : Users provide consent and certify it before deposit into the backend storage, that is used as the national donor registry 
 Demonstrate : Deposited consents are protected as specified by legal electronical archiving ISO norm to give them probative value in complement to the validity of the digital signature. Blockchain is used in complement to witness the integrity of the internal journal of operation. 
 
<p>Value Proposition</p>
 
 Public Health Authority : Build efficient governance across involved parties 
 Citizens : Empower citizen in an ethical relationship 
 Doctors : Liabilities protection 
 Legal : Instant compliance demonstration 
 IT operation : integrated turn key solution, easy to manage and to integrate into a enterprise grade environment&nbsp;

 Protocol Labs and Energy Web complete first showcase of an open-source solution to decarbonize Filecoin <p>In support of the <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord (CCA)</a>, <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web</a> today announced a successful showcase of an open-source solution for decentralized renewable energy purchasing by crypto miners. In this solution showcase, six Filecoin storage providers (i.e., miners) purchased verified renewable energy certificates from <a href="https://3degreesinc.com/">3Degrees</a> and <a href="https://www.spgroup.com.sg/sustainable-energy-solutions/our-low-carbon-solutions/renewable-energy-certificates">SP Group</a> using <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, a public renewable energy search engine(PL and 3D are both CCA Supporters.) The solution will eventually be applicable across any blockchain to make it easy for any crypto miner to deliver proof of green&nbsp;mining.</p><p>The CCA is a private sector led initiative to decarbonize the crypto sector with open-source decentralized solutions and promote best industry practices. Energy Web is a co-convener of the CCA and both Protocol Labs and 3Degrees are CCA Supporters.</p><p>In the showcase announced today, renewable energy purchases are <a href="https://filrep.io/?columns=energy&amp;order=desc&amp;sortBy=energy">recorded in Filrep</a>, a reputation system used by clients aiming to store data on the decentralized Filecoin network. Integrating renewable energy data from Energy Web Zero into the reputation system allows clients to factor renewables into their decision when choosing a storage provider. Each record on Filrep points to a <a href="https://zero.energyweb.org/partners/filecoin/purchases/c8ffa1c8-c763-44c1-bb4d-b370c15694b3">verification page</a> in Energy Web Zero, showing where the energy was produced, documenting the renewable source, and providing an attestation certificate proving ownership of the corresponding renewable energy&nbsp;credits.</p><p>Over the next year, Protocol Labs and Energy Web will create a package of open-source solutions that make it easy for all Filecoin storage providers to search for and purchase renewable energy on Energy Web Zero. Both Filecoin storage providers and clients will be able to verify procurement to substantiate their environmental claims because transactions will be anchored on the public Energy Web Chain, and in turn be traceable to existing renewable energy registries as well as individual solar, wind and hydroelectric power projects.</p><blockquote>“We are excited to develop open-source decentralized technologies to support investments in renewable energy and track energy use throughout the supply chain,” said Alan Ransil, the technical lead for Filecoin Green at Protocol Labs. “By serving as an early adopter of these technologies, the decentralized network of Filecoin storage providers will set an example for both crypto miners and other industries to&nbsp;follow.”</blockquote><p>Filecoin is an open-source cloud storage marketplace, protocol, and cryptocurrency that serves as a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud storage. Traditional cloud storage providers like Apple, Amazon, Google, and others have been moving aggressively with renewables. Now, decentralized storage and blockchain, too.</p><p>Many members of the Filecoin Storage Provider community voiced support for the new&nbsp;project:</p>  “The dream of a decentralized storage network powered by renewable energy has been a motivating force behind the company since our first prototype,” said Kevin Huynh, the CEO of PiKNiK, a San Diego, California-based storage provider. “We believe it is imperative for the future of Web3 to grow our industry in a way that protects nature, while setting a sky-high standard for transparency as to our environmental footprint and renewable energy sourcing.”  “I was deeply impressed by The Paris Agreement and Kyoto Protocol, which established the need to act quickly to support the environment,” said Alex Ma, a Filecoin storage provider based in Asia. “In my view, linking Filecoin to Energy Web Zero brings the community closer to a sustainable data storage solution.”  “I’m happy to do my part in making Filecoin more environmentally clean and sustainable,” said Nelson Chen, “this approach allowed me to support renewable energy and prove my contribution easily, without having to change my power provider or install new equipment.”  Stuart Berman, who serves as CTO, also at PiKNiK, said that “We started participating in Filecoin because we believe in the long-term vision. This proof of concept connecting Filecoin to renewable energy markets is a major first step towards solving the challenge of environmental sustainability within Filecoin and Crypto more broadly.”  Alex Altman, the COO of Seal Storage Technology Inc. said: “As we enter a new age of corporate environmental responsibility, Seal Storage Technology is delivering on its commitment of carbon neutrality with the ambitious goal of achieving carbon negativity in 2022. Filecoin already empowers Seal to offer decentralized cloud storage using significantly less energy than other blockchain-based networks, and the integration with Energy Web will allow our renewable energy use to be tracked and verified”  <p>The full cross-chain solution to be deployed in mid-2022 will create a unique decentralized identifier (DID) on the Energy Web Chain for each Filecoin storage provider who chooses to participate and link storage providers’ renewable energy purchases to their respective DIDs. This linking of a given Filecoin storage provider’s DID with verified green Filecoin mining will enable that storage provider to reflect their zero carbon status in the Filecoin Reputation System, and allow energy attributes to be traced from client to storage provider to individual renewable energy projects.</p><p>This cross-chain solution being developed can be extended to miners in other ecosystems because the underlying technical architecture will leverage the verifiable, interoperable hash links that are the basis of Web3 technologies such as <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> and all blockchains. The project will therefore support the development of verifiably renewable crypto mining projects such as <a href="https://cryptoclimacc.medium.com/open-source-green-hashrate-software-solution-will-track-and-verify-green-bitcoin-mining-6b4e9cabe8b">Green Hashrate</a>.</p><p>Protocol Labs and Energy Web will share progress updates over the months ahead in advance of releasing commercial ready open-source solutions.</p><p>— — —</p><p>About Protocol&nbsp;Labs</p><p>Protocol Labs is an open-source research, development, and deployment laboratory.

Read the first post in this series, “An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and Economy”&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">here</a>.</p><p>By Audrey Stienon, Associate, Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>Labor Day represents an important moment to commemorate the essential contributions of working people to our&nbsp;country.</p><p>The holiday was created at the height of the Gilded Age, a time when the American economy was booming, the likes of John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and J.P. Morgan were making their fortune, and most people toiled in exhausting, unsafe jobs for paltry wages. Working people, including children as young as five, labored in 12-hour shifts, seven days a week — and still were not paid enough to escape poverty. Individuals had little power to change the status quo, but when they banded together in labor unions, they were able to effectively demand better pay, hours, and working conditions from their employers.</p><p>This shift in power didn’t happen quietly or easily. The wealthy few who profited by exploiting labor wielded their money and political connections to mobilize private security forces, police, and the judicial system against working people. In turn, the labor movement used all the tools at its disposal — from strikes and boycotts to protests and marches — to fight for change, even in the face of violence. In 1894, after twelve working people were killed during the Pullman railroad strike, President Cleveland tried to repair the government’s frayed ties with working Americans by declaring the first Monday in September “Labor Day,” a holiday commemorating the essential contributions of working people to our&nbsp;country.</p><p>A new holiday, of course, did not suddenly balance power between working people and their employers. Today, working people — along with the labor unions, grassroots movements, small business associations, and community organizations that represent them — continue to engage in many of the same battles for equal power that they fought more than a century&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Equal power means freedom of choice for working people. That freedom is what makes possible the American Dream, with its promise that everyone should have the equal right to build the life they desire by participating in the economy in whichever way they choose — through hard work, risk-taking, innovation, or entrepreneurship.</p><p>Like democracies, capitalist markets — especially those intended to support democratic societies — work best when participants enjoy a high degree of equality in decision-making power. Ideal markets, after all, depend on individuals’ ability to buy what they choose as well as to walk away from any exchange that does not satisfy them — something true for people entering a store just as much as it is for people assessing how they want to spend their time and&nbsp;labor.</p><p>But whereas democratic power is shared through the vote, markets’ power often comes from money. Any capitalist system intended to support a democratic society depends on checks and balances that prevent any one group from writing rules that benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else. A society in which this power of choice is not balanced — in which the rules of the economy leave working people with no choice but to accept jobs that leave them in poverty, and with no way to achieve meaningful change — cannot be truly democratic.</p><p>We know American capitalism has routinely failed to live up to this ideal. The two-pronged restriction on voting access and market participation by race, gender, disability, and class ensured that whole swaths of our society were (and in many cases, continue to be) robbed of both the political power to write economic rules that protect their interests and the economic power to gain enough resources to live with dignity. And yet, by learning from the combined struggles of the labor movement, civil rights movement, and alliances between them, we know that it is possible to build an economy truer to our democratic values.</p><p>We are currently experiencing two crises simultaneously: both American democracy and capitalism are in critical condition owing to the increasingly unequal concentration of political and economic power throughout our&nbsp;society.</p><p>Of the <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-grounding-our-economy-in-a-new-ideas-and-values-99596c8dabe8">many failed ideas US policymakers have implemented in recent decades</a>, one of the most dangerous has been to systematically erode the checks and balances within both government and markets. Lax regulations have made markets less competitive, allowing corporate behemoths to block the entry of new competitors, robbing consumers of the freedom to buy alternatives to products they do not like — including digital products that require them to give up personal data — and depriving working people of the ability to find better jobs. Right to work laws and anti-union employers have produced a steady decline in the wages paid by industries that used to be pillars of the middle class. Our political system has been corrupted by private money that fuels election campaigns and lobbying efforts, giving the wealthiest in our society an unparalleled ability to influence the policymaking process and ensure that the rules continue to work to their advantage.</p><p>All of this means that, even as most of us recognize the socio-economic status quo is harming many Americans, we lack the power to enact the change necessary to bring it more in&nbsp;balance.</p><p>We at Omidyar Network believe that if we want our democracy to survive, we need a new form of capitalism that promotes and protects balanced power. As in our democracy, we need checks on those with the most power to make sure they cannot rig the rules to their benefit, and we need to build <a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/testimony-by-heather-boushey-before-the-joint-economic-committee-on-the-coronavirus-recession/">counterweights to concentrated power</a> so that the people who suffer under unfair rules are certain to have their voices&nbsp;heard.</p><p>One of our priorities is to help build the power of working people so they can advocate for the wages, working conditions, and policies needed to thrive. That’s why we <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-network-endorses-pro-act-to-expand-worker-power/">endorsed the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2021</a>, which would expand people’s right to organize and engage in collective bargaining, ensuring their interests are well-represented when employers respond to economic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future trends, such as automation.</p><p>In addition to the PRO Act at the federal level, many of the fights for worker power are taking place closer to the ground. As the pandemic increased people’s recognition of the importance of caregivers, hospital employees, and service workers — whose jobs typically pay low wages and provide little protection — we have supported the <a href="http://alwaysessentialworkers.com/partners/">National Essential Workers Campaign</a>, an initiative intended to coordinate state and local efforts fighting to give essential workers more voice and power, especially over health and safety. We have also supported the <a href="https://www.californiaworkerpower.org/">California Coalition for Worker Power</a>, a new coalition anchored by a number of partners dedicated to ensuring that every worker in the state has the power to come together and improve their work conditions and communities.</p><p>We also recognize that a rapidly changing economy requires new strategies and tools to help workers organize. We support <a href="https://uwunited.org/">Unemployed Workers United (UWU)</a> and their experimentation in the use of digital organizing tactics to engage people who have lost their jobs — especially in communities of color — in local grassroots campaigns. We also support an <a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/business-and-society-program/worker-voice-lab/">idea lab</a> at The Aspen Institute’s <a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/business-and-society-program/">Business in Society Program</a> to allow a number of stakeholders — including corporate governance experts, business leaders, and worker organizers — to explore solutions for increasing worker voice in corporate governance structures.</p><p>Working people, however, are not the only group that needs a greater say in the future of our economy. Alongside the Ford Foundation and W.K. Kellogg Foundation, we launched the <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-network-ford-foundation-w-k-kellogg-foundation-launch-carry-on-the-fight-fund/">Carry on the Fight Fund</a> to support grassroots organizations so they have support beyond Election Day to hold elected officials accountable to their campaign promises and build long-term power. We have also partnered with organizations such as <a href="https://mainstreetalliance.org/">Main Street Alliance</a>, which advocates for policies that support small business and helps small business leaders become their own advocates for policy change. We’re working with <a href="https://www.changethechamber.org/">Change the Chamber</a>, a student movement taking on the Chamber of Commerce through <a href="https://twitter.com/lobbyforclimatehttps:/twitter.com/lobbyforclimate">social media campaigns</a> and direct conversations with companies and policymakers in response to the Chamber’s continued lobbying efforts on behalf of fossil fuel interests to hinder essential climate change regulation.</p><p>We are also focused on ensuring economic policies do not concentrate wealth — and the power that comes with it — in the hands of a few individuals and corporations. To do so, we support groups such as <a href="https://bettermarkets.com/">Better Markets</a>, a watchdog organization that advocates on behalf of the public interest for a fairer financial sector and serves as a check on Wall Street’s immense lobbying power on financial regulatory matters. We are also working with several organizations pushing to reform the outsized impact large corporations currently have on the American political processes. Notably, the <a href="https://www.politicalaccountability.net/">Center for Political Accountability (CPA)</a> is working to increase accountability and transparency for companies’ political spending. They developed the <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CPA-Wharton-Zicklin-model-code-of-conduct-for-corporate-political-spending-10-13-20-.pdf">CPA-Wharton Zicklin Model Code of Conduct for Political Spending</a>, which is intended to guide companies on how to ethically engage in political activities and helped mobilize shareholders to win an unprecedented number of fights, resulting in requirements that companies disclose their political spending.</p><p>We recognize that many of these efforts have been guided by organizations that provide the research and ideas for how different stakeholders of the economy can work together toward a more equal distribution of economic power. The <a href="https://earn.us/">Economic Analysis and Research Network (EARN)</a>, for example, is a network of research, policy, and public engagement organizations that provide resources and technical assistance to local groups. Through their <a href="https://earn.us/issue/worker-power/">Worker Power Project,</a> they aim to bolster the ability of working people to achieve racial, gender, and economic justice through organizing, collective bargaining, and advocating for state and local policies that promote worker power. Meanwhile, the merger of the Center for Responsive Politics and the National Institute on Money in Politics created <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/">OpenSecrets</a>, which will build on the extensive datasets of its two parent organizations to track the money being invested in political campaigns and lobbying at both the federal and state level. This information is crucial for efforts to hold policymakers accountable to the&nbsp;public.</p><p>We celebrate this Labor Day amid a pandemic that has acted as a shock to the system and has given may people the power — often for the first time — to make a conscious choice about how they want to participate in the economy, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/07/jobs-report-labor-shortage-analysis/">triggering a “Great Reassessment of work in America.”</a> Many are choosing not to return to jobs that paid low wages and had erratic schedules or poor working conditions. These decisions are proof that the economy people want is very different than the one we have. Even a pandemic has not been enough to disrupt the systemic power imbalance that exists in both our economy and democracy. We must continue the legacy of the working people and labor leaders who have stood up to hoarders of power; we must continue to fight for a future in which each of us has the power and voice to determine how we live our&nbsp;lives.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-building-counterweights-to-power-83e7234aa958">Reimagining Capitalism Series: Building Counterweights to Power</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>There are currently a few initiatives around the world that want to develop digital vaccination records and bring them to market. However, the past has shown that even established solutions such as the international vaccination certificate (“Yellow Card”) cannot be digitized so easily. The current OwnYourData research project IDunion – funded by the “IKT der Zukunft” program from the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology in Austria (<a href="https://projekte.ffg.at/projekt/4125456">FFG Projekt 887052</a>) – aims to adapt the previously <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/hall-of-fame/dip/">NGI DAPSI project “Digital Immunization Passport”</a> for the Austrian market and to develop a functional prototype in order to examine the business, legal, technical and social aspects of such a solution and to discuss them in a broader public.<br>
Technically, the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) network offers interesting opportunities for citizens, authorities, and companies, a new form of trusting cooperation. Through a cooperation with the <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion SSI network</a> in Germany, we take the opportunity to test this technology specifically for the administration of COVID-19 test certificates from individuals in Austria.<br>
Legally, it is necessary to define, document and enforce any data exchange through clearly defined terms of use. We will continue to expand the existing concept of usage policies and use semantic technologies to show that this enables an automated and GDPR-compliant implementation of consent management.<br>
The big economic challenge is how health authorities and SMEs can access personal data in order to benefit from the potential of personal data just like internet companies. In this project, we present a technology platform that offers small and medium-sized businesses a simple approach to the use of SSI networks for managing digital certificates and enable them to exchange data between citizens and authorities / companies.<br>
The social aspect of this solution is based on the human-centered approach of handling personal data. In this project, the citizen is the point of integration of all health-related data streams and has the option of managing COVID-19 test certificates either in a digital wallet on the smartphone, or also operating a personal data store in order to manage their own personal data in a self-sovereign way.<br>
This project offers the opportunity to try out new architectures and technologies for an acute social and health issue. It is not a project that will make a solution immediately available, but it shows fundamental possibilities for a new approach to human-centered technology. This research project lays the foundation for developing the most secure and most modern health passport for Austria.</p>

 AEMO announces open-source operating system for world-leading distributed energy marketplace design&nbsp;trial  World-first global partnership includes Energy Web (to provide the open-source data exchange system), Microsoft (to provide cloud services), and PXiSE (to provide market logic software), with local aggregators (Mondo) and network operators(AusNet) <p>Zug, Switzerland — 2 September 2021 — <br>Australian power system and market operator, Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has announced the architecture and technology partners for<a href="https://energyweb.org/aemo/"> Project EDGE</a> — a flagship initiative enabling distributed energy resources (DER) to provide for both wholesale and local network services at enterprise scale within an off-market trial environment. The DER Marketplace solution will be developed in partnership with local market participants AusNet Services, Mondo and global technology vendors, including Energy Web, PXiSE, and Microsoft.</p><p>Australia leads the world in adoption and deployment of distributed energy resources (DER), with nearly one in four homes featuring rooftop solar, and 40% in some states (South Australia and Queensland).</p><p>Combined with the rapid growth of energy storage, demand-side management, and utility-scale renewable generation, the Australian grid is transforming to a decentralised system in which consumer owned DER play a pivotal role. This has created challenges for AEMO and distribution network operators in balancing and protecting the grid, but also creates new opportunities for consumers and other market participants to create value via supporting the energy transition with their&nbsp;DER.</p><p>In response, AEMO has established a DER program to enable the transition from one-way energy supply to a world-leading system that maximises the value of DER for all consumers through digitisation and integration of DER into Australia’s power systems and&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Under project EDGE, AEMO is collaborating with Mondo and AusNet Services, with input from the broader energy industry, to demonstrate via a proof-of-concept trial, how aggregated fleets of DER can deliver multiple energy services at scale both wholesale power system and local network&nbsp;levels.</p><p>This project will provide AEMO and its partners with technical and operational experience to inform evidence-based changes to regulatory and operational processes to effectively manage Australian electricity grids and markets with increasing levels of DER participation. Additionally, EDGE will focus specifically on understanding consumers’ perspectives and preferences in selling their DER capacity to Aggregators for use in energy&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Project EDGE is focused on streamlining data exchange among market participants to maximise utilisation and coordination of DER for providing multiple grid services, informing capability for scalability. Project EDGE is testing this capability with up to 10MW of DER capacity, made up of approximately 1,000 customers.</p><p>The DER Marketplace will be underpinned by Energy Web’s open-source operating system, which will be used to establish digital identities for all assets and market participants in the program. This identity-based architecture facilitates secure, efficient exchange and validation of DER data amongst market participants using digital infrastructure shared amongst Australian market participants.</p><p>The market intelligence and logic layer will be provided by PXiSE, and the solution will leverage Microsoft Azure cloud computing resources. EDGE’s DER Marketplace will deliver three core function&nbsp;sets:</p><p>1:Efficient and scalable DER data exchange between actors through use of self-sovereign identities anchored to a digital infrastructure that in future, could be shared between market participants;</p><p>2:Wholesale integration: DER Fleets will be dispatched as if they are participating in existing wholesale markets, while considering Distribution Network Limits in the dispatch process;&nbsp;and</p><p>3:Local Services Exchange — the Marketplace will facilitate visible, scalable and competitive trade of Local DER Services that enables Distribution Network Service Providers (DNSPs) to manage local power security and reliability and enables DER Aggregators to stack local and wholesale value streams efficiently.</p><p>As DER deployment accelerates across Australia, coordinating DER across market participant operating systems and participating prosumers has become a significant challenge. Project EDGE will provide evidence to support decisions relating to investment in digital operating system and the underlying design of data exchange&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Australia’s EDGE project will begin testing services in April 2022, with project completion in March&nbsp;2023.</p><blockquote>AEMO Chief Markets Officer, Member Services, Violette Mouchaileh, said “Project EDGE aims to build understanding of and inform the most efficient and sustainable way to integrate DER into the electricity system and markets, allowing all consumers to benefit from a future with high levels of DER. There is no existing product that meets all high-level requirements for the DER Marketplace, so Project EDGE is at the leading edge of product development in this&nbsp;space.”</blockquote><p>The EDGE Project is being supported by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), with AEMO receiving almost $13 million in funding for the project. ARENA CEO Darren Miller said at the time that this landmark trial would provide the blueprint for integrating DER into the&nbsp;grid.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/aemo-announces-open-source-operating-system-for-world-leading-distributed-energy-marketplace-design-a211a6f6c415">AEMO announces open-source operating system for world-leading distributed energy marketplace design…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The growing demand for digital public infrastructure requires coordinated global investment and an ethical&nbsp;lens Global leaders weigh in on the ethical facets of digital public infrastructure at a virtual conference held Monday, Aug. 30,&nbsp;2021. The 10 must-reads to keep pace with the digital public infrastructure movement <p>By Govind Shivkumar, Director of Responsible Technology, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>You don’t need me to tell you that 2020 was an arduous year, or that the year that followed has been just as fraught. We all had a collective experience of the pandemic as a destabilizing force. It exacerbated and highlighted societal inefficiencies and inequities as no other single event in recent memory has, and it did so on a global&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Underlying many of the achievements and disappointments in pandemic response was digital public infrastructure (or lack thereof). Where some nations were equipped to deliver cash transfers to citizens, collect and utilize comprehensive public health data, and distribute vaccines in an orderly fashion, others struggled. What made the difference was often preexisting digital public infrastructure (or&nbsp;DPI).</p><p>Our friends at The Rockefeller Foundation explain this well in a new <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/report/co-develop-digital-public-infrastructure-for-an-equitable-recovery/">report,</a> showing that as more of our society becomes digital (especially the economy), it becomes increasingly imperative that we treat digital infrastructure like we do roads and bridges. They outline six key areas of cooperation. The bottom line? We need coordinated global investment in digital public infrastructure so that it’s in place before we need it. And we need an ethical lens to ensure that any digital systems reinforce safeguards such as inclusion, trust, competition, security, and&nbsp;privacy.</p> A shared vision and call to&nbsp;action <p>The need for more and better digital public infrastructure has not gone unnoticed by government and philanthropy. This week, a group of nearly 20 global leaders laid out a shared vision for co-developing broad-based, flexible digital systems to support an equitable recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic while strengthening inclusion and human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Hosted by the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a>, Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norad), and The Rockefeller Foundation, the virtual event elicited meaningful ideas and commitments from The United Nations, European Commission, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, Africa Digital Rights Hub, USAID, India, Sri Lanka, Togo, Sierra Leone, Estonia, Norway, Germany, and many other champions.</p><p>Omidyar Network’s Senior Vice President of Programs, Michele Jawando, moderated the conversation, drawing out pledges of funding and other support to <a href="https://mosip.io/">MOSIP</a> and <a href="https://mojaloop.io/">Mojaloop</a> (two of Omidyar Network’s grantees), the health data exchange <a href="https://dhis2.org/">DHIS2</a>, <a href="https://digitalsquare.org/blog/2021/8/27/digital-square-recommits-to-advancing-health-equity-through-digital-transformation">Digital Square</a>, Digital Public Goods Alliance, technical assistance to implementing nations, research, and proposals for new funding structures such as The Giving Pledge or creating a GAVI-like alliance that pools demand and resources from the public and private&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>“More than 400 people tuned in to learn more about digital public Infrastructure (DPI) — the basic systems like digital identity, payments and data exchanges that can connect us at a societal scale,” Jawando reflected. “Some heard for the first time how innovators built on DPI to slow disease spread and deliver help. They heard calls for caution and the need for safeguards for inclusion and protection. And they saw that we have a shared and coordinated agenda for equitable global co-development, based on digital public&nbsp;goods.”</p><p>As the speakers reminded us, this is just the beginning. We have a chance to bake ethics and inclusion into society’s next great socio-technological transformation; the first that is truly global AND digital. Let’s use that opportunity wisely.</p> An ethical framework <p>If history has shown us anything, it’s that creating systems that have society-wide implications without prioritizing ethical considerations is a fool’s errand at best; at worst it’s catastrophic. As the demand for digital public infrastructure becomes more widespread, it’s important to prioritize the ethical considerations when designing such&nbsp;systems.</p><p>That’s the objective of a new <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/digital-public-goods">white paper</a> funded by Omidyar Network and developed by Harvard University’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. To provide governments with a roadmap for the ethical deployment of digital public infrastructure, the Center’s Justice, Health and Democracy Impact Initiative produced a set of best practices for organizations that covers the design and deployment considerations for technologists, national governments, and philanthropic funders.</p><p>“After taking a hard look at existing work on this subject, we realized much of the debate is happening at the wrong level,” said co-author Josh Simons, who holds a joint fellowship at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy and the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. “There is too much uncertainty, change, and dynamism for hard and fast rules. What we need are concrete structures of decision-making and participation that hold actors to account for how they build digital infrastructure.”</p><p>Specifically, the paper advises technology developers to design digital public infrastructure that can adapt to emerging needs, concerns, and technological developments. Developers should consult directly with advocates of end users at all stages of development to ensure systems do not undermine their rights. Developers should also ensure their systems are able to be accessed by a variety of users, regardless of background or experience with technology, and regularly revise and maintain the systems once they’re&nbsp;built.</p><p>On the policy side, it is critical that policymakers integrate deliberation in the design and deployment of digital public infrastructure. These deliberation processes should also seek out input and feedback from groups have historically been marginalized. Additionally, policymakers should continuously conduct evaluations of how digital systems are affecting the communities they serve and establish clear ways to reform the systems, protect user rights, and establish transparency and accountability for politicians and technology developers.</p><p>Finally, philanthropists who are hoping to support the development of digital public infrastructure should identify and support developers and policymakers who have clear commitments to responsible digital public infrastructure development. They should moreover establish accountability measures for themselves such as adopting multidisciplinary ethics committees to help with oversight and navigating uncertain situations.</p><p>And the paper stresses regular discussions among all stakeholders involved to assess the merits, feasibility, and limitations of digital public infrastructure.</p><p>“Our guiding principles for stakeholders involved in developing and deploying digital public infrastructure are revisability of technology design, deliberative governance to create feedback loops, and accountability of funders and policy-makers,” said Jeff Behrends, Director of Ethics and Technology Initiatives at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics and co-author on the project. “We advocate an approach to the ethics of digital public infrastructure that we believe is robust, resilient, and applicable to countries across the&nbsp;world.”</p> A growing&nbsp;movement <p>If you feel like this has only scratched the surface, you’d be right! As with so many things with social, political, economic, and technological consequences, digital public infrastructure is a complex topic. Below are links to further reading that highlights the need for digital public infrastructure and how to make it a reality everywhere, for everyone. We’re confident that once others in government, international organizations, civil society, business, and philanthropy learn more, they will want to help overcome some of the remaining hurdles.</p><p>We welcome them into a rapidly growing international community of organizations working to change how countries are supported in their digital transformation journeys. There are no quick fixes. Only through better coordination, vastly more resources, and a clear vision of what “good DPI” is and why it matters can we accelerate deployments, strengthen national digital sovereignty and local value creation.</p><p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/08/4-reasons-you-should-care-about-digital-public-infrastructure">How to bring digital inclusion to the people who need it most</a> (World Economic Forum, Aug.&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-digital-public-infrastructure-is-no-longer-just-a-development-agenda-6c3915d20598">Reimagining digital public infrastructure is no longer just a development agenda</a> (Omidyar Network, June&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://ecfr.eu/article/a-digital-agenda-for-the-eastern-partnership/">A digital agenda for the Eastern Partnership</a> (European Council on Foreign Relations, June&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.xyz/">Exploring digital public goods</a> (An eight-part series written by Richard Pope and supported by Omidyar Network, May-July&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-the-time-is-now-for-digital-public-goods-99833">Opinion: The time is now for digital public goods</a> (Devex, May&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/financing-the-digital-public-goods-ecosystem/">Financing the digital public goods ecosystem</a> (Digital Public Goods Alliance, March&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2020/12/07/covid-19-spurs-national-plans-to-give-citizens-digital-identities">Covid-19 spurs national plans to give citizens digital identities</a> (The Economist, Dec. 2020 — subscriber access required)</p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/746a8643-1ff5-4e28-8f78-389f549c2b0e">‘Fire hose’ of health innovation risks going down the drain</a> (Financial Times, Nov.&nbsp;2020)</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/the-growing-demand-for-digital-public-infrastructure-requires-coordinated-global-investment-and-an-8ce1a22e4d6c">The growing demand for digital public infrastructure requires coordinated global investment and an…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Reflecting on WAO’s digital support of charities during the Catalyst Continuation programme Image: <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/uL99eb3GCa0">Clay&nbsp;LeConey</a><blockquote>“Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.” (Winston Churchill)</blockquote><p>A couple of months ago, we <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/all-good-things-come-to-an-end-e3d21a93da49">announced</a> that we’d been asked to help eight charities with some digital support through Catalyst’s ‘Continuation ‘programme. This has now come to an end, so we thought we’d wrap up what happened and what we learned from the&nbsp;process.</p><p>First of all, we tracked everything we did. This was vital not only to account for our time but also to co-ordinate with one another and fairly distribute our support amongst our eight charities. Doug and Laura collaborated to provide advice and support over the course of the programme.</p><p>The work being done by charities was diverse and different, and we didn’t have a lot of time to plan what kind of support we were going to offer. As our eight charities were in different places, we needed a plan that would be quite flexible. Consequently, we decided to run weekly office hours in which charities could randomly show up, meet whomever else happened to have shown up and ask questions or just chat. In addition, we offered weekly 1:1 sessions for each&nbsp;charity.</p><p>Our digital support was optional, which meant that some charities used their full allocation of time, whereas others touched in occasionally or used us as accountability partners.</p><p>From <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> training to <a href="https://typeform.com">Typeform</a> remixing, advice on SSL certs and hosting packages to analytics, GDPR, CRMs or discovering if a particular tool had its own API, over the ten weeks, we helped charities with a wide range of technical issues.</p><blockquote>I don’t believe we would have been as effective or achieved as much in this phase without the help, support and direction of the you as our Digital Mentors. (Christine Brown, Ideal For&nbsp;All)</blockquote><p>We also gave advice on community engagement, peer to peer learning, architectures of participation, user testing, UX and many other socio-technological phenomena. All of this kind of consultancy can only happen by understanding the wider context a charity is working in, so we are pleased that our participation in previous Catalyst programmes had given us that insight and understanding.</p><blockquote>Really appreciate everything you’ve taught us and that goes for the rest of the team too. (Lindsay Woodward, CFF)</blockquote><p>We’re so proud to have had the opportunity to work with such a wonderful group of charities and human beings. As we wrapped up our participation in the Catalyst Continuation programme, we made sure to let our charities know that they are always welcome to reach out and share with us what they’ve been working on. After all, the relationships don’t end just because the beginning does!</p><blockquote>We Are Open were as clever as they were time efficient, a valuable resource throughout. (Kat Lewis, The Margate&nbsp;Bookie)</blockquote> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-end-of-the-beginning-fad2447f378f">The End of the Beginning</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>We do not have to look back further than the global economic collapse of 2008 to fully understand the worst-case scenario of unverified legal entities engaging in financial transactions. The LEI was created at the request of the G20 and Financial Stability Board (FSB) in response to this global catastrophe. Its objective is to provide a means to uniquely identify any legally distinct entity that engages in a transaction and subsequently reduce fraud and mitigate risk within the ecosystem. </p>
<p>With the LEI’s origin and objective in mind, it follows naturally that it offers potentially immeasurable value too when it comes to delivering transparency and trust in payment transactions. This value is widely recognized among many payment industry insiders, and in recent years, there has been burgeoning appetite and advocacy for LEI usage in a broad range of payments use cases. There has been significant industry-wide progress with two concrete mandates for LEI usage recently emanating from the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank of England in specific payment applications. Additionally, many regions and regulators are consulting on transformation within the ecosystem, and considering what role the LEI could play as a result. Since early 2020, GLEIF has shared information with regulatory authorities and organizations in the payments space on the LEI and its credentials in identity management via nine public consultations. Many more are anticipated in the years ahead.   </p>
<p>Below is a summary of key recent developments within the payments’ arena, which demonstrate widening acceptance of the LEI as a tool capable of delivering an enhanced global payments ecosystem.    </p>
<p>Mandate: LEI for Large Value Transactions </p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced a new mandate for the use of the LEI for all payment transactions of the value ₹50 crore (approximately €5.5 million) and above for entities using the Reserve Bank-run Centralized Payment Systems viz. Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT). By 1 April 2021, banks had to ensure that all remitter and beneficiary information in RTGS and NEFT payment messages were populated with the LEI. Data showed that in Q1 2021, India was ranked fifth in terms of the jurisdictions with the highest rate of LEI growth. This offers an indication of the mandate’s impact on LEI issuance.   </p>
<p>A strong proponent for the LEI, the RBI had earlier introduced it as a requirement in over the counter (OTC) derivative and non-derivative markets and large corporate borrowers.</p>
<p>The RBI’s use of the LEI to verify the identity of participants in large value transactions is the first use case of its kind. Yet the potential risk management advantages it offers make it a compelling tactic that other central banks may wish to consider adopting.   </p>
<p>Mandate: LEI in CHAPS Payments Message Standard (ISO 20022)  </p>
<p>In December 2020, The Bank of England (BoE) published its ‘Policy Statement: Implementing ISO 20022 Enhanced data in CHAPS’. Within the document, the BoE reaffirms its proactive position “to support the wider uptake of the LEI - beyond the financial sector - to corporates. […] the Bank believes wider uptake of the LEI could unlock a number of key benefits and is working with Government and national and international stakeholders to promote LEI use cases. These include their potential role in enhancing cross-border payments as part of the Financial Stability Board’s roadmap, as well as the role the LEI can play to help tackle financial crime.”</p>
<p>The paper confirms the BoE’s long-held intention to “introduce the LEI into the CHAPS payment message standard when migrating to ISO 20022, in line with industry views and international consensus, including HVPSplus and CBPRplus guidance.”</p>
<p>It then sets out the following initial phasing timeline:  </p>
 
 February 2023: LEIs will be introduced into ISO 20022 standard CHAPS payment messages on an ‘optional to send’ basis. While the BoE encourages all CHAPS Direct Participants to start using LEIs as early as possible, it will not become mandatory until spring 2024.  
 Spring 2024: The BoE will begin mandating LEIs to be used in by certain circumstances, with a vision to widen out the requirement to all participants over time. The BoE will mandate the use of the LEI where the payment involves a transfer of funds between Financial Institutions.  
 
<p>Within the report the BoE notes that the earlier firms adopt the LEI, the sooner they will derive its benefits. It also states an intention for the BoE to monitor the use of LEI for all transactions, with a view to assessing whether the mandatory requirement to include LEI data should be extended to all CHAPS payments. Industry will be provided with at least 18 months’ advance notice if the BoE extends any mandatory LEI requirements. </p>
<p>Consultation: Cross Border Payments </p>
<p>In February this year, GLEIF published a blog exploring the FSB’s support for the LEI in its Stage 3 roadmap on Enhancing Cross-Border Payments. In that publication, the FSB lists several focus areas that require global coordination and action to overcome the challenges and frictions in cross-border payments. Of particular note is the identification of ‘Establish Unique Identifiers with proxy registries’ as a key building block in the FSB’s roadmap to enhanced cross-border payments. </p>
<p>An action-oriented framework is laid out in the roadmap, which commits the FSB and GLEIF to collaborate in consultation with other prominent stakeholders to: “explore the scope for, and obstacles to develop, a global Unique Identifier (UI) for cross border payments and potentially other financial transactions, that takes into account existing identifiers including the LEI for legal entities….” This collaborative work effort is scheduled to run from October 2020 until December 2021 and GLEIF welcomes the opportunity to engage with it.</p>
<p>Additionally, as a further action mapped to the same ‘Establishing Unique Identifiers…’ building block, GLEIF will work in close coordination with the FSB, the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) and national authorities to explore options for improving LEI adoption. This work effort will run from June 2021 to June 2022.</p>
<p>Reassuringly, the FSB roadmap makes the association between an enhanced payments ecosystem and legal entity identification. For cross-border payments, the ability for identity verification to happen across borders is critical and this is why the LEI is perfectly poised to provide a solution. Its universality makes it the perfect candidate for bestowing transparency in relation to entity identification across the global payments landscape.  </p>
<p>Consultation: Instant Payments </p>
<p>In March 2021, the European Commission (EC) published its Consultation Strategy on Instant Payments in the EU. The purpose of the consultation is to identify obstacles to the creation of efficient pan-European instant payment solutions, to assess the effectiveness of potential solutions and to measure the potential benefits and costs of those solutions. The first part of this consultation involves surveying payment service providers (PSPs) and providers of supporting technical services. Of relevance to the LEI are the questions regarding sanctions screening. The survey asks whether there is a need for alleviated screening of transactions by PSPs involving clients vetted or whitelisted beforehand, or if a common EU-wide list of false hits and/or the use of the LEI for firms and digital IDs for individuals could solve any sanctions screening-related issue that instant payments may create. </p>
<p>GLEIF welcomes the EC’s consideration of the LEI as a potential solution to support the screening of instant payment transactions against sanction and watch lists and has a keen interest in the outcome of the survey. </p>
<p>The ‘LEI Lightbulb Blog Series’ from GLEIF aims to shine a light on the breadth of acceptance and advocacy for the LEI across the public and private sectors, geographies and use cases by highlighting which industry leaders, authorities and organizations are supportive of the LEI and for what purpose. By demonstrating how success derived from strong regulatory roots is giving rise to a ground swell of champions for further LEI regulation and voluntary LEI adoption across new and emerging applications, GLEIF hopes to educate on both the current and future potential value that ‘one global identity’ can deliver for businesses, regardless of sector, world-wide. </p>

<p>By Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CMO, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Leaders from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and IBM met with President Joe Biden at the White House last week to discuss strategies the government and private sector can use together to improve the nation’s cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the meeting, Amazon announced that it will provide eligible AWS customers with access to free FIDO Security Keys. Not only will this protect the burgeoning number of businesses that run on AWS, but it will help instill better authentication practices as these keys can be used across many other business (e.g., G Suite, Github, Dropbox, Stripe) and consumer (Facebook, Twitter, Coinbase, Bank of America) services.</p>



<p>Amazon has been a leading stakeholder in FIDO Alliance for several years now – it is wonderful to see their leadership extended to the market at large. As more businesses move to the cloud, it is absolutely critical that cloud service providers follow suit to protect this critical infrastructure. Threats and attackers are growing in sophistication, and the impacts are non-trivial. Hundreds of millions of personal records are being stolen and resold on the dark web on an alarmingly regular basis. This is a clear and present threat to our economy, our national security and our society.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to name a breach from the past five years that wasn’t tied to stolen credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest prominent attack, which was carried out on Colonial Pipeline, used <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/colonial-pipeline-ceo-tells-senate-cyber-defenses-were-compromised-ahead-hack-2021-06-08/">a single stolen password</a> to essentially cripple the U.S eastern seaboard.</p>



<p>It is important that all businesses take steps to educate and protect their employees and customers from such threats. “Traditional” means of multi-factor authentication (such as OTPs) simply aren’t fit-for-purpose to protect against these attacks, which can financially cripple a company or organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, credential-based breaches (like Colonial Pipeline’s) wouldn’t be possible if accounts were protected with FIDO Authentication, which requires local possession of a device with no knowledge-based authentication credentials passed over the network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance has come a long way since our inception. What started as a whiteboard concept has evolved into technology that is becoming part of the web’s DNA. Virtually every platform and device can now support FIDO Authentication, and there are public SDKs and tools, plus a rich ecosystem of FIDO Certified vendor products and services that can help companies implement FIDO for their sites and apps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amazon’s move to provide free FIDO Security Keys sets a strong – and important – example. We encourage all other cloud service providers to urgently consider following suit by at a minimum enabling FIDO authenticators for admin access to networks.</p>

<p>Early this month we were hosted by our good friends at <a href="https://www.marsh.com/nz/home.html?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">Marsh New Zealand</a> to run a joint Connect event with <a href="https://fintechnz.org.nz/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">FinTechNZ</a> on Digital and Cyber Risk.&nbsp; Overall, we see cyber security as one of three key elements, alongside identity and privacy which in combination make up Digital Trust – providing the confidence needed for people, technology and processes to create a truly safe and effective digital world. &nbsp;</p>



  
<p>The world has seen an unprecedented rise in cyber security incidents since the beginning of 2020 – a trend which is shaking up everything we thought we knew about prevention and management of this insidious risk.</p>
  



<p>We had four insightful presentations, given by Jono Soo (<a href="https://www.marsh.com/nz/services/cyber-risk.html?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">Marsh NZ</a>), Jonathon Berry (<a href="https://www.inphysecsecurity.com/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">InPhySec</a>), Andy Prow (<a href="https://www.redshield.co/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">Red Shield</a>) and Paul Platen (<a href="https://www.sss.co.nz/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">SSS</a>) which provided a deep-dive into what has been going on in the world of cyber security and insurance over the past 12 months, how this has impacted on businesses in all sectors both globally as well as in New Zealand, and what we might expect looking forward.</p>



<p>Their presentations can be found <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2021/08/Digital-and-Cyber-Risk-Beyond-2020.pdf?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">here.</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>The key take homes for me were:</p>



<p>More human interactivity now happens at the digital layer rather than the human layer (according to the CIA!) The frequency and severity of ransomware attacks continues to climb, therefore cyber security insurance premiums are going up quickly too and are going to be tougher to acquire. <a href="https://www.cert.govt.nz/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">CERT NZ</a> is a great place to get a whole host of cyber security info.&nbsp; However, when NZ CERT was set up it was given a budget of only $22m for 4 years. The NZ Defense Force spends around 4bn per annum i.e. the comparison between what is spent to protect ourselves physically vs what is spent to protect us digitally is stark. We need to take the protection of the digital realm much, much more seriously and orders of magnitude and more resources need to be focused here. &nbsp; </p>

<p>Hi. My name is Anne Hilliger and I am the new intern at <a href="http://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a>. Not only am I new but also the first ever intern at WAO which means I’m also their guinea pig for a possible future intern&nbsp;program.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@solomac?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Adam Solomon</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hello?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>As a little taste of what makes me me here are some randomly collected facts about me: I am crazy for bike riding (nice gravel rides with coffee breaks and a good amount of icecream are just the best), the first half of this year I spend living and studying in Lapland in the same town where also Santa lives (Rovaniemi and yes I met him, twice), I live in a flat with 5 other adults and two incredibly cute kids (not mine though), I am definitely a cat person and if somebody would give me a basket full of kitties I would happily say&nbsp;yes.</p><p>I am studying cultural and media education at a small university in central/eastern Germany called <a href="https://www.hs-merseburg.de/">Hochschule Merseburg</a>. In the current semester it is time to do your mandatory internship and like my last name might tell, I know Laura Hilliger and have always been very interested in what she tells me about her work. Therefore I thought this internship might be a perfect opportunity to learn more about what WAO is doing, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/about-us/">who her colleagues are</a> and what it is like to work on projects with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Another incentive that made me want to work with WAO is that my curriculum at the university is rather focused on teaching kids and teenagers, mostly in face to face, school or kindergarten settings. This is also fun and interesting but in my world media education is even more than that. To have the opportunity to work with people who are specialized in teaching and learning in mostly online environments, who developed interesting and innovative tools and who know how to work with companies, charities or other collaborators, is going to teach me so many cool things! I am really looking forward to&nbsp;that.</p>one project I worked at in 2016: creating a virtual dinosaur museum in minecraft (CC BY-NC-SA&nbsp;4.0)<p>After receiving a very warm welcome I am now in my fourth week already, the onboarding is in full speed and I am learning a lot about the projects, the processes and of course the philosophy of openness. I worked myself through the email courses they developed (<a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/">please go and check them out if you haven’t, they are great!</a>), and I got particularly caught up with the topic of working openly because this is something I never really did before and it is as exciting as it is challenging.</p><p>I am coming from an understanding of work that is very conservative and heteronormative due to the capitalistic structures I grew up in. Therefore I find it challenging to actually pursue the approach of openness. In theory I understand the principles, but what does it actually mean? You have to unlearn quite some patterns. I for example noticed that in order to ask questions not only to Laura (who is a confidant) but into the channel where everybody from the Co-op can read it, I have to jump over my own shadow a lot (a German expression that means to overcome yourself). I am still thinking in the pattern of “Am I allowed to do that?”, “Aren’t the others too important/busy to listen to what I have to say?”, “I am only the intern”. I am really looking forward to jumping over my own shadow for this more often and starting to integrate the philosophy of openness into my understanding of how work can also be&nbsp;like.</p>And this is me, very much frozen in Lapland (CC BY-NC-SA&nbsp;4.0) <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/hello-world-6b5c8caed8db">Hello world!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation announced recently a new mechanism for rewarding and funding work in the common interest of its membership, the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/introducing-dif-grants/">DIF Grants Program</a>. The Steering Committee ratified an addendum defining these collaborations between a specific DIF working group and a grant sponsor, and this shiny new tool sits ready to be debuted in the toolkit available to DIF community work. DIF’s work is leveling up with this new mechanism for transparently funding work that supports DIF’s mission and benefits the membership as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>The first such grant was initiated by Microsoft, which has a long history of collaborations in DIF. Of the various modalities described by the grant program, The Claims and Credentials Working Group will be overseeing a new work item open to all DIF members that creates and harden a JWS test suite, with this grant funding a lead editor to drive the work and keep it to a pre-determined timeline, paid upon stable and complete&nbsp;release.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@natasyachen">Natasya&nbsp;Chen</a> History <p>Pamela Dingle, co-chair of the Interoperability WG, identified a recurring theme in conversations about interoperability across the great “JSON”/”JSON-LD” divide: while considerable cross-vendor, cross-stack alignment had happened over the last years to address many other aspects of credential exchange and identifier resolution, “translation issues” and varying interpretations of the JSON sections of the VC data model specification lead to divergent ways of structuring, defining, signing, and parsing VCs in JWT form. The kinds of signature suite definitions that define Linked Data Proofs made strange bedfellows with the in-built mechanisms of JWT, which were hardened and commoditized earlier. This results in a slightly “balkanized” landscape of VC-JWTs that make different concessions to the expectations of JSON-LD-native parsers and&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Initially, the idea of iterating one or more foundational specifications seemed a natural solution: a few key sections of any specification could be made more explicit, more normative, or less ambiguous. But just as the plural of anecdote is not data, so too is the plural of specifications not disambiguation. Another tack was chosen: implementers of the existing specification would come together and compare their running code to identify every difference and incompatibility, defining a test suite that interpreted the current specification. They might still produce a list of changes they would like to see in a future specification, and that list might contain some contentious items that take a long time to align. But in the meantime, they would have a practical roadmap to alignment and a benchmark for conformance to drive interoperability amongst each other and clarity for external interoperability.</p> A signature suite that spans two&nbsp;worlds <p>The specification under test in this new work item is <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">Json Web Signature 2020 </a>(“JWS2020” for short), a CCG signature suite that defines how the signature mechanisms and data structures native to “detached signature” JWS tokens can be parsed as <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a>. The signature mechanisms of the <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/jwt-jws-and-jwe-for-not-so-dummies-b63310d201a3">JWT world</a> and the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Feb/att-0130/VerifiableTrustStandards.png">LDP world</a> are quite different– bridging them requires a deep understanding of both: differing security models, canonization and serialization complexities, explicit reliance on <a href="https://www.iana.org/protocols">IANA registries</a>, <a href="https://json-ld.github.io/rdf-dataset-canonicalization/spec/">URDNA dataset normalization</a>, and the like. Advanced topics, even for this&nbsp;blog!</p><p>Understanding such a specification on a deep intellectual level and understanding its design decisions requires a firm grasp on all these complexities spanning two very different engineering traditions. Implementing the specification, however, should not; to be blunt, our community cannot afford such understanding gating off successful implementation, particularly if industrial adoption of decentralized identity is a shared goal. Before the specification gets iterated, it needs to be testable, and even more implementable than it already&nbsp;is.</p><p>This is where a test suite offers pedagogical tool for first-time implementers, as well as a negotiation tool for seasoned veterans and large corporations managing vast roadmaps and production development pipelines. While many DIF members do not encode VCs in JWT form, this grant is clearly in the common interest because mainstream adoption will indisputably benefit from a clearer, more explicitly-defined, and definitively-testable “normative VC-JWT”.</p> Selection Process <p>From 26 July 2021 to 9 August 2021, the chairs fielded applications through a google <a href="https://forms.gle/hPCNWaAQZpLFZyXd7">form</a>, and submitted all valid application to <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials/tree/main/grants/grant_1/applications">github</a> for posterity. The selection criteria for the work item lead is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  familiarity with JWS mechanics and common JOSE libraries/best-practices  experience with automated testing, vector design, and test scripts/suites  familiarity with LD Proofs and signature suites generally  familiarity with JSON/JSON-LD interop problems, at the semantic, signature-verification, and representation/parsing levels   Grantee Announcement <p>On 12 August 2021, The Claims &amp; Credential (C&amp;C) Working Group at DIF gladly announced Transmute Industries as the recipient of the first DIF Grant to provide a JWS Test Suite for Verifiable Credentials. One of the chairs, Martin Riedel, summarized the chairs’ decision thusly:Transmute has been a thought leader in the SSI space for years and uniquely fits the requirement profile laid out in the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/dif-grant-1-jws-test-suite/">Grant announcement</a>.</p>  Orie Steele, the CTO of Transmute, is the initiating author of, lead editor of, and main contributor to <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">the (LD-) JSON Web Signature 2020</a>.  Transmute has a strong background in TDD and is a strong proponent of delivering test vectors with specifications in order to achieve greater implementation-level interoperability. Examples include Test Vectors in <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/sidetree.js/tree/main/packages/test-vectors">Sidetree.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/did-key.js/tree/main/packages/did-key-test-vectors">did-key.js</a>.  The company already provides integrated libraries to support (LDS)-VC and JWT-VC side-by-side, demonstrating their familiarity with both representations. See&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/verifiable-data/blob/c61c2eeff859a902cfbaf375424b3b5cfa519ea6/packages/vc.js/README.md">vc.js</a>.  Lastly, Transmute has a strong track record of making specifications and libraries accessible to the general public in a variety of deployed web-projects (<a href="https://did.key.transmute.industries/">https://did.key.transmute.industries/</a>, <a href="https://wallet.interop.transmute.world/">https://wallet.interop.transmute.world/</a> and&nbsp;others…)  <p>Therefore we regard Transmute Industries as the ideal candidate to provide a comprehensive JWS test suite for LDS-VC and JWT-VC and support the community interactions around this project within DIF’s C&amp;C&nbsp;Group.</p> Next Steps <p>The new work item will be announced and regular meetings initiated at the 23 August meeting of C&amp;C– if you are interested in participating, please attend and/or drop a note in the C&amp;C slack&nbsp;channel.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-grant-1-jws-test-suite-a26cc4a95540">DIF Grant #1: JWS Test Suite</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>NFTs let anyone proveably own a unique digital property. This technology is revolutionizing <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/dapper-labs-nba-top-shot-has-crossed-the-million-user-mark">collectibles</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million">digital art</a>, <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/to-infinity-and-beyond-the-growth-of-axie-infinity/">gaming</a>, <a href="https://ff.mirror.xyz/3FKwvkwAPltEdhe4pWnL8RX7TNruwNNZcFAqNn92tUs">media</a>, and even <a href="https://twitter.com/paulkhls/status/1427724533713326082">science</a>. However, to date, the type of property that could be managed through NFTs has been limited to constant, static, hardcoded properties. This is great for art, collectibles, and other use cases where immutability is a feature. </p><p>Most types of property benefit from evolution, mutability, or gamification. Together, Ceramic and Chainlink give creators the tools to create more dynamic NFT experiences. Ceramic allows for hosting more flexible forms of content, while Chainlink can supply external inputs that change and gamify NFTs, creating what’s called dynamic NFTs. </p><p>With these new tools, NFT-based experiences can expand to include:</p>  Evolving art and collectibles, changed by the original creator, current owner, or new data like the weather  Collectible packs of NFTs with special edition traits randomly chosen upon opening  Property that gains value from each owner depending on how they use it, like an in-game item that keeps its own history of how it’s used in gameplay  Ownership rights that let the current NFT holder change the content associated to the NFT, for example for land parcels in AR, VR, or games  <p>“When you buy a physical piece of land, the house doesn’t disappear. There’s a foundation there,” says Geo Web founder Graven Prest. “We need to replicate that for NFTs in the digital world.”</p><p>CERAMIC is a sovereign data network for creating, storing and sharing data under the direct control of any identity. Because data in Ceramic is mutable, and only by the controller of that data object, it provides not only a fully decentralized option to store NFT content and metadata but the first way to attach dynamic content to an NFT, with strict permissions and access control rights. Because Ceramic has a cross-chain identity system built-in, this can be deployed easily for any blockchain. </p><p>There are two ways to use this in NFT experiences. First, Ceramic streams can be updated only by the original creator. This would let artists sell NFTs and then update and enhance their work over time. The history is preserved, so this mutability is purely a gain. Athletes could sell NFTs that evolve as their stats do. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork/status/1428371493407371265">NFT:DID</a>, a recently released feature in Ceramic, allows the current owner of an NFT exclusive rights to update content. For example, Geo Web is using Ceramic to store content displayed in their AR metaverse. The owner of each parcel of land, represented by an NFT, can change the content being displayed. This could be used for owner-only logbooks, storing critical metadata or permissions, profile pics with changeable attire, collective playlist creation, or more. &nbsp;</p><p>CHAINLINK provides more dynamic ownership models for NFT experiences based on reliable external data feeds and trust-minimized off-chain computations. Most notably, Chainlink <a href="https://chain.link/solutions/chainlink-vrf">Verifiable Random Function (VRF)</a> generates a tamper-proof and auditable source of randomness, which users can reference to offer fair drops of limited edition NFTs, evolve NFTs over time via pure entropy, and retain rarity odds in NFT distribution models.</p><p>Given the historical security and reliability of Chainlink VRF, we recommend that any developer launching NFTs on Ceramic and needing randomness to use Chainlink VRF. Ultimately, this will help them create a more exciting, transparent, and fraud-proof user experience, as well as help gamify NFTs by enabling them to change over time.</p> <p>About Chainlink</p><p>Chainlink is the industry standard oracle network for powering hybrid smart contracts. Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Networks provide developers with the largest collection of high-quality data sources and secure off-chain computations to expand the capabilities of smart contracts on any blockchain. Managed by a global, decentralized community, Chainlink currently secures billions of dollars in value for smart contracts across decentralized finance (DeFi), insurance, gaming, and other major industries.<br></p><p>Chainlink is trusted by hundreds of organizations, from global enterprises to projects at the forefront of the blockchain economy, to deliver definitive truth via secure, reliable oracle networks.

<p>Thanks to Billy Leudtke of <a href="https://www.layer0.ventures/">Layer 0 Ventures</a> for drafting this article. </p><p>The Convo Space is giving Web3 developers an easy way to add comments, content and conversations to their decentralized applications. Now live on Ceramic mainnet, The Convo Space enables content from across applications to be linked to an user’s unique decentralized identity to create a shared, decentralized layer for Web3 conversations. The easy-to-use API abstracts away the complexity of Web3, paving the way for the defragmentation &amp; democratization of the ‘conversation’ layer of the internet.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://theconvo.space/">https://theconvo.space/</a> and get started today!</p> Fragmented social context <p>Today, our conversations are fragmented across applications and platforms. Threads of conversation we have with our friends, family, coworkers and peers flow unconnected across a plethora of mediums such as text message, WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Facebook, Instagram and others, and each context of interaction is tied to a different one of our many application-specific digital identities.</p><p>These silos destroy our continuity online, forcing us to:</p>  Rediscover and reconnect with contacts on each new platform  Carry conversations across platforms, eliminating context  Choose applications based on access to our social graph, rather than purely for the product itself  Relinquish control of our data, including the value it generates  Trust platforms to protect our privacy   <p>Platforms don’t talk, people do. Web3 promises an alternative model, with data, identity and reputation separated from individual applications and easily shared across platforms. This information is always controlled by the users, so they can bring reputation and data along when moving to different applications and interfaces, instead of starting from scratch.</p> The Convo Space: de-platformed conversations <p>The Convo Space is a decentralized conversation protocol with data separated from the application/interface, allowing a unified conversation layer that can work across applications and solve the fragmentation issue. Through this separation, conversations can continue to be generated organically on the incumbent platforms, while The Convo Space unifies that content from across platforms to create a cohesive conversation for the user. &nbsp;</p><p>The team’s first product is a commenting solution similar to a decentralized Disqus. The developer product offers three ways to integrate:</p>  A 1-line integration that embeds an i-frame for an out-of-the-box comments section that can be added to any website  React components to let developers customize their own decentralized comments product  APIs to build a fully custom social experience, without having to worry about all the complexities of Web3  <p>Developers can easily leverage any of the above methods to begin building on the decentralized conversation layer of the internet. And because all the data on The Convo Space is associated with users rather than applications, any application can build on the same conversation graph and content.</p> Built on decentralized content, organized around decentralized identities &nbsp; <p>The Convo Space is intended to be fully decentralized, making sure this key social infrastructure is not confined to, or controlled by, any single app or platform. The solution pulls together the latest decentralized technologies to achieve this, including Ceramic, IPFS, Textile, Pinata, and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). </p><p>Comments are stored in ThreadsDB databases, built by Textile. This content is made available through Pinata’s IPFS-pinning service and backed up to Filecoin to ensure fully decentralized availability and redundancy. </p><p>To complete the solution, the product needed to associate the comment threads with users and give them control of their content. For this, they turned to Ceramic. IDX, the decentralized identity protocol built with Ceramic, gives The Convo Space an easy way to link multiple addresses and disparate digital identities into a single user identity. </p><p>This open, unified data network lays the foundation for rich identities that can be used across platforms. IDX also provides an easy way to associate specific comment threads with a user directly. Says Anudit Nagar, founder of The Convo Space: </p><blockquote>Ceramic truly allows your data to flow and aggregate across multiple different chains - it's truly a one-stop solution for all your storage and access needs, in a truly decentralized manner. That is really future proof.</blockquote><p>The platform lets users aggregate all their social conversations into a single place, under a single identity. This lets developers focus on building new and amazing user experiences and worry less about data management. For users, this means conversational data will never be lost or trapped, locking you into a platform because your contacts and ongoing conversations are there. This bridge between Web2 to Web3 enables users to leverage their existing social communities to create more seamless and flexible experiences. </p> What’s Next for The Convo Space? <p>Today’s solution is just the first step towards an unbundled conversation layer for Web3. &nbsp;The team is actively working on rolling out new features to further improve user engagement and experience. Decentralized governance of the protocol is also in the works, which will allow the community to eventually manage itself and set up standards for content moderation, among other things. The team is also working on a <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> Snap which will allow conversations to live natively in a Metamask wallet.</p><p>The Convo Space is currently onboarding NFT marketplaces, DAO aggregation platforms and others to begin opening the commenting layer of the Web.

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director</p>



<p>Editor’s Note: This is the second blog covering the FIDO Developer Challenge.&nbsp; To learn more about the background and process, please read the earlier blog post, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/announcing-the-fido-developer-challenge-for-developers-across-the-globe/">Announcing the FIDO Developer Challenge for Developers Across the Globe</a>.</p>



<p>We are happy to announce that 14 teams from eight different countries (the U.S., Japan, Canada, France, India, Malaysia, Vietnam, and South Korea) have been invited to participate in the implementation stage of the 2021 FIDO Developer Challenge.  Six of the teams are early-stage ventures and an equal number hail from academia; the other two are individual developers.</p>



  



<p>[Faces of participants, captured during online interviews in late July]</p>



<p>All of the teams share a commitment to using FIDO authentication to provide a smoother and more secure user experience across a variety of application areas.  As was the case in our earlier Hackathons, we are seeing yet again that the mix of entrepreneurial vision coupled with the capabilities of FIDO Authentication can be realized in a wide array of use cases and industries.  We will share more details on each of the submissions as the review process carries forward.</p>



<p>The teams are now engaged in designated virtual lounges for possible Q&amp;As and support from the Developer Challenge sponsors and broader FIDO development community.&nbsp; To that end, we would like to recognize and give special thanks to the W3C WebAuthn Adoption Community Group for managing the private Discord Channel to provide technical support for participating teams.</p>



<p>Implementations will be done by the end of August and the judges will evaluate the teams’ final presentations and demos by early September.&nbsp; Please stay tuned for our announcement of the Top 3 by the middle of September – with the winner being announced at the Authenticate conference in Seattle on October 20.</p>

<p>Developers building multi-chain applications have a powerful new combination to work with, as Ceramic supports Polygon applications. &nbsp;Polygon offers developers a massively scalable, EVM-compatible blockchain infrastructure. Ceramic adds support for advanced data management and cross-chain identity. </p><p>Together, this enables developers and users to depend on the same accounts and wallets to manage transactions, identities, and data across their applications. Get started <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network">building today</a>. </p> A full stack for cross-chain applications <p>Since Polygon uses the same keypairs and wallets as Ethereum, and Ceramic’s identity system can be managed by Ethereum wallets, signing and<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/#currently-supported-blockchains"> </a>authentication for Ceramic's data streams is supported out of the box for Polygon applications. </p><p>Now that Polygon and Ceramic can easily be used together, developers can:</p>  Build data-rich user experiences and social features on fully decentralized tech  Give users cloud-like backup, sync and recovery without running a centralized server  Publish content on the open web without the need to anchor IPFS hashes on-chain  Leverage interoperable profiles, social graphs and reputations across the Web3 ecosystem  <p>Users can now perform transactions on Ceramic and Polygon with their existing wallets. For example, users of <a href="https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/ideation">Boardroom’s DAO governance platform</a> can participate in ideation forums and discussions with all content stored on Ceramic and managed by their decentralized identity.</p> Getting started with Ceramic and Polygon   To get started on Polygon visit their <a href="https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/getting-started">documentation site</a>  To add IDX to your project, follow this<a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>  To use Ceramic for streams without IDX, follow this<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>.

 DIF "Frequently Asked Questions" Knowledgebase 
<p>DIF has launched a massive <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/">knowledgebase</a>, structured as a long series of frequently-asked questions and answers. This synthesizes a year of educational efforts in the interop WG, blog posts, newsletters, and many other DIF inputs in a format we hope will be useful as a reference and onboarding document throughout the decentralized identity space.  Please peruse it, particularly the sections about your personal research focus and/or your company's specialty and products, opening issues or PRs on github wherever you feel a correction or addition is needed.  This is intended as a community resource, so PRs are open to your input!</p>
 🍾 DIF Welcomes Chris Kelly at Comms 
<p>Hello and greetings to all! I am delighted to introduce myself as DIF's new communications director. I am originally from Dublin, Ireland, and home is now Berlin, Germany. I'm excited to get involved at DIF, support members in their documentation efforts and bring the decentralised identity conversation to a wider audience. I've spent time in the advertising and non-profit sectors, as a video producer, a sysadmin, and I cohost a comedy drag talkshow on YouTube. At DIF I'll be working on things like promoting our blog and managing our social media channels, and I have some exciting ideas in store.<br>
Visit my drop-in office hours Tuesdays at 8pm CET (11am PT, 2pm EST) for a chat, or reach out to me directly via Slack or <a href="mailto:chris@identity.foundation">email</a>.<br>
I am always happy to hear your feedback and ideas for articles and initiatives!</p>

 Report from the OIDF Working Groups with David Waite and Kristina Yasuda.
 
 Discussion about identity history, SIOP, WebAuthN, NFC support.
 
 history of the past 12 years in identity world
 
 OAuth1, Oauth2, Keybase etc. 
 
 
 "Different kind of trust, can anchor with more sources of identity." 
 With SIOP, you do self-generated and pairwise keys - ephemeral, not rooted to anything. 
 one of reasons I think that "Sign in with Google" is so attractive is that I expect their Google account to outlast my account - so I don't have to do recovery. 
 OIDF is interested in using VP as recovery scheme (e.g. drivers license).
 
 If shared during registration, becomes source of registration for recovery. 
 repairing a damaged trust relationship is very time-, cost- and labor-intensive for a company. Using VP can help reestablish the trust relationship, spares asking secret questions, extra data eg. Mom's name, pets etc.

 Main piece left in OIDC4VP is how to use DIF PE as a query language. There are few outstanding issues in DIF PE GitHub that will be discussed on a call on 4th Aug - join us if interested 
 SIOP V2 (previously known as did-siop) is also making progress. Big discussion happening now is how to secure and perform origin verification in a cross-device flow where verifier and the user wallet are on the different devices. 
 Credential Provider draft is in the process of being integrated into the Claims Aggregation draft to define how VCs can be issues from the OpenID Identity Provider

<p>Having shown in our last piece how interoperability “profiles” are designed, we now tackle some key technical problem areas ripe for this kind of profile-first interoperability work across&nbsp;stacks.</p><p>In our <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/setting-interoperability-targets/">last essay</a>, we explored the means and ends of interoperability targets and roadmapping across stacks and markets. “Interoperability,” like “standardization,” can be a general-purpose tool or an umbrella of concepts, but rarely works from the top-down. Instead, specific use-cases, consortia, contexts, and industries have to take the lead and prototype something more humble and specific like an “interoperability profile” — over time, these propagate, get extended, get generalized, and congeal into a more universal and stable standard. Now, we’ll move on to some technical problem areas ripe for this kind of profile-first interoperability work across&nbsp;stacks.</p><p>&gt; What makes sense to start aligning now? What are some sensible scopes for interoperating today, or yesterday, to get our fledgling market to maturity and stability as soon as safely possible?</p>Ponte Vecchio, Fiorenze, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/GHoX7zFRMMU">Ray Harrington</a> From testable goals to discrete&nbsp;scopes <p>The last few months have seen a shift in terminology and approach, as many groups turn their attention from broad “interoperability testing” to more focused “profiles” that test one subset of the optionalities and capabilities in a larger test suite or protocol definition. This decoupling of test suites from multiple profiles each suite can test helps any one profile from ossifying into a “universal” definition of decentralized identity’s core featureset.</p><p>As with any other emerging software field, every use case and context has its own interoperability priorities and constraints that narrow down the technological solution space into a manageable set of tradeoffs and decisions. For instance, end-user identification at various levels of assurance is often the most important implementation detail for, say, a retail bank, and DID-interoperability (which is not always the same thing!) might be a hardware manufacturer’s primary concern in being able to secure hardware supply&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Every industry has its unique set of minimum security guarantees, and VC-interoperability is obviously front-of-mind for credentialing use-cases. For example, in the medical data space, “Semantics” (data interpretation and metadata) might be a harder problem (or a more political one) than the mechanics of identity assurance, since high standards of end-user privacy and identity assurance have already made for a relatively interoperable starting points. Which exact subset of the many possible interoperability roadmaps is safest or most mission-critical for a given organization depends on many factors: the regulatory context, the culture of the relevant sectors, its incentive-structures, and its <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">business&nbsp;models</a>.</p><p>Cross-cutting industry verticals, however, are structural issues with how decentralized identity stacks and architecture vary, which can already been seen today. By applying “first principles,” (or in our case, the “<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md">functions</a>” of a decentralized identity system and its many moving parts) across use-cases and industrial contexts, certain shared problems arise. As is our default approach in DIF Interop WG, we applied DIF’s in-house <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/raw/master/assets/interop-mapping-version-by-Hakan-Yildiz(TUB).pdf">mental model</a> of the “5 layers” of decentralized identity systems, sometimes called “the 4+1 layers”. (See also the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io/raw/master/assets/crosscommunity-architecture-survey-oct-2020.pdf">more detailed version</a>).</p><p>We call these the “4+1” layers because our group agreed that a strict layering was not possible, and that all the architectures we compared for using verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers had to make major architectural decisions with consequences across all four of the more properly “layered” categories. This fifth category we named “transversal considerations,” since they traverse the layers and often come from architectural constraints imposed by regulation, industrial context, etc. Foremost among these are storage and authorization, the two most vexing and cross-cutting problems in software generally; these would justify an entirely separate&nbsp;article.</p><p>In a sense, none of the topics from this transversal category are good candidates for specification in the medium-term across verticals and communities — they are simply too big as problems, rarely specific to identity issues, and being addressed elsewhere. These include “storage” (subject of our newest <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working group</a>), “authorization” (debatably the core problem of all computer science!), “cryptographic primitives”, and “compliance.” (These last two are each the subject of a new working group, <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/crypto.html">Applied Cryptography</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/wallet-security.html">Wallet Security</a>!). These interoperability scopes are quite difficult to tackle quickly, or without a strong standards background. Indeed, these kinds of foundational changes require <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">incremental advances</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093">broad cooperation</a> with large community organizations. This is slow, foundation work that needs to connect parallel work across data governance, authentication/authorization, and storage in software more generally.</p><p>Similarly, the fourth layer, where ecosystem-, platform-, and industry-specific considerations constrain application design and business models, is unlikely to crystallize into a problem space calling out for a single specification or prototype in the medium-term future. Here, markets are splintered and it is unclear what can be repurposed or recycled outside of its original context. Even if there were cases where specification at this later would be timely, DIF members might well choose to discuss those kinds of governance issues at our sister-organizations in the space that more centrally address data governance at industry-, ecosystem-, or national- scale: <a href="http://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP</a> was chartered to design large-scale governance processes, and older organizations like <a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData.org</a> and the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> also have working groups and publications on vertical-specific and jurisdiction-specific best practices for picking interoperable protocols and data&nbsp;formats.</p><p>That still leaves three “layers”, each of which has its own interoperability challenges that seem most urgent. It is our contention that each of these could be worked on in parallel and independently of the other two to help arrive at a more interoperable community — and we will be trying to book presentation and discussion guests in the coming months to advance all&nbsp;three.</p> Scope #1: Verifiable Credential Exchange <p>The most clear and consensus-building, even urgent way forward is to bring clarity to Verifiable Credential exchange across stacks. This has been the primary focus of our WG for the last year. Given that most of the early ecosystem-scale interest in SSI revolves around <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/#vc-infrastructure-layer-3">credentialing</a> (educational credentials, employment credentials, health records), it is highly strategic to get translation and unified protocols into place soon for the interoperable verification and cross-issuance of credentials.</p><p>In fact, there has actually been a lot of good progress made since Daniel Hardman wrote an <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/getting-to-practical-interop-with-verifiable-credentials/">essay</a> on the Evernym blog making a pragmatic case for sidestepping differences in architecture and approach to exchange VCs sooner. This aligned with much of our group’s work in recent months, which has included a <a href="https://hackmd.io/t1cotiReTXCnkpDG8k2tVA#THE-MAIN-EVENT">survey of VC formats</a> among organizations producing “wallets” for verifiable credentials (be they “edge” wallets or otherwise). Our group has also sought to <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8j6niRuFWTjVMIXqmw3zX-4KkLt-sli8">assist educational efforts</a> at the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>, in the Claims and Credentials <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">working group</a>, and elsewhere to make wallet-producing organizations aware of the relevant <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/vc-spec-map">specifications</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/dif/be6763341a014d248f655aea187d7890?v=c9ac48a07f3d411c9a1bea32b55f7e76">other references</a> needed to make their wallets multi-format sooner and less painfully. Much of this work was crystalized into an <a href="https://www.lfph.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Verifiable-Credentials-Flavors-Explained.pdf">article</a> by co-chair Kaliya Young and crowd-edited by the whole group; this work was a major guiding structure for the Good Health Pass work that sought to make a common health record format (exported from FHIR systems) equally holdable and presentable across all of today’s VC&nbsp;systems.</p><p>One outgrowth of this effort and other alignments that have taken place since Hardman’s and Young’s article is the work of prototyping a multi-community exchange protocol that allow a subset of each stack’s capabilities and modes to interoperate. This tentative, “minimum viable profile” is called <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-presentation-exchange">WACI-PEx</a> and is currently a work item of the Claims and Credentials working group. Work is ongoing on v0.1, and an ambitious, more fully-featured v1 is planned for after that. This profile acts as an “extension” of the broader Presentation Exchange protocol, giving a handy “cheat sheet” for cross-stack wallet-to-issuer/verifier handshakes so that developers not familiar with all the stacks and protocols being spanned have a starting point for VC exchanges. Crucially, the results of this collaborative prototype will be taken as inputs to future versions of the DIDComm protocols and the WACI specification for Presentation Exchange.</p><p>Note: There has been some discussion of a OIDC-Presentation Exchange profile at some point in the future, but given that the alignment of DIDComm and Presentation Exchange started over a year ago, the most likely outcome is that work on this would not start until after v1 has been released of the “WACI-PEx” profile for DIDComm has been released.</p> Scope #2: Anchoring layer <p>Of course, other forms of alignment are possible as well in the “bottom 3” layers of the traditional stack, while we wait on the ambitious transversal alignment specifications and the ongoing work to align and simplify cross-format support for VCs (and perhaps even multi-format VCs, as Hardman points out in the essay&nbsp;above).</p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery</a> WG at DIF has long housed many work items to align on the lowest level of stack, including general-purpose <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-common-java">common libraries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">recovery mechanisms</a>. It has also received many donations that contribute to method-level alignment, including a recent <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/trinsic-donates-did-key-rs-to-i-d-wg-8a278f37bcd0?source=friends_link&amp;sk=dbd175f5db9107ed1e9d953a386441a4">DID-Key implementation</a> and a linked-data <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-document-loader">document loader</a> donated by Transmute. The group has also served as a friendly gathering point for discussing calls for input from the DID-core working group at W3C and for proposing W3C-CCG work&nbsp;items.</p><p>One particularly noteworthy initiative of the group has been the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540?source=friends_link&amp;sk=306a37f289dcf61a89d19cd11f5be04e">Universal Resolver</a> project, which offers a kind of “trusted middleware” approach to DID resolution across methods. This prototype of a general-use server allows any SSI system (or non-SSI system) to submit a DID and get back a trustworthy DID Document, without needing any knowledge of or access to (much less current knowledge of or authenticated access to) the “black box” of the participating DID methods. While this project only extends “passive interoperability” to DIDs, i.e., only allowing DID document querying, a more ambitious sister project, the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">Universal Registrar</a>, strives to bring a core set of CRUD capabilities to DID documents for DID methods willing to contribute drivers. Both projects have dedicated weekly calls on the DIF calendar, for people looking to submit drivers or get otherwise involved.</p> Scope #3: “Agent”/Infrastructure Layer <p>There is another layer, however, in between DIDs and VCs, about which we haven’t spoken yet: the crucial “agent layer” in the ToIP/Aries mental model, which encompasses trusted infrastructure whether in or outside of conventional clouds. The Aries Project has scaled up an impressively mature ecosystem of companies and experimenters, largely thanks to the robust infrastructure layer it built (and abstracting away from application-layer developers and experimenters).</p><p>Until now, differences of strategy with respect to conventional clouds and infrastructures have prevented large-scale cooperation and standardization at this layer outside of Aries and the DID-Comm project. Partly, this has been a natural outgrowth of the drastically different infrastructural needs and assumptions of non-human, enterprise, and consumer-facing/individual use cases, which differ more at this level than above or below. Partly, this is a function of the economics of our sector’s short history, largely influenced by the infrastructure strategies of cloud providers and telecommunication concerns.</p><p>This is starting to change, however, now that agent frameworks inspired by the precedent set by the Aries frameworks have come into maturity.

This could mean standardization of specific components at this layer, for&nbsp;example:</p>  The DIDComm protocol could expand into new <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-looker-jwm-01.html">envelopes</a> and transports  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">Control recovery</a> mechanisms could be specified across implementations or even standardized on a technical and/or UX&nbsp;level  Auditing or historical-query requirements could be specified to form a cross-framework protocol or primitive  Common usages of foreign function interfaces, remote procedure calls like gRPC and JSON-RPC, or other forms of “glue” allowing elements to be reused or mixed and matched across languages and architectures could be specified as a community  <p>We are very much in early days, but some see on the horizon a day when frameworks that don’t cooperate with one another can’t compete with the ones that join forces. After all, adoption brings growing pains, particularly for the labor market — aligning on architectures and frameworks makes onboarding developers and transferring experience that much easier to&nbsp;do!</p> Next Steps <p>I would encourage anyone who has read this far to pick at least one of the three scopes mentioned above and ask themselves how they are helping along this alignment process in their day-to-day work, and if they truly understand what major players at that level are doing. Often large for-profit companies pay the most attention to what their competitors are doing, but here it is important to think outside of competition and look instead at non-profit organizations, regulators, and coalitions of various kinds to really see where the puck is heading. Sometimes consensus on one level is blocking compromise somewhere else. It can be pretty hard to&nbsp;follow!</p><p>In recent articles, DIF has encouraged its members to think about an open-source strategy as comparably important to a business plan, a living document and guiding philosophy. I would like to suggest that the subset of DIF companies working with VCs and DIDs should also think of interoperability strategy and conformance testing as the most crucial pillar of that strategy — if you cannot demonstrate interoperability, you might be asking people to take that strategy on&nbsp;faith!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/setting-interoperability-targets-part-2-of-2-671f8faa8ecb">Setting Interoperability Targets Part 2 of 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In the latest installment of the Lumen Researcher interview series, we spoke with Andrea Fuller, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal who specializes in data analysis. Prior to her work with the WSJ, Fuller was previously a data journalist for Gannett Digital, The Center for Public Integrity, and The Chronicle of Higher Education.</p><p>Fuller’s work combines data, spreadsheets, and code with investigative journalism and storytelling. Last May, Fuller wrote an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-dmca-copyright-claims-takedown-online-reputation-11589557001">article</a> for the Journal about her investigation into Google’s handling of DMCA takedowns. Using Lumen’s extensive database of copyright notices, Fuller exposed some of the shady copyright claims and abusive submitters that were flying under Google’s&nbsp;radar.</p><p>In this interview, Adam Holland, Project Manager at the Lumen Project, Anna Callahan and Gina Markov, Lumen’s 2021 summer interns, spoke with Fuller about her research and how the Lumen Database helped her develop her story about the bad actors in the world of DMCA takedowns.</p><p>Lumen: Could you give us a brief description of your&nbsp;bio?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: I’ve been at the Journal since 2014, so, seven years now. I’ve done tech stories, I’ve done a lot about nonprofit shenanigans, I’ve done a lot about education. So, I’m a little bit of a jack of all trades when it comes to subjects. But I mainly work on data projects at the Journal — I do spreadsheets, I do SQL, I do R, I write code, I call people and talk to them, and then I write stories. So, yeah, I do a little bit of everything.</p><p>Lumen: In 2020, you wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal about how Google approaches DMCA takedown requests. Could you give us some background about your process of researching and writing that&nbsp;piece?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: We started this article in late 2019 after it came out of some other Google reporting. We came across some of Lumen’s own blog posts and great work about the DMCA and we wanted to take this a step further. So we spent months and months downloading lots of DMCA requests from the Lumen database. We got the Lumen API key and started uploading the text of these requests and assembling our own database.</p><p>I set up a MongoDB database that we imported all these JSON files into, and we started collecting them incrementally. I actually wrote a bunch of code to turn it into a relational database so I could search them more easily. I was working in SQL. Google releases its own transparency report, which does not have all the detailed information of the text of these requests, but does say how many and which of the URLs were removed, so I was able to cross reference that.</p><p>I looked for any DMCA requests against major websites, whether they be major retail sites or news sites. It was interesting — there weren’t any successful DMCA requests from sites like The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times. What I started finding was more obscure, niche news sites — whether they be blogs or international news sites in foreign languages — [where] Google had complied with the take-down requests [it had received]. It became evident to me that Google was doing a really good job at filtering out bad takedown requests against major newspapers and major consumer sites, but not so much against more esoteric&nbsp;media.</p><p>Lumen: Do you have any speculation as to why that&nbsp;is?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: One of the things we say in our article is that the team at Google that’s in charge of DMCA is not very big. To actually manually review all of these requests is a near impossible task as the volume of DMCA requests has increased dramatically. And it’s really hard to make those judgment calls, because whether something is a real news site or not can be a really difficult determination. You get into broader philosophical discussions about the credibility of media in particular.</p><p>In one of the most compelling interviews that I had, I talked to this journalist in the Ukraine who was affiliated with an international reporting organization. He described these shady characters who will post fake copies of webpages on live journals and then file DMCA take-down requests to remove the original pages. It works, forcing them to file counterclaims, but there’s a gap before you can have it restored. So it’s a pretty effective strategy for getting content removed if you are an alleged Ukrainian gangster.</p><p>I also talked to one girl who was a blogger in Singapore, and she had a blog that was taken down through a DMCA request. She was writing letters to Google saying, “Why? I don’t understand. What did I do?” She didn’t do anything. She wrote about this Instagram influencer who was promoting a questionable sham cryptocurrency product. And that [product’s] organization created a blog post and filed a take-down request, claiming that it wrote the article first, which was laughable because it was clearly written in her voice, in her person. So, it’s really hard for people to fight these. They can definitely file counterclaims, but there is a delay in the process and then sometimes people don’t necessarily have the resources.</p><p>It’s a really tricky issue. It would take a lot of manpower to manually review all of these. Even though I was able to use queries to identify likely problematic ones, this took me a lot of time. Eventually, I sent Google about 100 things that I pretty much knew were wrong. And from that, because they have much more data than I do internally, they were able to restore something like 50,000 pages that they had taken down erroneously. And that’s just out of my one little slice of research.</p><p>Lumen: Did you see any trends in how fraudulent notices looked as you were going through&nbsp;them?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: You would see examples of things that claim to have happened earlier, but the date was something that couldn’t possibly match with the dates in the context of the piece. And it was clearly just made up. So, it was pretty self evident. I think there were a lot of really clever, yet nefarious, tactics. But once you look at some of these articles it was really blatantly obvious: We had these LiveJournals that had been hacked and were suddenly all in Russian or Ukrainian, and had all these articles about oligarchs.</p><p>In other cases, it was harder. Both of these sites in Ukrainian look kind of scammy, which is the real one and which isn’t? And it was really hard to assess that in some&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Lumen: What was the most shocking or unexpected thing that you found during your research?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: There were a couple things that I think surprised me, one being the hacking of LiveJournals. The idea that LiveJournals played such a big role was so bizarre to me. I actually, at one point, started searching for any take-down requests that were based on claiming that a LiveJournal had copyright, because that was a way I was identifying them. I think I was also pretty surprised by that story where the girl’s blog actually got taken down because it was a Google Blogger product, and that was pretty stunning to me. Not only was it not available in search, but it was just gone from the internet entirely and that was pretty troubling.</p><p>Lumen: What alternative approach do you think you would have been able to take had the notices not been available to you via Lumen? Do you think that approach would have been as effective?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: I think it would have been really difficult just going off the URLs — I don’t think this would have even been possible without the Lumen data. I don’t think we could have found such a large volume of stuff. Having the actual text of the complaint was what made this analysis possible and I can’t even really fathom how we could have done it simply based on the transparency report data. We could have probably found a few anecdotes, but I didn’t know what websites to search for because I don’t know the name of Ukrainian blogs, so I think it would have been really difficult without&nbsp;Lumen.</p><p>Lumen: Do you think there is any appetite for a follow-up piece about this&nbsp;stuff?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: Yes. My coworker, Rachel Levy, did a great story a couple months before mine about reputation management. This hedge fund manager had created fake websites to promote himself and manipulate Google search results. So, it’s certainly a really interesting area, and I think DMCA is a larger piece of that&nbsp;puzzle.</p><p>Lumen: As a data journalist who often covers issues pertaining tech and business, how important, in your opinion or experience, is transparency through notice&nbsp;sharing?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: As a journalist, we do our jobs based on this kind of transparency. If there had been no Google transparency report or Lumen database we wouldn’t have been able to do this. And so, you have to at least give Google credit for releasing that kind of data. And I think if there was more stuff like that out there in the tech world that would be really beneficial to researchers and journalists and people who can help with the accountability process. I think that the more transparent data we have, it makes stuff like that possible. And at the end of the day, it helps the public and consumers and it really helps the Ukrainian journalists. And that’s what we’re all here&nbsp;for.</p><p>[The quotes in this interview have been edited for clarity.]</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/lumen-researcher-interview-series-andrea-fuller-wall-street-journal-ec35d2800e3f">​Lumen Researcher Interview Series: Andrea Fuller, Wall Street Journal</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>In July 2021, the European Commission (EC) moved one step closer to a clampdown on illicit money flows; it published its long-awaited package of four legislative proposals intended to strengthen the EU’s rules on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).</p>
<p>Within the package, the EC officially recognized the value of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) as a unique mechanism capable of supporting transparency within any ecosystem, by formalizing it as an important component of future AML/CFT efforts. Two of the four EC proposals call for the LEI to be used in certain customer identification and verification scenarios where it is available: </p>
 
 New Regulation on AML/CFT: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing; 
 Revision of the 2015 Regulation on Transfer of Funds: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on information accompanying transfers of funds and certain crypto-assets (recast). 
 
<p>Inclusion of the LEI within such far-reaching, EU-wide proposals for a future-proof AML/CFT regulatory  framework represents a huge leap forwards, in terms of realizing a key component of the G20 and Financial Stability Board’s vision to create the LEI as a public good. Any role played by the LEI in helping to protect EU citizens from the impact of terrorism and organized crime can be deemed of significant societal benefit. </p>
<p>A brief analysis of why the EC is championing the LEI within the AML/CFT context highlights that there are many benefits. Use of the LEI consistently for entity identification at the Member State level and the EU level can diminish the margins-of-error related to language ambiguity, human interpretation, and manual intervention. The LEI’s broad interoperability enables it to be integrated seamlessly into both centralized and decentralized digital identity management systems, together with the eIDAS-compliant digital certificates that are already harmonizing the use of e-signature technologies across the EU.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the new EC proposals are intended to create a much more consistent framework to ease compliance for operators subject to AML/CFT rules, especially for those active cross-border. Here too, and given the cross-border nature of money laundering and terrorism financing, the LEI can be used as the ‘Rosetta Stone’ for legal entities involved in financial transactions. Overseen by the <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/about/index.htm">Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC)</a>, the Global LEI System is the only system that establishes a recognized, monitored and standardized global identity for legal entities, linked to the entity’s national ID system. Its universality across borders, combined with open and online access to annually verified business card information linked to each LEI, makes it uniquely placed to enable efficient information exchange between the ‘obliged parties’ defined in the AML/CFT proposal and all competent authorities.   </p>
<p>And while this is the first time the LEI has been officially endorsed by the EC in its AML/CFT framework, the LEI has a long track record as a powerful tool in assisting the efforts of financial institutions to combat money laundering and terrorist funding. The LEI enables financial institutions to conduct fully automated, straight-through processing; by replacing outdated manual checks, the LEI increases both the speed and the effectiveness of client onboarding and ongoing compliance checks. This includes improving screening against sanctions and watch lists thereby enabling new efficiencies for both institution and client, lowering costs significantly. </p>
<p>The latest recommendation from the EC that the LEI is used, where available, for customer identification and verification in AML/CTF legislative reforms, has the potential to drastically increase the transparency of legal entities participating in financial transactions. Recent AML scandals have shown that financial criminals mostly operate through a network across borders to conceal their illicit transactions. The LEI, a global standard for unique legal entity identification, can make these connections and transactions across borders visible and easy-to-interpret to the financial institutions and Financial Intelligence Units. It can therefore contribute to the stronger authentication of entity clients, promote transparency and reduce illicit transactions.</p>
<p>By including the LEI in its AML/CFT legislative package, the EC strengthens efforts across Europe to use and reinforce global standards in the promotion of transparency and financial stability. The European Central Bank (ECB) recently recognized the benefits of extending LEI use to cover all future public reporting and financial transactions. As a result, the European Systemic Risk Board has recommended the establishment of an EU legislative framework for systemic and comprehensive adoption of LEIs across the EU by any organization involved in a financial transaction and to identify entities reporting financial information.</p>
<p>In context of the AML/CFT proposals, for those ‘obliged entities’ that want to surpass transparency goals, becoming a Validation Agent offers a vast array of business benefits. The Validation Agent role was created by GLEIF within the Global LEI System to simplify LEI issuance for clients and to deliver a variety of cost, efficiency and customer experience benefits for the Validation Agents organizations themselves. More information on the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/validation-agents">Validation Agent role can be found on the GLEIF website</a>.   </p>
<p>How has the LEI Been Referenced Within the EC’s AML/CFT Legislative Package? </p>
<p>AML / CFT Regulation <br>
As defined in Article 1, this proposal lays down rules concerning: </p>
 
 Measures to be applied by obliged entities to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing;  
 Beneficial ownership transparency requirements for legal entities and arrangements;  
 Measures to limit the misues of bearer instruments.  
 
<p>Obliged entities are defined fully in Article 3 of the proposal, but include (with certain exceptions): credit institutions; financial institutions; and various natural and legal persons acting in a professional capacity, ranging from auditors, accountants and tax advisors to legal representatives involved in certain types of transactions, including property, precious metals and stones, gambling services, crypto-asset service providers and crowdfunding service providers. </p>
<p>Reference to the LEI is made in Article 18, which is titled ‘Identification and Verification of the Customer’s Identity’. The text makes clear that where available, an LEI should be obtained by obliged entities, in order to identify a legal entity customer. </p>
<p>Revision of the 2015 Regulation on Transfer of Funds<br>
In a press release announcing the legislative package, the EC makes it clear that primary drivers for enhancements to the existing EU AML/CFT framework are “new and emerging challenges linked to technical innovation.” It names virtual currencies, more integrated financial flows in the Single Market and the global nature of terrorist organisations among these challenges. </p>
<p>The key focus of this Revision of the 2015 Regulation on Transfer of Funds ensures that EU AML/ CFT rules are extended beyond their current remit, to fully apply to the crypto sector. This will ensure full traceability of crypto-asset transfers and allow the prevention and detection of their potential use for money laundering or terrorism financing. </p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the LEI has been referenced twice within the package of legislatory proposals. </p>
 
 In section (25), which outlines that transfers of funds or crypto-assets from the Union to outside the Union should carry complete information on the payer and payee, a new requirement has been introduced: “Complete information on the payer and the payee should include the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) when this information is provided by the payer to the payer’s service provider, since that would allow for better identification of the parties involved in a transfer of funds and could easily be included in existing payment message formats such as the one developed by the International Organisation for Standardisation for electronic data interchange between financial institutions.”  
 In a later section that outlines the obligations on the payment service provider of the payer, Article 4 of the Revision proposal sets out the requirements for information that must accompany transfers of funds. In the latest revision, a new requirement for the payer’s current LEI has been added, “subject to the existence of the necessary field in the relevant payments message format, and where provided by the payer to the payer’s payment service provider….”.

 With an initial pilot complete, we look ahead to what’s next for one of the world’s largest renewable energy&nbsp;markets <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/guy5aS3GvgA">ActionVance</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/guy5aS3GvgA">Unsplash</a><p>In the world of power grids, PJM Interconnection is a household name. It is a regional transmission operator (RTO) whose service territory spans a 13-state region in the Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, and Northeast region of the United States. It’s not huge by land area: as measured in square miles, all of PJM’s service territory could fit within the borders of France. But it is a massive electricity and renewable energy&nbsp;market.</p><p>PJM was the world’s largest competitive wholesale electricity market until the development of the European Integrated Energy Market in the 2000s. And it remains one of the world’s largest grid operators as a founding member of the GO15. On the renewable energy front, in 2020 PJM generated more renewable energy certificates (RECs) than the whole of Australia.</p><p>And so when we, Energy Web, kicked off a collaboration with <a href="https://www.pjm-eis.com/">PJM Environmental Information Services, Inc. </a>(PJM-EIS) — a subsidiary of PJM Interconnection — in late 2018, we were excited. That’s because PJM-EIS administers the Generation Attribute Tracking System (GATS), a platform for tracking and trading RECs in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>The focus of the collaboration was to build a blockchain-based pilot alongside PJM’s existing GATS system. Together, PJM-EIS and Energy Web wanted to explore the potential for bringing new functionality and benefits to GATS and evaluate how blockchain technology could be integrated into existing IT systems seamlessly and create value for PJM stakeholders.</p><p>Evaluating opportunities to modernize an existing U.S. REC&nbsp;platform</p><p>We set out to leverage the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS), an open-source tech stack of decentralized software and standards for the energy sector. More specifically, the pilot used <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Energy Web Origin</a>, an open-source software development toolkit (SDK) for REC (and similar) tracking and trading platforms running on the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">Energy Web Chain</a>, to create new functionality for the GATS Bulletin Board and assess the potential for decentralized technologies to support wider improvements to GATS beyond the Bulletin&nbsp;Board.</p><p>The Bulletin Board is a place on GATS where REC buyers and sellers can, respectively, post their bids and asks for specific REC volumes. Actually selling or buying those RECs remains the responsibility of the counterparties in bilateral agreements. We thought a blockchain-based solution could improve that experience and increase use of the Bulletin&nbsp;Board.</p><p>Historically, the Bulletin Board has been an underutilized feature available on GATS to facilitate trading of voluntary RECs. The central aim for this pilot was to test new functionality that could enhance the Bulletin Board as a means to grow the REC market in the PJM footprint while also improving security, increasing transparency, and reducing transaction costs for PJM stakeholders. In other words, this pilot assessed how improving the technical functionality and user experience of the Bulletin Board could remove market barriers and grow the local REC market — and possibly even attract greater REC imports from other U.S. REC&nbsp;markets.</p><p>The result: a pilot for the PJM-EIS version of GATS Bulletin Board with blockchain-based REC marketplace functionality that integrated with the existing&nbsp;GATS</p><p>This spring, five PJM subscribers tested the pilot GATS Bulletin Board. Seller participants posted asks on the Bulletin Board based on actual RECs in their respective GATS accounts and buyer participants posted their REC bids based on their procurement needs. Any matches made between bids and asks then triggered notifications for participants to confirm if they wanted to complete any REC transfers, where any completed trades would link back to the legacy GATS to update the buyer and seller’s respective accounts. For this pilot, the transactions were purely test transactions and so there was no financial settlement.</p><p>Here are some screenshots from the pilot GATS Bulletin Board to give a flavor of the updated user experience (shown from the perspective of a renewable energy&nbsp;buyer):</p>  Getting a view of the overall Bulletin Board market&nbsp;activity  <p>2. Starting the renewable energy procurement journey with various search filters to place&nbsp;bids</p><p>3. Identifying verified procurement options that match with&nbsp;bids</p><p>4. Viewing completed transactions and blockchain-based proof of each transaction</p><p>“We have learned a lot about what it would take to add new technical functionalities to GATS, how to integrate blockchain-based technologies ‘under the hood’ of GATS, and how PJM stakeholders support these improvements,” said Ken Schuyler, President of PJM-EIS. “We look forward to further understanding how we can use EW-DOS to support our overall digitization efforts.”</p><p>Energy Web Origin provided the back-end infrastructure for the marketplace functionality and use of a public blockchain — the Energy Web Chain — to digitize the RECs in GATS and anchor the proof of any REC transactions that occurred on the pilot Bulletin Board&nbsp;system.</p><p>Pilot feedback and next&nbsp;steps</p><p>In post-pilot interviews, pilot participants shared overall positive feedback about their experience, especially around the level of integration with GATS, and shared how they could successfully post bids and asks for RECs from their GATS accounts.</p><p>In the end, given how energy sector market participants typically adopt new technologies in phases (rather than in one fell swoop), this pilot illustrates that it is possible to integrate blockchain-based functionalities into existing IT systems to support wider digitization and tech modernization efforts.</p><p>Nevertheless, PJM-EIS and Energy Web experienced practical implementation challenges with the pilot. The core challenge revolved around how — while it’s possible to integrate new, blockchain-based tech with legacy IT systems — this integration process takes more time than designing and implementing an entirely new IT system from scratch. This is the main reason why the pilot took more time than initially expected to implement.</p><p>The pilot also raised bigger strategic questions that PJM-EIS will continue to evaluate as it explores next steps for technical upgrades to GATS in general and the Bulletin Board in particular. For example, this pilot showed that it is technically possible to integrate new technologies on a legacy system, but cannot answer the central question as to whether or not PJM-EIS wants to make the Bulletin Board an exchange where real REC purchases (and associated financial transactions) happen. In addition, the pilot did not assess the role of using new decentralized identifier technologies that make it possible to assign every energy device a unique digital identity anchored on a public blockchain so that a given device can plug into different PJM&nbsp;markets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/pjm-eis-update-modernizing-a-legacy-u-s-rec-tracking-system-with-blockchain-based-technology-db0ad5a4f924">PJM-EIS UPDATE: Modernizing a legacy U.S. REC tracking system with blockchain-based technology</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Bárbara Villuendas. Digital Content Assistant de <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com">Cuatroochenta</a></p><p>Alastria ID es uno de los modelos referentes de identidad digital soberana en el que han colaborado empresas como Cuatroochenta a través de la firma 4TIC, a la que adquirió en 2020. El proyecto quiere que la ciudadanía y las empresas sean propietarias de sus datos personales y que tengan el control con todas las garantías de seguridad que aporta la tecnología blockchain.</p>Sistema de funcionamiento basado en la Identidad Digital Soberana. Foto: Cuatroochenta<p>Un negocio que quiera tener una cuenta corriente en una entidad bancaria ha de facilitar a la sucursal una copia del DNI del representante legal. Si la firma tiene cuentas en otras entidades, debe ofrecer esa copia a cada uno, redoblando trámites y riesgos de seguridad, ya que esa documentación se expone muchas más veces a un posible robo de información… Esto es lo que pasa hoy en día, pero imaginemos un escenario totalmente diferente. Un escenario en el que una empresa no tiene que ofrecer ningún documento físico ni electrónico, sino que simplemente permite al banco acceder a su número de DNI, a través de su cartera digital, es decir, su wallet. Este sistema serviría también, por ejemplo, para hacer los trámites para ser proveedor de un negocio o para licitaciones en administraciones públicas. Estamos hablando de la <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/blockchain-como-garantia-de-confianza-en-los-negocios/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">identidad digital soberana</a>, conocida por sus términos en inglés como self sovereign identity&nbsp;(SSI).</p><p>La Comisión Europea ha presentado recientemente la identidad digital europea, sustentada en la SSI y en la <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/blockchain-como-garantia-de-confianza-en-los-negocios/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">tecnología blockchain</a>, que permite distribuir en una red el control de la información y validarla sin intermediarios.</p><p>Con este sistema, la ciudadanía y los negocios pasan a ser los propietarios de la identidad digital y, por tanto, de las credenciales que la conforman. Y ¿qué se entiende por credencial? Cualquier dato que identifica a una persona o empresa. Puede ser, por ejemplo, el número de DNI o NIF, el carnet de conducir, un título universitario o una aptitud profesional. Imaginemos el supuesto de una persona que debe acreditar que es mayor de edad. Con este sistema no es necesario que aporte el DNI con todos los datos personales que recoge, sino una <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">credencial verificable (VC)</a> en que una administración confirma esa mayoría de edad preservando la privacidad de los&nbsp;datos.</p><p>Es un giro y un cambio de paradigma hacia un <a href="https://elpais.com/retina/2017/06/05/tendencias/1496646930_763686.html">modelo descentralizado</a>. La Unión Europea con su <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_es">proyecto de identidad digital</a> quiere evitar que las personas cedamos y regalemos sin darnos cuenta datos a las grandes tecnológicas. En los últimos años se han implementado en toda Europa diversas iniciativas con la vista puesta en los usos de la SSI. En España uno de estos proyectos es el que ha desarrollado el consorcio multidisciplinar <a href="https://alastria.io/">Alastria</a>, del que es socio Cuatroochenta de forma colaborativa entre más de 200 miembros <a href="https://alastria.io/id-alastria/">Alastria ID</a>, un modelo técnico de identidad digital basado en los estándares internacionales y que quiere aprovechar las <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/tendencias-tecnologicas-que-marcaran-2021/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">capacidades de blockchain</a> y de la&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>Si quieres conocer cómo se construye la identidad digital, los beneficios de la SSI y las características del modelo Alastria ID puedes leer el <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/los-cimientos-de-la-identidad-digital-sobre-blockchain/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">artículo completo</a>.</p>

 Some Overviews 

<p>Blockchain Commons is getting big, so we produced some overviews of our work!</p>

<p>Video Overview. Over the last few years, Blockchain Commons has produced a number of specifications, including our fundamental work on Uniform Resources (URs), our other innovations such as Lifehashes and Object Identity Blocks, and our updates of sharding technology with SSKR. If you’re trying to get a handle on the technologies we’re using and the specifications that we’re creating with our Airgapped community, we invite you to take a look at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">technology overview video</a>, which runs through our core conceptual and specification work one element at a time.</p>



  
<p><br></p>

<p>The Gordian Principles. We’ve also begun publishing some descriptions of what the Gordian architecture means to us. It’s focused on four principals that we believe are crucial to digital-asset management: independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. They’re all about ensuring that you’re the controller of your digital assets. Besides writing a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">short overview</a>, we’ve also begun adding descriptions to each of our reference apps, discussing how they embody those principles.</p>

<p>And, those reference apps were our biggest news for the quarter …</p>

 Reference App Work 

<p>Our reference apps show off how Blockchain Commons’ Gordian Principles work in real life. We made great progress on them this quarter.</p>

<p>Gordian Releases. Where we had three reference apps available for beta testing in Q1, in Q2 we advanced to having two available for release from Apple.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229"></a>
Gordian Seed Tool is the app previously known as Gordian Guardian.
It allows for the management of your cryptographic seeds in a way that’s secure and resilient. You store your seeds in Seed Tool, ensuring that the data is encrypted and that it’s redundantly backed up to iCloud, and then you derive and export keys as they’re needed. As with all of the Gordian reference apps, this one demonstrates the usage of a number of Blockchain Common’s specifications, including SSKRs, UR, and even our new <code>request/response</code> airgap methodology that we just <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md">debuted</a> this February.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070"></a>
Gordian QR Tool is a simpler tool that similarly allows for the storage of QR codes in a secure and resilient way. Thus, if you had a largely unused seed or key, you could export it as a QR and store it here. QR Tool can also be used to store other private information such as 2FA seeds or the brand-new Smart Health Cards. QR Tool recognizes many categories of QR codes, including the UR types that Blockchain Commons has defined, allowing easy categorization and sorting of your cryptographic data. Our QR Tool was slightly held back by inadequacies we found in Apple’s QR creation functions, which can produce overly large QRs. We’ve already begun work <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/QRCodeGenerator">translating a better QR library into Swift</a> and expect to integrate that into v1.1 of QR Tool in the future.</p>

<p>QR Tool and Seed Tool also offer the first demonstration of the interactions possible in a Gordian architecture. One of the most powerful examples involves Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">SSKR specification</a>. Seed Tools allows a user to not only shard a seed using SSKR, but also to encode those shares as QR codes. The encoded shares can then be given to friends and family who have QR Tool, ensuring the safe storage of all the shares required to restore your seed!</p>

<p>We have more reference app releases planned for the future. Gordian Cosigner remains available as a Testflight beta release, and is our reference app for demonstrating how to conduct airgapped signing. We are also beginning work on the Gordian Recovery app, which we announced last quarter; it’ll demonstrate methodologies for recovering assets held by third-party wallets.</p>

<p>Sweeptool Debut. Recovering funds held in a third-party HD wallet can be tricky since you don’t always know which addresses were actually used. We’ve also been attacking that problem with a command-line tool called <code>sweeptool</code>, which sweeps funds anywhere in the hierarchy defined by a descriptor. Sweeptool is the work of one of our intern graduates, and is already available as an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/sweeptool-cli">alpha release</a>.</p>

<p>Timelock Experiments. Our current architecture for #SmartCustody depends on multisigs to allow for the partitioning of keys and the creation of resilience. However, we’re already thinking about the next generation of #SmartCustody, which will allow the use of timelocks to recover funds in the case of the incapacitation of a principal. We did some deeper investigation into miniscript this quarter, which allows for easier integration of timelocks into Bitcoin addresses, and also mapped out some new architectures for progressively sweeping funds forward to keep ahead of timelocks. However, we discovered that at this point miniscript isn’t yet integrated with the descriptor-wallets that are another of the core elements of the Gordian architecture. This prevents integration with our Gordian apps.</p>

<p>We’ve published a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md">preliminary paper</a> on the usage of Timelocks, but it isn’t finalized yet because of these issues. Meanwhile, one of our interns has begun work on a Rust-based Timelock project called <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli">mori-cli</a>. This work is all meant to ensure we’re ready when miniscript is added to Bitcoin Core, or when timelocks are integrated into descriptors in some other manner.</p>

 Coding Processes 

<p>Releasing apps is just one step of a larger coding process, which requires careful consideration of what languages (and libraries) to use and careful reviewing of their security.</p>

<p>Rust Focus. Sweeptool is written in Rust, which is an increasing focus at Blockchain Commons. We’ve also been using it for our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli">musign-cli work</a> and some of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap">torgap work</a> and have touched upon it in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/18_5_Accessing_Bitcoind_with_Rust.md">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</a>. We think that Rust is an important language for the future of Bitcoin development in large part because of its safety guarantee, including <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/22/why-rust-for-safe-systems-programming/">memory safety properties, which can resolve 70% of security problems</a>. Our main barrier for wider use of Rust has been the fact that C and C++ are the main languages used by Bitcoin Core, iOS, and Android, but we’ve already seen the start of changes there, and hope to be able to integrate Rust even more fully in the future. The fact that the Rust-based <a href="https://bitcoindevkit.org/">Bitcoin Dev Kit</a> is actually in advance of Bitcoin Core in some features is very encouraging.</p>

<p>Security Review. Bitmark, one of our Sustaining Sponsors, has hired <a href="https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security</a> to conduct a security review of our SSKR libraries, <a href="https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-shamir">bc-shamir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">bc-sskr</a>. This is crucial element in making Blockchain Commons’ specification work widely available, since it would be improper for us to review our own security code. As our first partners planning to use one of our libraries in a shipping project, as opposed to just our specifications, Bitmark is stepping up to the plate to fund the review of our core SSKR libraries. We expect this pattern to repeat with future partners and libraries in the future. It shows the power of our open libraries: future companies will be able to depend on our SSKR libraries thanks to Bitmark’s contribution, and then they’ll be able to make contributions of their own that will be much less than if they’d had to security review an entire suite of themselves.</p>

 New Docs 

<p>The blockchain infrastructure is empowered by users and developers who know how to use it properly. Teaching them is the goal of our documentation projects.</p>

<p>UR &amp; SSKR Docs. The ultimate purpose of our reference applications is to demonstrate how our new specifications can be used in actual applications. Hand-in-hand with that, we’re also producing documentation that lays out in more detail how those specifications work. We’ve begun collecting many of those docs in the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/tree/master/Docs">documents area of our crypto-commons repo</a>. This quarter we added to our docs repo with several documents about our Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction system, including <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-users.md">SSKR for Users</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-developers.md">SSKR for Developers</a>. We also released a series of articles on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources (URs)</a> intended to show developers how they’re constructed and used.</p>

<p>We are also planning further support for our interoperable specifications such as UR and SSKR at a virtual interoperable wallet specification workshop. We’re currently working on locking down a date.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Translations. Our best-known tutorial at Blockchain Commons, is our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course</a>, which we pushed to v2.0 last year and which has 1,700 stars and 100 watchers on Github. We’re thrilled that translations are now ongoing into both <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/portuguese-translation/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/spanish-translation/es">Spanish</a> thanks to a half-dozen core volunteers. Some of Blockchain Commons’ own programmers and interns entered the blockchain industry thanks to this course, so we’re looking forward to these translations opening the doors even wider.</p>

 Other Priorities 

<p>Finally, we have a lot of more varied projects that all saw some progress.</p>

<p>Our Summer Interns Have Begun Work. Thanks to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/human-rights-foundation-grants-bitcoin-defi-education-activism">a grant from the Human Rights Foundation</a>, we have a class of a dozen interns this summer. We’re engaging them with weekly calls to introduce them to crucial use cases and to let them talk with Bitcoin and Lightning experts from the industry and human-rights experts, most recently including John Callas from the EFF and Alex Gladstein from HRF.</p>

<p>Some of our human-rights-focused intern projects include a self-sovereign donation app, scripts to automate the setup of privacy and/or bitcoin services, documents on managing pseudonymity, and tracking of blockchain-based legislation.</p>

<p>Some of our more general intern projects include deployment of a full Esplora node for Blockchain Commons, the creation of scripts to make it easier for others to do so, documentation on bitcoin fee-estimation use cases, improvements to our Spotbit server including expansion of the Spotbit API and client app, and the aformentioned work on Mori and on Learning Bitcoin translations.</p>

<p>Our first completed intern ‘21 work is a short <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/15_0_Using_i2p.md">i2p chapter</a> for Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line, talking about an alternative (or supplement) to traditional Tor privacy.</p>

<p>Wyoming Testimony. Christopher’s testimony has continued in Wyoming, talking about DAO and identity, to improve and extend both laws. The most recent testimony <a href="https://youtu.be/ayQ086BVDXE?t=4060">on May 28</a> continued to work through the ramifications of the definitions of principal authority for self-sovereign identity.</p>




<p><br></p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Identity. Speaking of which, it was the fifth anniversary of the concept of self-sovereign identity, which first suggested that we should control our identities on the internet, not be beholden to centralized agencies. Christopher <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">wrote an article</a> for Coindesk celebrating that anniversary, talking about how far we’ve come and reflecting on how things could be improved.</p>

<p>BTCR. Finally, we’ve also been talking about another of our blockchain projects that originated in <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>: BTCR, a self-sovereign decentralized identifier that uses the Bitcoin blockchain. Recently Christopher and the other creators of BTCR talked with <a href="https://the-rubric.castos.com/episodes/the-granddaddy-of-dids">The Rubric</a> about the past and future of the DID.</p>

<p>As you can see, we’ve got lots of ongoing work that continue to expand the ideas of responsible key management and self-determination on the internet. If you’d like to support our work at Blockchain Commons, so that we can continue to design new specifications, architectures, reference applications, and reference libraries to be used by the whole community, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a>. You can alternatively make a <a href="https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/">one-time bitcoin donation</a> at our BTCPay.</p>
