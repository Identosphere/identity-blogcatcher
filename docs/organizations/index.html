<p>The latest version of the electronic interchange format for business documents is now an OASIS Standard.</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of its newest OASIS Standard, approved by the members on 15 June 2021:</p>



<p>Universal Business Language Version 2.3<br>OASIS Standard<br>15 June 2021</p>



<p>Universal Business Language (UBL) is the leading electronic interchange format for business documents. It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes.</p>



<p>The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:</p>



  A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.  A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.  A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.  



<p>Version 2.3 is a minor revision to v2.2 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 91.</p>



<p>The TC received 4 Statements of Use from IBM, ClearView Trade, the Swedish Procurement Agency, and Philip Helger.</p>

<p>How to scale your Blockchain project using the Agile Method</p>
<p>The Agile Method is a particular project management approach that is used in software development. This method helps teams respond to the unpredictability of building software through the use of incremental and iterative work sequences, commonly known as sprints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The general principles of the Agile method</p>
<p>Our top priority is to satisfy the customer by releasing valuable software, right out of the box and continuously.<br>
We embrace changes in requirements, even at advanced stages of development.<br>
Agile processes leverage change for the customer’s competitive advantage.<br>
We frequently deliver working software, ranging from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, preferring short periods.<br>
Clients and developers must work together on a daily basis for the duration of the project.<br>
We base projects on motivated individuals.<br>
We give them the environment and support they need and trust in their ability to get the job done.<br>
A face-to-face conversation is the most efficient and effective way to communicate with and within the team.<br>
Working software is the primary measure of progress. – Agile processes promote sustainable development.<br>
Sponsors, developers, and users should be able to indefinitely maintain a steady pace.<br>
Continued focus on technical excellence and good design enhances agility.<br>
Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.<br>
The best architectures, requirements, and design emerge from self-organizing teams.<br>
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, after which it adjusts and adapts its behavior accordingly.</p>
<p>History of the Agile Method&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the Agile ideas emerged in the 1970s. Studies and reviews were conducted on the Agile Method explaining its birth as a reaction against traditional approaches to project development. In 1970, Dr. William Royce published a paper discussing the management and development of large software systems. The paper outlined his specific ideas about sequential development. Specifically, his presentation stated that a project could be developed like a product on an assembly line: each phase of development had to be completed before the next phase could begin. The idea required that developers had to first put together all the requirements for a project. The next step was to complete its architecture. Code writing followed, and the development sequences continued in increments aimed at closing integral parts of the project. When these steps are completed, there is little or no contact between the specialized groups completing each phase of the project. The pioneers of the Agile Method believed that if developers studied the process, they would find the most logical and useful solution for software development.</p>
<p>Companies that use the Agile Method</p>
<p>Although there is no official list of companies that use the Agile Method for their projects, IBM is one of the companies that openly uses this method to develop software. In fact, many companies adopt it within their development structure, but they are not always open about their choice to use it. According to IBM, the use of the Agile Method generates significant organizational changes. IBM believes that many Agile software development teams will increase their chances of success by collaborating with reliable guidance. That company also helps clients implement their own Agile software development strategies for their projects and provides critical guidance that will help Agile software development teams avoid common pitfalls of adoption, expansion and implementation.</p>

<p>Blockchain Model Canvas (BMC)</p>
<p>Alex Osterwalder in his famous book explains a fantastic method to describe any business idea: the Business Model Canvas. With nine blocks in a grid drawn with a marker on a whiteboard and post-it notes he manages to explain any business in the universe.&nbsp; No wonder that because of the clarity of the information and the ease of use of the Business Model Canvas, Osterwalder was so successful. Next, we created our own model called BMC, more based on Ash Mayura’s work, which is fast, concise and in a single page represents the entire business model of a Blockchain project</p>
<p>What is the Business Model Canvas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use a nine-block model called the Blockchain Model Canvas (BMC) (based on the work of Ash Mayura and Alexander Osterwalder) to describe your vision and a method called Lean Startup (based on the work of Eric Ries) to test validity.</p>
<p>The problem and the customers</p>
<p>Having found these first two elements, everything else in the BMC is easier to complete. It is for this reason that it always pays to analyze them together. Writing three main problems for the customer segment you have in mind, describe the three main problems that need to be solved.</p>
<p>The Value Proposition (VP)</p>
<p>At the heart of the BMC is the most important element of the entire model, and incidentally also the hardest to hit on the first shot. The VP must contain why the product is different, and that difference must matter. People who visit a site for the first time spend an average of eight seconds there. The Value Proposition is their first interaction with the product.</p>
<p>The Solution</p>
<p>Now you are ready to tackle the various solution scenarios. Understand that since everything we write about BMC is just an untested hypothesis, it is not advisable to convince yourself that you have found a definitive solution to your customers’ problems. At this stage, it is best to simply sketch out the salient features of the product alongside each problem. Ideally, you should strive to associate a solution to the client’s problem as late as possible, at least after you’ve spoken to the client once…</p>
<p>The Metrics</p>
<p>There are only five key metrics that drive a Blockchain project</p>
<p>Acquisition How users arrive and from what channels they arrive at your service<br>
Activation How users first register with your service<br>
Retention How users come back to your service again and again<br>
Referral How users like your service enough to suggest it to others<br>
Revenue How users buy your service</p>
<p>Channels</p>
<p>How to distribute our Value Proposition to the customer? In addition to defining the right product to build, it’s just as critical to start finding, building and testing a path to your customers from day one. There are a variety of distribution channels: some may be inapplicable in the early stages of your startup, while others may be feasible during the later stages of your startup.</p>
<p>The Relationship</p>
<p>In the first phase, you need to find potential clients (prospects) to talk to. You need to remember that you are looking for people who are suffering from a problem and who, as a result, should be willing to pay to have your solution. How do you find and reach prospects? There is no right answer, no magic formula. It depends on the resources available.</p>
<p>Revenues and Costs</p>
<p>Many companies postpone the “pricing question” because they don’t think their product is ready. Time and time again, you hear the phrase, “how do we charge for an MVP?” MVPs are supposed to solve big problems for the identified customer segment and so, by definition, the MVP must offer enough value to justify the expense.</p>

  <p>According to a recent global study from McKinsey &amp; Company, Covid-19 has accelerated business’ digital initiatives by, on average, seven years.</p>
<p>In acknowledgement of this monumental leap forward, GLEIF has launched several strategic initiatives over the past year designed to broaden the value of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in the fields of digital identity, digitized counterparty verification and their related use-cases. </p>
<p>As Germany celebrates Digital Day on June 18, GLEIF looks back at these milestones and considers what the future holds for the LEI and the global digital economy.  </p>
<p>The Validation Agent: Opening the door to business ID services for legal entities</p>
<p>In September, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-defines-new-validation-agent-role-for-banks-financial-institutions-to-simplify-and-accelerate-client-lifecycle-management">GLEIF introduced a new role into the Global LEI System called the Validation Agent</a>. The role is designed to help financial institutions and other supervised organizations make immediate gains in client lifecycle management and begin to develop innovative business identity services for their clients.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/validation-agents">Validation Agents</a> leverage their know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulated ‘business-as-usual’ onboarding processes to obtain LEIs for their customers. By equipping their business client base with LEIs, Validation Agents can promote financial inclusion and create new value by pioneering revenue generating digital services in corporate identity management and cross-border supply chain relationships. </p>
<p>Validation Agents can also utilize the LEI to accelerate their internal digital transformation, in areas such as customer onboarding, payments and other transactions, and contract signing.</p>
<p>Since its launch at the end of 2020, the Validation Agent framework has gained significant traction around the world. Two significant institutions, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-confirms-j-p-morgan-as-first-validation-agent-in-the-global-lei-system">J.P. Morgan</a> and the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-welcomes-pioneering-advances-by-china-financial-certification-authority-cfca-which-pave-the-way-for-increased-lei-usage-in-mass-market-digital-identity-products">China Financial Certification Authority (CFCA)</a>, have already completed the qualification process, with many more to follow. </p>
<p>The vLEI: Enabling instant, automated verification of business identity</p>
<p>Until now, the absence of an independent governance authority capable of establishing universal digitized trust between legal entities has presented an industry-wide barrier to innovation. To overcome this obstacle, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-advances-digital-trust-and-identity-for-legal-entities-globally">GLEIF launched a cross-industry development program</a> in 2020 to create a digitally verifiable LEI (vLEI).  When complete, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">the vLEI</a> will extend the Global LEI System to create a fully digitized LEI service that can enable instant and automated identity verification between counterparties operating across all industry sectors, globally. </p>
<p>With GLEIF acting as the ‘root of trust’, the vLEI service creates a cryptographically secure chain of trust that can replace the manual processes required to access and confirm an entity’s LEI data. This will give organizations worldwide the capacity to use their LEI’s non-repudiable identification data relating to their legal status, ownership structure and authorized representatives in a huge number of digital activities, many of them automated, enabling them to participate in the global digital economy for years to come. </p>
<p>As a result, the vLEI has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world; it will be the hallmark of authenticity for all legal entities everywhere.</p>
<p>In February 2021, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-unveils-issuance-and-infrastructure-models-for-verifiable-lei">GLEIF unveiled the official issuance and technical infrastructure models</a> which will support the development of the vLEI and now invites software developers to engage with the program’s stakeholders to explore how the vLEI can be leveraged in future applications. </p>
<p>Digital Certificates: Embedding the LEI to uphold trust in the system</p>
<p>As legal entities’ use of digital certificates continues to grow in both number and use-case application, so too does the time and cost required to maintain them. The increasing complexity of this task is already <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/blog/the-lei-the-missing-ingredient-in-digital-certificate-management">undermining the trust system that digital certificates were designed to create</a>. </p>
<p>To address this problem GLEIF has worked closely with the International Standards Organization (ISO) to <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/iso-standardizes-the-process-of-embedding-leis-in-digital-certificates">standardize the process of embedding LEIs into digital certificates</a> at the point of issuance, which will make certificates easier to manage, aggregate and maintain, as well as increasing transparency across the digital identity ecosystem. <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/the-lei-in-digital-certificates">By becoming the common link between digital certificates</a>, the LEI will provide certainty of identity in any online interaction, making it easier for everyone to participate with confidence in the global digital marketplace. </p>
<p>GLEIF is actively engaged with Certification Authorities (CAs) and Trust Service Providers (TSPs) to support and encourage LEI adoption in digital certificates as part of its new CA Stakeholder Group, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-launches-new-stakeholder-group-to-accelerate-the-integration-of-leis-in-digital-certificates">announced in March 2021</a>. This group aims to facilitate the transfer of mutually beneficial information between stakeholders in a joint effort to develop best practice guidelines and case studies for LEI integration. Following this, GLEIF <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-welcomes-pioneering-advances-by-china-financial-certification-authority-cfca-which-pave-the-way-for-increased-lei-usage-in-mass-market-digital-identity-products">welcomed the first commercial demonstration of an LEI embedded within a digital certificate</a> with the launch of the China Financial Certification Authority’s (CFCA) TrustSign® software in March 2021. </p>
<p>LEI Search 2.0: Enriching and automating access to LEI data</p>
<p>GLEIF has also been hard at work to ensure the LEI’s own tools stay ahead of the digitalization curve. </p>
<p>In 2020, in line with its vision to enable broader, automated use of the LEI, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-answers-industry-demand-for-customized-automated-access-to-rich-lei-data-with-lei-search-2-0-and-companion-api">GLEIF completed its migration to LEI Search 2.0</a>, a new LEI search engine with rich data functionality, and published a companion API enabling third-parties to set up fast, customized and automated searches and retrieve open, higher quality LEI data from within their application environments.</p>
<p>By expanding the number of search parameters available, <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/search/">LEI Search 2.0</a> delivers a new level of transparency over how legal entities have evolved over time, enabling faster and more sophisticated counterparty due diligence, heightened granularity in regulatory oversight procedures and richer reporting potential for market data aggregators. </p>
<p>What’s next? </p>
<p>In the coming months GLEIF will continue working hard to advance these strategic initiatives. </p>
<p>The Validation Agent Framework is maturing and GLEIF’s focus is now on championing the roles benefits and encourage take-up from financial institutions and other supervised organizations around the world. </p>
<p>The vLEI continues to evolve at pace as stakeholders across healthcare, pharmaceutical, telecom, automotive and financial services begin to build out sector-specific applications. </p>
<p>In collaboration with members of the CA Stakeholder Group, GLEIF continues to combat complexity and advance trust and transparency across the digital certificate ecosystem around the world.</p>
<p>The LEI’s legacy is proudly rooted in financial services and regulation. Its future, however, undeniably points beyond to broader, digitized adoption and utilization across public and private sectors around the world. The Global LEI System is the only open, commercially neutral, and regulatory endorsed system capable of establishing digitized trust between all legal entities everywhere. It was established as a public good, and GLEIF remains committed to ensuring that every last drop of value is wrung from the system, and used to the benefit of all.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has given many consumers their first taste of virtual content tied to physical locations, with restaurants around the world replacing menus with QR codes for customers to scan. This trend is accelerating, with augmented reality (AR) and integrated digital/physical experiences becoming more commonplace. But the merging of our physical and digital worlds can't really take off while we rely on QR codes posted everywhere or siloed smartphone apps for each use case.</p><p><a href="https://www.geoweb.network/">Geo Web</a> is creating a set of open protocols to anchor digital content in the physical world on a shared, fair, decentralized network. By using NFTs and a creative system of property rights, Geo Web hopes to create the virtual land layer that can be overlaid on the offline "meatspace" for any use case.</p> Decentralizing ownership of the web's AR platform <p>As augmented reality (AR) technology matures and it becomes easier to layer digital content into physical spaces, a key question becomes "who controls the platform?" &nbsp;With a purely open, unconstrained platform there will be competing content that drowns out high-value data with noise and spam. And with closed, proprietary platforms, one dominant gatekeeper could exert massive power.</p><p>Geo Web co-founder Graven Prest first started thinking about geospatial AR after seeing one such platform in 2014:</p><blockquote>I realized that whoever created that platform would control a global virtual real estate market.</blockquote><p>Unlike with virtual reality (VR) and "other metaverses," with AR it's likely important that we all share a single platform so that we can interact with it together. As Prest puts it, "We have one Earth we all share, and I don't want to be walking down the street and be in a different metaverse than you are. We need to coordinate our collective attention, and the only way we're going to do that is by being fair and legitimate."</p><p>In pursuit of this vision, Geo Web combines decentralized AR content stored on Ceramic with a system of digital property rights tied to physical land which keeps the content of every land parcel productive, while enabling open participation and community ownership of an augmented, shared reality.</p> NFTs for digital land parcels <p>Geo Web accomplishes this by representing each parcel of physical land as an NFT in a <a href="https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/core-contracts">registry smart contract</a>. The owner of that NFT has exclusive rights to control the digital content associated with that parcel of land, which is stored in streams on Ceramic.</p>Claiming a Geo Web land parcel NFT in Times Square with the <a href="https://cadastre.geoweb.eth.link/">Geo Web Cadastre</a><p>The parcel owner can anchor any kind of digital content to that land on the <a href="https://cadastre.geoweb.eth.link/">Geo Web Cadastre</a>. For example, a restaurant can purchase the parcel it resides on and show its menu to guests or today's specials to people walking down the street. Sports teams can purchase parcels near their stadium or in their hometown to show highlights and news. Governments can rent space to display public service announcements (PSAs). Collectors can display their digital art, or museums could add digital information to their physical exhibits.</p><p>Geo Web uses a unique property rights system called <a href="https://docs.geoweb.network/concepts/partial-common-ownership">partial common ownership (aka Harberger Taxes)</a> that works as follows:</p>  Parcel owners pay a license fee to the network (similar to a property tax). This fee goes to fund public goods on the network.  The fee is based on the owner's self-assessed value of the land.  At any time, anyone else can purchase the parcel at that self-assessed value.  <p>This ensures fair market pricing over time, and that valuable virtual land is being used productively. If a digital real estate mogul is squatting on valuable property and self-assessing a below-market rate to avoid paying fair fees, this model incentivizes a new virtual property developer to come in and purchase that land to put it to more productive use.</p><p>Each parcel owner can choose how they wish to use their digital airspace, and can change it freely over time. Individual consumers, standalone businesses, or broader efforts like gaming studios or media platforms can all participate on the same network and AR metaverse. This means users don't need to constantly switch applications, but instead can benefit from AR technology on a single easy, fair, and collectively-owned network that resembles the open web. Geo Web can become a shelling point for augmented reality tied to physical geography.</p> Managing dynamic, decentralized content at scale <p>To tie virtual content to specific parcels, Geo Web needed a way to store and manage that content such that:</p>  The content can be anything - from text to digital art to videos  Only the current parcel owner is able to control it  The content can change often at a reasonable cost  <p>Essentially, Geo Web needed a way to manage dynamic, ever-changing IPFS content, with access control permissions limited to the current NFT holder. They considered using an end-to-end smart contract solution for storing the CIDs of static IPFS files, but the team ultimately decided that this model would be prohibitively expensive and cumbersome since it would have required a smart contract interaction for every content update.</p> Ceramic streams for decentralized content storage <p>In their search for the best way to anchor digital content to NFTs, Geo Web discovered Ceramic's mutable data streams. Says Prest:</p><blockquote>Ceramic is the best, easiest way to manage mutable information peer-to-peer</blockquote><p>Ceramic provides a completely trustless way to save and update content that can operate at the scale they needed, without requiring blockchain transactions. In their design, each NFT points to a Ceramic stream where the NFT's owner is the only one able to publish, select, and update the digital content they want displayed for that physical location.</p>A simple Geo Web browsing experience seen as if you were in Antarctica<p>When any user navigates to a parcel's corresponding real-world location, they will be able to see and interact with this content through <a href="https://browse.geoweb.eth.link/">Geo Web's geospatial browser</a> or any other browser that supports the Geo Web protocol.</p> Decentralized identity for personalized experiences <p>Geo Web is also using <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX</a>, Ceramic's identity protocol, for user identity. In addition to basic profiles, this lets Geo Web store the keys for all Ceramic streams a user has control over. As Geo Web matures, they will also store settings and preferences with IDX, giving Geo Web the ability to implement user-centric controls, reputation systems, and filters for the content that users prefer or would like to avoid, for a more personalized and fine-tuned user experience. This lets Geo Web stay neutral and open at the base protocol layer while enabling each user to create their own customized experience.</p> DID:NFT for NFT-based access control <p>In the future, Geo Web plans to add <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-94/CIP-94.md">DID:NFT</a> - a standard that turns any NFT into a decentralized identity (DID) that can control content on Ceramic - to give the current owner of each land parcel exclusive access to update the Ceramic stream that contains the parcel's entire content history.</p><blockquote>With DID:NFT, because the content that is anchored to a Geo Web parcel can actually be owned by the parcel itself, when someone buys the land they're also getting the infrastructure that's been built up on that land.</blockquote><p>Without DID:NFT, each time a parcel is sold a new stream must be created. This means that every ownership transfer wipes the previous content from the land. However, tying content ownership and rights directly to the land NFT opens up new and exciting use cases – both for Geo Web's property model, but also for NFT use cases in general.</p><p>Geo Web envisions an ecosystem of "digital real-estate developers" building infrastructure, tooling, applications, and marketplaces around NFT land parcels. We may see virtual fixer-uppers and physics-defying architecture in the AR metaverse before too long.</p> What's next for Geo Web? <p>Geo Web is actively researching and testing Ethereum L2 roll-up solutions for a mainnet fair launch later this year. The team will also be adding to the network's open publishing and browsing infrastructure, including integrating DID:NFT and releasing native browser apps for more immersive augmented reality experiences. If you want to support their open source work, Geo Web has <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/1403/the-geo-web">a grant active in Gitcoin's GR10</a>. </p><p>If you're a digital artist, app developer, or Web 3.0 enthusiast interested in learning more about the Geo Web, get in touch with the team in their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/reXgPru7ck">Discord</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thegeoweb">@thegeoweb</a> on Twitter, or through the <a href="https://www.geoweb.network/">project website</a>.</p> <p>Thanks to 0xElle for contributing to this article.</p><p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> | <a href="http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">GitHub</a> | <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Docs</a> |<a href="https://forum.avax.network/"> </a><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX Identity</a></p>

 ENGIE Energy Access and Energy Web Announce DeFi Crowdfunding Platform to Help Scale Solar, Mini Grids in Sub-Saharan Africa <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/zf9_yiAekJs">Seth Doyle</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/zf9_yiAekJs">Unsplash</a><p>Zug, Switzerland and Berlin, Germany — 17 June 2021 — Today nonprofit Energy Web and<a href="https://www.engie-energyaccess.com/"> ENGIE Energy Access</a> — one of the leading off-grid, Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) solar and mini-grid solutions providers in Africa — announced a partnership to accelerate energy access in sub-Saharan Africa through a decentralized finance (DeFi) crowdfunding platform. The DeFi application will be built on the open-source Energy Web tech stack and enable investors to provide microloans that support clean energy deployment.</p><p>In 2019, an estimated <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/access-to-electricity">580 million people</a> in sub-Saharan Africa remained off grid and in the dark, accounting for three-quarters of the global population without electricity access. After years of steady declines since 2013, that number has risen in 2020 due to the Covid 19 pandemic. Thus rapid deployment of solar home systems (SHSs) and clean energy mini-grids is a crucial humanitarian cause that supports health, quality of life, and economic growth in off-grid regions of the subcontinent.</p><p>ENGIE Energy Access integrates and unites ENGIE’s solar home system companies, Fenix International and ENGIE Mobisol, as well as its mini-grids provider, ENGIE PowerCorner, under one entity and one name. “To date, ENGIE Energy Access has served over 1 million customers and 6 million people in 9 countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The new DeFi platform in partnership with Energy Web will help ENGIE Energy Access deploy more solar faster, by directly tackling a key challenge: access to low-cost financing,” commented Gillian-Alexandre Huart, CEO of ENGIE Energy&nbsp;access.”</p><p>“We’re excited to bring crypto-based decentralized finance to rural electrification in Africa,” said Stefan Zelazny, Head of Software and IT at ENGIE Energy Access and previously CIO at ENGIE Mobisol. “We believe this can accelerate much-needed clean energy deployment throughout the region by connecting impact-oriented investors with unbanked rural customers. Combining the technology that remotely connects and controls our Solar-Home-Systems with the Energy Web Chain will result in the first smart asset-backed NFT where asset use can be controlled via the&nbsp;chain.”</p><p>The first phase of this initiative will focus on integrating the Energy Web software tech stack with ENGIE’s platform to further promote rural electrification in Africa. The crowdfunding platform to be developed by Energy Web will allow micro-investors to finance the installation of clean energy assets by staking Energy Web Tokens (EWT), the native token of the Energy Web Chain, in exchange for a fixed interest rate. This setup will unlock capital from the global cryptocurrency market, bringing a significant new source of capital to clean energy deployment in Africa. To help mitigate the risk for everybody involved, the Community Fund of Energy Web will back this first phase of the platform. Giving people in Africa access to new green electricity solutions utilizing the Energy Web DOS is a great first use case for the Community Fund.</p><p>In the second phase, Energy Web will work together with ENGIE Energy Access to give a unique decentralized identifier (DID) to each one of the home appliances and rooftop solar deployed by ENGIE. This way, one can directly add credits to the appliances owned by locals to support their access to electricity and its services.</p><p>“Creating positive impact in people’s lives is one of our core principles at Energy Web. But the global energy transition must also reach those who don’t yet have access to electricity,” explained Energy Web’s Walter Kok. “We are happy that ENGIE — one of the biggest energy players in the world and one of the founding members of the Energy Web Chain — has embraced the Energy Web technology stack to support such an important mission.”</p><p>About ENGIE Energy Access<br>ENGIE Energy Access is the leading Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGo) and mini-grids solutions provider in Africa, with a mission to deliver affordable, reliable and sustainable energy solutions and life-changing services with exceptional customer experience. The company is a result of the integration of Fenix International, ENGIE Mobisol and ENGIE PowerCorner; and develops innovative, off-grid solar solutions for homes, public services and businesses, enabling customers and distribution partners access to clean, affordable energy. The PAYGo solar home systems are financed through affordable installments from $0.14 per day and the mini-grids foster economic development by enabling electrical productive use and triggering business opportunities for entrepreneurs in rural communities. With over 1,700 employees, operations in nine countries across Africa (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), over 1 million customers and 6 million lives impacted so far, ENGIE Energy Access aims to remain the leading clean energy company, serving millions of customers across Africa by&nbsp;2025.</p><p>For more, please visit<a href="https://engie-energyaccess.com/"> https://engie-energyaccess.com/</a></p><p>Contact&nbsp;: <a href="mailto:stefan.zelazny@engie.com">stefan.zelazny@engie.com</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

 Energy Web Names Chief Commercial Officer Jesse Morris as Energy Web CEO, Outgoing CEO Walter Kok will lead Lab.EnergyWeb <p>Zug, Switzerland — 16 June 2021 — Today we’re excited to introduce <a href="https://lab.energyweb.org/">The Lab (Lab.EnergyWeb)</a>, a new R&amp;D initiative housed within Energy Web to build out cutting-edge functionality, services, SDKs, and other enhancements on the Energy Web stack. Initial projects under development within our new Lab unit include a DeFi application for crowdfunding energy-sector projects in emerging economies via Energy Web Tokens, additional staking models on the Energy Web stack, migrating non-energy crypto applications to the Energy Web Chain, and launching the development of Energy Web Chain 2.0. The announcement comes as we celebrate the second anniversary of the launch of the Energy Web Chain later this week. Walter Kok will lead this new initiative whilst he steps down as&nbsp;CEO.</p><p>In tandem, we’re pleased to announce that Jesse Morris, our longtime chief commercial officer, has been named Energy Web’s new CEO. Since our founding in 2017, Morris’ leadership has been fundamental to the growth of Energy Web into the world’s largest ecosystem of energy companies focused on accelerating the energy transition with open source digital technology.</p><p>“This is an exciting moment for Energy Web, as we move into the next phase of the organization’s evolution,” explained Jules Kortenhorst, EW Foundation Council member and CEO of Energy Web co-founder RMI. “Walter came to Energy Web to launch the world’s first public blockchain tailored to the energy sector. Under his leadership the Energy Web community experienced very rapid growth while adoption of the EW tech stack has scaled in a growing list of major projects around the world — especially impressive against the backdrop of a global pandemic. The next era of Energy Web with Jesse’s leadership promises to be just as revolutionary. Jesse has been instrumental to the success of Energy Web since its incubation and together with Walter leading the Lab we will continue to accelerate the energy transition through digital&nbsp;tech.”</p><p>In a similar move of promoting from within, Kok was Energy Web’s chief operating officer before being named its second CEO in August 2019. He came to Energy Web from a 30+ year career spanning ING Bank, Vodafone Global Enterprise, and NEC Corporation and several startups. Prior to joining the co-founding team of Energy Web, Morris was a principal in the electricity practice at RMI, where he partnered with utilities, technology providers, developers, and regulatory stakeholders to help distributed energy resources become an integral, widely-accessible part of the global electricity system.</p><p>“Walter and I have been working closely together for years now and we’re both excited about our new roles and responsibilities,” reflected Morris. “Me taking the reins as CEO will free up Walter to incubate a series of bleeding-edge crypto and digital projects under the new Lab. This move will make it easier for not just Energy Web as an organization but for our entire community to continue innovating well ahead of the energy&nbsp;market.”</p><p>“Coming from major enterprises like ING Bank and Vodafone, it’s been an incredible experience to lead the Energy Web team. There are so many talents at Energy Web and Jesse stepping into the CEO role is a great example of how we develop the new breed of leaders.” added Kok. “We are growing fast around the world, and I’m thrilled to continue informing our strategy as we forge ahead with The Lab. We will kick-off additional bleeding edge projects to demonstrate the level of innovation that is possible with our EW-DOS today. We are going to speed up the pace and will bring other sectors to our carbon-neutral Energy Web Chain too. Acting our way into new thinking”</p><p>Energy Web’s core team has grown rapidly under Kok’s watch — scaling alongside our ambition and work with the global energy and crypto sectors — almost tripling since the EW Chain’s one-year anniversary in 2020. In less than two years, the EW Chain’s validator network has grown to 44 companies spanning four continents. Some 45,000 wallet addresses have already generated 28 million transactions. Yet the biggest gains are&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>Morris concluded by saying, “The two industries we straddle — crypto and grid digitization — are still in their infancy. For as much as we’ve collectively accomplished until now, we’re just getting started.”</p><p><a href="https://lab.energyweb.org/">Learn more about The Lab at lab.energy.org</a>.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

<p>Over the last couple of weeks I’ve been thinking quite a lot about the concept of the Trust Economy.&nbsp; What is it? And why should we care about it?</p>



<p>My interest was first piqued when I came across two videos on YouTube from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vbPXbm8eTw">Rachel Botsman</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNog-xrc_YA">Philipp Kristian Diekhöner.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trust has always been at the centre of society overall and commerce in particular.&nbsp; There’s a reason why during the first industrial revolution banks always built the most impressive, secure looking buildings in town – so you trusted them to deposit you money there!</p>



<p>Now with the 4th industrial (digital) revolution the old vertical, siloed trust models are breaking down and we are moving to a more horizontal, distributed environment.&nbsp; The decline in trust in the media (fake news) and the lack of trust we are all now feeling with the way big tech is monetising our personal data is creating ever increasing demands from people to significantly improve trust models for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have a strong sense that Aotearoa New Zealand has always projected a reasonably trusted persona globally;&nbsp; good people, good morals, good global citizens etc… and now our Covid-19 response would appear to have bolstered the level of trust people have in us across the planet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An example of this is the <a href="https://brandirectory.com/globalsoftpower/">Global Soft Power Index</a> which for its 2021 ranking had Aotearoa New Zealand as the fastest improving nation in the Index, claiming 16th place in the ranking (up from 22 last year), citing “perceptions of New Zealand have no doubt been bolstered as nations such as the UK and the US cede their usual place as leaders in public health, with both battling repeated waves of the COVID-19 virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There would now appear to be a real opportunity for us to focus on really enhancing our trust position globally.&nbsp; 100% Pure New Zealand was a really strong brand position.&nbsp; Might something like 100% Trusted New Zealand be a branding idea for our future?</p>



<p>And in the context of the digital economy, digital identity and trust go hand in hand as cornerstones of the Trust Economy.</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

   When Energy Web launched in early 2017, we did so with the support of two key cofounders: RMI, a leading global think-and-do tank focused on the energy transition, and Grid Singularity, an award-winning energy blockchain developer.  Two years later in June 2019 we launched the Energy Web Chain in partnership with a global community of energy companies, grid operators, and other enterprises that ha

<p>When Energy Web <a href="https://rmi.org/press-release/press-release-energy-web-foundation-launch/">launched in early 2017</a>, we did so with the support of two key cofounders: RMI, a leading global think-and-do tank focused on the energy transition, and Grid Singularity, an award-winning energy blockchain developer.</p><p>Two years later in June 2019 we <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-foundation-launches-worlds-first-public-open-source-enterprise-grade-blockchain-3a67fc457341">launched the Energy Web Chain</a> in partnership with a global community of energy companies, grid operators, and other enterprises that had grown into the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-foundation-surpasses-100-affiliates-en-route-to-becoming-largest-energy-blockchain-4823616b1579">world’s largest energy blockchain ecosystem</a>. Within the first year of the EW Chain’s operation, solutions and transactions on the network grew quickly, while the validator network <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-chain-celebrates-tripling-of-validator-network-9cdfd830e044'">more than&nbsp;tripled</a>.</p><p>As we now look ahead to the third year of the Energy Web Chain’s growing prominence in the energy and crypto spaces, the cofounders remain as committed as ever to the Energy Web mission of accelerating the energy transition by unleashing the potential of blockchain and other digital technologies.</p><p>For example, RMI partnered with Energy Web and the Alliance for Innovative Regulation (AIR) earlier this year to launch the <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord</a>. Meanwhile, Grid Singularity has continued to focus on <a href="https://gridsingularity.com/d3a/">building energy market exchanges</a> on top of the Energy Web tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Thus on this EW Chain anniversary, we are pleased to share these statements from our cofounders, who are re-affirming their commitment to supporting the Energy Web Chain, the Energy Web Community, and the greater Energy Web ecosystem moving&nbsp;forward:</p> Statement from&nbsp;RMI <p>“RMI will continue to strongly support the value created by the Energy Web Foundation and the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System. As a steward of EWF’s mission and a broader champion of the energy transition, RMI commits to employ its EWT only where necessary to build new business models, engage in bonding and chain-related activities, and more broadly stimulate the advance of critical decentralized digital markets that support a rapid transition to a zero-carbon economy. We recognize that building a successful utility token platform will take time and know that EWF is well on its way to creating a world-changing model that fuses decentralized, low carbon generation with distributed ledgers and computing.”</p> Statement from Grid Singularity <p>“Grid Singularity will continue to strongly support the value created by the Energy Web Foundation and the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System. Grid Singularity intends to use held EWT to scale the development of the Grid Singularity energy exchange for peer-to-peer and community trading, to invest in community applications and to contribute to the next growth stage of EWF 2.0, leveraging Polkadot technology, such as by staking, bonding for parachains, and advancing on-chain governance.”</p><p>Their statements are a testament to their continued trust and investment in the potential of blockchain and other decentralized, digital technology—including the evolving Energy Web tech stack—to accelerate the energy transition.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-cofounders-rmi-and-grid-singularity-reaffirm-their-commitment-to-the-mission-81ef02df81bb">Energy Web Cofounders RMI and Grid Singularity Reaffirm Their Commitment to the Mission</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>New Alliance Promotes Wide Adoption of Free Tools that Make the World’s Digital Collections Accessible Now and Into the Future</p> 


<p>15 June 2021 – OASIS Open, the international open source and open standards consortium, and <a href="https://samvera.org/">Samvera</a>, an international open source community with best in class digital asset management solutions, are pleased to announce their Foundation-as-a-Service partnership. The program streamlines the process of forming and running foundations by letting groups operate independently while enjoying the benefits of the OASIS nonprofit corporate structure and expertise.</p>



<p>A vibrant community of information and technology professionals, Samvera’s suite of repository software tools offers flexible and rich user interfaces tailored to distinct content types on top of a robust back end, and can enable a wide range of repository solutions for the digital collections held by libraries, archives, museums, and other organizations.</p>



<p>“There is unanimous support in the Samvera Community for this transition to OASIS Open’s Foundation as a Service,” said Rosalyn Metz, Associate Dean of Library Technology and Digital Strategies at Emory University Libraries and Samvera Board Chair. “Being aligned with OASIS, while maintaining Samvera’s well established governance structure and sovereignty, gives us the best of both worlds. We believe this partnership will ensure our autonomy and help promote our sustainability.”</p>



<p>“We are excited to welcome Samvera to the OASIS community,” said Guy Martin, OASIS Executive Director. “This partnership was a natural fit for both of our organizations, as we share the values of inclusivity, openness, and transparency. We look forward to providing Samvera with administration &amp; governance support so that they can continue to focus on delivering value to their users and helping their open source community thrive.”</p>



<p>From its beginning in 2008, Samvera (originally called Hydra) set out to build a community to support and sustain its software, which is free and open source. The Samvera Community creates sustainable solutions using a common infrastructure within which there is flexibility to tailor solutions to local demands and workflow. Its partners include institutions, service providers, and other organizations that have formally committed to contributing to the Samvera Community.</p>



<p>“We are excited to partner with OASIS and have already benefited from the expertise of their program staff,” said Heather Greer Klein, Samvera Community Manager. “Foundation-as-a-Service is an excellent fit for the Samvera Community, and I believe this model offers a new approach to sustainable stewardship of open technologies that we’ve not seen before in the scholarly and cultural heritage ecosystem.”</p>



<p>OASIS welcomes inquiries from groups seeking to form or transition existing open source Foundations using the Foundation-as-a-Service Program.</p>

If the seller is providing the digital asset via URL, the timeframe for the use of the URL should be clearly communicated to the buyer. For example, the URL should be valid between the Digital Asset Start Date/Time and Digital Asset End Date/Time of the image file. If there is no Digital Asset Start Date/Time provided, the URL should be valid from the time the data is received.</p>   <p> </p>

<p>By Jason Keirstead, OASIS Open board member</p> 


<p>On May 12, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cyber Security</a>, charging U.S. federal agencies to partner with the private sector to foster a more secure cyberspace and protect the nation from malicious cyber actors. As both a board member as well as an active participant, I believe that OASIS Open’s members and projects are uniquely qualified to facilitate this public-private partnership and help guide the creation of cybersecurity standards.</p>



 Securing the Software Supply Chain 



<p>One key aspect outlined in Section 4 of the Executive Order (EO) is securing the software supply chain. At issue here is the reality that the U.S. federal government—like nearly any other organization on the planet that uses computer technology in any form—relies on not just one but numerous types of software to process data and run operational equipment. The sources of the software can vary—from proprietary software purchased from vendors to open source software downloaded from Git repositories to custom software created by in-house developers. To make matters more complex, most software today is itself a compilation of pieces of code that come from a variety of sources, with each component being inherently subject to flaws and vulnerabilities. In order to secure the software supply chain, we need to be able to document the provenance of software code, i.e, its origin and path of development or, as it is phrased in the legal field, the code’s “chain of custody.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One tool for documenting provenance is the Software Bill of Materials or “SBOM.” It’s a list of all the components that make up a codebase, the source of each component, the versions of those components, their patch status and the licenses that govern them. The concept of an SBOM is derived from manufacturing, where manufacturers keep detailed inventories of the parts that are used to build a product (such as a car) and the sources of those parts. Such bills of materials can be vital not only for production, procurement and maintenance purposes but also for initiating appropriate responses (e.g., a recall) when a part is found to be defective. Similarly, a software bill of materials is essential to responding quickly when vulnerabilities or security breaches are discovered in a piece of code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Members at OASIS have, for quite some time, been working on a standard that will be a critical feeder into SBOMs—<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=csaf">the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)</a>. CSAF is a standard way for vendors and open source projects to report vulnerabilities in their products to the outside world. SBOMs and CSAF go hand in hand; in fact, without the information that originates in CSAF, an SBOM cannot fulfil its purpose with respect to cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s an example of how SBOMs and CSAF create a cybersecurity feedback loop. Suppose you are managing Microsoft Windows. You’re using Python, and Python’s SBOM lists OpenSSL as a component. If the OpenSSL project issued a new CSAF advisory, the advisory could automatically cascade upstream to Python, and then cascade upstream again to Microsoft Windows. Microsoft could then issue its own CSAF advisory, essentially completing a virtuous feedback loop to help eliminate vulnerabilities throughout the supply chain.</p>



<p>Allan Friedman, the Director of Cybersecurity Initiatives at the US Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), is tasked with managing cybersecurity multi-stakeholder processes to bring together industry, academia, and the hacker community to tackle key security policy issues. He and his team are currently evaluating <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/ntia_sbom_formats_and_standards_whitepaper_-_version_20191025.pdf">options for SBOM standards and policies</a> and are already working closely with CSAF, because no matter how the standard gels, CSAF will play an essential role.</p>



 SBOMs Just Scratch the Surface of the EO Mandate 



<p>There is much, much more to the EO than SBOMs and the supply chain, and OASIS has much to offer in the other areas as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EO Section 2, for instance, is devoted to sharing threat intelligence. OASIS supports several standards that could play a role here, including:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti-stix">STIX,</a> a language for expressing cyber threat and observable information.  <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti-taxii">TAXII</a> is an application layer protocol for the communication of cyber threat information in a simple and scalable manner.  <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tac">TAC</a> is a common knowledge framework that enables semantic interoperability of threat actor contextual information and standardized vocabularies for threat actor characterization.  



<p>EO Section 3 deals with modernization. The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security">SAML</a> project is highly applicable here. Security Assertion Markup Language is an XML-based framework for communicating user authentication, entitlement, and attribute information. As its name suggests, SAML allows business entities to make assertions regarding the identity, attributes, and entitlements of a subject (an entity that is often a human user) to other entities, such as a partner company or another enterprise application.</p>



<p>EO Section 6 addresses the government’s need for a uniform series of playbooks for responding to vulnerabilities and incidents. OpenC2 and CACAO are ready-made for this challenge. <a href="https://openc2.org/">OpenC2</a> is a standardized language for the command and control of technologies that provide or support cyber defenses. By providing a common language for machine-to-machine communication, OpenC2 is vendor and application agnostic, enabling interoperability across a range of cyber security tools and applications.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cacao">CACAO</a> is a standard for defining and sharing cybersecurity playbooks, and how these playbooks can be created, documented, and shared in a structured and standardized way across organizational boundaries and technological solutions.&nbsp; It’s an ideal format for what the government wants to create.</p>



<p>EO Section 7 is focused on improving detection of vulnerability and incidents, which is what CSAF is all about, as I mentioned earlier.<br>And the <a href="https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/">OCA</a> is relevant to all of it. The OCA (Open Cybersecurity Alliance) is an ideal forum for vendors and entities who want to participate in an ecosystem where cybersecurity products interoperate without the need for customized integrations. Using community-developed standards and practices, OCA is simplifying integration across the threat lifecycle. As regulations to implement the EO become codified by CISA, NIST, and other federal agencies, a standards-based and vendor-neutral approach will be required in order to facilitate a healthy and competitive cybersecurity marketplace. The OCA is an ideal forum where this kind of cross-industry collaboration can and should take place.</p>



 Beyond Standards: Orchestrating Harmony &amp; Progress 



<p>Yes, many standards relevant to the EO are already in development under the OASIS umbrella. But the organization has more to offer this challenge than simply a library of projects: namely, its acumen for creating harmony and progress from heterogeneity and complexity.</p>



<p>OASIS Open is one of the most respected, non-profit standards bodies in the world. People and organizations join OASIS to advance projects for cybersecurity, blockchain, IoT, emergency management, cloud computing, legal data exchange, and much more. (You can check out all the projects <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/projects-committees/">here</a>.) The priceless asset OASIS offers its communities is the ability to harness the power of global collaboration to advance the fair, transparent development of open source software and standards. That’s what it’s going to take to address the challenges laid out in the EO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A common adage today is “it takes a village,” and I suppose that applies in the case of the EO. Certainly, industry has been given a mandate to help the U.S. government solve its cybersecurity challenges, but neither one nor many vendors with their proprietary solutions will be enough. Likewise, simply defining a standard—whether de facto or de jure—will not be enough. And although open source will certainly play a role (e.g., bridging the gap between a proprietary solution and the standard by building and testing reference implementations), open source alone can’t solve the problem either. Interoperability of solutions in this space, whether proprietary or open source, will require open standards that have been collaboratively built and designed with open integration in mind from the beginning.</p>



<p>It’s going to take a village—a harmonious combination of standards, vendor solutions, and open source—to accomplish this. Creating and nurturing that kind of village is precisely what OASIS does best.</p>

<p>Diplomas and Certificates no more falsifiable, thanks to the APP DIPLOMI on blockchain by T.S.C. srl on Commercio.network.</p>
<p>18 students of the Re-Europe training path for young graduates , will receive in Herculaneum their certificates with electronic delivery (eDelivery) on blockchain.</p>
<p>Ercolano, June 14th, 2021 ,</p>
<p>18 students of the Re Europe training path, to enhance the skills necessary to support the management of European and regional funds, will receive their certificates that will be certified on blockchain.</p>
<p>The benefits of using this innovative technology in the school environment and consequently also for the working context are many.</p>
<p>The first is certainly to allow all parties involved, such as students, colleges, universities and companies, to easily and immediately verify if the digital diploma in possession is the original one and does not present alterations from the one produced by the Institute or by the ‘Issuing Body.</p>
<p>Thanks to the solution developed by T.S.C Technology srl and to the use of the blockchain technology of Commercio.network the students will be able to guarantee the authenticity and the integrity of their electronic diplomas and certificates to potential employers all over the world, in a simple and immediate way.</p>
<p>In fact, this innovative solution allows students to generate an electronic diploma or certificate. Each digital document has a unique and unchangeable fingerprint. This fingerprint is recorded in an unchangeable way on the blockchain, through a special transaction called ShareDOC. This transaction certifies the electronic delivery (eDelivery) of the diploma from the Issuing Institution to a student’s personal wallet (ewallet) that can in the future contain all of the student’s educational and biographical information while maintaining the highest degree of privacy currently possible.</p>
<p>The electronic certificate visually looks like a classic paper diploma, where all the identifying information is present: school year, name of the student, name of the school or institution, type of course attended, date and place.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not simply a matter of having a digitized copy of a paper certificate.&nbsp; Due to its decentralized nature, blockchain technology cannot be tampered with, and the certification of graduation remains forever.</p>
<p>The blockchain record contains encrypted information without any personal data, and therefore cannot be directly traced to the student at all.</p>
<p>The adoption of blockchain in schools is already law in Malta and is used on an experimental basis in several prestigious universities abroad such as MIT in Boston, Holberton School in San Francisco and Imperial College in London. In Italy, a few institutions have launched similar initiatives, waiting for the school system to massively adopt these solutions.</p>

		<p>In short, the way to [advancement], if you desire it, is as plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on two words: industry and frugality.</p>
<p>–Benjamin Franklin<br>
‘The Way to Wealth” (1758)</p>
<p>Technology investment is regarded by many leaders as the single most strategic investment that institutions of higher learning can make to accelerate their mission and achieve their business strategy in a timely and effective manner. Yet, all too often institution senior leadership bemoan the fact that technology investment continues to increase as a share of annual operational expense while returning little return on that investment. This dilemma begs a few questions. First, why is this the case ? What can/should leadership do to extract maximum value from their escalating technology costs?</p>
<p>Ideally, technology should be an accelerator for higher education, yet many institutions suffer chronically from overpriced and under utilized technology assets.&nbsp; Over time these assets become expenses that do&nbsp; little more than keep the lights on for an institution, constraining IT leaders from emerging as thought leaders in support of the overall institutional mission and vision.&nbsp; The effort required to maintain legacy systems often prevents IT from emerging as a strategic asset that is able to meet the wants and needs of faculty, students, and staff.&nbsp; The unwise investments lead to the law of diminishing returns as these technology investments chip away at the institution’s balance of technology expense versus value.&nbsp; This is evinced annually through the escalating price of licensing and maintenance fees for hardware, software, and technical services which in reality produces very little improvement to automation, workflow, or true cloud hosting and cloud management. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding to key functional officer and executive stakeholder frustration, these same technologies often accrue increasing indirect expenses in the form of time spent by the resident-based functional office and technical office labor resources, namely people, and the good people&nbsp; always seem to bear the brunt of the burden.&nbsp; Shadow IT organizations emerge, that is, functional office staff self-modifying or sometimes by management decree perform more and more duties aligned with that of technical professionals as a result of underutilized technology, slow and poor upgrades and configurations.&nbsp; Shadow IT also emerges because actual IT spend increases the amount of knowledge, skill, and effort required to maintain information systems as opposed to maturing them. This lack of technical professional unity results in haphazard cybersecurity protocols whenever new tools are supplied by functional offices to authenticate behind the firewall, whereas they ought to be demanded by functional offices and supplied by a centralized IT authority, or at a minimum, a decentralized IT community that is centralized on standard operating procedures, practices, and policies through formal and executive sponsored governance.&nbsp; I’m fine with shadow IT, so long as it stands in the shadow of my department.&nbsp; In the worst of these scenarios, and unfortunately all too common, technology is refreshed as an annual budget surprise to the CIO and the CFO because of poor planning in IT management ranks, and the lack of coordination with functional office managers, resulting in sudden death (i.e., premature-obsolescence) of the technology system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The opportunity cost couldn’t be more clear; the same functional and technical staff would best serve each other, the faculty, students, and the institutional mission if they could afford sufficient time to evolve and mature their knowledge, skill, and effort so as to keep up with the latest trends, reduce costs through improved efficiency, and add value through increased output, in other words; accelerate.&nbsp; Some accelerators include, but are not limited to; cabinet leadership enterprise thinking regarding information systems and data governance, reorganizing IT into its various IT reference disciplines (e.g., network, security, cloud, user support, emerging technologies etc.) and empowering its staff to achieve excellence in their specialization.&nbsp; Lackluster and legacy IT departments, staff, and tools cause presidents, CFOs, Deans, faculty, and more, to assert technology as an expensive cost center, as opposed to a valuable investment, to evoke cliches for technology resources and IT leadership such as “the gift that keeps on giving.”</p>
<p>Begs The Question – Savings, Capital, and Technology<br>
Okay Mr. Smart guy, then what’s the silver bullet?&nbsp; Well, none exists, but the application of business and social science to assist information technology/information systems management is an option.&nbsp; Economists in this space have been gathering and synthesizing data into useful information and wisdom for over a century, Nobel prizes have been awarded for theoretical proofs leading to practical benefits and heuristics, and application of these by microeconomic entrepreneurs have evinced their real value.&nbsp; Classical and neoclassical economists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Ludwig Von Mises asserted institutions would best serve themselves, their constituency, and the overall economy through frugality and savings.&nbsp; Others, such as John Maynard Keynes and new keynesian economists Stanley Fischer and Gregory Mankiw, assert that while this may work for individuals and firms, there may be antithetical results at higher levels of aggregation in economic policy, hence the paradox of thrift. Still, both major schools of economic thought agree that the best microeconomic policy for individual decision makers and collective wills of the institution (the firm), in public, private, and non-profit sectors is one that incorporates frugality in expenses and a strong focus on savings in both purchasing power as well capital planning and services.</p>
<p>Technical Progress<br>
Economist Robert Solow, Nobel Prize winner, Harvard graduate, and professor of technology and growth economics at MIT, discovered something of significance for the world of enterprise as well as key decision makers of public and non-profit institutions that he refers to as the Solow Growth Model.&nbsp; First, he concluded that savings and frugality has a positive impact on growth, but that savings, frugality, and capital planning are subject to the law of diminishing returns just like anything.&nbsp; Second, Solow calculated that about four fifths (⅘ths) of growth in output per worker was attributable to technological progress and entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Technology seems to be more important to institutional economic growth, when acquired and adopted correctly, than savings, frugality, labor, research and development, and natural resources.&nbsp; According to Solow, increasing saving and capital investment, even with aid, isn’t enough to stimulate growth; the adoption of technology is essential.</p>
<p>Finally, entrepreneurship and technology subject matter expertise are in short supply and high demand, especially in our volatile time due to the pandemic.&nbsp; Because of the constant change in technology and business process, exasperated by the recent pandemic, it is of paramount importance that higher education institutions partner for success with the right experts and innovators.&nbsp; Subject matter experts, leaders, and innovators who possess the knowledge, skill, and ability as well the solutions and services to truly add value and accelerate the mission of higher education.&nbsp; Expertise and knowledge alone are not enough. Partners who have deliberately defined, designed, and applied this expertise and knowledge for the benefit of institutions by way of a defined ecosystem of solutions and services are necessary for real value to be rendered.&nbsp; As a non-profit minded organization, given birth by to by a highly esteemed council of university and college presidents, Edge represents the quintessential technology solutions and services organization as it has proven itself to be a maturely formed ecosystem of technology solutions, services, experts, and innovators who have aligned with every aspect of the student lifecycle to render real value to the higher education community.&nbsp; Our approach is an economic advancement one, it is a results based approach that leverages the collective and collaborative power of a fully mature technological economy that is at the ready and forefront always to serve the mission of higher education.</p>

 If we accept the premise that on the Internet “if you’re not paying, you’re the product”, in the Metaverse you will become a walking — talking billboard. The Metaverse, art by the author of this post <a href="https://www.picmonkey.com/legal/tos">under license by PicMonkey</a>. Intro: Video games&nbsp;now <p>Amongst the changes that “lockdowns” and “new normality” have brought, there is a revalorization of digital interactions as valuable and meaningful. Ironically, what was once regarded as isolationist or a poor substitute for “real life” (an expression used as an interchangeable semantic proxy for “in-person”) experiences, has become the glue that holds the social fabric together.</p><p>Connecting in and through digital spaces has been a staple of 2020: from work or formal education moving to online alternatives, to recreational uses of video platforms. In these virtual spaces, human ingenuity has found new testing grounds to deal with the challenges presented by the pandemic. It can be a thoughtful provocation to say that since lockdowns started, we might have been living in a proto-version of the Metaverse.</p><p>The silver lining is an accelerated digital transformation, even for those areas traditionally reluctant to innovate or that deemed remoteness incompatible with organizational culture (like small businesses adopting digital payments as opposed to inveterate cash-only business practices, or governmental bureaucracies offering online alternatives to otherwise mandatory in-person procedures).</p><p>Amidst this burgeoning digital life, video games have experienced an influx of new players, <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/game-engagement-during-covid-pandemic-adds-15-billion-to-global-games-market-revenue-forecast/">growing revenue</a>, and newfound mainstream respect. One year after designating video game addiction as a <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/addictive-behaviours-gaming-disorder">mental health disorder</a>, the OMS has taken a more nuanced position, acknowledging their positive value for socialization.</p><p>Beyond their collective value, in times of uncertainty video games constitute a space to regain some sense of control and security, as well as a place to <a href="https://anormallostphone.com/">exercise empathy</a>. By design, challenges in gaming are presented to the player with the implicit promise that they can be solved with the tools provided beforehand, and the skills gained along the way. Good game design will equip players with prerequisite skills and knowledge to arrive at that stage with a chance of success, and never confront them with a challenge that is impossible to win. With the unspoken pact that there is always -at least- one guaranteed possibility of triumph, losing just becomes a matter of trying but not a failure. With the reassurance of success looming ahead, losing becomes just another moving part of the game, a rehearsal in the path to&nbsp;winning.</p><p>Considering games as a narrative medium that separates itself from others by its interactivity, gaming presents unprecedented potential as a rehearsal space for empathy. When we play, we are able to try a different skin and participate in a story from a privileged insider perspective that no other medium can&nbsp;match.</p><p>Video games are consumed not only by playing but also by communal activities like engaging in watching others play. Streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube are popular amongst youth due to the added value of interpersonal interaction, a sense of belonging, and community building.</p><p>The Metaverse, defined as an encompassing, persistent, virtual world, can be seen as the newest iteration of the Internet, both an evolutionary step and a fusion of social networks and online gaming. As gaming becomes more ubiquitous and social media platforms resort to gamification mechanics to promote interaction between users, the frontiers between these two worlds tend to blur: platforms become games and games take the place of social media spaces. Twitch, which started as a platform to watch other people play games, has evolved into a community-building space where games are also played with the audience, by using overlays and gamified mechanics of interaction.</p><p>Fortnite has been a pioneer in this space, not only with its “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lJlaP-2HY">Party Royale</a>” mode and providing concerts and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/fortnite-is-screening-an-entire-christopher-nolan-movie-for-free/">movie screenings</a> (separated from the core gameplay but organically integrated as a whole) but also by creating a gaming experience that incentivizes socialization. Gaming platforms have become the new town square, where bonds, friendships, and rivalries are forged over voice&nbsp;chat.</p><p>Besides social aspects of play, in a receding economy for industries related to in-person activities (affected by the pandemic through overstressed supply chains and reduced demand), the video game industry and its ecosystem have been one of the few to increment growth. With changes in consumer behavior driven by stay-at-home routines, it is no surprise that fashion, movies, and other related domains are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gucci-roblox-76339d10f139e9b0d39761bd8426c11e">moving into digital spaces</a> and seeking to create digital doppelgangers of the goods and services they provide in the tangible world. Marketing and advertising are <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/01/the-metaverse-needs-responsible-stewardship-not-greedy-predators/">increasingly interested in the Metaverse</a>, as the next frontier for expanding their brand’s business and targeting prospective new audiences.</p><p>The recent explosion of the NFTs market is a closely related phenomenon, and its rise is partly attributable to their ability to create artificial scarcity. Through maiming their essentially infinitely replicable with near-zero marginal cost attribute, NFTs provide to digital goods the non-fungibility characteristic of analog goods. Decentralized blockchain applications and NFT’s based business models allow the creation of secondary markets for digital goods, providing a foundational economic backbone for the Metaverse.</p><p>Paired with advancements in VR/XR and AR technology, investment and <a href="https://epicgames.com/site/th/news/announcing-a-1-billion-funding-round-to-support-epics-long-term-vision-for-the-metaverse">funding</a> attracting new <a href="https://www.oculus.com/facebook-horizon/">players</a>, all of these factors converge into creating a critical juncture for the pursuit of the Metaverse.</p> “Metaverse/s” and virtual&nbsp;worlds <p>The term Metaverse is attributed to Neal Stephenson and his book Snow Crash, a novel about a protagonist (actually, a Hiro Protagonist) interacting in a persistent, immersive, shared, virtual&nbsp;world.</p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/30455994@N03/4955876395">“Neal Stephenson — Snow Crash”</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/30455994@N03">RA.AZ</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;atype=rich">CC BY&nbsp;2.0</a><p>The concept, which both echoes and modifies the idea of “cyberspace,” a term popularized by the 1984 William Gibson novel “Neuromancer,” has been revisited in other sci-fi works like Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. Both movie and book portray OASIS (which stands for Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), as a massively multiplayer online simulation accessible via haptic devices, that hosts entertainment, commercial and educative hubs.</p><p>People will participate in these spaces through a digital representation of themselves, as avatars or skins, that could assume any possible shape or form. Restrictions will probably come from the terms of service, community standards or policies, intellectual property infringements, or licensing requirements.</p><p>The Metaverse is different from virtual worlds in the sense that it aspires to contain all or several of these virtual worlds, or at least, to create interoperable gateways to connect them, functioning as an all-encompassing, unified portal and hub. That poses an interesting tension between the pretended decentralization where blockchain advocates see an intersection with the Metaverse, against its own monopolistic proposition. One friction that only can be solved by creating a pipeline of true interoperability, both technical and legal, that enables the flow and uniform treatment of data (by uniform data protection laws) and content (likewise, for intellectual property regulations).</p><p>The architecture of the Metaverse can be fragmented into several attributes that should be checked by those aspiring candidates:</p>  ubiquity: the Metaverse will need to encompass different aspects of human experience, from leisure to education, finances, political expression, etc. <a href="https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/cybersex-second-life/Content?oid=80223585">Adult clubs</a> have a prominent role in Second&nbsp;Life.  synchronicity; with events happening in real-time or a shared time-scale  interconnection: allowing the transition between several virtual worlds (relevant questions here will be about the portability of digital goods from one world to another, and if they will remain functional)  persistent, implying that events will take place at its pace no matter whether the person remains or not logged; and that they can`t probably be reset or modified (as in loading a saved&nbsp;game)  virtual/ immersive; being a digital representation that sets the Metaverse apart from AR interfaces that add layers of extended meanings and content to the physical&nbsp;world.  collective and shared; as in virtual worlds populated by other beings ( question remains if human,<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8410872"> artificial,</a> or&nbsp;both)  <p>Necessarily, it should provide a self-representation construct (in the form of skins, avatars, or any sort of digital manifestation able to interact within the virtual world), and arguably, building tools that enable creative outlets for the expansion of these worlds through a <a href="https://blog.siggraph.org/2019/10/siggraph-spotlight-episode-30-tim-sweeney-and-the-metaverse.html/">creator-centric </a>approach.</p><p>Questions remain on how those spaces will be adjudicated and governed. The answers to that will shape further attributes, such as: openness, decentralization, portability, artificial scarcity, and interoperability (allowing to interface with other applications, not just to create with the building tools provided as in user-generated content).</p><p>The core idea behind the Metaverse proposition is to create an immersive digital place that duplicates reality without physical constraints. Nevertheless, that doesn’t necessarily imply that real-world rules don’t apply in the Metaverse. Paraphrasing an iconic Morpheus quote from The Matrix, “some rules can be bent, others can be broken”, and even when the laws of physics may not apply, that most certainly won’t be the case of intellectual property rules and other regulatory frameworks. Governance challenges arise in similar ways to those already existing around the Internet, only to be enhanced by the invasive and intimate nature of this immersive technology with sensors and devices connected close to the body and extracting biometric sensitive data, -like eye-tracking devices-, that is ripe for abuse. Digital wellbeing and the <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/mm/2013/fox-chb-sexualized-virtual-selves.pdf">effects of virtual embodiment representations</a> should be carefully considered.</p>The Matrix, one of the cornerstones of simulation narratives.<p>Adding to that, the fact that it will be a privatized playground, with the potential to construct inferences by statistical mining; and the use of generative artificial intelligence paired with biometric data raises high privacy and self-determination concerns, in an ecosystem that could further lead to reinforcing tech- solipsism tendencies.</p><p>Even with strong contenders like <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/680139/minecraft-active-players-worldwide/">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox</a>, or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/04/17/fortnite-metaverse-new-internet/">Fortnite</a>, that already have a huge player base and infrastructure to become aspiring Metaverses, the fact remains that there is still none that can claim the title. In the meanwhile, digital rights communities, academics, and policymakers should remain vigilant, and engage in this brave, new, virtual&nbsp;world.</p><p>(Note: This article is an excerpt of a forthcoming paper on the Metaverse and its governance).</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-metaverse-a-brave-new-virtual-world-2f040cbae7d4">The Metaverse: A brave, new (virtual) world</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Welcome to the Challenge</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance is pleased to announce our first global FIDO Developer Challenge, where participating developer teams will create and demonstrate compelling and innovative applications leveraging FIDO standards and technologies.  Prior challenges based in&nbsp;Korea over the past two years proved to be very successful and&nbsp; we are now pleased to expand this program globally.</p>



<p>FIDO has come a long way since the Alliance’s inception in 2012, going from a whiteboard concept to a core technology supported by billions of consumer devices worldwide.&nbsp; With over 85% of browsers now supporting FIDO Authentication, now is the time for web developers to ditch password-based logins in favor of FIDO’s approach, which provides a superior user experience and prevents phishing and other computer&nbsp;hacks.  We are looking forward to seeing the selection&nbsp; of implementations the developer community comes up with this year, leveraging the public FIDO2 WebAuthn API to bring FIDO Authentications to websites and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Projects we are looking for&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are looking for projects that address a technical or social challenge in today’s world. There is no limit on the development ideas, but we expect implementation of FIDO Authentication to take place in various fields such as Fintech, eCommerce, IoT, retail, blockchain, gaming and education. Samples from the previous regional challenge include projects like FIDO-based IoT storage services for low-income families, FIDO-based drone platforms, FIDO-based smart home security systems, FIDO- and DID-based smart health insurance card services and a FIDO-based passwordless WiFi router control system. We are happy to expand this year’s program globally to attract even more innovative ideas to solve technical and social challenges.</p>



<p>The process</p>



<p>The FIDO Developer Challenge takes place in a virtual format and focuses on implementation of the FIDO2 WebAuthn API. The Challenge is open to students, individual developers, and pre-seed stage venture companies only.</p>



<p>Our website contains all the details on how to participate in the FIDO Developer Challenge. Here are a few milestones we are looking forward to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  We will be accepting applications until July 2. Upon receiving applications from all over the world, we will do the initial screenings and announce the top 20 teams within two weeks of the application submission deadline.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then, we will invite 20 teams to implement the FIDO2 WebAuthn API in their inventions, online services or products.  The teams that successfully implement FIDO2 will be invited to the final evaluation step, where they will give an online presentation and demo. They will also&nbsp; participate in a Q&amp;A with our judges.  The judges will select the top three teams, all of which will be featured in a session at our Authenticate conference (Oct 18-20 in Seattle, WA; USA), with the winner being offered the opportunity to attend with all their expenses paid by the FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Prizes and opportunities</p>



<p>In addition to exposure at Authenticate, the top three teams will receive prizes from FIDO members, awarded public recognition, and the unique opportunity to share their business vision with panels of early-stage investors. More details can be found on the Challenge website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We encourage you to think outside the box, considering new experiences and benefits that FIDO can bring to users and developers alike. Best of luck to you all. We cannot wait to see your submissions!</p>

<p>Me2B Alliance’s&nbsp;Head of Validation Research,&nbsp;Noreen Whysel,&nbsp;recently presented&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theiaconference.com/session/shedding-light-on-dark-patterns-a-case-study-on-digital-harms/">“Shedding Light on Dark Patterns: A Case Study in Digital Harms,”</a>&nbsp;at the 2021&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theiaconference.com/">Information Architecture Conference</a>.&nbsp;Whysel’s presentation was aimed at the digital creators&nbsp;in attendance. These&nbsp;designers, developers and product managers&nbsp;are responsible for developing&nbsp;technology products, and thus&nbsp;may&nbsp;perpetuate harmful or&nbsp;disrespectful patterns.&nbsp;Social media companies designing addictive apps – on purpose – is an extreme example of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whysel&nbsp;began&nbsp;the talk&nbsp;by&nbsp;describing the&nbsp;Me2B&nbsp;Alliance’s approach to&nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/about/principles/">respectful technology behavior</a> and her contribution to our standards development and independent testing work.&nbsp;&nbsp;She then introduced the product integrity framework based on the Me2B Alliance’s Respectful Technology Specification, currently in development. The Specification incorporates routine information architecture heuristics and prioritizes clear communication with users – especially regarding their control over what they do and share, as well as what data may be collected from them. Whysel’s presentation included examples of <a href="https://me2ba.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Marketing/EeYWAV1wqqNNj77iE86ijZUBBPtlpg2uHQwQ22vzDfXSgA?e=uvwcRt">digital harms</a>&nbsp;known as&nbsp;“dark patterns.”&nbsp;She also&nbsp;encouraged the audience to rethink&nbsp;the&nbsp;labels&nbsp;themselves, asking,&nbsp;“is&nbsp;calling it a ‘Dark Pattern’ itself a dark pattern?”&nbsp;—&nbsp;pointing out the <a href="https://exygy.com/blog/racist-language-in-software/">inherent racism</a> of describing negative things as dark.&nbsp;She closed with advice on how to&nbsp;work with&nbsp;digital creators&nbsp;to&nbsp;avoid harmful patterns&nbsp;and&nbsp;create a path toward&nbsp;healthy&nbsp;technology&nbsp;relationships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>June 10, 2021, Geneva Switzerland: After more than a year of pandemic restrictions, resulting in a greater than 70% decline in travel and tourism activity, health status exchange will enable economies and borders to reopen. On February 9th, 2021, the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> (GHPC) was launched to build an interoperable bridge blueprint to accommodate varying standards-based health credential formats, driven by disparate governing authorities to serve the complex travel industry.</p><p>To implement a subset of its recommendations, on June 8th, 2021, <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH) announced the facilitation of the Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN), a network of expert collaborators to facilitate trust building and interoperable exchange of COVID certificates for safe reopening of borders globally by operationalizing the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.</p><blockquote><p>“The first wave of apps for proving one’s COVID status did not allow that proof to be shown beyond a single state or nation, did not avoid vendor lock-in, and did not distinguish between rich health data and simple passes. The Blueprint gives this industry a way to solve those issues while meeting a high bar for privacy and integrity, and GCCN turns those plans into action.”</p></blockquote><p>Brian Behlendorf, General Manager for Blockchain, Healthcare and Identity at the Linux Foundation</p>

The Blueprint addresses – in considerable depth and detail – nine technical and interoperability challenges around which global consensus must be reached:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Consistent User Experience</p>  <p>Security, Privacy, and Data Protection</p>  <p>Identity Binding</p>  <p>Standard Data Models and Elements</p>  <p>Credential Formats, Signatures, and Protocols&nbsp;</p>  <p>Paper Credentials</p>  <p>Rules Engines</p>  <p>Trust Registries</p>  <p>Governance and Trust Frameworks</p>  <p>The nine drafting groups brought together more than 120 experts from the health, travel, and technology sectors, managed through a partnership with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> – a <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects">Linux Foundation project</a>.</p><p>On June 7th, 2021, GHPC announced the release of their eagerly-anticipated Blueprint in draft form [download <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/download/attachments/76241/GHPC%20Interoperability%20Blueprint_v1.0.0_June%207%202021.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1623073365535&amp;api=v2&amp;download=true">here</a>] for three weeks of stakeholder consultations and public comments. The primary intention of the announcement was to stimulate discussion at the <a href="https://www.g7uk.org/">G7 Summit</a>, which opens on Friday, June 11th, in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, UK.</p><p>Paul Knowles, Head of the Advisory Council at the Human Colossus Foundation, co-led the Standard Data Models and Elements drafting group, one of the nine interconnected GHPC drafting groups, to spearhead group recommendations on data elements, common models for data exchange, and semantic harmonization. The recommendations of that drafting group will help to enable data interoperability without putting any undue burden on existing health systems and workflows.&nbsp;</p><p>Key recommendations from the Standard Data Models and Elements drafting group include:</p>  <p>Data elements. The drafting group specified standard data elements for three COVID-19 credentials —vaccination, test, and recovery— based on the European Commission’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/policy/network_en">eHealth Network</a> recommendations. The group also defined data elements for a standard travel pass consisting of name, date of birth, and an event-specific status indicator;&nbsp;</p>  <p>A common model for data exchange. To standardize and facilitate the exchange, sharing, and storing of data from multiple sources, the drafting group specified <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/">HL7 FHIR (release 4)</a> as a common data model for COVID-19 credentialing initiatives to promote interoperability between systems that encode healthcare data in different ways.; and</p>  <p>Semantic harmonization. The final group recommendation was <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/cjzegoi58xgpfzwxyrqlroy48dihwz">Overlays Capture Architecture</a> (OCA) as a solution for semantic harmonization between data models and data representation formats, devised explicitly for data object interoperability, acting as a catalyst for standardized credential issuance in multiple languages.</p>  <blockquote><p>“Digital health passes offer our best hope to safely, confidently, and promptly restore global travel and restart the global economy – but only if they are widely trusted and adopted by the public and universally accepted by airlines and border control agencies. The standards proposed in the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint will make it possible for digital health pass systems around the world to be interoperable with one another, thus creating a trusted, convenient, and seamless experience for travellers as well as for airlines, airports, and border control agencies.”</p></blockquote><p>Dakota Gruener, Executive Director, ID2020</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


 <blockquote><p>“To allow international travel to resume safely, we must take every possible step to limit the spread of new Covid-19 variants. We urgently need an internationally-recognised system of health passes so that travellers can quickly and easily prove their health status, in a way that is secure and privacy-preserving. The Good Health Pass Collaborative is doing critical work to develop the standards we need to support this. Now political leaders need to lend their weight to this effort. The G7 group of nations should commit to establish a network of globally interoperable health passes, and set up the necessary working groups to deliver it.”</p></blockquote><p>Tony Blair, Executive Chairman of Tony Blair Institute for Global Change and Former UK Prime Minister</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


&nbsp;<p>Linux Foundation Public Health creates the Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN) </p><p>[Official LFPH press release <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linux-foundation-public-health-creates-the-global-covid-certificate-network-gccn-301307874.html">here</a> | Official LFPH blog post <a href="https://www.lfph.io/2021/06/08/gccn/">here</a>]</p><p>To implement a subset of its recommendations, on June 8th, 2021, LFPH announced the launch of GCCN, a network of expert collaborators to provide technical implementation guidance to operationalize the Blueprint. GCCN will include a global directory of trust registries to enable cross-border certificate verification, and be a home for toolkits and community-managed support for those building and managing COVID certificate systems. This next phase of implementation will help governments and public health authorities (PHAs) to build interoperable solutions respecting privacy with the aim to reopen international borders.</p><p>GCCN will implement a technological framework in a bid to enable citizens to move safely and freely across borders during the global COVID pandemic. The defined infrastructure hopes to allow interoperable and trustworthy exchanges of COVID certificates between countries for safe travel.</p><p>To knit together all of the necessary components and gain sufficient momentum behind the launch of GCCN, the network partners have focused on alignment with the EU Member States and other key organizations implementing COVID systems for governments and industry alliances.</p><blockquote><p>“We are interested to learn about how LFPH is taking bold steps in creating the Global COVID Certificate Network in order to facilitate trust building and interoperability for safe borders reopening, since it still seems that there are many challenges and barriers to overcome, for example the need for a European eID agreement. The Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) Panel of the European Parliament (EP) is looking into the challenges that the pandemic has introduced, and also we explore potential technological solutions and their impact based on scientific data, credible sources of information and the respect of the European values. I look forward to the next steps of the LFPH that could provide us with more ideas and insights on strategies that enhance the use of a certificate in a safe way, and also to provide further technical options for the EU that could be adopted and could help and enable our system to work in a harmonised way. As soon as we achieve that, then we could immediately share the methodology to connect with the rest of the world and move to the new normal of our post COVID digital era, always in respect of the European charter for human rights and the regulation for privacy and personal data.”</p></blockquote><p>Eva Kaili, MEP and Chair of the STOA Panel of the European Parliament</p>

<p>Blockchain Product Design = Design Thinking + Lean Startup + Agile</p>
<p>Blockchain Product Design is a method that combines three known and respected approaches to addressing each of these stages:</p>
<p>Design Thinking: empathize with users, define and ideate<br>
Lean Startup: turn ideas into business models and test if a market exists<br>
Agile: build and deliver product incrementally and faster through Agile processes.</p>
<p>Design Thinking (Problem/Solution fit)</p>
<p>Design Thinking is an interattive process in which we seek to understand the user’s problem, question assumptions, and redefine problems in order to create new Blockchain-based strategies and solutions. Unlike “Brainstorming”, Design Thinking promotes “Painstorming” to fully understand the user’s “pain” or problem.</p>
<p>The steps of Design Thinking are as follows:</p>
<p>Empathize with users.<br>
Define users’ needs, their problems.<br>
Ideate by questioning assumptions and creating innovative hypotheses.<br>
Develop a Blockchain Proof of Concept (POC) of these solutions.</p>
<p>Design Thinking is a user-centered approach to innovation to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.</p>
<p>Lean Startup (Product/Market fit)</p>
<p>Lean Startup is a methodology for business and product development that aims to shorten product development cycles and quickly discover whether a proposed business model is viable. This is achieved by adopting a combination of business hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning.</p>
<p>The steps of Lean Startup are as follows:</p>
<p>Create a business model based on the Blockchain problem and solution.<br>
Test the solution and get feedback from customers.<br>
Move interactively from a POC to the Blockchain. Minimum Viable Product by listening to customer feedback.<br>
Understand if there is a market for this Blockchain Minimum Viable Product by finding paying customers/users.</p>
<p>Globally, 90% of startups fail (Forbes) and the main reason is market failure: “They make products no one wants”(Fortune). The Lean Startup methodology originated in Silicon Valley in the 1990s, but the use of the word “lean” has its roots in Toyota’s lean manufacturing system. Toyota’s lean manufacturing system was used to build things efficiently, but it doesn’t say what should be built.</p>
<p>Using the words of Eric Ries:</p>
<p>“Lean Startup provides a scientific approach to creating and managing startups and getting the desired product into the hands of customers faster. It is a principled approach to new product development.”</p>
<p>Agile (scale)</p>
<p>Agile is a scalable way of working, based on iterative development, incremental delivery and continuous re-evaluation of a product. Primarily used in software development, it is based on a clear idea of the product concept and its market. Unlike the idea of focusing on a set of features to be developed, Agile focuses on high-value features first.</p>
<p>Agile is about producing tangible, working results after each iteration. According to the twelve principles of the Agile Manifesto, “Working software is the primary measure of progress.”</p>

<p>Two new Project Specifications from the OSLC Open Project start the 60-day public review that precedes the call for consent as an OASIS Standard.&nbsp;</p> 


<p>OASIS and the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) Open Project [1] are pleased to announce that OSLC Core Version 3.0 and OSLC Query Version 3.0 are now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>The OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) initiative applies Linked Data principles, such as those defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP), to create a cohesive set of specifications that can enable products, services, and other distributed network resources to interoperate successfully.</p>



<p>OSLC Core defines the overall approach to Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration based specifications and capabilities that extend and complement the W3C Linked Data Platform. The OP received 3 Statements of Use from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, SodiusWillert, and IBM [2].</p>



<p>OSLC Query provides a mechanism for a client to query or search for RDF resources that match a given criteria. The response to a successful query includes the RDF of a query result container that references the member resources found by the query, and optionally includes selected properties of each member resource. The OP has received 3 Statements of Use from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Koneksys, and IBM [3].</p>

<p>Thank you to all Corporate members who voted in the new 2021 OpenID Foundation Corporate Member Representative election.</p>
<p>Each year, Corporate members of the OpenID Foundation elect a member to represent them on the board. <a href="https://openid.net/2021/02/09/2021-openid-foundation-board-update/">Ashish Jain was elected by Corporate members during the 2021 elections</a> that were conducted in January 2021. Ashish was at eBay at the time of his nomination and being elected but soon after left eBay and joined Arkose Labs at Chief Product Officer. Arkose Labs then joined the Foundation.</p>
<p>The Foundation’s bylaws Section 5.4(e) provides that&nbsp;vacancies&nbsp;in the Board of Directors “(e)&nbsp;of a corporate director&nbsp;due to the resignation&nbsp;… of such director,&nbsp;shall be filled in an election by the corporate members&nbsp;…”</p>
<p>Per the bylaws, the Foundation conducted a new election with a request for nominations. All Corporate members were eligible to nominate and vote for candidates with Ashish Jain and Dale Olds with VMware nominating themselves for this new election.</p>
<p>I am very pleased to welcome Ashish Jain, Chief Product Officer at Arkose Labs, to the Board as Corporate Member Representative. Ashish served on the Foundation board in the past and has been a contributor over the years.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Dale Olds of VMware, for his continued support of the Foundation and participating in this most recent election. Dale served as the Corporate Member Representative for the last few years and like so many in our community, I appreciate his contributions to the Foundation and the community at large.</p>
<p>I want to thank all Foundation board of directors for their service and contributions to the OpenID Foundation.</p>

 Good Health Pass Collaborative Releases Draft Blueprint for Digital Health Passes in Advance of G7&nbsp;Summit <p>In an effort to restore global travel and restart the global economy, the <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> today announced the release of the eagerly-anticipated <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org">Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint</a>.</p><p>The Blueprint — released today in draft form for a three-week period of stakeholder consultations and public comment — is intended to stimulate discussion at the G7 Summit, which will open Friday in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, UK.</p><p>This announcement follows on the heels of a May 18 letter, sent by the Good Health Pass Collaborative to G7 leaders, urging them to adopt a statement of principles for digital health passes. The letter also called for the formation of a working group — composed of senior ministerial staff from G7, G20, and European Union health and transport ministries — with the task of reaching an international consensus on standards by July&nbsp;16.</p><p>Unprecedented global collaboration — between governments, nonprofits, universities, and the private sector — propelled the rapid development and distribution of highly effective COVID vaccines. A similar level of collaboration is urgently needed to ensure that verifiable digital health passes for international travel can be issued and universally accepted worldwide by airlines, border control agencies, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>Most governments already require proof of travelers’ COVID status — either through a recent negative test or, increasingly, proof of vaccination– as a precondition of entry. While dozens of solutions have been rushed to market to meet this growing demand, they vary greatly in the extent to which they protect user privacy and security and enable individuals to control access to their personal health information.</p><p>The absence of internationally recognized, consensus-based open standards — to which all solutions adhere — could leave individuals uncertain about the security and privacy of their data and even unsure of whether their health pass will be accepted for&nbsp;travel.</p><blockquote>“Digital health passes offer our best hope to safely, confidently, and promptly restore global travel and restart the global economy — but only if they are widely trusted and adopted by the public and universally accepted by airlines and border control agencies,” said ID2020 executive director, Dakota Gruener. “The standards proposed in the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint will make it possible for digital health pass systems around the world to be interoperable with one another, thus creating a trusted, convenient, and seamless experience for travelers as well as for airlines, airports, and border control agencies.”</blockquote><p>Restoring international travel is vital to restarting the global economy. The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that 61.6 million tourism-related jobs worldwide have been lost as a result of the pandemic. In 2020, travel and tourism contributions to global GDP decreased by 49.1%, a loss of $4.5 trillion (USD), nearly 18 times the impact experienced during the 2009 global financial crisis.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, it would take years to develop standards for digital health&nbsp;passes.</p><p>In February, <a href="http://id2020.org">ID2020</a> launched the Good Health Pass Collaborative, a multi-sector, global initiative to establish guiding principles for digital health passes and dramatically streamline the standards development process. Within weeks, the Collaborative grew from 25 partners to <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org">more than 125 companies and organizations</a> from across the health, travel, and technology sectors.</p><p>Nine “drafting groups”, bringing together more than 120 experts from the health, travel, and technology sectors were managed through a partnership with the Trust Over IP Foundation the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative and Linux Foundation Public Health — all projects of the Linux Foundation.</p><p>The resulting Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint addresses — in considerable depth and detail — nine technical and interoperability challenges around which global consensus must be&nbsp;reached:</p>  Design principles  Creating a consistent user experience  Standard data models and&nbsp;elements  Credential formats, signatures, and exchange protocols  Security, privacy, and data protection  Trust registries  Rules engines  Identity binding (ensuring the authenticity of the&nbsp;holder)  Governance  <blockquote>“This draft blueprint is historic, both in its depth and breadth of proposed standards, as well as the number of expert volunteers who contributed their time to its development,’’ said Gruener. “When we partnered with the Trust Over IP Foundation, we committed to an open and inclusive process. Releasing the draft for public comment today takes that commitment a step further. We felt this was incredibly important, given the range of public and private entities expected to play a role in the issuance and acceptance of digital health passes and the need to build public trust and support their adoption.”</blockquote><p>The UK government — in its capacity as president of the G7 — has identified “leading the global recovery from coronavirus, while strengthening our resilience against further pandemic” as the highest policy priority for this 47th G7 Summit. International agreement on principles and standards for digital health passes is critical to achieving this policy priority.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implementation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights while ensuring data remains private and in the hands of the individual.</p><p><a href="http://www.id2020.org">www.id2020.org</a></p>

<p>The three phases of development of a Blockchain project on Commercio.network</p>
<p>The process is divided into three distinct macro phases that must answer three specific questions.</p>
<p>1) Problem/Solution Fit Phase Do I have a problem that can be solved with a Blockchain solution?<br>
Before you invest months or years in efforts to build a Blockchain project that no one wants, you need to determine if this product is something worth building. The only way to do this is to separate the problem from the solution and calibrate both through a series of interactions with potential customers. Problem Testing allows you to understand if you have a “problem worth solving” on your hands long before you invest the time, money and effort to set out to build a solution. In business circles, a “worthy problem” means someone can spend money to see it solved. Having reached this point, it is possible to determine the minimum number of features our Blockchain product must have to solve the problem and move on to the first draft of the solution, creating a Proof of Concept (POC).</p>
<p>2) Product/Market Fit Phase Have I built something that people want?<br>
As soon as you find a problem worth solving and after developing the Proof of Concept, you need to create a business model hypothesis based on this problem/solution. You can start the learning process by going to customers/users to test how well your Blockchain solution solves the problem. After several customer interactions, you progressively move from POC to Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The essence of this phase is to maximize this type of learning. Achieving traction (i.e. finding a crossover between the product and the market) is the first significant milestone for a Blockchain project.</p>
<p>3) Scaling Phase How can I accelerate growth?<br>
After finding the Product and Market intersection, achieving a decent level of success is almost always guaranteed. The focus in this final phase shifts to accelerating the business actions that lead to company growth (scaling).</p>

<p>In an eﬀort to restore global travel and restart the global economy, the <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative </a>today announced the release of the eagerly-anticipated Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.</p>
<p>The Blueprint – released today in draft form for a three-week period of stakeholder consultations and public comment – is intended to stimulate discussion at the G7 Summit, which will open Friday in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, UK.</p>
<p>This announcement follows on a May 18 letter, sent by the Good Health Pass Collaborative to G7 leaders, urging them to adopt a statement of principles for digital health passes. The letter also called for the formation of a working group – composed of senior ministerial staﬀ from G7, G20, and European Union health and transport ministries – with the task of reaching international consensus on standards by July 16.</p>
<p>Unprecedented global collaboration – between governments, nonproﬁts, universities, and the private sector – propelled the rapid development and distribution of highly eﬀective COVID vaccines. A similar level of collaboration is urgently needed to ensure that veriﬁable digital health passes for international travel can be issued and universally accepted worldwide by airlines, border control agencies, and others.</p>
<p>Most governments already require proof of travelers’ COVID status – either through a recent negative test or, increasingly, proof of vaccination– as a precondition of entry. While dozens of solutions have been rushed to market to meet this growing demand, they vary greatly in the extent to which they protect user privacy and security and enable individuals to control access to their personal health information.</p>
<p>The absence of internationally recognized, consensus-based open standards – to which all solutions adhere – could leave individuals uncertain about the security and privacy of their data and even unsure of whether their health pass will be accepted for travel.</p>
<p>“Digital health passes oﬀer our best hope to safely, conﬁdently, and promptly restore global travel and restart the global economy – but only if they are widely trusted and adopted by the public and universally accepted by airlines and border control agencies,” said ID2020 executive director, Dakota Gruener. “The standards proposed in the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint will make it possible for digital health pass systems around the world to be interoperable with one another, thus creating a trusted, convenient, and seamless experience for travelers as well as for airlines, airports, and border control agencies.”</p>
<p>Restoring international travel is vital to restarting the global economy. The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that 61.6 million tourism-related jobs worldwide have been lost as a result of the pandemic. In 2020, travel and tourism contributions to global GDP decreased by 49.1%, a loss of $4.5 trillion (USD), nearly 18 times the impact experienced during the 2009 global ﬁnancial crisis.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, it would take years to develop standards for digital health passes.</p>
<p>In February, <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020 </a>launched the Good Health Pass Collaborative, a multi-sector, global initiative to establish guiding principles for digital health passes and dramatically streamline the standards development process. Within weeks, the Collaborative grew from 25 partners to <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">more</a> <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">than 125 companies and organizations </a>from across the health, travel, and technology sectors.</p>
<p>Nine “drafting groups”, bringing together more than 120 experts from the health, travel, and technology sectors were managed through a partnership with the Trust Over IP Foundation the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative and Linux Foundation Public Health – all projects of the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>The resulting Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint addresses – in considerable depth and detail – nine technical and interoperability challenges around which global consensus must be reached:</p>
 
 Design principles 
 Creating a consistent user experience 
 Standard data models and elements 
 Credential formats, signatures, and exchange protocols 
 Security, privacy, and data protection 
 Trust registries 
 Rules engines 
 Identity binding (ensuring the authenticity of the holder) 
 Governance 
 
<p>“This draft blueprint is historic, both in its depth and breadth of proposed standards, as well as the number of expert volunteers who contributed their time to its development,” said Gruener. “When we partnered with the Trust Over IP Foundation, we committed to an open and inclusive process. Releasing the draft for public comment today takes that commitment a step further. We felt this was incredibly important, given the range of public and private entities expected to play a role in the issuance and acceptance of digital health passes and the need to build public trust and support their adoption.”</p>
<p>The UK government – in its capacity as president of the G7 – has identiﬁed “leading the global recovery from coronavirus, while strengthening our resilience against further pandemic” as the highest policy priority for this 47th G7 Summit. International agreement on principles and standards for digital health passes are critical to achieving this policy priority.</p>
<p>About ID2020</p>
<p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonproﬁts, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting and portable digital ID solutions.</p>
<p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implementation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights, while ensuring data remains private and in the hands of the individual. <a href="http://www.id2020.org/">www.id2020.org</a></p>

<p>After a long process of finding leadership, hammering out a charter, and defining an optimistic scope, the new transatlantic leadership is hammering out a tentative work plan and scope reductions to line up all the ducks.  Public meetings have begun this week to include the whole working group in this discussion about deliverables and timelines. Stay tuned and register for the <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/wallet-security">mailing list</a>.</p>
 First public meeting of the Cryptography WG approaches 
<p>A younger group with a narrower scope has, in parallel, also been forming around cryptographic primitives and dependency analysis. Leadership has already been selected by consensus and the charter is being fine-tuned-- a charter DocuSign and a scheduling doodle might be ready for interested parties as soon as time of press for the next newsletter. Join the mailing <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/crypto-wg">list</a> in the meantime if specifying cryptographic primitives across different tooling stacks sounds like a priority for your organization.</p>

 New Special Work Item Calls
 
 <a>DID Registration</a> Work Item Call - Wednesdays 1000 ET 
 <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver</a> Work Item Call - Wednesdays 1300 ET 
 
 
 Persistence and versioning of JSON-LD contexts, and implications on Linked Data Signatures. 
 Data structures and other topics in the CCG's Universal Wallet Interop <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/#Data%20Model">specification</a>. 
 Discussion of Fission (CA)'s proposed approach to DID resolution / discovery in signing up for an account / linking DIDs.
 
 Giving every user an end-to-end encrypted data store building on IPFS 
 Fission-specific, human-readable user-account namespace for discovery and usability, with each account controlling a DID "under the hood" 
 
 
 <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">UNIVERSAL REGISTRAR</a> - An Overview
 
 Issue: Onboarding/getting access to a DID registry is usually DID-registry-specific. 
 Proposals:
 
 Consider the most frequent flows:
 
 Redirect to a webpage (authentication or other operations are performed outside the wallet) 
 Authentication via API (some existing Universal Registrar drivers support this) 
 
 
 Proposal should work for most DID methods (e.g., did:web, Sovrin, sidetree). 
 A more detailed compatibility analysis is required. 
 
 
 Outcomes: Proposals will be further analysed and discussed in the Universal Registration call. Issues will be opened in the Universal Registration repository 
 Discussions about:
 
 <a href="https://github.com/gataca-io/gataca-did-method">Gataca's DID method</a>. 
 Historical resolution &amp; different properties/categories of methods WRT historical options. 
 DID revocation: historical signature retroactively invalidated or do they survive?

<p>Blockchain project development: first question is blockchain needed ?</p>
<p>When companies define strategies they often make a few missteps. They usually collect past data and make predictions about the future based on it, and often this same data doesn’t tell what future customers expect. Alternatively, they make risky bets based on gut instinct instead of evidence. Blockchain Product Design is a strategic process that seeks to avoid these mistakes through a series of methodologies applied by startups seeking a profitable, repeatable, and scalable business model.</p>
<p>The first and only universally valid rule is to build something that people want.</p>
<p>This means finding a problem for whose solution someone would be willing to pay something.</p>
<p>In our case, it’s important to understand whether the problem can be solved with Blockchain alone.</p>
<p>To understand this, we just need to answer six questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Do I need to register status? (True) (False) 
 Are there multiple people who need to write data? (True) (False)&nbsp; 
 Do you NOT want/can you delegate to a single third party? (True) (False)&nbsp; 
 Are all the people writing data NOT known? (True) (False)&nbsp; 
 Are all people who write data NOT trusted? (True) (False)&nbsp; 
 Is public verification of all transactions required? (True) (False)&nbsp; 
 
<p>If you answered False to any of these questions, there is no need for a Public Blockchain, at most a Federated or Private Blockchain.</p>
<p>Blockchain Product Design is a strategic process that employs three methodologies from the world of innovative design, the startup world, and the world of software development.</p>

Schema.org was announced ten years ago this week!  Without getting all emotional, this feels like an appropriate moment to thank everyone who has contributed to this effort in any way - from publishers, technologists and standards experts to those who build applications that use the markup, or who work on publishing it from sites across the web. Some but not all of you are named in our documentation (<a href="https://schema.org/docs/about.html">about us</a>; <a href="https://schema.org/docs/releases.html">release notes</a>); &nbsp;but the truth is that the success of Schema.org comes in large part from the millions of sites who have adopted it as a practical way to communicate the meaning of their content using structured data.&nbsp; <br>  Schema.org was founded on the idea of making it easier and simpler for the ordinary, everyday sites that make up the web to use machine-readable data, and for that data to enable an ecosystem of applications used by millions of people. While it's hard to predict exactly what the next decade will bring, if we can all keep these founding concerns in mind as we improve, refine and curate our growing collection of schemas, we'll be doing our part to continue improving the web.  <br>  Dan &amp; Guha  For Schema.org.

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/tag/blockchain/"></a>A headline theme for building Scotland into a world leading digital nation is the development of it’s ‘cryptocurrency ecosystem’. 
 This refers not only to the adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but also the development of the new ventures and products that build upon it to achieve innovative new business models. 
<p>The basic concept is eloquently explained by Anthony Pompliano.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wigz8z6Vm3U">this discussion</a>, from 9m:50s, he describes a tiered financial system that builds upon gold as the foundation asset at level one, the issuing of cash money based on its value at level two, and then an increasing sophistication of electronic use of money at levels three and above.</p>
<p>He states that the cryptocurrency world is in the process of creating an equivalent system, where Bitcoin functions as the level one asset, aka “digital gold”, and we’ll see a comparable services ecosystem build upon it through layers two and above.</p>
<p>Vendor technologies like <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/introducing-the-hiro-platform">Hiro</a> demonstrate a great example of this effect, providing the tools to build upon this layer with new applications, with major market innovations like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/mastercard-plans-to-explore-applications-it-can-build-on-top-of-cbdcs">Mastercard planning</a> to build upon CBDCs, like launching like a&nbsp;<a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/mastercard-gemini-winklevoss-launch-crypto-bitcoin-rewards-card-digital-summer-2021-4-1030353514">crypto rewards card</a>, a great example of a level three service.</p>
<p>In China they are already active and the competitive repercussions are becoming evident. As the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-chinese-banks-promote-cbdc-over-local-payment-firms-for-shopping-festival">Cointelegraph reports</a> the banks are promoting the CBDC, the ‘digital yuan’, over the incumbent payment providers like Alipay and WeChat Pay. JD.com has started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/jd-pays-staff-digital-yuan/">paying staff</a> in the digital yuan.</p>
 Open Banking 
<p>As we consider the dynamics of building a Scottish crypto ecosystem a key industry trend to factor in is Open Banking. This is a <a href="https://digitalscot.net/open-banking-scotlands-global-opportunity/">global market opportunity</a> for Scotland.</p>
<p>Matthew Enubuje <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-hidden-war-for-fintech-millennials-open-banking-vs-crypto-928a86273f4a">provides a helpful overview</a> of where the two sectors overlap, and the potential for their synergy.</p>
<p>He makes the key point that reflects the insights described by Anthony Pompliano, that where the Blockchain industry has excelled at the level one core digital asset infrastructure, they haven’t been as progressive in terms of developing the higher layer of interconnecting, value adding apps. Open Banking has.</p>
<p>The advantages of crypto over Open Banking are mainly those to do with circumventing the banking system and the technological features of the Blockchain – The decentralized control of assets by users themselves not banks, and the transparent integrity of the transactions.</p>
<p>He describes the opportunity for the crypto industry being to basically expand to the higher levels of the ecosystem introduced in this article, citing examples such as <a href="https://nexo.io/">Nexo</a>, a crypto lending platform with&nbsp;no credit checks and instant credit lines, and where their revenue comes from their 5.9% interest on loans.</p>
<p>This adds equity to their crypto as it can be used to get a loan and by users holding it for long periods, they receive 30% dividends and this offsets the demand to supply ratio.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Matthew suggests a few other examples of this ecosystem, such as <a href="https://www.helium.com/">Helium</a>, a crypto company distributing hotspot devices and people earn their crypto when they use it, and the mobile app&nbsp;<a href="https://emma-app.com/">Emma&nbsp;</a>— it lets you connect to your bank accounts and crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>The killer innovation central to both trends is interoperability. Open Banking is achieved through API-based data flow between banks and apps, and for crypto cross-chain integration is the holy grail of its next major phase of evolution. The CoinTelegraph explores this in detail <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-interoperability-evolves-from-blockchain-bridges-to-defi-transfers">here</a>, with major innovations setting out to address the challenge including <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cosmos-set-to-take-lead-in-blockchain-interoperability-with-februarys-stargate-release">Cosmos</a>.</p>
 Building Back Better – Digitizing Scotland’s SMEs 
<p>So in practical terms what does this mean for Scotland, how should we act to exploit their trend and opportunity?</p>
<p>To answer this question we can consider other strategic objectives, with the most notable being to ‘Digitize Scotland’s SMEs’ – To better enable Scotland’s small businesses to make use of technology to grow their business, especially so after the pandemic.</p>
<p>This provides a very practical lens to view the above market insights; in short the ecosystem will be most effective when it produces these types of tools. For example early adopters of crypto payments in Scotland include the Aberdeen <a href="https://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2021/05/04/first-scottish-craft-beer-company-to-accept-cryptocurrency-payments-food-and-drink-news-scotland/">Taproom</a>, an Edinburgh <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/scottish-music-school-now-supports-crypto-payments-for-tuition/">School of Music</a> and a <a href="https://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/business/consumer/falkirk-cafe-among-first-in-scotland-to-accept-cryptocurrency-payments-3192051">Falkirk cafe</a>.</p>
<p>Scotland’s startups making possible this type of service are thus the essential foundation, highlighting ventures like Zumo, who have launched innovations like a <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/edinburgh-fintech-launches-pay-crypto-24090015">virtual payment card</a>.</p>
<p>To the point of this article what’s really key is&nbsp;their <a href="https://developers.zumo.money/">Developers SDK</a>. Accepting payments is just the building block, as highlighted above the real secret sauce for what will be of great value to SMEs is the increasingly sophisticated functionality that builds upon this, in a way that truly supports and enables the growth of their business, such as a loyalty rewards scheme for example. Zumo’s SDK would enable other digital entrepreneurs to create these types of solutions.</p>
<p>With this type of functionality in mind other Scottish startups to highlight include <a href="https://stampede.ai/">Stampede</a>. While not a crypto company they are a great example of a provider of technology to Scottish SMEs, in the hospitality sector, to help them grow their business, via functionality such as a <a href="https://stampede.ai/how-it-works/wifi/#portal">Wifi portal</a>, <a href="https://stampede.ai/how-it-works/automations/#campaigns">email and SMS marketing</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://stampede.ai/how-it-works/gifting/#gifting">digital gift cards</a>.</p>
<p>Given their type of client would include the Aberdeen Taproom mentioned, the most powerful accelerant of Scotland’s ecosystem is the integration of these capabilities, one that combines crypto payments with these digital marketing services, so that Scotland’s SMEs have access to a one stop shop for easily adopting the full suite.</p>
<p>This is the most effective route to achieving the goal of Scotland becoming a world leading digital nation – Scotland’s SMEs are the backbone of its economy, and empowering them to adopt the latest technologies that can grow their business, via utilizing local Scottish tech startups, creates a rising tide that floats all boats multiplying effect.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>The number one topic at the heart of the Scottish Independence debate is what currency would be used. 
 This <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/snp-must-rethink-its-economic-model-independent-scotland/">OpenDemocracy article</a> sets the scene through a critical analysis of the SNP’s Growth Commission plans, being especially harsh of their currency strategy. 
<p>Thought leaders pioneering alternative ideas in Scotland include Tim Rideout, heading up the <a href="https://www.reservebank.scot/">ReserveBank.scot initiative</a>, Common Weal who have published <a href="https://commonweal.scot/policy-library/how-make-currency-practical-guide">this paper</a> on how to make a Scottish currency, <a href="https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2020/12/04/why-is-scotland-still-debating-whether-it-will-need-its-own-currency-when-independent-when-the-answer-is-so-glaringly-obviously-that-it-will/">Richard Murphy</a> and <a href="https://www.modernmoney.scot/">Modern Money Scotland</a>.</p>
<p>See all of them together discussing the topic on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lzxjVs810Y">this panel discussion webinar</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 Pioneering the Future of Money 
<p>Rather than this being a weak point for the Independence argument, the smart move is to seize it as the moment for global technology leadership it represents, an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone – One being the need for a currency, the second being the aspiration to become a world leading digital nation.</p>
<p>A key trend to highlight are “CBDCs” –&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency">Central Bank Digital Currencies</a>, the full blown digitization of national currencies, which is the grand prize of this space and given Scotland’s history of pioneering financial innovations including founding banks et al, presents us with a unique window to lead the trend globally.</p>
<p>It’s a behemoth of a worldwide opportunity now taking shape – In the USA former CFTC chair Chris Giancarlo has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/35528/digital-dollar-project-names-advisory-group">set up a not-for-profit</a>&nbsp;called the Digital Dollar Foundation, to pioneer the creation of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC).&nbsp;In his presidency campaign Michael Bloomberg&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/us-presidential-contender-michael-bloomberg-proposes-clear-regulatory-framework-for-crypto">proposed creating a regulatory framework</a>&nbsp;for cryptocurrencies in a new financial regulation plan.</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum says it’s time to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/08/why-its-time-to-take-central-banks-digital-currencies-seriously/">take them seriously</a>, CNBC explores&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/central-banks-lay-out-a-framework-for-digital-currencies.html">what they would look like</a>, the US Federal Reserve published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/central-bank-digital-currency-a-literature-review-20201109.htm">a literature review</a>, the IMF a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/11/20/Legal-Aspects-of-Central-Bank-Digital-Currency-Central-Bank-and-Monetary-Law-Considerations-49827">set of considerations</a>&nbsp;for their use and Brookings a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/07/23/design-choices-for-central-bank-digital-currency/">set of design options</a>. The Bank of England offers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2020/central-bank-digital-currency-opportunities-challenges-and-design-discussion-paper">this discussion paper</a>&nbsp;to explore the topic in detail and HSBC comments on them&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hsbc.com/insight/topics/central-banks-develop-digital-currencies">here</a>.</p>
<p>Early pioneers include&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-swiss-snb-currency-digital/swiss-central-bank-says-wholesale-digital-currency-trial-a-success-idUKKBN28D1N5">Switzerland</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ghanas-central-bank-confirms-its-still-looking-to-pilot-a-digital-currency">Ghana</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/marshall-islands-seeks-to-establish-a-self-sovereign-identity-with-new-blockchain-based-currency">Marshall Islands</a>&nbsp;seeking to blaze the trail, and China has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-12-01/in-depth-chinas-digital-currency-ambitions-lead-the-world-101634550.html">ambitions to lead the world</a>&nbsp;in this field.</p>
<p>There are concerns and critics of course. Coin Telegraph writes that they have the&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-digital-currencies-have-the-power-to-upend-global-finance">potential to upend global finance</a>, and also that they are&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-digital-currencies-are-dead-in-the-water">dead in the water</a>, and the Economist asks if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/12/05/will-central-bank-digital-currencies-break-the-banking-system">they will break the banking system</a>.</p>
 “Programmable Money” 
<p>Furthermore the real magic lies in the concept of ‘Smart Money’ aka Programmable Money.&nbsp;This is not just about the straight digitization of money as we understand it, but an entire transformation of how money ‘works’.</p>
<p>As the term suggests it refers to creating an intrinsic intelligence for money.&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2020/09/16/programmable-money-crypto-tokens">Reporting on IBM</a>&nbsp;being awarded a patent for a “bespoke programmable crypto token,” Cointelegraph explores how specific functionality can be programmed into the behaviour of digital monies.</p>
<p>The LSE explores the idea, asking ‘<a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2020/09/14/do-we-need-programmable-money/">Do we need programmable money</a>?’, where they define it in terms of both Open Banking and crypto:</p>
<p>“In non-crypto fintech, ‘programmable money’ seems to refer to leveraging open banking APIs to build new, automated use-cases over legacy bank payment infrastructure but in our crypto world, the ‘programmable money’ refers to digital cash hosted on a blockchain, where cash can be placed under the control of a smart contract.”</p>
<p>A key standard that could make it possible is ‘DAML’, a programming language for creating Blockchain smart contracts that run across multiple infrastructure options. DigitalAsset is the world’s expert on this and explore the trend in more detail in <a href="https://daml.com/daml-driven/why-daml-is-great-to-represent-digital-currency/">this series of blogs</a>.</p>
<p>Not only does this provide the technology to digitally enable currencies as they behave now, but to make possible a future of Programmable Money, where a variety of behaviours and actions can be coded into the flow of money not possible with physical currency.</p>
<p>A Canadian visionary in this field is Alex Tapscott.&nbsp;Indeed he defines it as the wholesale reinvention of capital, a journey he foresees in his 2016 presentation ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=WnEYakUxsHU">Blockchain is Eating Wall Street</a>‘.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Digital assets are smart and programmable. Let’s say you’re sending money to your kid studying in college. You can now program the money to only work at certain retailers like Walmart and Whole Foods, rather than the Ontario Cannabis Store or LCBO.</p>
<p>By rethinking capital, we can reimagine markets, money and finance. Entire swaths of the financial services industry currently worth trillions of dollars — banking, payments and even money itself — will be questioned, challenged and upended in the years to come.”</p>

<p>Commerc.io srl is glad to announce that from today is available on the Google Play Store App the wallet&nbsp; to manage&nbsp; all the operations related to the tokens of Commercio.network.</p>
<p>Thanks to this new application a user can create his own non custodial wallet.</p>
<p>In a non custodial wallet, the real owner of the tokens is the person who has access to them. In other words, unlike when using a hosted wallet managed by a third party, only you can operate because you are the only one who has the private key.<br>
A non custodial wallet doesn’t have a password recovery system, so it’s essential to store the 12 Words properly. If you lose them you have lost your tokens forever.<br>
Here are the features of the Commerc.io app wallet</p>
<p>CREATE AND IMPORT A WALLET: you can create a wallet ex novo or import the 12/24 of the cards distributed to the validator nodes by Commercio.network.<br>
SEND AND RECEIVE COM thanks to the app you can send and receive COM with a simple scan of a QR Code.<br>

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>The objective of our <a href="https://digitalscot.net/library/digital-nation/">Digital Nation Action Plan</a> is to identify the individual entrepreneurs visions for how to achieve a world leading Scottish digital nation, and aggregate these into one overall action plan. 
<p>On <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L5Nf6ipWAAID1hdwOVoc5">The Crypto Standard podcast</a> they interview Nick Jones of <a href="https://www.zumo.money/">Zumo</a>, exploring the details of their exciting venture pioneering a cryptocurrency payments app.</p>
<p>Concluding the interview Jordan highlights how Wyoming is becoming a crypto and blockchain global hub, and asks if Scotland could replicate a similar success.</p>
<p>Nick believes this is entirely doable, given how Scotland is a small, relatively cash rich country with highly educated people, and with many pressing social inequality issues to address could act as an incredible ‘sandbox’ for cultivating innovative applications of the technology that leverage Scotland’s <a href="https://www.zumo.money/blog/how-scotland-liberated-smart-money">deep legacy of financial expertise</a>.</p>
<p>To crystallize a strategy to unify Scotland’s many different initiatives and assets around a single vision of making Scotland the Blockchain Capital of Europe, Nick quantifies the end result through stating key metrics such as having 10 of the top 50 startups, three relevant university courses and a £500m venture fund for supporting the ecosystem.</p>
 “Weak on Blockchain” 
<p>The nature of the challenge is very succinctly captured by Andrew Noble of Par Equity in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/6-investors-and-founders-forecast-hockey-stick-growth-for-edinburghs-startup-scene/">this TechCrunch artlcle</a>. While reporting on the general success of Scotland’s startup scene in his analysis he comments that Scotland is “weak on Blockchain”.</p>
<p>He’s not wrong. Scotland has a handful of great Blockchain startups like Zumo, Siccar and Appii, but to Nick’s point we’re well short of how many there should be, there’s no real funding initiatives to address this and adoption in key ‘big lever’ sectors like Government is non existent.&nbsp;Therefore the essence of our Action Plan should be to address exactly this.</p>
<p>A keystone foundation is regulation and legislation, the right approach could either inhibit innovation or unlock an unparalleled scale of economic growth. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/proposed-legislation-in-germany-could-allow-425b-to-flow-into-crypto-report">Coindesk reports</a>&nbsp;a new German law could theoretically bring as much as €350 billion (~$425 billion) of institutional investment into their cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://billatnapier.medium.com/we-need-a-blockchain-act-for-every-country-7ae10f36b3c4">this blog</a> Bill Buchanan describes how countries should legislate a Blockchain Act, emulating pioneers like <a href="https://www.regierung.li/en/press-releases/212310">Liechtenstein</a>, providing the legal framework to truly achieve a wholly digital nation.</p>
 The Tokenization of Everything 
<p>Legislation is a slow moving process outwith our control, so the second, more important foundation is simply to drive large scale adoption, an effect that can be characterized as “The Tokenization of Everything”.</p>
<p>Despite our claims of living in a digital society the reality is that so much of our economy is still paper-based, from mortgages to opening a bank account requiring the endless shuffling of paper and the centuries old practice of ‘wet’ signatures or what Bill describes as ‘fake digital’, the practice of visually emulating these via tools like Docusign.&nbsp;Instead he defines that:</p>
<p>“We need to move into a world which properly replaces paper, and moves towards crypto-assets and digital signing with private keys.”</p>
<p>The digitization of all documents and processes via the Blockchain would give rise to what Bill describes as ‘The Token Economy’:</p>
<p>“But some countries are now defining the required legal infrastructure around blockchain, and finding ways to integrate into their existing legal frameworks, and also provided increased trust in the new economy — the token economy.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>and that</p>
<p>“The key requirement is for national regulation infrastructure and which builds on a total anonymous distributed ledger infrastructure, as well as mapping trusted identities into a regulation infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Demonstrating the potential Scotland has to not only adopt but also pioneer this massive trend is local startup <a href="https://digitalscot.net/directory/listing/blockchain-technology-partners/">Blockchain Technology Partners</a>, who specializes in the ‘smart contracts’ that Bill defines as the linchpin to this new digital universe. They also envisage the complete digitization of all facets of our economy, describing ‘<a href="https://interwork.org/towards-the-tokenization-of-everything/">The Tokenization of Everything</a>‘.</p>
<p>As the title suggests this refers to an evolution where every asset with inherent value will eventually be represented by a cryptographic token on a Blockchain.</p>
 Scaling Scotland’s Blockchain Ecosystem 
<p>Nick offers an ideal starting point for a Digital Nation Action Plan – A big audacious ambition and clear metrics for quantifying when it is achieved.</p>
<p>By incorporating the equivalent views from other Scottish tech entrepreneurs we can refine a detailed strategy and set of steps for truly realizing the goal of building a world leading Scottish digital nation.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalgovernment.scot"></a>The core principle of Government as a Platform is that a common foundation makes possible multiple different services that share this capability, to avoid reinventing the wheel for repeated functions like authentication and data sharing. 
<p>With these building blocks in place developers are then freed to concentrate on building the apps that more quickly deliver real business value.</p>
 Vaccination Passports 
<p>A great example of the need for this rapid approach is ‘Covid Vaccination Passports’. Clearly there has been a requirement for a quick response to critical public health needs, and one that utilizes existing government systems so that there is a complete integrity of the data produced.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/21/1015353/covid-vaccine-passport-digital-immunity-record/">MIT asks</a> if you will have to carry this on your phone, where it might function like an actual passport, being shown as you arrive at airports, and could also act like a work authorization at your job, or a pass to get into restaurants, bars, and shopping malls.</p>
<p>Highlighting the type of issues that need addressed such as a <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/travelers-using-counterfeit-covid-test-results">booming black market</a> in fake test results that is diminishing trust in printed records and driving demand for cheat-proof digital documents, they define the medical and technology challenges and nature of this opportunity:</p>
<p>“There are a lot of players in the field, including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson-health/health-pass-puts-privacy-first/">IBM</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://thecommonsproject.org/">the Commons Project</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">Covid Credentials Initiative</a>. </p>
<p>They’re coming at the problem from different angles but are ultimately chasing the same goal: let people share required information about their health, while protecting other private information. Yet it’s still too early to rely on any of these for a fast and widespread solution.”</p>
<p>Many governments, as well as airlines and other businesses are trialing or in talks to build “health pass” apps, which let users ask participating labs and health systems to send authenticated test results and other data straight to the app, bypassing verification concerns.</p>
 Scotland’s Opportunity – A Digital Healthcare Ecosystem 
<p>To begin zeroing in on the specific opportunity for Scotland, we can first identify the core technology challenge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Connecting any systems across borders means navigating a patchwork of languages, databases, and privacy laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>This highlights the work of Scotland’s <a href="https://nds.nhs.scot/about/">NDS team</a>, who are building the ‘<a href="https://digitalscot.net/nes-digital-service-platform/">National Digital Platform</a>‘, the technical architecture which ensures that key things are only done in one way across Scotland such as how people are identified and where clinical data is stored.</p>
<p>As they explain <a href="https://nds.nhs.scot/blog/the-national-clinical-data-store/">here</a>, their National Clinical Data Store (NCDS) is storing vaccinations data and being made accessible to healthcare staff, via their <a href="https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/42708/turas-vaccination-management-tool">VMT app</a>.</p>
<p>“Under the bonnet, the VMT sends copies of the records of immunisations to the&nbsp;NCDS. For those that may be interested, this is achieved using a “FHIR API” based on the&nbsp;<a title="Opens new window" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core">UK FHIR Core</a>&nbsp;Immunisation Profile. A FHIR API is essentially an industry standard way of sharing digital health data.&nbsp;The&nbsp;NCDS can then&nbsp;securely share citizens’ immunisation history records to other services, again using a FHIR API.”</p>
<p>As we’ll explore in the upcoming and future webinars, Scotland’s opportunity is to build upon this core innovation through a collaborating community, a Digital Healthcare Ecosystem, to flesh it out in multiple directions including ways to expand user uptake and to enable new scenarios for how users interact with and update data.</p>
<p>This is particularly relevant when we consider the broader context of Scotland’s overall digital agenda. In their just released digital strategy, the Scottish Government describes a key objective of:</p>
<p>“Adopt a common approach to online identity where personal data is controlled by the individual.”</p>
<p>This highlights a couple of key vendor solutions:</p>
 
 Appii – Appii has developed their <a href="https://appii.io/health-passport/">Health Passport</a>, a service that verifies your identify through a selfie photo, is populated through recording your test result at one of their partner sites (eg. Lloyds Pharmacy) and provides a digital certification. 
 Digi.me – Digi.me is a specialist in general data sharing services and have developed a number of apps that build on this capability, including a <a href="https://digi.me/covid19/">Covid-19 solution</a>. 
 
<p>What all of this highlights is the importance of the platform approach. A Covid certification service is just one of the many apps governments need to deploy, and each and every one will feature repeated requirements to verify the identity of users and share data across multiple systems.</p>
<p>Furthermore this should feed an innovation ecosystem, where for example the NDS National Clinical Data Store is a data set securely exposed to third party developers so that they can create new apps that leverage the data in new ways, for scenarios like Covid 19 as just one of many that will be required on an ongoing basis. Vendors like Appii and Digi.me would be ideal for this type of accelerated app innovation.</p>

  <p>By March 31, 2022, the Global LEI System will have implemented three new Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) policies to further increase the level of open, standardized, and high-quality legal entity reference data available to users.</p>
<p>From March 1, 2022, all GLEIF services will accept and display data in new Common Data File (CDF) formats in line with the new policies. Public users of the Global LEI System will therefore need to be able to process data in the new format from this date onwards. The month of March will be used as a transition period during which all LEI issuing organizations will migrate to the new formats and perform testing to ensure smooth operations. During this month, therefore, public users of Global LEI System should prepare to support both formats when performing LEI data analysis. This blog outlines the preparatory steps public users are required to take and provides links to more detailed reference information.</p>
<p>Details of the new policies</p>
<p>The new policies apply to:</p>
 
 Legal Entity Events: Specifies events that alter the entity, the relationship data of a legal entity, or result in the retirement and/or creation of LEIs.  
 Fund Relationships: Introduces three new distinct relationship types that can be collected for funds.  
 General Government Entities: Allows certain legal entities to be classified as Government Entities or International Organizations.  
 
<p>How to prepare for the new policies</p>
<p>The following users must take action to implement the updated file formats to ensure uninterrupted access to LEI data beyond March 1, 2022:</p>
 
 All users of the GLEIF Concatenated files 
 All users of the Golden Copy and Delta files 
 All users who access the content of the Golden Copy files via the GLEIF API 
 
<p>GLEIF has published further technical details, example files and additional documentation specifying the transition steps and the impact on associated data <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/common-data-file-format/upcoming-versions">here</a>.</p>
<p>Additional support</p>
<p>Following March 31, 2022, GLEIF anticipates a period of up to one year before the Global LEI System will be fully populated with information on Legal Entity Events, Fund Relationships and Government Entities. Data is generally collected at the time of new LEI issuance or existing LEI renewal.</p>
<p>If you have questions or need additional support ahead of the March 1 deadline, please email GLEIF: <a href="mailto:info@gleif.org">info@gleif.org</a>.</p>

<p>Razia joined the Women in Identity team early in 2021, helping to co-ordinate our sponsorship programme.</p>
<p></p>
 Tell us about your job and what gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>My journey originally started with a degree in Cognitive Science and I wanted to incorporate ‘diverse thinking’ in my daily working life. In 2019 I decided to take a step back from corporate life. After a year travelling across the USA and Asia and I took the decision to retrain decided as a life coach.</p>
<p>With my new-found skillset, I learned how to tap into my blind spots, focussing on understanding the difference between means goals and end goals.</p>
<p>I worked hard.</p>
<p>But I spent little time with family and friends.</p>
<p>My work-life balance wasn’t particularly healthy – even though I was accomplishing the goals I had set for myself.</p>
<p>I was not showing up in the best version of myself.</p>
<p>I realised I needed to be a part of something more meaningful. Something that meant I was contributing towards the bigger things in life.</p>
<p>I had given over years of my life in trying to attain fulfilment by having money in my bank account. I could buy what I wanted, had great job titles so I was generally seen as successful. I realised I was pursuing a need to be recognized – for my work on this project or that initiative. These are the values I grew up with; the values I thought I needed in order to be viewed as “successful”.</p>
<p>During my travels, I took time to understand what I really wanted – namely to show up with unique ideas that would really contribute to making a difference – not just having a smart job title. I wanted to travel more and spend genuine, quality, time getting to know my friends and family again. &nbsp;I decided to start connecting with people who have really inspired me and in late 2019 launched my first podcast.</p>
<p>I now work with non-profit organizations that are passionate about making a real difference. I feel like I work within several communities, each one driving change around the diversity and inclusion agenda. It’s why I wanted to get involved with Women in Identity and I joined the volunteer team earlier this year.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I always worked very hard, putting in the hours, but later in my career I realized that hard work has very little to do with success.</p>
<p>I recognized the importance of learning to slow down. I have worked with FTSE 100 companies to Silicon Valley start-up and – honestly – I now realise how important it is to never stop learning. I have volunteered with many different organizations, simply because it taught me so many things outside my experience.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>To tell myself every day that I have a unique combination of infinite potential and divine possibilities. There is no one else exactly like me so if I don’t show up for myself, I can’t expect others to do so.</p>
<p>The second biggest lesson for me was outgrowing the things I originally wanted and learning the art of “surrender”.&nbsp; I believe we need to have goals but also to keep a sense of what it means to keep learning, keep growing. &nbsp;an entrepreneurial vision. If your business or you fail in a particular role, the real question to ask yourself is: “did I grow?” The jobs I do are simply a means to me achieving my bigger goal: to keep on growing.</p>
 What would be your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>&nbsp;People have been treated badly throughout history due to organizations having policies and practices that have disadvantaged people. I would like our leaders to make self-reflection a fundamental part of management and leadership training.</p>
<p>If organisations within the Identity space want to create environments that are truly free of racism and sexism, they need to look to hire people from different genders, faiths and races, different educational and economic backgrounds. This will help eliminate the stereotyping that we all fall foul of – and stop us building computer programs that perpetuate them.</p>
<p>Many organisations understand that having women in leadership groups increases productivity by 40%. We need to continue this momentum so we can finally stop having to find statistics to justify what should be a no-brainer!</p>
 Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity means accepting an individual’s differences, creating a judgement-free environment where EVERYONE is comfortable talking about things, sharing opinions openly. For me, diversity is about having diverse thinking.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>I would like to recommend <a href="https://www.vishen.com/">Vishen Lakhiani’s</a> work at Mindvalley. I love listening to his podcast and all the speakers he brings from different backgrounds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reading-wise, I would recommend Rebel Ideas by Matthew Syed. It’s a great read for anyone looking to understand more about diverse thinking.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>&nbsp;Read more, take off the pressure and have fun!</p>
<p>Surround yourself with people who bring out the best in you or inspire you.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that “entrepreneurs don’t confront the world; they create and change the world. When you have real conviction, you have the power, literally, to change the world.’</p>

<p>Developers building on the NEAR blockchain now have a powerful way to manage user identities and dynamic off-chain data in their applications. <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>, the decentralized network for data stream processing, now supports NEAR wallets.</p><p>NEAR is currently hosting an Open Web Community <a href="https://createbase.community/hackathon/">hackathon</a> with a prize for integrating <a>IDX</a> profiles on Ceramic with a NEAR Sputnik DAO. </p><a href="https://gov.near.org/t/near-ceramic-sputnik-dao-bounty/2391">  NEAR + Ceramic: Sputnik DAO Bounty  NEAR + Ceramic: Sputnik DAO Bounty We are so excited to partner with Ceramic Network! Developers building on NEAR Protocol have powerful ways to manage user identities and dynamic off-chain data in their applications. Ceramic, the decentralized network for data stream processing, now supports NEA…  NEAR Forumjlwaugh    </a> Blockchain, Data &amp; Identity: a full stack for Web3 developers <p>NEAR Protocol offers developers the most scalable and dev-friendly infrastructure for building decentralized apps and services. Great Web3 and DeFi apps require more than a smart contract platform. They also need sophisticated, scalable and dependable data management infrastructure. Ceramic provides advanced database-like features such as mutability, version control, access control, and programmable logic. It is also the foundation for <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX</a>, Web3's first cross-chain identity model.</p><p>Now that NEAR and Ceramic can easily be used together, developers can:</p>  Build data-rich user experiences and social features on fully decentralized tech  Give users cloud-like backup, sync and recovery without running a centralized server  Publish content on the open web without the need to anchor IPFS hashes on-chain  Leverage interoperable profiles, social graphs and reputations across the Web3 ecosystem   Ceramic now supports NEAR wallets <p>Starting today, developers building applications on NEAR can easily add support for Ceramic and IDX in their application with a seamless user experience. NEAR key pairs have been added as a supported signing and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/#currently-supported-blockchains">authentication method</a> for Ceramic's data streams, so users can now perform transactions on Ceramic with their existing NEAR wallets.</p><p>Developers have already begun to combine these two networks to create applications like NEAR Personas:</p> NEAR: Easy to build on &amp; easy to use <p><a href="https://near.org">NEAR Protocol</a> is a Proof-of-Stake, climate-neutral, layer one blockchain protocol and smart contract platform. Developer experience and end-user accessibility are the top priorities for NEAR, all the way down to the protocol level. Developers can use familiar tools, such as Rust or AssemblyScript, to build on NEAR’s WASM-based runtime, and the application build/test/deploy cycle is much faster and simpler than on most networks––with fast finality and very low transaction fees (usually less than one cent).</p><p>NEAR’s unique contract-based account model provides the flexibility to onboard users to an application who either don’t hold NEAR tokens or have never interacted with a blockchain, a process that can take dozens of steps and fiat onramps with most other networks. Human-readable, named account addresses (i.e. ceramic.near) replace long, clunky hex strings and can support multiple names within a single public key. With progressive onboarding, the crypto elements of using decentralized apps on NEAR can be 100% abstracted away from the user and the complexities of gas fees, storage costs, seed phrases, and keys are obscured from their experience until they are ready to claim their wallet and hold their own tokens.</p> Ceramic: Decentralized data streams <p>Ceramic provides developers with database-like functionality for storing all kinds of dynamic, mutable content. This finally gives developers a Web3 native way to add critical features like rich identities (profiles, reputation, social graphs), user-generated content (posts, interactions), dynamic application-data, and much more.</p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/">Ceramic's unique stream-based architecture</a> is designed for web-scale volume and latency and to handle any type of data model. Built on top of open standards including IPFS, libp2p, and DIDs and compatible with any raw storage protocol like Filecoin or Arweave, all information stored on Ceramic exists within a permissionless cross-chain network that lets developers tap into an ever growing library of identities and data while using their preferred stack.</p> IDX: Cross-chain identity and user-centric data <p>Identity is the first use case enabled by Ceramic's building blocks for open source information. <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX (identity index)</a> is a cross-chain identity protocol that inherits Ceramic's properties to provide developers with a user-centric replacement for server-siloed user tables. By making it easy to structure and associate data to user's personal index, IDX lets applications save, discover and route to users' data.</p><p>The IDX SDK makes it simple to manage users and deliver great data-driven experiences using the same NEAR keys and wallets as developers and users are already relying on. Users can also link multiple keys, from any wallet and multiple blockchains, to the same identity. This is essential to developers who want to serve users over time, as it enables key rotation, data interoperability across accounts, and rich cross-chain profiles, reputations and experiences (including 50,000+ profiles on Ethereum today).</p> Getting started with Ceramic on NEAR <p>NEAR is currently hosting an Open Web Community <a href="https://createbase.community/hackathon/">hackathon</a>! There is a prize for integrating Ceramic profiles with a NEAR Sputnik DAO.</p>  To install NEAR, follow their <a href="https://docs.near.org">documentation</a>.  To add IDX to your project, follow this <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">installation guide</a>.  To use Ceramic for streams without IDX, follow this <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/">installation guide</a>.  Regardless of which option you choose, you should also select 3ID Connect as your DID wallet during the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/">authentication</a> process which handles the integration with NEAR wallets.

  <p>This blog post summarizes the key highlights of the Digital Immunization Passport (DIP) project. We implemented and evaluated an end-to-end workflow for handling immunization information in a human-centric way, and we provided the necessary infrastructure for all participating stakeholders to demonstrated the functionality in real-world use cases: Yellow Fever and Tick-borne encephalitis vaccination.<br>
The project has received funding from <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/">NGI_DAPSI</a> (DAPSI 1st open call), the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 871498.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The focus of this project is on Data Interoperability &amp; Compatibility through establishing interfaces between health industry and individuals as well as pushing forward on standardized interfaces for data stores. Additionally, we address Data Transparency (Usage Policies and Data Provenance in Semantic Containers) and Security &amp; Privacy (by applying blockchain technology and digital watermarking on data sharing). A key challenge in making institutional data available to individuals is authentication. In this project we demonstrated the use of biometric features to identify individuals and generate a unique identifier that can either be managed as a decentralized identifier (DID) or via a national Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).</p>
<p>The project team consisted of the partners OwnYourData (OYD) and the Human Colossus Foundation (HCF), who shared conceptual and development work. As a result the following deliverables were made available:</p>

 Rory Torres shares her experience as part of Berkman Klein’s latest global research&nbsp;sprint <p>In an increasingly digital world, our experiences online are shaped by data gathered and wielded to tailor experiences. But what control do users have over that data, where it goes, and how it is&nbsp;used?</p><p>Questions of control over personal data were a cross-cutting theme throughout a <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2021-03/research-sprint-examines-digital-self-determination-increasingly-interconnected-world">Research Sprint</a> co-hosted by the <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalasiahub.org/">Digital Asia Hub</a>. The Sprint also examined other important dimensions of self-determination in the digitally networked world, for instance, self-expression and participation in civic life and the digital economy, or relationship-building and well-being, to name just a few application areas.</p><p>The three-month program for graduate students focused on digital self-determination spanning a range of geographies, backgrounds, and contexts. The cohort, who came from 21 countries across the globe, convened regularly to participate in critical discussions and create accessible educational resources — including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination">Wikipedia page</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Digital_self-determination">Wikiversity Living Syllabus</a> — on the&nbsp;topic.</p>Mary Rhauline “Rory” Torres, Harvard Law LL.M. ’21 was a participant in a recent Research Sprint from the Berkman Klein Center. Courtesy&nbsp;image.<p>One participant, Mary Rhauline “Rory” Torres, Harvard Law LL.M. ’21, joined the sprint from Mangaldan, Pangasinan, in the Philippines. We spoke with Torres about her experience in the program, what she learned, and how it informed her&nbsp;work.</p> What motivated you to join the Research Sprint and explore digital self-determination? <p>I learned about the Research Sprint when Professor <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ugasser">Urs Gasser</a> posted it in his Comparative Digital Privacy course. The call to participate resonated with me because there was a huge surge of new Internet participants in South East Asia when the pandemic hit. That’s 40 million new users of the Internet who are basically opening up their lives to the digital world. It’s an exciting place, but also has threats and harms. Even those of us who have been connected for a while are still scrambling to find our place in the digital space. I thought learning about digital self-determination can help all of us make sense of our role in the Internet as individuals and as a community, and thrive in&nbsp;it.</p> How has your understanding of the concept changed or evolved over the past few&nbsp;months? <p>Prior to the Research Sprint, my understanding of digital self-determination was limited to empowering an individual to participate in a digital environment and being equipped to do so responsibly, much like digital citizenship. I didn’t realize how digital self-determination is a labyrinth until we started to talk about it with related concepts like digital rights, digital colonialism, informational self-determination; to situate it in various contexts like digital health, digital economy, digital information; and to ground it in principles that would realize self-determination, such as trustworthy data spaces. It’s all very interesting and&nbsp;complex!</p> The Research Sprint is interdisciplinary and international by design. What was that experience like working with graduate students around the world to explore digital self-determination? <p>The Sprint is composed of an amazing group of people from all over the world with so many diverse backgrounds. There are students studying psychology, communication, political science, social science, and culture. The diversity of language, culture, and studies makes the task of understanding digital self-determination challenging because we all have different contexts. But there’s also beauty in it because it allows us to find connections, confront ourselves with different, sometimes opposing perspectives, and accept and respect&nbsp;that.</p> Your cohort is coming together to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination">Wikipedia entry</a> on digital self-determination. Could you explain the processes behind that task, and what you hope the impact is of the&nbsp;entry? <p>We started with gathering a bibliography of articles that relate to digital self-determination. Building on that bibliography, the group created an outline in a shared Google document. We’ve since then expanded that outline by communicating through Slack, gathered volunteers to write sections that are of interest to them, and some have met through Zoom or smaller chat groups to get feedback, do peer review, and make&nbsp;changes.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination">Wikipedia entry</a> is divided into three parts: first, an overview of the history of self-determination in philosophy, psychology, and its legal adaptations, and defining self-determination in the digital sphere; second, identifying practical elements that support the realization of digital self-determination, such as digital infrastructure, equal access, privacy protections; and third, current issues relevant to digital self-determination, including a discussion on regulation and legal frameworks, which I am contributing to.</p><p>Having a Wiki entry on digital self-determination is a big first step to bringing the principle out into the digital space, making it more accessible and understandable, and keeping in mind that the concept is a work in progress.</p> What was the most interesting topic you explored during the&nbsp;program? <p>The session on Information Diet was extremely interesting because it relates so well to our daily lives: living at a place and time where information seems to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time. One of the first things I do in the morning is open my phone, read the “recommended stories” of the New York Times on my account, open the Telegram information group on the situation of COVID-19 in the Philippines, check my emails and I’m bombarded by the newsletters that I’ve subscribed to, and then there’s Facebook. There’s just so much information, so there’s this burden of having no excuse not to know about an important issue. And there’s so much disinformation, that filtering out reliable from unreliable content has become so overwhelming.</p><p>So I really loved Professor <a href="https://sarah.genner.cc/">Sarah Genner</a>’s presentation on Information Diet and what it means to be in the driver’s seat in the digital age and not the other way around and having an overview of how to disconnect, do a digital detox, and avoid digital distractions. While studying for my exams, I used the Pomodoro Technique and the amount of studying I was able to clock in was almost cathartic.</p> Was there a particular speaker that stood out to you, or sparked a new interest? <p>I was fascinated by Professor <a href="https://nishantshah.online/">Nishant Shah</a>’s talk on the formation of our identities in the digital age. He provoked a lot of questions on how an individual defines one’s identity through digital artifacts — that one may or may not have created or uploaded for oneself; how digital spaces may constrain our definition of ourselves in and out of cyberspace; and how do we preserve these identities — or do we even want&nbsp;to?</p> You host a blog about parenting. From your perspective, how should adults address digital self-determination with children? <p>In the same talk, Professor Shah’s example of his nephew’s thousands of photos in the cloud uploaded for him by his relatives resonated with me as a parent. As a mother of a four-year-old, it’s so difficult to restrain me from uploading pictures of my child — what Professor <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/11018/Plunkett">Leah Plunkett</a> calls “Sharenthood.” Parents create digital footprints of our children and so much of their private moments are in the digital space already. But beyond the dangers of violating the privacy of children, the creation of this catalog of children’s lives online may limit their ability to define who they are, to reflect on their experiences, to associate objects to their memories, because so much has already been documented for&nbsp;them.</p><p>So when is digitization too much that it harms children’s self-determination — is a topic I want to explore further. It goes hand-in-hand with other parenting issues in the digital era, like safety. Parents should educate themselves about technology and how our children interact with it because it’s not going away and it plays a large role in how they define themselves and their realities. I personally recommend Professor Urs Gasser’s book “<a href="https://today.law.harvard.edu/the-connected-parent-offers-guidance-insight-into-digital-parenting/">The Connected Parent</a>” as a starting&nbsp;point.</p>Rory Torres with her daughter. Courtesy&nbsp;image. How did your studies as an LL.M. student at Harvard Law School — and your interests in tech and the law — inform or shape your perception of the&nbsp;program? <p>When we talk about law and technology, there’s always a discussion of seemingly competing but often interacting concepts: the individual and the collective, the private and the public, the offline and the online. As an LL.M. student, what I have realized in studying these concepts as they relate to technology is that technology is highly contextual and it is fast-changing, such that, as a student of the law, it is difficult to create a single universal approach to encourage innovation that would provide a positive impact to the world or to address the harms or threats that technology can bring. This is the attitude that I have brought with me to the Research Sprint, and it has helped me broaden my perspective and try to see self-determination from the lens of participants and speakers with various backgrounds and expertise.</p> How did participating in the Research Sprint inform your time at HLS and your future trajectory? <p>Finding my trajectory after HLS is an exercise of self-determination! At HLS, I curated my law and technology courses for business and technology, and Internet and society, because there’s always that tension between commercial interests and social issues. The Research Sprint in particular expanded my thinking beyond legal frameworks and allowed me to explore the field of social science and the Internet, and was especially inspired by Professor Lokman Tsui’s work on free expression, digital rights, and Internet policy in Asia. In relation to that, I’m also keen on exploring Privacy-by-Design and studying how to integrate digital self-determination into its principles, beyond respect for user privacy, and experimenting with startups on how to integrate Privacy-by-Design and digital self-determination as they develop their platforms.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/a-deep-dive-on-digital-self-determination-368c48d87705">A Deep-Dive on Digital Self-Determination</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Government is losing out because these companies don’t pay their fair share of taxes in countries of operation, thereby constraining public investments. These platforms use extractive and intrusive ways to collect data, stripping communities and individuals of privacy and control.

Finally, the data economy needs mechanisms for participatory governance and practice-based intermediation approaches.

 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;Tell us about your day – what gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;I am the Head of Financial Crime for a credit card company. I am also studying for a PhD in Criminal Justice Studies, looking at the role of insider fraudsters within business.</p>
<p>In my spare time I run STUC (Stammerers Through University Consultancy), an initiative which collaborates with universities nationwide offering better support for students and staff who stammer.</p>
<p>I’m really fascinated by the world of financial crime and how to prevent it. No two days are ever the same because the fraud landscape is continually changing.</p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;Employment-wise, I graduated with a French degree from the University of Warwick in 2014 and landed a job at Amazon working as a bilingual fraud investigations specialist. They hired me for my language skills and trained me in fraud detection and prevention on the job. From that point, I was hooked. I subsequently worked in the financial crime sector at Cifas, World First and, currently, Jaja Finance. I also completed a MSc in Counter Fraud &amp; Counter Corruption Studies before starting on my PhD. I wanted to have a combination of both professional and academic background in my line of work.</p>
<blockquote>
 Allow everyone to be themselves and work in a way that suits them. Your teams will feel more valued and much more loyal 
</blockquote>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;I’d say it is that the person I was when I started my first graduate job in 2014 is completely different to who I am now. I used to be shy, naïve, desperate to please and anxious of making the tiniest of mistakes. Now I am so much more confident, much less anxious. I understand that you can’t please everyone and that making mistakes is part of how you learn.</p>
<p>I’ve also learned that whilst having a great manager is invaluable to aid your personal and professional development, having not-so-great managers will teach you just as much.</p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What would you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;Diversity and inclusion should be at the forefront of everything you do, as well as instilling a culture that promotes acceptance and versatility. Trying to mould people to fit a certain type of employee will only deter them and staff turnover will be high. If you allow everyone to be themselves and work in a way that suits them, they will feel more valued and will show loyalty.WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you?</p>
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;Diversity is a necessity for the progression, learning and development of both individuals and businesses.</p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members and why? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;I always used to try too hard to people-please. I’d obsess over what people thought of me, and regularly put myself in uncomfortable situations under the belief that it would help me be liked. So my recommendation would be The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**k by Sarah Knight!</p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;Your stammer doesn’t define your success. One day you’ll decide that you can’t substitute words anymore and that if you stammer, so what? People may not understand it, they may not react in a way you like, but you’ll rise above it and will be able to live the life you want – because you’ll learn that your words are just as important as everyone else’s.</p>

<blockquote>
 I’d much rather keep tabs on pastoralists use of SMS or small business owners workarounds for digital payments than reading the latest news onTechCrunch. 
</blockquote>
 Tell us about your role and what gets you out of bed in the morning 
<p>Functionally, I support when / where / why / how to integrate digital technologies (and partners, service providers) into resource constrained contexts, primarily for purposes of humanitarian response. Most recently, I’ve been focused on supporting large-scale humanitarian cash transfer programmes, as well as supporting essential work in mobile health, agriculture, nutrition and supply chain programs.</p>
<p>I love helping others to make informed decisions around what will be the most impactful technologies, partnerships etc. and I typically serve as a bridge between technologists and non-technologists. I suppose I’m a kind of trusted broker and often my role is hidden.&nbsp; Slowly, I think people are starting to realize this can be integral to the success of a large scale tech project and I love the feeling that my role is so connected to the success of projects that have such an impact on fellow human beings.</p>
<p>I also love learning how people are bending simple technologies for their own needs, in seemingly “less developed” locations or within “complex crises.” I’d much rather keep tabs on pastoralists use of SMS or small business owners workarounds for digital payments than reading the latest news on TechCrunch.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Luck, curiosity and cautiously stumbling along unexpected pathways. I’m fairly up front about what I know and what I don’t know. This results in a lot of leaning in on others to help develop the situational awareness we need to piece together the best outcomes re digital integrations.</p>
<p>More specifically, my interest in the world of “impactful tech” was sparked when I spent a very brief time in Haiti a few days after the 2010 earthquake. Basic ICT and mobile technology was accessible to many and I was fascinated how it became an invaluable tool, updating (OpenStreet) maps to allow for better co-ordination of logistics etc.. I’ve basically followed that curiosity ever since.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
 
 Trust is key. 
 Technology / ICT is an industry. Regardless of goodwill intent, this should never be forgotten. 
 “Being an expert” is very relative. It’s been quite fascinating to observe the quick ascent of experts in “emerging technologies” (e.g. AI, ML, blockchain / digital ID) and how they will “most definitely” impact “the unbanked” or other demographics in the developing world. All I can say is it seems there are a lot of experts who understand technology and its potential. But I believe there are far fewer who can navigate how to make it all work sustainably in a new context, with new populations. 
 
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
 
 START educating people on what actually makes a recognized identity. What are the fundamental building blocks? Which public policies and stakeholders / authorities should be involved? 
 STOP selling pipe dreams based solely on product designs. No ID app or platform will hold meaning unless the right stakeholders (and regulators) are engaged and on board. Thankfully we are seeing a reduction in Marketing campaign that promote “digital ID for all refugees” or the like. 
 CONTINUE promoting standards that uphold interoperability. Continue to educate governments on what makes a good public technology / societal platform, as well as share successes of large-scale (and govt led) technology initiatives. Digital ID is the backbone of a new age of digital governance. Ot needs to be treated as more than just a pilot project, dependent on archaic RFP / tender processes. 
 
 What does diversity mean to you?&nbsp;&nbsp;* 
<blockquote>
 Without diversity, my perspectives on life would be much less interesting (or balanced) !! 
</blockquote>
 What book, film or piece of art would you recommend to fellow WiD members? 
<p>My book would be: Fake Like Me, by Barbara Bourland.&nbsp; Full disclosure ….. the author is a friend! But it’s a fun read for summer that’s ostensibly a murder mystery based in an artists’ colony. Ultimately, it’s also a witty introspection into identity and how easy it is to create (and destroy) it.</p>
<p>Art – <a href="https://artscoops.com/">https://artscoops.com/ </a>&nbsp;I know it’s not a single piece, I know, but it’s a great place to keep revisiting you’re wanting to support artists from the Middle East.</p>
 
 Finally, what advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>“You won’t end up in Law School. Though maybe don’t tell Mom just yet!!”</p>

<p>Developers building multi-chain applications have a powerful new combination to work with, as Ceramic now supports Moonbeam applications. &nbsp;Moonbeam offers developers an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot, providing an easy path to a multi-chain implementation. Ceramic adds support for advanced data management and cross-chain identity. Together, this enables developers and users to depend on the same accounts and wallets to manage transactions, identities, and data across Ethereum and Polkadot applications. </p> A full stack for cross-chain applications <p>Since Moonbeam uses the same keypairs and wallets as Ethereum, signing and<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/#currently-supported-blockchains"> </a>authentication for Ceramic's data streams is also supported out of the box. Now that Moonbeam and Ceramic can easily be used together, developers can:</p>  Build data-rich user experiences and social features on fully decentralized tech  Give users cloud-like backup, sync and recovery without running a centralized server  Publish content on the open web without the need to anchor IPFS hashes on-chain  Leverage interoperable profiles, social graphs and reputations across the Web3 ecosystem  <p>"Moonbeam devs and users will now be able to easily implement Ceramic's streaming data and cross-chain identity protocols due to the same keys and wallets being utilized that developers and users are already familiar with," says Nate Hamilton, Director of Business Development at Moonbeam. </p><blockquote>The Ceramic and Moonbeam teams look towards the same goal: proving the best-in-class user experience</blockquote><p>Currently, Moonbase Alpha, the Moonbeam TestNet, has been added as a supported chain. Users can now perform transactions on Ceramic and Moonbase Alpha with their existing wallets. Currently, Moonbeam is compatible with MetaMask and MathWallet.</p> About Moonbeam:  <p>Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on the Polkadot network that makes it easy to build natively interoperable applications. This Ethereum compatibility allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and DApp frontends to Moonbeam with minimal changes. As a parachain on the Polkadot network, Moonbeam will benefit from the shared security of the Polkadot relay chain and integrations with other chains that are connected to Polkadot. Currently, in active development by PureStake, Moonbeam is expected to reach MainNet by mid-2021. </p><p>Learn more: <a href="https://moonbeam.network/?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=announcement&amp;utm_content=subscan">https://moonbeam.network/</a>.</p> About Ceramic <p>Ceramic provides developers with database-like functionality for storing all kinds of dynamic, mutable content. This finally gives developers a Web3 native way to add critical features like rich identities (profiles, reputation, social graphs), user-generated content (posts, interactions), dynamic application-data, and much more.</p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/#streams">Ceramic's stream-based architecture</a> is designed for web-scale volume and latency and to handle any type of data. Built on top of open standards including IPFS, libp2p, and DIDs and compatible with any raw storage protocol like Filecoin or Arweave, all information stored on Ceramic exists within a permissionless cross-chain network that lets developers tap into an ever growing library of identities and data while using their preferred stack.</p> IDX: Cross-chain identity and user-centric data <p>Identity is the first use case enabled by Ceramic's building blocks for open source information. <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX (identity index)</a> is a cross-chain identity protocol that inherits Ceramic's properties to provide developers with a user-centric replacement for server-siloed user tables. By making it easy to structure and associate data to a user's personal index, IDX lets applications save, discover and route to users' data.</p><p>The IDX SDK makes it simple to manage users and deliver great data-driven experiences using the same keys and wallets as developers and users are already relying on. Users can also link multiple keys, from any wallet and multiple blockchains, to the same identity. This is essential to developers who want to serve users over time, as it enables key rotation, data interoperability across accounts, and rich cross-chain profiles, reputations and experiences (including 50,000+ profiles on Ethereum today).</p> Getting started with Ceramic and Moonbeam   To get started on Moonbeam visit their <a href="https://docs.moonbeam.network/">documentation site</a>  To add IDX to your project, follow this<a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>  To use Ceramic for streams without IDX, follow this<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>.

 <a href="http://digitalgovernment.scot"></a>In the <a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/files/ash/files/300871_hvd_ash_digital_trans_1.pdf">Harvard white paper</a> on Digital Government Transformation Richard Pope provides a working definition of ‘GaaP’ – Government as a Platform. 
 “GaaP should reorganize the work of government around a network of shared APIs and components, open-standards and canonical datasets, so that civil servants, businesses, and others can deliver radically better services to the public more safely, efficiently, and accountably.” 
<p>He explores the topic through a summary round up of how this approach has been pioneered and adopted in countries like India, Estonia and the UK.</p>
<p>Our white paper builds on this, providing detailed blueprint analysis of GaaP implementations across the world.</p>
 #LegoGovernment – Plug and Play Service Design 
<p>GaaP is such a powerful approach because it address the root issue that inhibits integrated Government services.</p>
<p>Like all large enterprise organizations Governments are structured via rigidly delineated departments and agencies, and typically deploy their own dedicated IT for only their business processes, creating isolated silos. The DWP develops their own standalone IT systems, Tax and Healthcare does the same, … and so on.</p>
<p>As the Harvard paper describes:</p>
<p>“There is a lot of duplication in government. Generally, departments and agencies are vertically integrated, with each running its own version of a system (a public website, a payment gateway, a printing service, an address lookup, etc.) that’s similar but not identical to all the others. Platforms have been cited as a way to remove that duplication and break down organizational silos.</p>
<p>Siloed approaches to transformation don’t work,” <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/29/government-as-a-platform-the-next-phase-of-digital-transformation/">Mike Bracken wrote in 2015</a>. “Reinventing the wheel every single time we build a service has led to far too much duplication and waste. That’s not good enough.”</p>
<p>This is a critical point for those working in public sector service design. When we consider how services are actually delivered we see that the workflow processes that enable them cut across these silos, as illustrated through this simple example:</p>
<p>This sets the scene for the concept of “Lego Government”. Rather than the traditional approach of building Government services via dedicated line of business applications, they are created via coupling together modular components.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/features/inside-dwp%E2%80%99s-digital-coronavirus-response-%E2%80%93-apis-reuse-and-micro-services">This PublicTechnology interview</a>&nbsp;explores in detail how the DWP are working with APIs. For example when the NHS undertakes a real-time check for prescription charge exemption they call the DWP passport benefit API which validates the enquiry. They also perform this check for the Department for Education for free school meals entitlement and for local authorities for the disabled Blue Badge award.</p>
<p>They make the critical point that they endevour to reuse existing APIs wherever possible, and where they don’t they develop them via ‘<a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/news/how-microservices-empowered-uks-dwp-to-pivot-during-covid-19/elsewhere-web/2020/08/04">microservices</a>‘ – Small snippets of code intended only for this purpose. This enables very rapid solutioning, only four weeks in some cases.</p>
<p>Underpinning the business logic and service design layer the core technology architecture is the API Gateway platform.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the DWP describes:</p>
<p>“Once we identified – or built – the API that met the requirement, we deployed it onto our current shared API Gateway which was already hosted in our internet-facing cloud. This meant that all the infrastructure was already in place so, once the API was tested and proven to be suitable, it could be deployed really easily through the existing shared infrastructure. Historically, the process of building the underlying infrastructure could take months; we deployed new APIs, or extended throughput on existing APIs within two days. This would not have been possible without the API Library or the shared API Gateway.”</p>
<p>Hosting their API gateway in a cloud environment allowed the team to scale up in near real-time, after completing assessment of forecasted API volumes. This microservices approach will build the pathway towards the future, with the hope that eventually they will be able to “join up services across government and one initiative is that we’re creating a central cross-government API Registry that will enable us to share what APIs we already have available, as well as being able to see what APIs other government departments have available.”</p>

<p>The Future of Decentralized Escrow: Smart Payments</p>
<p>Blockchain Development<br>
A Smart payment, which occurs via a Hashed-Timelock Contract (HTLC), is a transfer of Tokens where the payment condition is enforced by the Blockchain. It is a concept originated within the Bitcoin community that is applied on Lightning Network and can be used on Ethereum, and in Cosmos chains</p>
<p>Condition is a Hashlock.</p>
<p>A Hashlock or the digest of a cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256, is a type of impediment that restricts the expenditure of an output until a specific piece of data is<br>
publicly disclosed. Hashlocks have the useful property that once a Hashlock is made public, any other Hashlock protected by the same key can also be opened. This allows for the creation of multiple outputs that are all encumbered by the same Hashlock and that all become executable at the same time.</p>
<p>The timelock is a time impediment, like a time safe, where the Smart Contract states that the recipient can claim the funds by presenting<br>
a valid pre-image of the hash digest before a specified deadline (timeout). After the timeout, the funds are automatically returned to the sender.</p>
<p>HTLCs are enforced by the Blockchain, so the transacting parties only need to trust that the Blockchain is executing the contract correctly, (not the counterparty.) It can also be expected that HTLCs can be executed on different Blockchains and even without the presence of a Blockchain, with Agreements (HTLAs).</p>
<p>Conditional Payments<br>
Two parties using an HTLA on a Blockchain that does not support Hashlock and Timeout could proceed as follows: the sender sends a message to the recipient telling it that it wants to “prepare” a transfer with a specified Hashlock and Timeout. The parties agree that if the recipient submits the pre-image hash before the<br>
Timeout, the transfer is executed and the sender owes the money to the recipient. Debts are settled through simple transfers on the Blockchain.</p>
<p>In the case of a post-funding agreement, the sender can settle its debt with the recipient for every payment if its Blockchain is fast and has low fees, or once the total amount owed reaches the parties’ credit limit. In this case, the recipient must rely on the sender to pay what they owe. The risk can be reduced by limiting the amount of money the sender can send before payment.</p>
<p>For pre-funded agreements, the sender transfers the amount of a single payment or a large amount to the recipient and benefits from the equivalent of a line of credit.<br>
The recipient then deducts the amount of any “conditional transfer” executed from the pre-funded amount. In this case, the sender must trust that the recipient will not steal the pre-funded amount, but this risk can obviously be reduced by limiting the pre-funded amount.</p>
<p>HTLAs thus work with Blockchains that support Hashlock and timelock (such as HTLC) and with Blockchains that do not support them.</p>
<p>In the future, this methodology could be used in the CommercioPay module in the <a href="http://commercio.network">Commercio.network</a> Blockchain.</p>

<p>By Rae Rivera, Ph.D., Director of Certification, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance today&nbsp; introduced a significant update to its Metadata Service (MDS). The service provides information about the certification status of authenticators, authenticator capabilities, and any known security issues. The FIDO MDS provides organizations deploying FIDO servers with a centralized and trusted source of information about FIDO authenticators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MDS is a web-based repository where vendors can publish metadata about their certified FIDO authenticators. Relying parties use this information&nbsp; to validate authenticator attestation and prove the authenticity of the device model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With over 100 authenticator products on the market today, and demand for strong authentication on the rise, the need for an easy-to-use repository to load and view FIDO Certified authenticators has grown in importance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just last week, the Biden administration mandated multi-factor authentication for all government agencies to thwart phishing attempts and protect against account takeover.&nbsp; Governments and other regulated industries such as banking and healthcare especially need to know that authenticators being used to access their systems are genuine and meet certain requirements, including FIDO Certification status, compliance and other organizational requirements. The new features in the FIDO MDS allow organizations to more quickly and easily verify the attributes of the FIDO Authenticators being used to log in to their web services and applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s news is significant in several areas:</p>



  The new MDS has a more efficient and effective user interface that greatly simplifies the uploading and publishing of metadata.&nbsp;  There is a simplified API for relying parties to download metadata.  Metadata updates are now available daily instead of monthly, which ensures relying parties have access to the most up-to-date information.  The new MDS data format is now a single JSON structure, making it more compatible with standard web development tools. The new MDS format uses human-readable strings instead of numerical values, making it easier to read and understand.  The MDS data is now linked to the FIDO Certification program, which will ensure the reliability of the validity of metadata of FIDO Certified products.&nbsp;  The service now uses cloud caching to provide high availability and download performance.&nbsp;

	<p>On May 6, 2021, two days after the Me2B Alliance published our report on&nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/school-mobile-apps-student-data-sharing-behavior/">data sharing in school utility apps,</a>&nbsp;Google issued a “<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">pre-announcement”</a>&nbsp;describing major improvements to app labeling in the Android app store:&nbsp;</p>
<p>We work closely with developers to keep Google Play a <a href="https://www.android.com/safety/">safe</a>, trusted space for billions of people to enjoy the latest Android apps. Today,&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;pre-announcing an upcoming safety section in Google Play that will help people understand the data an app collects or shares, if that data is secured, and additional details that impact privacy and security.<br>
[Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html</a>&nbsp;]&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement signals a serious intention to not only catch up to Apple’s privacy label, but surpass it, by introducing independent validation of the Android app privacy information.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the official policy will be published in Q3 2021, and by Q2 2022,&nbsp;all&nbsp;apps in the Google Play store will need to provide the new “safety section” information.  Details on the new “safety section” are where the rubber meets the road, and as we noted in our report, there currently isn’t adequate privacy or safety labeling for apps. Nevertheless, we’re encouraged by the new policy, and hope that Google’s new safety section includes SDKs by name and owner.</p>
<p>[Source:&nbsp; <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html</a>&nbsp;]&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement also makes clear that the new “safety section” will be independently audited, though unclear if that will take effect in Q2 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance currently performs independent audits of apps and websites and looks forward to learning more about Google’s independent app auditing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But why wait until next year when you can get your app or website audited by us today? &nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/services/">Contact us</a>&nbsp;to get started.</p>

<p>What is a DAO?</p>
<p>The acronym stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. The concept of DAO comes from Bitcoin, which could be seen as the first prototype of DAO, and Ethereum where there are several examples of DAOs.</p>
<p>The crypto world community has always been fascinated by this new form of life. Not because of what it could do, or had done, but precisely because it was a new life form. Anyone who wants to create their own new digital life form can do so using a project called <a href="https://aragon.org">https://aragon.org</a> which is based on Cosmos SDK like Commercio.network.</p>
<p>Aragon allows a group of people to organize and collaborate freely without boundaries or intermediaries. It is technically possible to create global organizations and communities without bureaucracy. It should be pointed out that from a legal point of view, there are still no case law references that can give a DAO the status of a legal entity.</p>
<p>Like a blockchain, your DAO will live on the network.</p>
 
 It will survive as long as it does something that people will pay for. 
 There will be no way to remove it. 
 It will be radically transparent. 
 It will not be able to be stopped in any way. 
 It will be able to pay people to do whatever people are willing to do in exchange for its tokens. 
 It will follow its own rules that were programmed when it was created. 
 
<p>You could create an NGO, a domain manager, or a prediction market, or a foundation, all of which are completely autonomous (and own themselves)</p>
<p>The concept of a Distributed Autonomous Organization/ Corporation (DAO/DAC) is the ideal outcome of the Crypto economic revolution .</p>
<p>Its roots lie in themes about organizational decentralization that were described by Ori Brafman in The Starfish and the Spider (2007) and those about “peer production”, aptly described by Yochai Benkler in The Wealth of Networks (2006).</p>

  Being able to prove one’s identity is critical in modern society. This is 
no less the case for people being served by humanitarian organizations. 
Indeed, those without official identification are among the most 
vulnerable. While previous solutions to this challenge have relied on 
traditional means, these are not ideal, especially in the context of the 
current COVID-19 pandemic.

            <p>Oldoniyro, Kenya 2018: In a field pilot utilizing cash assistance and blockchain technology conducted by the Kenya Red Cross and IFRC, it was recognized that lack of official ID was a hindrance to receiving assistance. In the published <a href="https://preparecenter.org/resource/blockchain-open-loop-cash-transfer-pilot-project/">learning review</a> it was noted that 25% of the Kenya Red Cross’ caseload have no official IDs, highlighting the need to address the issue of identities. </p><p>Photo credit: Kenya Red Cross</p>
          
        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>In disaster and crisis situations, members of affected communities who do not have an officially recognized form of identification (ID) <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/22297">can face barriers to receiving aid</a>. Without ID, people made vulnerable by their situations cannot prove who they are, making it impossible for aid agencies to “know their customer” – often a pre-requisite for delivering services in an accountable way. While these challenges can sometimes be overcome, for instance through trusted proxies who do have an ID, such analogue solutions are not ideal.</p><p>Through a series of expert interviews and case studies of existing projects, a new report written by <a href="http://www.octd.co.uk">Oxford Centre for Technology and Development</a>, commissioned by IFRC, and supported by the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/digid">DIGID </a>consortium (Norwegian Red Cross, Norwegian Refugee Council, Norwegian Church Aid, Save the Children Norway), <a href="https://hiplatform.org/s/Digital-IdentityAn-Analysis-for-the-Humanitarian-Sector-Final.pdf">Digital Identity: An Analysis for the Humanitarian Sector</a> looks at the opportunities offered by digital identity technologies in humanitarian contexts, but also the risks. The report lists technical, ethical and sustainability aspects of digital ID solutions for organizations looking to explore, learn, and invest in such solutions. </p><p>For affected communities, obtaining a digital ID issued by humanitarian organizations can make it much easier (or indeed possible in the first place) to access services, including cash and voucher assistance, in multiple ways. First, they can use the digital ID to prove their identity where this was not previously possible due to a lack of official ID. Second, they can store certain attributes or credentials digitally, allowing them to have portable access to information such as training or education certificates, health records or legal records that might otherwise be left behind or destroyed when a disaster hits. Third, they can choose to reveal only relevant pieces of information instead of all their digital wallet’s contents.</p>


  <blockquote>
    “Without ID, people made vulnerable by their situations cannot prove who they are, making it impossible for aid agencies to “know their customer” – often a pre-requisite for delivering services in an accountable way.”
  </blockquote>
  

<p>The report points out that in an ideal world, digital ID technology would be “interoperable” throughout the sector whereby different humanitarian organizations would be able to recognize digital ID credentials, check the issuer, and extract only the data that is being shared by the owner of the digital ID. In this way, members of affected communities could avoid having to register repeatedly (and potentially having to relive trauma as they recount their story), better preserving their dignity.</p><p>Meanwhile, the report finds that aid organizations would also benefit from avoiding such repeat registration as their process could be made more time- and cost-efficient by deploying digital ID systems. Another advantage of an interoperable solution would be that trust and collaboration between aid organizations would be enhanced. The DIGID consortium was established for this very purpose: to see how different agencies can work together to best deliver services instead of developing siloed systems.</p><p>But the report also discusses challenges to the successful implementation of digital IDs and makes recommendations to address these: </p>  <p>Developing and rolling out a solution has a considerable cost, in terms of both money and time, including the need to upskill staff and volunteers. </p>  <p>Concerns around data privacy must also be addressed to maintain trust between organizations and the communities they serve. </p>  <p>Digital ID solutions depend on certain levels of literacy and access to technology and devices that can be variable and limited in crisis-affected communities.</p>  <p>Despite these difficulties, the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/s/Digital-IdentityAn-Analysis-for-the-Humanitarian-Sector-Final.pdf">report </a>offers hope that digital IDs will come to form an integral part of delivering humanitarian services, including cash and voucher assistance. In a rapidly evolving ecosystem of assistance and technology, humanitarian actors must involve themselves in the process from the outset, or risk having to play catch-up in an environment over which they have little or no control. </p><p>The DIGID consortium also held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjL1MOv7_Rc">webinar</a> introducing this report, as part of <a href="https://solferinoacademy.com/ifrc-data-digital-week-2021/">Data and Digital Week in April 2021</a>.</p><p><a href="https://hiplatform.org/blog/2021/5/19/digital-ids-in-the-humanitarian-sector-whats-the-big-deal">Permalink</a></p><p></p>

 Energy Web and Energy Peace Partners Announce Peace Renewable Energy Credit (P-REC) Digital Marketplace Platform <p>Zug, Switzerland and Sausalito, Calif. — 19 May 2021 — Today, Energy Web and <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/mission">Energy Peace Partners</a> (EPP) announced a new partnership to develop a digital marketplace platform to accelerate the development of renewable energy projects in fragile, energy-poor countries. EPP leverages climate finance solutions to promote peace and development by extending the renewable energy revolution to some of the planet’s most vulnerable populations. EPP developed the <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/prec">Peace Renewable Energy Credit</a> (P-REC), which certifies the social co-benefits of renewable energy in addition to renewables’ traditional environmental benefits.</p><p>An energy attribute certificate (EAC) — including renewable energy certificates (RECs) in the United States and guarantees of origin (GOs) in the EU — is an internationally-traded virtual commodity that represents 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable energy generated. P-RECs are issued under the I-REC Standard, the EAC standard in 40+ developing countries, and are issued as I-RECs with additional social co-benefits from new projects in fragile, energy-poor regions. To date, EPP has been authorized as the country issuer of P-RECs and I-RECs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and South Sudan. The first-ever P-REC transaction occurred in the DRC in 2020 through a <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/blog/announcing-the-first-sale-of-p-recs">groundbreaking collaboration</a> between Microsoft, Nuru, 3Degrees (an Energy Web member), and&nbsp;EPP.</p><p>The digital marketplace platform will leverage the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Energy Web Origin</a> open-source software development toolkit, harmonize with <a href="https://www.irecstandard.org/">The IREC Standard</a>, and be prepared to integrate with <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, an application to find and digitally source verified, emissions-free renewable energy globally. Simply put, the platform will lead to the development of a digital P-REC purchase option for renewable energy buyers, including individuals, that want to support the development of high-impact renewable energy projects for communities where these projects are installed.</p><p>The platform will help EPP market P-REC projects, increase demand among a wider set of corporate and individual buyers, scale up the global P-REC market, and facilitate P-REC transactions in a streamlined way. For Energy Web, this partnership will generate new open-source functionality for EW Origin to support digitized EAC “forward agreements” that enable buyers to easily commit to supporting additional renewable energy facilities, which in turn helps reduce the upfront costs of new facilities and improve financing terms.</p><p>“This is an incredibly exciting partnership and project,” said Sherwin Das, Managing Director of EPP. “Together we’re bringing a cutting-edge, digital solution that will contribute to scaling up the market for P-RECs and, in doing so, unlock more renewable energy investment in high-impact projects around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>“We’re proud to partner with EPP on this renewables marketplace,” added Doug Miller, global markets lead for Energy Web. “This partnership represents Energy Web’s first engagement with projects in Africa and a breakthrough opportunity to introduce digital tools that make it easy for local communities to attract renewable energy buyers who can help expand clean energy access and related social co-benefits in a frictionless way. This partnership will also result in a new standardized digital approach to renewable energy forward agreements that we think will serve as an attractive product for renewable energy buyers that want to support additional products outside of Africa, yet are simpler to implement than power purchase agreements, especially in regulated markets like most I-REC markets.”</p><p>Both EPP and I-REC Standard are also advisors to EW Zero, which in December <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-awarded-good-energies-foundation-grant-for-new-global-renewables-marketplace-794eaa7e14e0">received a grant</a> from the Good Energies Foundation to commercialize the platform. For the EPP P-REC marketplace, the joint team expects to complete an initial proof of concept (POC) by the end of&nbsp;2021.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. We enable any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors our tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>About Energy Peace Partners<br>The mission of Energy Peace Partners (EPP) is peace and stability for all, powered by renewable energy. EPP brings together expertise in international peacebuilding and renewable energy in order to leverage climate finance solutions that support peace in places affected by violent conflict. We believe that a paradigm shift toward climate-sensitive development can deliver enduring benefits to the planet’s most vulnerable populations. Our efforts create an enabling environment for introducing renewable energy that can serve as the building blocks for&nbsp;peace.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-and-energy-peace-partners-announce-peace-renewable-energy-credit-p-rec-digital-6295ea233218">Energy Web and Energy Peace Partners Announce Peace Renewable Energy Credit (P-REC) Digital…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/tag/blockchain/"></a>This video is about, why and how China decided to go digital. What is the Digital Yuan? How does the Digital Currency work? Is DCEP a cryptocurrency? Is the digital Yuan blockchain based? 
 Video Summary 
<p>The nature of money is something that the average person living a thousand or one hundred or maybe even ten years ago spent a very little time thinking about outside of a few major economic crashes.</p>
<p>Money was a relatively constant and predictable thing in our lives, but in the last decade or so, the very nature of it has started to change with digital payments, mobile wallets, cryptocurrency and most recently the first ever attempt at a real digital currency by a major economy. The Chinese government started rolling out its digital Yuan, officially called the DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment) and small pilot projects last year.</p>
<p>China started talking about its own digital currency in 2013 for the first time the same year, WeChat, the country’s most popular messaging and social app, launched its mobile wallet, following in the footsteps of Alibaba Alipay. Alibaba’s Alipay was launched in February 2004.</p>
<p>Four years after that is in 2009 Bitcoin was launched. At first, the new digital currency seemed like little more than a side project of the government going through a couple of years of relatively slow research and development phase. But their focus started intensifying dramatically around 2017, leading to the first public trials in 2020 spending for Chinese cities and hundreds of merchants. And the timing of this increased interest is no coincidence.</p>
<p>At the end of 2017, Bitcoin hit its first real peak in valuation, creating widespread awareness for cryptocurrency around the world. In 2018, Facebook announced Libra with bold ambitions to create a cross-border currency for its over two billion users during this year’s mobile wallet exploded in popularity and China online lending through Internet companies ballooned to huge proportions in the country.</p>
<p>And the United States government launched its trade war against China, which increased the risk of financial sanctions. Within the span of just a few years, the entire Chinese monetary system, including its currency and its traditional banking sector, started facing major threats from both inside and outside of the country. Domestically, Tencent and Alibaba, China’s two largest tech companies, started to gobble up the entire finance industry of the country.</p>
<p>Their respective mobile wallets came to dominate the category, and mobile payments skyrocketed in popularity to mind blowing 32 percent of all sales in the country, leading to many merchants simply stopping to accept other payment methods, including cash or credit cards completely. Given their incredible growth, the two are now on a path to swallow up almost all payment in the country within just a few years.</p>
<p>And these two giants were increasingly starting to strike exclusivity deals with more and more merchants, meaning that consumers even now often have no choice but to use their services. Not only that, most giants and group especially also got heavily involved in offering other financial services like loans or insurances on the backs of their wallets. The group has an incredibly detailed picture of its users, including how they make and spend money both online and offline.</p>
<p>Combining financial services with e-commerce and social media profiles in real time create such strong synergies that traditional institutions simply cannot compete with them. And to top things off, a few months back, Jack Ma from the Alibaba Group even expressed in his now infamous speech that he thought the law’s traditional financial institutions have to operate under strict rules on the amount of cash banks have to keep in reserves in order to avoid potential bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The Chinese government was also becoming increasingly wary internationally. In 2019, vice president of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, explained why he thought the country needed an alternative to the SWIFT system. SWIFT is an organization that handles the communication for the majority of international bank transfers. Basically, most of the time somebody wants to make an international transaction. They send the message to SWIFT, who processes it and sends it to the right recipient.</p>
<p>The system is slow and ancient and the organization does most of its processing in Europe and the U.S. and the U.S. in particular has used Swift in the past to spy on transactions using the NSA. It has ceased transactions between citizens of third-party countries like Germany and Denmark that it had deemed unlawful. China, especially since the start of its trade war with the United States, sees its reliance on the swift system as a major source of danger for its sovereignty and thinks that the system could be used to essentially cut it out of the international financial world altogether.</p>
<p>And finally, China also started getting increasingly nervous about crypto currencies, as on the long term, those could potentially replace the Yuan altogether, leaving no control over its currency in the government’s hand at all. It has banned cryptocurrency exchanges and then the cryptocurrency themselves from being used as money to pay for things in the country. A couple of years down the line, cryptocurrency could become a real danger to their control over the economy.</p>
<p>China decided to turn to the digital yuan project, among other things, starting with its most urgent domestic priorities. It designed the DCEP to specifically combat mobile wallets by giving it not only the convenience of those wallets, but also many of the characteristics of a national currency like the regular Yuan. Digital Yuan is issued by the People’s Bank of China and can be withdrawn by them as well. The value of the two are designed to match. They are supposed to be freely exchangeable. Interestingly, the DCEP is also supposed to be usable even without an Internet connection, just like cash. So two users in a remote part of the country could transact on their phones and their transactions would sync back up once they got online again.</p>
<p>And importantly, the DCEP is also designed to be a legal tender again, just like a cash, meaning that, legally speaking, everybody taking digital payments into the country would have to accept it as a payment method. Once it rolls out a policy. There is no doubt specifically aimed at breaking up the quasi monopolies and which they have built over the years. And DCP intends to be just as convenient to the end user as existing mobile wallets as well. So users could get a mobile wallet from a number of approved financial institutions like banks.</p>
<p>They would sign up for an account with a phone number and then they would pay by scanning QR codes via NFC, etc.. The big difference, of course, is that it’s not Alibaba or WeChat processing the day to day transactions, but the banks, many of which are state owned and all of which are closely regulated.</p>
<p>Jack Ma disappeared from public life completely for over two months. Already, it seems clear that the government prefers to deal with the traditional finance players over the tech companies. Now, these banks will then all have to periodically report all DCEP transactions back to the government, which means the government will be able to see all transactions in the system. It could trace each one back to real human existence or phone numbers are legally required to be tied to real identities in China. It could create similarly detailed profiles of its citizens based on their shopping habits that currently WeChat and Alibaba can. It could simply directly give citizens with a DCEP wallet, money, safe or tax returns or unemployment benefits or whatever.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the first pilot programs for the currency have started in the country. Citizens don’t particularly seem to care about it, since it doesn’t seem to do functionally anything new over their existing mobile wallets already. The Chinese government theoretically has plenty of unfair advantages over commercial players. While the DCEP cuts out Swift as a middleman, which is indeed important for China, it simply adds the Chinese government as an even more powerful overlord there.</p>
<p>Instead, in its current form, the DCEB is a fully centralized system. For example, the Chinese government on its own can monitor all transactions and it can basically create and destroy money across users wallets as it pleases. While this might work domestically for its own citizens and companies, but any major country would accept doing serious business over it in its current form. International payments and decentralization for now are a big question mark.</p>
<p>The Bahamas and Cambodia technically both beat China by launching their respective digital currencies called the Sand Dollar &amp; Bakong. The Cambodian currency is even block chain based unlike China. Sand dollar might just be the coolest official currency name ever.</p>
<p>The most interesting and definitely most unfortunate example of a country trying and failing to launch a state issued cryptocurrency has to be Venezuela and it is called the Petro. It was announced in 2017 as an alternative currency backed by the country’s vast oil and mineral reserves. While the country’s regular currency was going through some of the world’s worst hyperinflation, it sadly didn’t work.</p>

	 Rebuilding Respectful Relationships in the Digital Realm 
<p>by Elizabeth Renieris</p>
<p>This article was commissioned by the Me2B Alliance, originally authored in 2020.</p>

	 
 

	 
	 

 

	
	 Abstract 
<p>With our lives under lockdown as COVID-19 rages on, our reliance on digital technologies and communications tools has perhaps never been greater, leading many to speculate that the pandemic has brought the digital future forward. At the same time, the shortcomings of digital life are now more apparent than ever, giving many a newfound appreciation for the value of human connection and relational states of being. In this context, the Me2B Alliance’s efforts to recenter relationships in our digital lives takes on new meaning and urgency.</p>
<p>According to the Me2B Alliance, we have relationships with each of the product and service providers in our lives, in both the digital and physical spheres. In the digital sphere, our experience of these primary relationships is often through a digital product or service, such as a website, app, or connected device. Each of these digital relationships has at least three core dimensions—commercial, technical, and legal. They are primarily business and legal relationships mediated by a variety of hardware and software tools.</p>
<p>The technical dimension of digital relationships introduces a variety of intermediaries into our primary relationships and creates a parallel dimension of reality consisting of the data generated by transactions and interactions in the ordinary course of those relationships—a kind of “parallel dataverse.” A commercial logic of extraction further complicates matters by introducing myriad parasitic entities who feed on and extract value from this parallel dataverse, undermining and distorting our primary relationships in the process.</p>
<p>Our prevailing legal paradigm for digital interactions stems from an overly simplistic and antiquated view of the digital universe, accounting only for primary relationships, without considering the impact of an increasingly complex digital realm and growing parallel dataverse. By only accounting for one dimension of our digital lives, this legal paradigm and its associated legal ceremonies leaves us exposed and vulnerable with insufficient safeguards and protections.</p>
<p>An alternative path forward must recalibrate our relationships and interactions in light of this increasingly complex and multidimensional view of the digital ecosystem. While digital will always be different, requiring intermediaries who enable our primary relationships, the more we can translate norms and expectations from the physical world into the digital realm, the closer we get to establishing effective standards and rules for our digital interactions.</p>
<p>Our legal paradigms must also evolve to capture this new reality by introducing base-level protections through prohibitions on certain activities and practices, mandating a risk-based approach to digital products and services, reestablishing context for our digital interactions, limiting default data collection and processing to what is necessary for primary business purposes, and imposing higher standards and obligations on parties who seek to go beyond what is necessary in the context of a bonafide commercial relationship.</p>
<p>Through this new paradigm, we can more easily define rules and norms for digital interactions that map to our expectations, according to the nature of our relationship to a given product or service provider. At the same time, we can also leverage and harness technology itself in the service of, rather than for purposes of extracting value from, these primary relationships. With new legal and technological foundations in place, the hope is to rebuild our digital relationships based on an ethos of mutual respect, in line with the Alliance’s mission.</p>

	 Introduction 
<p>The Me2B Alliance (the “Alliance”) is an innovative standards development organization whose mission is to grow the availability of trustworthy technology choices in part through a certification mark (like the “Organic” food label) that helps people understand how a connected product or service is treating them and their personal information. The work of the Alliance is premised on the existence of a relationship between an individual (a “Me”) and a business providing that individual with a product or service (a “B”), known as the “Me2B Relationship.” Additionally, the Alliance has developed a series of principles (“Me2B Principles”) and ethical rules of engagement (“Me2B Rules of Engagement”) that apply in and out of Me2B Relationships (see Appendix A – Me2B Materials).</p>
<p>The Alliance is now exploring alternatives to the prevailing “notice and choice” or “notice and consent” model for Web-based user interactions, based on whether or not an individual is in a Me2B Relationship with a given service provider. This paper is the result of a series of interviews and conversations with key stakeholders in the Me2B community, including Me2B leadership, participation in a series of Policy and Legal Working Group meetings, an analysis of pre-existing Me2B materials, and relevant research and scholarship. The Alliance is encouraged to view this whitepaper as a starting point for a long-term conversation about overhauling the context for, and nature of, our Web-based interactions in a way that more closely aligns with the Me2B Principles and Me2B Rules of Engagement.</p>
<p>This paper proceeds in five parts. Part I begins by examining the Me2B Relationship in context, including in the macro-context of a phenomenon known as surveillance capitalism, which distorts and undermines the very ethos of the Me2B Relationship. Part II outlines the failures of the prevailing “notice and choice” paradigm for digital interactions, including its legal and practical defects, as well as how such defects result from a failure to account for the effects of surveillance capitalism. Part III seeks to provide an alternative path forward by mapping the expectations we have in the physical world onto the digital world, including through new legal foundations and innovative uses of technology to realign expectations and reality. Part IV examines what digital interactions might look like in this new paradigm, according to the relevant Me2B Relationship state. Finally, Part V draws some conclusions and recommends next steps for research and exploration by the Alliance.<a></a></p>
 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foundations of the Me2B Relationship 
<p>This section examines the Me2B Relationship in context by first examining the nature of digital interactions and the role of intermediaries. It also explains how the prevailing logic of surveillance capitalism creates a kind of “parallel dataverse” that distorts the nature of Me2B Relationships and undermines the interests of the individual, i.e. the “Me.”</p>
 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Multidimensional Relationship 
<p>According to the Alliance, we have two-sided or 1:1 “relationships” with each of the product and service providers in our lives, in both the physical and digital spheres. In the physical realm, these relationships have at least two core dimensions: (1) a commercial dimension, typically in the form of exchanges of mutually agreed upon value, and (2) a legal dimension, typically in the form of a contract, such as a sales receipt, membership agreement, or loyalty subscription. Additionally, where a physical or in-person interaction has a digital component, such as a digital payment method, there is a third technical dimension.</p>
<p>In the digital realm, each of our interactions and relationships has all three dimensions—commercial, technical, and legal. Commercially, there are actual and potential transactions or exchanges of value in return for products and services. Technically, these commercial transactions or exchanges are achieved via an array of hardware and software products and services. And legally, there are formalities that establish certain legal relationships between the various parties to a given digital interaction or transaction. Due to a phenomenon known as surveillance capitalism (as further outlined below), there is also a fourth hidden dimension.</p>
 1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commercial 
<p>Commercially, our relationships are created through interactions and sharing over time. In general, these relationships tend to evolve according to a lifecycle consisting of five key stages: (1) acquaintance, (2) buildup, (3) continuation, (4) deterioration, and (5) termination, per Figure 1 below. A Me2B Relationship begins with a specific ceremony, such as signing up for an account, joining a loyalty program, agreeing to a website’s terms of service, or any other process by which individual credentials are created establishing a business relationship between a “Me” and a “B.”</p>

 
 
<p>Figure 1 – Me2B Relationship Model. Source: Me2B Alliance.</p>
 
 

<p>According to the Alliance, a Me2B Relationship is characterized by the individual having agency throughout the entire relationship lifecycle, including when to start and end the relationship, as well as what data to share or keep private, among other considerations. Before a Me2B Relationship is formed, and before a business relationship requires sharing personal information or exchanging value, the individual should have a reasonable expectation of anonymity. As she approaches the start of a Me2B Relationship and gets closer to establishing that business relationship, she gradually loses anonymity, becoming more pseudonymous or identifiable to a given service provider over time.</p>
<p>Once in a Me2B Relationship with a given service provider, the individual becomes personally identifiable. Nevertheless, she should still have the choice to remain unknown or anonymous in respect of specific transactions or interactions with that provider. Upon termination of the Me2B Relationship, she should be forgotten by and return to a state of anonymity in relation to that entity. In this way, a Me2B Relationship can also be described as a state of being “recognized, remembered, and responded to” by a given entity.</p>
<p>In order to exercise this kind of agency, individuals must be able to accurately identify the counterparties to a given interaction or transaction, which entities they are in relationship with, and where they are in the relationship lifecycle in relation to each entity, and be able to adjust their expectations accordingly. Undergirding the Me2B Relationship is a “Me2B ethos” or a core belief that a respectful relationship between an individual and the technology they are using, whether a website, connected device, app, or otherwise, benefits the individual and the service provider. Unfortunately, the complexity of the digital ecosystem as it exists today undermines both individual agency and the Me2B ethos.</p>
 1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technical 
<p>While offline, in-person interactions require the physical presence or proximity of the parties, digital interactions do not. Rather, individuals (Me-s) and product or service providers (B-s) are connected by some combination of technical tools and architecture, typically provided by commercially owned and operated entities known as “technical intermediaries.” In the prevailing centralized, client-server model of the Web, these technical intermediaries include hardware and software providers that “serve” an end user or “client” with access to certain digital resources from a “B,” as requested by the end user. In this way, the digital version of a Me2B Relationship can be recharacterized as a kind of “Me—T—B” relationship.</p>

 
 
<p>Figure 2 – Technical intermediaries &amp; the “Me—T—B” relationship</p>
 
 

<p>These technical intermediaries may include Web browsers (such as Google Chrome or Apple’s Safari), app stores (such as Google Play and the App Store), identity services (such as “login with Facebook” or “login with Google”), cloud services providers (such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft’s Azure), and device manufacturers (such as Apple and Google), among others. From the perspective of a “Me” trying to do business with a “B,” we often overlook the importance of these technical intermediaries and their impact on our relationships. When interacting or transacting with a “B” through a device by digital means, we tend to view our commercial relationship with the “B” as primary and our relationships with T-s as secondary.</p>
 1.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal 
<p>Though they may feel secondary, we are in primary legal relationships with technical intermediaries who facilitate our digital Me2B Relationships. Thus, we can also classify these technical intermediaries in terms of their legal status in relation to the “Me” in a given interaction. Those in privity of contract, i.e. in a direct contractual relationship, with the “Me” are “first parties” who sit in between the primary parties to a commercial transaction or interaction, with obligations to both sides. In the current paradigm of Me2B Relationships, a “Me” has a direct contractual relationship with the “B” and a parallel contractual relationship with each first-party technical intermediary who facilitates it.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are a variety of intermediaries who are not in privity, i.e. not in a direct contractual relationship with, the “Me” in a given transaction or interaction but are in a direct contractual relationship with the “B” or a “T” involved. From the perspective of “Me,” these are “third parties” or “third-party intermediaries” and may include payment processors, data processors, and other vendors and participants in a supply chain who are acting on behalf of a “B” or a “T” in the course of their ordinary business operations. Such third parties are necessary to provide technical or commercial functionalities in support of the primary business relationships between a “B” and its customers.</p>

 
 
<p>Figure 3 – First- and third-party intermediaries</p>
 
 

<p>Oddly, there are also a number of entities who are not commercially or technically necessary for a transaction or interaction between a “Me” and a “B” but who are lurking in the ambient digital environment around their relationship. Because they exist to extract value from Me2B Relationships but lack a direct or indirect relationship to the “Me” in a given relationship, they are akin to “parasites.” That digital interactions require an array of technical and commercial intermediaries does not by itself explain the presence of these parasites. Rather, their pernicious nature is the product of a particular phenomenon known as surveillance capitalism and its resulting distortions of the digital ecosystem.</p>
 1.2 On Surveillance Capitalism 
<p>Through their devices, browsers, authentication protocols, communications tools, and other infrastructure, it is almost impossible to interact or transact by digital means without the involvement of companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft, among others. The reality is that large corporate intermediaries who provide the connective tissues of our digital relationships penetrate even the most intimate aspects of digital life.Unfortunately, many of these entities also participate in a new economic order known as “surveillance capitalism,” which “claims human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction.” This extractive logic results from, and results in, vast asymmetries of power along at least four dimensions.</p>
 1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scale 
<p>With two and three billion users worldwide, Google and Facebook, respectively, have more users than the population of the largest countries on earth, reaching more people than governments, traditional media outlets, publishers, and any other platform in history. Scale is also concentrated in the market for mobile devices and applications. Together, Apple and Google control 99% of global market share and act as gatekeepers for all apps designed for iPhone and Android devices; in effect, all devices. Similarly, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google control more than 60% of the market for cloud services. As a result, many service providers or B-s have little choice but to accept the terms set by the surveillance capitalists, often compromising their relationships with Me-s in the process by sharing their data.</p>
 1.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information 
<p>Given their size and scale, and aided by exponentially increasing computational power, the surveillance capitalists have unmatched tools to collect and harness vast hordes of data and, in turn, to derive behavioral, psychological, and other insights about people, groups, and societies at large. They track and analyze our thoughts, preferences, and behaviors, leading many to conclude that privacy is dead. Meanwhile, the inverse is true of these intermediaries. Due to opaque algorithms (the so-called “black box” phenomenon), robust intellectual property rights and trade secrets, and limited technical competence on the part of law and policymakers trying to hold them to account, we know almost nothing about how their technology operates or how our data and any insights derived therefrom are used. As a result of the steep information asymmetries, we have fully transparent people and fully opaque platforms.</p>
 1.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resources 
<p>Asymmetrical scale and knowledge are further fueled by vastly asymmetrical resources as between individuals, service providers, surveillance capitalists, and their parasites. Through legal and accounting loopholes and aggressive lobbying, surveillance capitalists largely evade regulation and taxation. Failing to account for their externalities, they undermine and rent-seek from traditional businesses, such as traditional news media and journalistic outlets, free ride on public infrastructure, and take advantage of taxpayer funded subsidies, despite being among the richest companies of all time. Worse yet, they divert limited resources that could support the development of alternative technologies to promote the interests of Me-s online, perpetuating toxic, extractive practices to maximize shareholder value instead.</p>
 1.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capacity for control 
<p>With multidimensional asymmetrical power, the surveillance capitalists have an unprecedented capacity to exert equally unprecedented behavioral control and experimentation on people, without legal limits. Through recommendation engines, hyper-personalization, psychometric profiling, behavioral advertising, micro-targeting, and other tools, they have the ability to influence and alter our preferences, our expression, and ultimately our behavior. If mutual respect is a two-way street that recognizes both parties in a relationship as equally valuable in terms of their contributions and individual agency, a relationship built on the parasitic logic of extraction and control is a fundamentally one-sided relationship in which one party is more valuable to the other for purposes of extracting value.</p>
 1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hidden Dimension 
<p>Taken together, these asymmetries distort the power dynamics between Me-s and B-s and undermine the foundation of the Me2B Relationship, an ethos of mutual respect, by introducing a fourth hidden dimension into the relationship.</p>
 1.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The “parallel dataverse” 
<p>While data is relevant to and exchanged in all interactions, non-digital information gleaned from an offline interaction tends to be ephemeral, difficult to store, transfer, and otherwise process, and of limited market or industrial value as a result. In contrast, digital data generated in online or digital interactions is often permanent, cheap and easy to store, transfer, and process, and, as a result of surveillance capitalism, fed into a highly lucrative data economy. The perverse power dynamics of surveillance capitalism distort Me2B Relationships, hosting an infinite number of parasites extracting value from them. Such parasites may include general and financial data brokers, commercial databases, fraud detection providers, ad networks and ad tech companies, credit reporting agencies, and myriad other entities motivated by their own commercial interests. Surveillance capitalism coopts digital intermediaries in service of these parasites, subverting and exploiting Me2B Relationships in the process.</p>

 
 
<p>Figure 4 – Parasites and the Me-T-n-B-n relationship</p>
 
 

<p>While the parties to an offline, in-person interaction typically share a similar perspective and ability to assess the mechanics of that interaction, as well as the information and value exchanged, the same is not true of digital interactions. If relationships form the perceptible matter in the material universe around us, data forms the imperceptible anti-matter consisting of black box algorithms, dark patterns, and other hidden processes that feed these parasites. As a result, our digital lives exist in two parallel dimensions: (1) the realm of digital relationships, including Me2B Relationships; and (2) ambient data swirling in a kind of “parallel dataverse.” We see, perceive, and participate in the former, while we tend not to see or perceive the latter, though it distorts our experience of digital relationships. Unwittingly and under the pretense and familiarity of relationships, the opaque parallel dataverse expands.</p>
 1.3.2 Time and space in the parallel dataverse 
<p>While time and space are highly correlated in physical interactions, the same is not true for digital ones. The relationship between digital time and space is distorted by the parallel dataverse. A short-lived physical interaction, such as a one-off purchase, requires showing up to a place once. A longer-lived series of physical interactions, as in the case of a regular customer, requires showing up repeatedly over time. In the digital realm, we can be in different places at the same time and persist in space over time through our data long after we stop showing up.</p>
<p>More concretely, take the example of a simple&nbsp;“Me2B Deal” or an exchange of mutually agreed upon value, such as going to a restaurant and paying $20 for a meal.&nbsp;The deal is a&nbsp;quid pro quo&nbsp;agreement that defines and bounds the scope of sharing, i.e. you give the restaurant $20 in cash and get a meal in return. The same in-person interaction with a form of digital payment may look and feel the same but significantly complicates things. For example, if you pay with a credit card instead of cash, your credit card provider now has the restaurant or merchant information, details of your order, and potentially your location data. Pay with something like Apple Pay and now your credit card provider, telecommunications operator, and smart phone vendor may all have this information too.</p>
<p>If you did this every week at the same restaurant, and became recognized, remembered, and responded to, you may expect to end up in a Me2B Relationship with the restaurant owner. However, you may not expect parasites in the parallel dataverse to compile and resell behavioral data about when you visit the restaurant, the details of your order, and where you were before and after each visit, among other insights about you. As a result of surveillance capitalism, even light-touch, short-lived interactions can form expansive and persistent data trails that extend through time and space across the parallel dataverse, the dimensions of which can be hard for individuals to grasp. This sharing is both and theoretically unbounded, violating the Me2B ethos.<a></a></p>
 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cracks in the Foundation: On “Notice and Choice” 
<p>The logic of extraction based on asymmetrical power is also antithetical to the notions of “choice” and “consent” that theoretically undergird the legal foundations of our digital relationships. The prevailing paradigm for digital interactions is “notice and choice,” also called “notice and consent.” Originating from the Fair Information Practices of the 1970s, it is predicated on the idea that users of an online service can make informed decisions about whether and how to transact or interact with a given entity or service provider on the basis of transparent disclosures about its information and privacy practices. It still forms the foundation of the Federal Trade Commission’s enforcement authority over “unfair and deceptive” trade practices, the primary enforcement tool over online activity in the U.S. This section outlines the failures of “notice and choice,” including its many legal and practical defects.</p>
 2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal Defects 
<p>As U.S. companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and others continue to dominate the global market for digital technologies, this framework has been exported to and imposed on individuals around the world, even influencing the application and interpretation of other legal frameworks. Due to the ubiquity of “notice and consent,” the two primary ceremonies we encounter in the digital realm are notices, typically in the form of a privacy policy or privacy notice, and contracts, in the form of terms and conditions or terms of service seeking our consent. We are also frequently presented with a variety of licenses. Our perception of these tools does not align with how they operate in practice.</p>
 2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices 
<p>A “notice” is a legal notification or warning delivered in a written format or as a formal announcement.Online, notices typically take the form of a website or app’s privacy notice, sometimes called a privacy policy. A notice is meant to be a transparency tool that provides clear but comprehensive disclosures on how a website or online service collects, uses, discloses, retains, and otherwise handles the information of its users. On the basis of this notice, individuals are presumed to make informed choices about whether and how to share data or otherwise engage with the service. This is the “notice” prong of the “notice and choice” model.</p>
<p>Although “notice and choice” is touted as promoting individual autonomy, and consumers tend to perceive notices as making binding promises, courts have typically regarded online privacy notices as general statements of information policy rather than as legally enforceable contracts. This is largely due to their passive presentment, often located on a separate webpage, without requiring a user to accept or even read them to proceed or use a website or service. It has also been industry practice to draft privacy policies in ways that do not constitute legally enforceable agreements.</p>
<p>It is also due to the unilateral nature of notices, which bind all users of a website or service regardless of their relationship to the site owner or service provider. In practice and at law, privacy policies or notices actually act more like property notices that proffer one-way terms and attach in rem to a service provider’s digital property, rather than in personam to an individual user. In other words, such notices act more like signage in a shopping mall.</p>
 2.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Contracts” 
<p>When we think of contracts online, we tend to think of terms and conditions or terms of service, and ceremonies like ticking a box or consenting to terms by clicking “I accept.” These actions form the “choice” prong of “notice and choice.” While property law is one-sided to favor the property owner, contract law seeks to equally protect both sides of a bargain. As such, a contractual basis for digital interactions should “facilitate certainty, predictability, and care in entering productive relationships,” providing a better foundation for Me2B Relationships built on mutual respect. But the digital ceremonies we perceive as contracts often do not hold up in theory or in practice.</p>
<p>A contract is an agreement between private parties creating mutual obligations or legally enforceable promises. The basic elements required for contract formation are mutual assent,&nbsp;expressed by a valid&nbsp;offer and acceptance, adequate&nbsp;consideration, capacity, and&nbsp;legality.&nbsp;Acceptance requires a “meeting of the minds” such that both parties to the contract understand what is being offered, i.e. that acceptance is identical to the offer. In determining whether an electronic contract has been validly formed, there must be “reasonable notice” of terms and a “manifestation of assent” by the consumer. In this way, valid contract formation in the digital realm follows the “notice and consent” approach.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, courts also tend to interpret electronic contracts as acting more like property notices that need only be reasonably displayed and can be assented to by a user through mere use of a website or service, even where they are not seen or read by the user. In this way, digital “contracts” operate more like property instruments that protect digital property owners, undermining the rationale for relying on “notice and choice.” As one scholar puts it, “the inutility of contract law for enforcing privacy policy promises calls into question the effectiveness and legitimacy of the Notice and Choice model for privacy protection.”</p>
<p>Finally, the unilateral ability of a service provider to modify the terms of an electronic contract at will, in a way that is more typical of notices, also means “the bargain itself is a moving target,” making it hard to establish a meeting of the minds at a given point in time in the relationship lifecycle. The decoupling of time and space that allows us to persist in the parallel dataverse through our data long after a transaction, interaction, or relationship ends, means that what we agree to in the moment of contract presentment and execution does not capture future uses of that data or activities with consequences on our lives. Moreover, the asymmetries of power and information that characterize our digital interactions in the surveillance capitalist paradigm further undermine any “meeting of the minds.”</p>
 2.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Licenses 
<p>Finally, we may encounter end-user license agreements (EULAs) and other licenses when we access a copy of software or download an app. A license is a grant of permission to do something otherwise prohibited by law. Its nature is ill-defined as a license can be contractual or non-contractual. Under intellectual property law, as in the case of a EULA, a license is a contract granting written permission to exploit an invention, creative work, or trademark, and must satisfy the rules for contract formation, including valid offer and acceptance. Under real property law, a license is a unilateral commitment to grant certain restricted rights to property even where a grantee is unaware of those restrictions. A contractual license requires an act by the licensee that constitutes assent to its terms, while the licensee of a non-contractual license accepts its terms through performance, such as by entering a physical place or continuing to use a website. Contractual licenses have the same legal defects as digital contracts, as outlined above.</p>
 2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practical Defects 
<p>As a light-touch, self-regulatory mechanism, the “notice and choice” model is theorized to promote individual autonomy by centering the individual’s informed consent and decisionmaking. However sound the theoretical foundations of “notice and choice,” the model has not panned out in practice.</p>
 2.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quantitative Challenges 
<p>As more of the population comes online, the volume of digital interactions increases exponentially. We send more than one hundred and fifty million emails and sixteen million text messages each minute, while Google processes nearly four billion searches per day. The frequency with which we have to accept or consent to a variety of legal terms and conditions via our digital interactions is already unmanageable. According to one study, it would take an average of seventy-six days to read the privacy policies of every website an individual encounters in one year. The more people and devices that come online and connect as we approach a world with the “Internet in everything,”the more unmanageable this will become.</p>
<p>The ubiquity of “notice and choice” has resulted in rather unpleasant user experience and user interface (UX/UI) features, including a variety of cookie pop-ups, banners, and tick boxes, among other nuisances, compounding the cognitive overload challenges. Efforts to require meaningful informed consent in Web-based interactions have actually worsened the problem. For example, UX/UI has been a key challenge in implementing Europe’s ePrivacy Directive, which outlawed passive or implied consent to cookies via banners or pre-ticked boxes and required affirmative, opt-in consent to all cookies not strictly necessary for a website’s technical operation. Where complied with, it has resulted in a proliferation of popups and notifications.</p>
<p>“Notice and choice” also does not translate well to mobile devices with smaller interfaces or to emerging and future technologies. As we move beyond the graphical user interface (GUI) to new interfaces, including voice, gesture, and gait, as well as neural or brain-machine interfaces, implementing “notice and choice” will get even trickier. Add the proliferation of smart devices, the Internet of Things, and sensor technologies, and a corresponding growth in ambient data collection, and the idea of having written terms and conditions and privacy policies to accept on a regular basis in real-time through clicks and scrolls becomes wholly untenable. The lack of future proofing also demonstrates the unsustainability of the notice and choice paradigm.</p>
 2.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualitative challenges 
<p>These quantitative challenges also result in qualitative challenges in practice. While commercial entities continue to benefit from exponential improvements in computational capacity and power, the cognitive limits of the human mind have remained relatively static or fixed. As a result, the cognitive strain of the “notice and choice” paradigm further increases the asymmetry of knowledge and capacity as between individuals and the entities seeking consent. It is difficult, if not impossible, to establish meaningful, informed consent under these circumstances, as it simply exceeds our capacity for good decisionmaking.</p>
<p>“Notice and choice” is also applied uniformly to our relationships with product and service providers, whether B-s or T-s, despite our limited choice and the toxic business models of many T-s. These large commercial entities, so pervasive that they can be nearly impossible to avoid, intermediate most of our digital interactions. As a result, “consent” for entering into “contractual” relationships with them is not freely rendered but results from limited choice, anti-competitive tactics, and impediments to interoperability and data portability. Where we cannot interact with a B without accepting the terms of surveillance capitalist T-s, consent to B’s terms is also undermined. Without voluntariness, this is “defective consent” and cannot form the basis of meaningful “choice.”</p>
<p>Finally, there are mounting qualitative challenges to the nature of “notice” itself in respect of digital technologies. Consumer-facing notices are difficult to read and understand from the perspective of legal rights and obligations, and increasingly unable to communicate the true implications of data collection or technology use. New and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural or deep neural networks feature opaque processes and lack explainability. In such cases, technologists themselves may be unable to explain how certain decisions are made or outputs are derived, let alone communicate these ideas to the general public. Where explainability impedes notice, consent sought on the basis of that notice is also undermined.</p>
 2.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Context collapse 
<p>The law is filled with ceremonial activities that have traditionally involved physical acts, such as placing one’s hand on a Bible while taking an oath of office or affixing one’s signature in ink to enter into a contract. We tend to scale the level of effort required by a ceremony to the gravity of the obligation undertaken or status conferred. For example, signing a marriage license requires the physical presence of the parties, at least two witnesses, and a state-sanctioned officiant, while executing corporate documents may require simple notarization, and accepting a delivery only a simple signature. The more cumbersome the ceremony, the more likely we are to perceive a decision as having serious consequences. As one scholar puts it, “The heft of a document tends to correspond to the onerousness of the obligations agreed to by the consumer.”</p>
<p>The digital realm collapses all of our actions and behaviors into a series of one-dimensional clicks and scrolls. As a result, it can be difficult to assess the relative heft or gravity of a decision to interact or transact with a given service provider, share or consent to certain personal uses of data, or make any variety of other decisions. While legal ceremonies are meant to help us assess the heft of a decision, the ubiquity of “notice and choice” makes nearly all digital interactions feel the same. Just as digital activities are designed to remove as much friction as possible,companies “intentionally minimize the disruptiveness of contract presentment in order to facilitate transactions and to create a smooth website experience for the consumer,” thereby reducing the signaling effect of online contracts.</p>
 2.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hidden dimension 
<p>Even if the legal and practical defects with the “notice and choice” paradigm were corrected, it would still fail to provide an effective foundation for Me2B Relationships based on an ethos of mutual respect. We have seen how a Me2B Relationship in the digital realm is rarely a two-sided, or 1:1 relationship. Rather, it is situated in the context of a complex web of relationships between individuals (Me-s), service providers (B-s), technical intermediaries (T-s), and a potentially infinite array of parasites (n-s).</p>
<p>The “notice and choice” construct is based on an overly simplistic and acontextual view of relationships that fails to account for the complex and multidimensional nature of the modern digital sphere. By only capturing direct contractual relationships, such as Me2B Relationships, the “notice and choice” paradigm misses an entire dimension of the digital realm—the toxic, extractive practices of parasites and surveillance capitalists in the parallel dataverse. Any legal foundation or ceremony that ignores this context will always be deficient to protect and promote the rights and interests of individuals in Me2B Relationships.<a></a></p>
 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rebuilding Respectful Relationships 
<p>One reason that the “notice and choice” model persists despite the mounting evidence of its deficiencies is the failure to put forward a workable alternative or to imagine an entirely new paradigm. This section seeks to provide an alternative path forward by attempting to map the expectations we have in the physical world onto the digital world through new legal foundations and innovative uses of technology to support respectful digital relationships.</p>
 3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Realigning Expectations vs. Reality 
<p>Any viable path forward must recalibrate our relationships and interactions in light of the increasingly complex and multidimensional nature of the digital ecosystem. While digital will always be different, requiring intermediaries who enable our primary relationships, the more we can realign our expectations in the physical world with our experiences in the digital realm, the closer we can get to establishing effective norms and rules for digital interactions. As a starting point, we can map our expectations in the physical realm to the digital realm, taking the analogy of a shopping mall.</p>
 3.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The physical shopping mall 
<p>When we walk through a physical shopping mall, we inhabit a space that constitutes a series of overlapping relationships and legal statuses with respect to different parties, both known and unknown to us. We can window shop and weave in and out of individual shops at will, without signing any contracts or affirmatively accepting any terms. In fact, there are few legal ceremonies in a trip to the mall, apart from the occasional receipt that needs signing. That is not to say the mall is a lawless place.</p>
<p>The mall’s entrances may display a host of written notices about a prohibition on smoking, penalties for unlawful trespassing, maximum occupancy limits, or the use of security or surveillance cameras, among other conditions of entry. By law, such notices must be clear and easily legible and they must be posted conspicuously, such as near the main entrance and exit or access doorways in a given room or space. The terms of these notices are not negotiable and we are not asked to sign a consent form; we likely do not even know the identity of the property owner who is providing such notice. Rather, by entering the mall, we are presumed to understand and accept the conditions notified.</p>
<p>While inside the mall, we are generally anonymous apart from individuals personally known to us or while in shops or spaces we regularly visit; even then, we might be recognized but not identified by name or personal credentials. Typically, we can travel through the mall as one of many faces in the crowd, in a 1:N relationship to the mall and shop owners. While we may be on notice of security staff or the use of surveillance cameras in the mall’s common areas or individual shops, we still have a reasonable expectation of privacy in fitting rooms, restrooms, medical clinics or consultation rooms, and other areas.</p>
<p>Finally, property owners have basic obligations to maintain the safety and security of their premises and are typically liable for any harm or injury suffered as a result of their negligence. Individual store owners are typically responsible for keeping their premises clean and safe for customers, while mall owners are responsible for common areas like parking lots, walkways, elevators and escalators, and ensuring the safety of visitors in these areas. Moreover, shopping malls are quasi-public spaces where individuals retain certain fundamental rights. Compare this to the experience of browsing the Web as it exists today.</p>
 3.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The virtual shopping mall 
<p>Typically, we enter into the online or digital space through a browser such as Google Chrome or Apple’s Safari. If we download a new browser, we may be asked to click a box to accept a license agreement, terms of service, and/or privacy policy. Where a browser is preinstalled or the default browser on a device, consent may be bundled into an operating system’s blanket terms or license agreement. Even if we are unaware of a browser’s terms or privacy policy, its use is deemed to be implied “consent” or acceptance of them.</p>
<p>Once “online” via the browser, we can enter and exit various web properties such as individual websites and webpages owned and operated by different product and service providers. As in the physical realm, these property owners may stipulate conditions that apply to “being on their premises,” i.e. using their website or app, via written notices. But unlike in the physical realm, the terms are presented as contracts. In fact, we are “practically unable to engage in any online activity without being forced to accept the terms of an electronic contract,” notwithstanding their deficiencies. This includes the digital equivalents of window shopping, weaving in and out of shops without making a purchase, and an array of other activities that do not require contracts in the physical world.</p>
<p>Where we expect to be an anonymous face in the crowd to a mall or shop owner, we are typically identified, known, and tracked by digital equivalents, including the browser and website operator, with no reasonable expectation of privacy, even when we are not “logged in.” We are equally exposed whether in a perceived public forum like a social media newsfeed or a presumed private setting such as talking to a therapist through a mental health app. Even when using Google’s Chrome in Incognito mode, our activity may still be visible to third parties. Our activity is tracked across sites and properties, and shared with or sold to an infinite number of other entities for their unlimited purposes.</p>
<p>Unlike in the physical realm where we have some legal precedent to protect our fundamental rights, the digital realm is largely devoid of such protections, at least in the U.S., where we lack a comprehensive federal privacy law or equivalent legal safeguards. Moreover, unlike physical property owners, app developers, website operators, and other digital service providers have virtually no obligations to undertake routine maintenance or to ensure minimum safety and security protections for their users as visitors or invitees on their properties. The deep divergence between our physical and digital realities is not a feature of technology but results from the economic logic of surveillance capitalism and defective legal foundations for the digital realm.</p>
 3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A New Legal Foundation 
<p>In order to realign our norms and expectations in the physical and digital realms, we need better legal frameworks that move away from the hyper-individualistic or atomistic approach of “notice and choice.” Each of the components listed below provides an alternative to notice and choice. Together, they could create a more robust foundation for protecting the rights and interests of individuals in the context of digital interactions, whether in a Me2B Relationship or not.</p>
 3.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prohibitions on processing 
<p>First, we must end digital exceptionalism, i.e. what is illegal offline should also be illegal online. Just as there are capacity limitations, building and fire codes, and other restrictions imposed on physical property owners, digital services providers should be subject to specific prohibitions on certain data processing activities or uses of technology, particularly where an individual cannot opt out of a generalized practice. For example, a number of cities have recently banned the use of general facial recognition technologies to collect and process the biometrics of constituents.Other proposals would impose bans or prohibitions on the use of personal data to discriminate in decisions related to housing, employment, credit, insurance, and public accommodations. In such instances, individual preferences are overridden by a collective interest in prohibiting these activities. Reestablishing meaningful Me2B Relationships in the face of pervasive surveillance capitalism may require similar prohibitions, such as outright bans on the business of data brokers, the commercial sale of personal data and behavioral insights, and cross-site tracking outside of a relationship.</p>
 3.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Risk-based frameworks 
<p>Second, just as physical shop owners owe a duty of care and must undertake regular maintenance to promote the safety and security of their customers, digital product and service providers should owe a similar duty and be subject to risk-based measures to ensure the safety and security of their customers. At present, technical intermediaries, including browsers and apps, have virtually no legal obligation to protect the rights and interests of their users. As a result, they tend to privilege the commercial interests of customers, advertisers, and other parties, over those of individuals. In some cases, their competitive interests may result in better protections. For example, Apple undertakes a minimal vetting process, and mandates certain base level privacy and security requirements, before making an app available to consumers in its App Store. While this helps shift the burden of assessing risk away from the individual and onto the app provider, who is better positioned to assess it, corporate goodwill is not a sufficient basis for a new legal paradigm.</p>
<p>This burden-shifting must be mandated by law through the imposition of risk-based frameworks. Rather than outright prohibitions, this may entail prohibiting the use of a technology or data processing activity by an entity before it has undertaken a variety of ex-ante impact assessments. In addition to traditional privacy and data protection impact assessments, these may include social, ethical, economic, civil rights, and human rights-based impact assessments. More radical proposals would require entities to demonstrate safety and efficacy, as well as freedom from bias, before going to market. The aim of such proposals is to shift the burden of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risk away from individuals and onto the asymmetrically more powerful entities creating the risk, thereby reducing the cognitive load on individuals when deciding how to interact and transact digitally.</p>
 3.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contextual integrity 
<p>In addition to prohibitions and risk-based frameworks, it is critical to reestablish context in the digital realm. One method of doing so may be by adapting the theory of privacy as contextual integrity to digital life. Contextual integrity “ties adequate protection for privacy to&nbsp;norms of specific contexts, demanding that information gathering and dissemination be&nbsp;appropriate&nbsp;to that context and obey the governing norms of&nbsp;distribution&nbsp;within it.” For example, a norm of&nbsp;appropriateness&nbsp;makes it acceptable for a doctor to inquire about a patient’s weight, but unacceptable for an employer to do so. Similarly, a norm of&nbsp;distribution makes it appropriate for a doctor to share a patient’s prescription with a pharmacist (under the condition it remains confidential), but inappropriate for the same doctor to share that information with the patient’s employer (at least not without the patient’s informed consent).</p>
<p>While we can easily identify context in the physical realm, we tend to treat the online or digital realm as a single monolithic context,&nbsp;tolerating behaviors and practices we would find objectionable offline. For example, we allow Google to read our email and Facebook to read our messages even though we would likely object to a neighbor reading our snail mail or a spouse reading our texts. Moreover, we use the same legal ceremonies and the same deficient “notice and choice” paradigm in wildly different contexts, whether a medical chat bot or Facebook’s newsfeed. With the reduced signaling effect of legal ceremonies in the digital realm, context is ever harder to establish. In the face of this context collapse, establishing norms of appropriateness and distribution requires reestablishing context in digital interactions, including by determining relationship states relative to specific entities.</p>
 3.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Necessity” and minimization 
<p>With contextual integrity restored in the digital realm, we could limit data collection and processing to what is necessary in a given context. Rather than requiring individuals to “consent” to each individual instance of data collection or use, limiting data collection and processing to what is necessary for a given transaction or interaction by default would help reduce cognitive strain and realign expectations with reality. It could also limit the distortions caused by an unbounded parallel dataverse and behavioral “surplus” that feeds parasitic actors in the surveillance capitalist paradigm. Much of this surplus results from the widespread reliance on “notice and choice” and consent-based frameworks that fail to account for data processing outside of primary commercial relationships.</p>
<p>Necessity is not new. European data protection law, which requires data minimization, allows for processing personal data where necessary for the “performance of a contract” or prior to entering into a contract and for “legitimate interests” pursued by a controller or third party. In the U.S., the draft Data Accountability and Transparency Act of 2020 would go further to prohibit an entity from collecting, using, sharing, or otherwise processing any personal data unless it can demonstrate it is “strictly necessary to carry out a permissible purpose.” Permissible purposes include providing a good, service, or specific feature requested by an individual in an intentional interaction, and non-targeted advertising. As with contextual integrity, limiting collection by default may require overhauling technical infrastructure and the difficult task of establishing norms about what is “permissible” or “necessary.”</p>
 3.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiduciary duties 
<p>Finally, where it may be desirable to share personal data beyond what is strictly necessary for a given transaction or interaction, such as to save payment information or remember personal preferences, or for any other purposes that would serve the individual’s interests while respecting her preferences, an obligation must attach to that sharing. The Alliance describes this principle as “no data about me without an obligation.” Such obligation may take the form of legally mandated fiduciary duties imposed on parties seeking to collect or use personal data. For example, a leading proposal would treat existing online providers as “information fiduciaries” legally bound by general fiduciary duties.</p>
<p>The most common fiduciary obligation is the duty of care, often expressed in data security terms, requiring enterprises to take reasonable or prudent care in securing personal data and to avoid deliberately causing harm. A higher duty of loyalty may require entities to avoid conflicting duties (the “thin” version) or to act in an individual user’s best interests (the “thick” version). For example, the duty of loyalty may require preventing uses of data that would harm or offend a reasonable user. Finally, a duty of confidentiality would require enterprises to bind data processors and sub-processors to the same duty of confidentiality as binds them in performing their obligations for that enterprise.</p>
<p>Fiduciary-style obligations and duties are typically grounded in asymmetrical personal relationships such as between doctors and patients or attorneys and clients. Applying them to the digital realm requires identifying appropriate relationships to which they might attach. Moreover, as such obligations only make sense in the context of primary relationships, they could not, standing alone, provide a sufficient legal foundation to remedy the nefarious effects of the parallel dataverse and logic of surveillance capitalism on Me2B Relationships. Rather, they must be layered on top of these other foundational building blocks as laid out above.</p>
 3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technical Scaffolding 
<p>Without a new legal paradigm, technology can do little to restore respectful digital relationships in the face of powerful commercial incentives. Even with such a foundation in place, there will still be too many interactions and touchpoints to effectively scale our cognitive capacity and human agency in the digital realm. Without scaling, we cannot address the steep power asymmetries at play as between individuals and entities in the digital sphere. By helping scale the individual’s ability to express and promote her interests and preferences in the digital realm, technology can act as a kind of scaffolding to support and uphold the new rules in practice, thereby restoring mutuality to Me2B Relationships.</p>
 3.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The browser as “digital proxy” 
<p>Until we can physically inhabit a digital space, we will require some kind of technical infrastructure to act as our “digital proxy.” Right now, we show up through a combination of technical intermediaries who have competing interests, none of which uniquely represents our own. In other words, we lack an effective digital proxy. As such, many proposals for fixing the Web call for new intermediaries, such as digital avatars, personal artificial intelligence, and virtual assistants. The idea is that these tools could help individuals scale their knowledge, capacity, and resources to lessen the asymmetrical power dynamics that exist in the digital realm and approximate the dynamics of offline, in-person interactions. But why not begin by leveraging existing intermediaries in service of the new paradigm?</p>
<p>The browser is in a unique position to support this paradigm by helping to realign our experiences in the digital realm with our expectations in the physical one. In order to act as our digital proxy, we must be known to the browser by establishing credentials and setting out our preferences. This means, we must enter into a genuine Me2B Relationship with the browser by executing a valid legal contract and providing meaningful, informed consent to its terms of service and privacy policies. Under this validly formed contract, the browser could not make any material changes to the contract unilaterally and any violations would be enforceable at law, unlike under the current paradigm.</p>
<p>To act as our digital proxy, the browser must be bound by a thick duty of loyalty mandated by law, not commercial preference. This duty would require it to promote and privilege our individual interests above the interests of all other parties or stakeholders in a given interaction or transaction. The browser would also have heightened obligations to store, communicate, and manage our individual preferences vis-à-vis other web properties, including preferences such as “do-not-track” or “do-not-sell-my-data” requests under laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Finally, the browser must be held to a duty of confidentiality with respect to our browsing activity and search history.</p>
<p>The browser could also help streamline legal ceremonies in the digital realm. Acting as our digital proxy to enforce our preferences, the browser could scan and read the many property-style notices we encounter. Rather than forcing us into defective contracts with each product or service or digital property we explore, it could undertake an initial screening process to eliminate any providers whose terms do not align with our values or meet our preferences. After this initial gating, we could decide whether to enter into a Me2B Relationship with a relevant service provider for purposes of completing a transaction or interaction through a validly formed contract. Reducing the number of contracts should also reduce the cognitive strain and help restore the signaling effect of digital legal ceremonies.</p>
<p>Going back to the shopping mall analogy, the browser would enter digital space as we would physical space, carrying our own preferences and inclinations forward into the digital realm. Through the browser as our digital proxy, we could visit websites, webpages, and other digital properties anonymously. This would require a technical means by which to obscure our identity vis-à-vis our digital proxy. We could then explore or weave in and out of these properties, as we can in the physical world, without establishing a commercial relationship or entering into a defective contract. Finally, the browser could help further reestablish context by locating us in digital time and in space, to give us a fuller picture of the various stakeholders involved in a given interaction or transaction as well as its potential data footprint.<a></a></p>
 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me2B Relationships in the New Paradigm 
<p>Having outlined a vision for a new legal foundation, supplemented by new applications of technology, this section examines what digital interactions might look like in this new paradigm, according to relationship state.</p>
 4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respectful Defaults 
<p>With general prohibitions in place to outlaw toxic and pernicious behaviors that are impossible to opt out of at an individual level and the imposition of mandatory risk-based frameworks to assess the safety and security of digital products and services before they hit the market, our digital interactions would be inherently more protective of our interests. As a matter of principle, ending digital exceptionalism by prohibiting online what is illegal offline offers a good starting point. Working to articulate the acceptable bounds of our digital interactions, achieving consensus on specific behaviors and practices that should be outlawed, and determining the necessary risk-based assessments that must be undertaken by a product or service provider, are also key steps. Once in place, all digital interactions would benefit from more respectful defaults and baseline protections, whether in the context of a Me2B Relationship or not.</p>
 4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relationship States 
 4.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The no Me2B relationship state 
<p>The “No Me2B Relationship State” can exist: (1) before an individual has entered into a Me2B Relationship and established unique credentials with a given product or service provider; (2) after the individual’s credentials have been destroyed upon termination of a Me2B Relationship with a given product or service provider; or (3) when an individual has an existing Me2B Relationship and unique credentials with a given product or service provider but chooses to participate in a specific transaction or interaction anonymously without presenting those credentials, rather than through the relationship. For example, a retail customer of Target.com who has a customer account with Target may nevertheless decide to checkout in “guest mode.” In the new paradigm, the browser acting as our digital proxy could “know” our relationship state in relation to each digital product or service provider we encounter online.</p>
<p>In the No Me2B Relationship State, having no unique business relationship with an entity, an individual has no need to establish unique credentials with it. Rather, the individual will be able to interact with that entity’s digital properties as an anonymous face in the crowd, in a 1:N property-based relationship, just as she would in relation to shops in a physical mall. The browser would provide a technical means by which to obscure our identity vis-à-vis the service provider. Unlike in the current “notice and choice” paradigm, defective contractual instruments in the form of terms and conditions or terms of service would be unnecessary in the No Me2B Relationship State under the new paradigm. Instead, the default legal ceremony would be a property-style notice not requiring any affirmative act from the individual. In the new paradigm, contracts become the exception rather than the norm, helping restore their signaling effect.</p>
<p>Before entering into the Me2B Relationship State with a given entity, the browser as our digital proxy would have scanned and pre-screened that entity’s terms and conditions, privacy policies, and any other relevant notices for compliance with our indicated values, preferences, and requirements. We could then enter the service provider’s digital space with awareness and acceptance of these conditions. Should the browser detect any unreasonable notices that violate our values or preferences, it could provide a notification or alert recommending “exit” or “caution.”&nbsp; Even while in a digital space in a No Me2B Relationship State, the service provider would still owe us a duty of care, having to take reasonable or prudent steps to secure any data or insights gleaned, ensure minimum safety standards, and avoid deliberately causing us harm.</p>
 4.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Me2B relationship state 
<p>Should we want to establish a business relationship with an entity to be “recognized, remembered, and responded to,” we would enter into a Me2B Relationship by creating an account, signing up for a membership or loyalty scheme, or by otherwise establishing unique credentials with the entity, with the help of the browser as our digital proxy. This would be achieved through a validly formed electronic contract requiring an affirmative act on our part, and may also be supplemented by means of “whitelisting” or other technical mechanisms implemented by the browser. Once in this Me2B Relationship, the service provider could not unilaterally change the terms of such contract without jeopardizing the relationship or risking legal liability. We could now participate in specific transactions or interactions in a “Me2B Relationship State.”</p>
<p>While in a Me2B Relationship State, we would remain identified, share personal information, and participate in exchanges of mutually agreed upon value through our browser as our digital proxy. The website owner or operator would owe us more than a mere duty of care as in the No Me2B Relationship State. Rather, when transacting or interacting with an entity in this Me2B Relationship State, the entity would also be legally bound by duties of loyalty and confidentiality. Even with these heightened duties owed, the browser could help provide additional context for specific interactions or transactions by giving us a fuller picture of the various stakeholders involved and even its potential footprint in the parallel dataverse. We could then elect to participate in either relationship state.</p>
<p>The browser could provide this ability to transition between relationship states, affording us the same agency in digital spaces as we have in physical ones, carrying our own preferences and inclinations forward into the digital realm. In this way, the browser would no longer be a mere technical intermediary or T. Rather, it would be transformed into an approximation of the “Me” in a Me2B Relationship. With the browser acting as “Me’s” genuine digital proxy and obligated to promote Me’s interests in all digital interactions, what were previously Me—T—B style relationships become much more like direct Me2B Relationships again. In this way, the new paradigm helps to restore the mutuality of Me2B Relationships to approximate relationships in the physical realm.<a></a></p>
 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusions 
<p>Based on the above analysis, we can draw a number of preliminary conclusions. First, Me2B Relationships in the digital realm are multidimensional relationships with commercial, legal, and technical dimensions. Through this technical dimension, data generated in the ordinary course of our Me2B Relationships creates a fourth hidden dimension—a&nbsp; kind of “parallel dataverse” that is largely invisible to us as individuals. This hidden dimension has significant consequences for Me2B Relationships despite exceeding our cognitive capacity to appreciate them.</p>
<p>Second, as a result of surveillance capitalism, myriad parasitic entities feed off of this parallel dataverse in ways that exploit and undermine our primary Me2B Relationships. Thus, a given Me2B Relationship cannot be assessed in isolation from the complex and overlapping relationships between various parties directly and indirectly involved in a given digital interaction or transaction, including individuals (Me-s), product and service providers (B-s), technical intermediaries (T-s), and parasites (n-s).</p>
<p>Third, our prevailing legal paradigm for digital interactions, in the form of “notice and choice,” stems from an overly simplistic and antiquated view of the digital universe formed in the 1970s. It is comprised of defective legal ceremonies and also suffers from a growing number of practical defects. Moreover, it only accounts for primary relationships, failing to consider the impact of an increasingly complex digital realm running on the logic of surveillance capitalism. By only accounting for one dimension of our digital lives, this legal paradigm and its associated legal ceremonies leaves us exposed and vulnerable with insufficient safeguards and protections.</p>
<p>Fourth, any viable path forward must acknowledge this complexity and provide a strong underlying foundational framework to situate Me2B Relationships in this broader context and help realign our expectations in the digital world with our experiences in the physical realm. This realignment can help guide the development of effective norms and rules for our digital interactions regardless of relationship state.</p>
<p>Fifth, a robust new legal foundation must prohibit certain activities and practices, mandate a risk-based approach to commercializing digital products and services, reestablish context for digital interactions, limit default data collection and processing to what is necessary for primary business purposes, and impose higher standards and obligations on parties who seek to go beyond what is necessary in the context of a bonafide commercial relationship.</p>
<p>Finally, existing and emerging technologies could help play an important role to support and help enforce this new legal paradigm in practice, starting with the browser as our “digital proxy.” Through legal mandates requiring technological tools like the browser to act in service of, rather than for purposes of extracting value from, our Me2B Relationships, we can help rebuild respectful relationships in the digital realm based on an ethos of mutual respect.</p>

	<p>The concept of better privacy practices is not new – we’ve been talking about it since the birth of the internet. But what exactly does “better privacy” mean, and how do we get there?</p>
<p>Policymakers have been working on legislation oriented around privacy for some time. While there have been some steps in the right direction, significant change won’t happen until we broaden the lens. What most people want but don’t have the terms to describe is respectful digital relationships. In the same way there is an unspoken code for respectful behavior in physical-realm relationships, this same type of behavior is just as essential when engaging with an online service or website.</p>
<p>Today, MIT Computational Law Report published a framework for policymakers to understand and advocate for more respectful digital relationships based on the <a href="https://me2ba.org/about/principles/">Me2B Alliance vision</a>.</p>
<p>The article, “<a href="https://law.mit.edu/pub/rebuildingrespectfulrelationships/release/4">Rebuilding Respectful Relationships in the Digital Realm</a>,” penned by Elizabeth Renieris, an internationally recognized expert in law, policy and digital privacy, describes the Me2B Alliance’s approach to digital engagement with a focus on the legal and technological foundations necessary to rebuild digital relationships based on an ethos of mutual respect.</p>
<p>Renieris’ paper proceeds in five parts:</p>
<p>1. Digital relationships today and surveillance capitalism. Examines the Me2B Relationship in context, including in the macro-context of a phenomenon known as surveillance capitalism, which distorts and undermines the very ethos of the Me2B Relationship.</p>
<p>2. Today’s failed opt-out paradigm. Outlines the failures of the prevailing “notice and choice” paradigm for digital interactions, including its legal and practical defects, as well as how such defects result from a failure to account for the effects of surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p>3. An alternative path forward. Maps the expectations we have in the physical world onto the digital world, including through new legal foundations and innovative uses of technology to realign expectations and reality.</p>
<p>4. Digital interactions in this new paradigm. Defines interactions according to the relevant Me2B Relationship state.</p>
<p>5. Conclusions and recommends. Identifies next steps for research and exploration by the Alliance.</p>
<p>Policymakers take note: this is where privacy legislation needs to go in order to turn these small steps into leaps in the right direction. The vocabulary and concepts defined in this paper will help to define what is much more complex than “privacy” alone. We urge policymakers to internalize these concepts and start infusing respect into privacy-related legislation.</p>

				 <p>Over the past years, the question of how we can protect our identity in the world of online has been getting more heated. The Self-Sovereign Identity paradigm stepped in with the idea itself, that everyone should be in charge of their own digital personal information, and that it is the data owner who should decide on how this data is being used and by whom.</p>
<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) promises to empower European citizens with new means to manage privacy, to eliminate logins, and to enjoy much faster and safer electronic transactions via the internet as well as in real life.</p>
<p>Strengthening internet trustworthiness with electronic identities is also the aim of eSSIF-Lab, which has just launched its Second Business-oriented Open Call on 7 May 2021.</p>
<p></p> 
			   
				
				
				  2nd Business-oriented Open Call 
<p>This call is open&nbsp;for proposals to develop and demonstrate SSI working solutions for a real-world, domain-oriented problem or opportunity, in prioritized eSSIF-Lab areas (Health Tech, e-Government and Education), or in the Open Disruptive Innovation track (which is covering innovative bottom-up projects out of these verticals).</p>
<p>Proposed solutions must be commercial, competitive and sector-specific SSI applications for products and services.

<p>This month I’d like to focus on an important announcement regarding New Zealand’s Digital Identity Trust Framework that the Minister David Clark, who is both the Minister for Commerce and Consumer Affairs as well as Digital Economy and Communications, made at the last DINZ event held in Wellington.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Firstly, Minister Clark, who also chairs the the new Digital Ministers’ Group, talked to us about the Digital Strategy for Aotearoa and it’s three pillars:Mahi tika (trust)Mahi tahi (inclusion)Mahi ake (growth).Mahi Tika is viewed as being critical for government and businesses as we build confidence in new processes and technology. With Mahi Tahi there is a need to make sure we bring everyone along on this digital journey. And Mahi Ake is about ensuring that New Zealand is well positioned to reap the rewards of being a digital nation and securing a bigger piece of the global pie.</p>



<p>Minister Clark&nbsp; went on to talk about the Government’s work on digital identity and he articulated how it is a crucial enabler to these three strategic pillars. He then announced that the Government has approved proposals to establish a Digital Identity Trust Framework in law.</p>



<p>He stated that the Government is committed to enhancing trust and confidence in how organisations handle personal and business identity information, that the legislation will ensure that everyone is clear on their rights and obligations and that the framework will give the tech sector a solid reference for how they can innovate and grow.</p>



<p>He also made it clear that there is a commitment to ensuring that the digital identity system reflects Māori perspectives, and that officials are engaging extensively with iwi to deliver this framework in a way that supports tikanga Māori.</p>



<p>He concluded by stating that a trusted modern digital identity system will help grow our digital economy, transform government services and ensure all New Zealanders can take part in the digital world. Here’s some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reseller.co.nz/article/688093/govt-ploughs-ahead-digital-identity-trust-framework-legislation/">press coverage</a>&nbsp;on Minister Clark’s announcement.</p>



<p>The announcement was followed by a lively Q&amp;A session during which Ann-Marie Cavanagh who has dual hats as Deputy Chief Executive Digital Public Service, and Deputy Government Chief Digital Officer, and Alan Bell, the Executive Director, Digital Identity took a range of questions from the floor.</p>



<p>For me there were a few key takeaways:&nbsp;The government seems to be taking development of the digital sector seriously as a key element in making New Zealand a more secure and prosperous place.&nbsp;There is an emerging strategy to assist and hopefully accelerate that developmentDigital identity is a central component of both the government’s digital strategy and in the development of our digital sector overall.&nbsp;DINZ and its members can play a pivotal role in achieving these goalsThere’s a shed load of work to do to get there!We had hoped to repeat the event on 5th of May in Auckland, but for a number of reasons that is now happening on 3rd June. Whilst there is quite a gap between the two events, both Ann-Marie Cavanagh and Alan Bell will be at the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/new-zealands-digital-identity-trust-framework-department-of-internal-affairs/">Auckland event</a>&nbsp;and this presents an awesome opportunity for those working in the digital identity space to spend some time with a couple of people who will be central to the role government plays in this space. We look forward to seeing many of you there,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/new-zealands-digital-identity-trust-framework-department-of-internal-affairs/">ensure you register</a>&nbsp;to secure your place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>



<p>Michael Murphy<br>Executive Director</p>

<p><a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>, the decentralized network for data stream processing, and <a href="https://idx.xyz/">IDX</a>, Web3's first cross-chain identity model, are now integrated with Avalanche. Starting today, developers and users have a new, powerful way to manage identities and dynamic off-chain data in their applications.<a href="https://ceramic.network"></a></p><p>Ceramic provides developers with database-like functionality for storing all kinds of dynamic, mutable content. This finally gives developers a Web3 native way to add critical features like rich identities (profiles, reputation, social graphs), user-generated content (posts, interactions), dynamic application-data, and much more. </p><p>Developers building applications on Avalanche can easily add support for Ceramic and IDX in their application with a seamless user experience. Avalanche key pairs have been added as a supported signing and<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/#currently-supported-blockchains"> authentication method</a> for Ceramic's data streams, so users can now perform transactions on Ceramic with their existing Avalanche wallets.</p> Blockchain, Data &amp; Identity: a full stack for Web3 developers <p>Avalanche offers developers the most scalable infrastructure for building decentralized apps and services. It is the first decentralized smart contracts platform built for the scale of global finance, with near-instant transaction finality. Ethereum developers can quickly build on Avalanche as Solidity works out-of-the-box.</p><p>Great Web3 and DeFi apps require more than a smart contract platform, however. They also need sophisticated, scalable and dependable data management infrastructure.</p><p>Ceramic provides advanced database-like features such as mutability, version control, access control, and programmable logic. Now that Avalanche and Ceramic can easily be used together, developers can:</p>  Build data-rich user experiences and social features on fully decentralized tech  Give users cloud-like backup, sync and recovery without running a centralized server  Publish content on the open web without the need to anchor IPFS hashes on-chain  Leverage interoperable profiles, social graphs and reputations across the Web3 ecosystem  <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/">Ceramic's unique stream-based architecture</a> is designed for web-scale volume and latency and to handle any type of data model. Built on top of open standards including IPFS, libp2p, and DIDs and compatible with any raw storage protocol like Filecoin or Arweave, all information stored on Ceramic exists within a permissionless cross-chain network that lets developers tap into an ever growing library of identities and data while using their preferred stack.</p> IDX: Cross-chain identity and user-centric data <p>Identity is the first use case enabled by Ceramic's building blocks for open source information.<a href="http://idx.xyz"> IDX (identity index)</a> is a cross-chain identity protocol that inherits Ceramic's properties to provide developers with a user-centric replacement for server-siloed user tables. By making it easy to structure and associate data to user's personal index, IDX lets applications save, discover and route to users' data.</p><p>The IDX SDK makes it simple to manage users and deliver great data-driven experiences using the same keys and wallets as developers and users are already relying on. Users can also link multiple keys, from any wallet and multiple blockchains, to the same identity. This is essential to developers who want to serve users over time, as it enables key rotation, data interoperability across accounts, and rich cross-chain profiles, reputations and experiences (including 50,000+ profiles on Ethereum today).</p> Getting started with Ceramic on Avalanche   To install Avalanche, follow this quickstart guide for <a href="https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/nodes-and-staking/run-avalanche-node">running an avalanche node</a>  To add IDX to your project, follow this<a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>  To use Ceramic for streams without IDX, follow this<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>  Regardless of which option you choose, you should also select 3ID Connect as your DID wallet during the<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/"> authentication</a> process which handles the integration with Avalanche wallets  For questions or support, join the<a href="https://chat.ceramic.network"> Ceramic Discord</a> and the Avalanche discord    About Avalanche <p>Avalanche is an open-source platform for launching decentralized applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem.

<p>So, what do Blockchain Commons’ technologies do? We’ve just released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">a Technology Overview video</a> that discuses the concepts and foundations underlying our work and also highlights many of our most important technological releases.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY"></a></p>

<p>As the video notes, our work is built on a considerable volume of existing literature. We work with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m56s">entropy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m39s">seeds</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m45s">keys</a> and use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=6m34s">airgaps</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=5m12s">multisigs</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m6s">secure storage</a> to ensure robust key creation, safe key usage, and responsible key management. We also build on crucial technological foundations such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m13s">CBOR</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m37s">CRC-32</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=14m53s">Fountain Codes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=8m15s">QRs</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=12m55s">SHA-256</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=13m36s">Shamir’s Secret Sharing</a>.</p>

<p>This results in a number of core Blockchain Commons technologies:
</p>
 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=16m21s">Bytewords</a> are a text-encoding method for binary data. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=19m58s">Uniform Resources</a> support self-describing data that can be used interoperably. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=24m55s">LifeHash</a> allows for graphical recognition of seeds, keys, and other data. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=26m52s">SSKR</a> provides new libraries and methodologies for sharding secrets. 
   The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=28m46s">Torgap</a> architecture creates security by partitioning blockchain services. 
 

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">Technology Overview video</a> discusses all of this and more.</p>

<p>We are also continuing to produce documents of use for the entire blockchain community, with our newest tutorials offering more depth on how to use the technologies highlighted in this video. That begins with some just-published developer-focused documents that expand on the overview of Uniform Resources (URs) found in the video. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources: An Overview</a> explains how URs are put together, and then <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-2-keys.md">A Guide to Using URs for Key Material</a> looks at <code>ur:crypto-seed</code>, <code>ur:crypto-bip39</code>, and <code>ur:crypto-hdkey</code> as three different ways to transmit key material in a standardized, typed format. (We have more UR docs planned on SSKRs, PSBTs, and our new request and response system.)</p>

<p>The specifications, architectures, references, and documents that we’re creating at Blockchain Commons are all meant to improve interoperability among many different vendors, to support the creation of wallets (and future cryptography applications) that enable independence, security, and resilience for their users. We’ve been working with an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">Airgapped Wallet Community</a> to create these various technologies. If you’re designing blockchain applications of your own, we hope you’ll view the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">video</a> to see how some of our technologies can help you.</p>

<p>You can also support the continued development of technologies like these, meant to support the entire community by becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor at GitHub</a> or by making a one-time donation <a href="https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/">at our BTCPay</a>.</p>

<p>Federal agencies should choose FIDO as they seek to comply with the new Executive Order that requires the implementation of multi-factor authentication within the next 180 days.</p>



<p>By: Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and Chief Marketing Officer, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>In the face of recent attacks that have exposed areas of weakness in critical U.S. infrastructure assets, President Biden signed a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order Wednesday to help bolster the nation’s cybersecurity</a>.</p>



<p>There have been a number of high profile attacks against critical American infrastructure in recent months, including the Solarwinds supply chain attack that exposed much of the government to potential risk. Top of mind in recent days is the ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline, which significantly impacted the flow of refined oil across America. These attacks expose the vulnerability of critical infrastructure in the United States, and the Biden Administration is issuing federal directives that will minimize or eliminate risk.</p>



<p>A key part of the Executive Order is a requirement that agencies adopt multi-factor authentication (MFA) and encryption for data at rest and in transit to the maximum extent possible. Federal Civilian Branch Agencies will have 180 days to comply with the Executive Order and will need to report on progress every 60 days until adoption is complete. If for some reason agencies cannot fully adopt MFA and encryption within 180 days, they must report to Secretary of Homeland Security through the Director of CISA, the Director of OMB, and the APNSA with a rationale for not meeting the deadline.</p>



<p>At the FIDO Alliance, we welcome today’s directive from the Biden Administration and applaud its focus on the importance of multi-factor authentication. What’s notable about this Executive Order is that the White House is prioritizing MFA everywhere, rather than limiting MFA to the PIV/PKI platform that agencies have depended on for more than 15 years. Today’s Executive Order marks an important step forward, in that it makes clear the priority is protecting every account with MFA — without mandating any specific technology. This is a notable shift, because we know that the weakest forms of MFA can still stop some attacks where passwords are the attack vector. We also know that FIDO Authentication is the only standards-based alternative to PIV for those applications that need protection against phishing attacks. This Executive Order opens the door for agencies to deploy FIDO Authentication — something we’ve heard they’ve wanted to do but have held back as use of any non-PIV authentication has not been permitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time the U.S Government has advocated for the use of MFA and strong encryption. In an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Insights_Actions_to_Counter_Email-Based_Attacks_on_Election-Related_S508C.pdf">advisory</a> issued by CISA in September 2020 on election security, the government agency noted that the majority of cyber-espionage incidents are enabled by phishing, and FIDO security keys are the only form of MFA that offer protection from phishing attacks 100% of the time.</p>



<p>In fact, the U.S. Government hasn’t just been advocating for the use of strong authentication with FIDO, it has actually already been implementing it since at least 2018 on the <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> portal. With <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> the U.S. Government is already offering a secure approach to help citizens and agencies to securely access Federal resources. In June 2019, the FIDO Alliance hosted a <a href="http://www.apple.com">webinar</a> detailing the deployment case study for login.gov, which is now even more timely with the need for agencies to adopt strong authentication in the next 180 days.</p>



<p>Since its inception, the FIDO Alliance has been bringing industry partners together, including every major operating system vendor as well as technology and consumer service providers across all industry verticals including financial services, ecommerce and government. All those diverse groups have been working together in common purpose to standardize strong authentication. Billions of devices around the world today can support FIDO Authentication and are ready to play their part in ensuring a strong authentication future. The fact that most major cloud providers, device manufacturers and browser vendors all ship with support for FIDO means that agencies can easily leverage MFA that is built in, rather than other products that need to be “bolted on.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If there is one thing that the recent spate of attacks has served to once again remind us, it’s that the private sector and public sector need strong security measures to protect critical infrastructure — and the FIDO Alliance believes this begins with authentication.</p>



<p>We urge government agencies to adopt only the strongest forms of MFA when complying with this directive. The FIDO Alliance and its members stand ready to serve and help agencies with the education, resources and tools to implement strong authentication to help reduce risk and improve the cybersecurity posture of the U.S. Government.</p>

 Announcing preview availability of <a href="https://validator.schema.org">validator.schema.org</a> for review and feedback.<br>  <br>  As <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schemaorg/2020Dec/0002.html">agreed</a> <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/12/structured-data-testing-tool-update">last year</a>, Schema.org is the new home for the structured data validator previously known as the Structured Data Testing Tool (SDTT). It is now simpler to use, and available for testing. Schema.org will integrate feedback into its <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/blob/main/docs/validator.md">draft</a> documentation and add it more explicitly to the Schema.org website for the next official release.  <br>  SDTT is a tool from Google which began life as the&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2010/09/rich-snippets-testing-tool-improvements">Rich Snippets Testing Tool </a>back in 2010. Last year Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/07/rich-results-test-out-of-beta">announced plans</a> to migrate from SDTT to successor tooling, the <a href="https://search.google.com/test/rich-results">Rich Results Test</a>, alongside plans to "deprecate the Structured Data Testing Tool". The newer Google tooling is focused on helping publishers who are targeting specific schema.org-powered <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery">searc</a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">h features</a> offered by Google, and for these purposes is a huge improvement as it contextualizes many warnings and errors to a specific target application. <br>  However, many publishers had also appreciated SDTT as a powerful and general purpose structured data validator. Headlines such as "<a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-deprecate-the-structured-data-testing-tool-29737.html">Google Structured Data Testing Tool Going Away; SEOs Are Not Happy</a>" captured something of the mood.  <br>  Schema.org started out written only in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)">Microdata</a>, before embracing&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.schema.org/2011/11/using-rdfa-11-lite-with-schemaorg.html">RDFa 1.1 Lite</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2013/06/schemaorg-and-json-ld.html">JSON-LD 1.0</a>. There are now huge amounts of Schema.org data in all of these formats and more (see&nbsp;<a href="http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/#results-2020-1">webdatacommons</a>&nbsp;report). Schema.org endorsed these multiple encodings, because they can each meet different needs and constraints experienced by publishers. The new validator will check all of these formats.  <br>   Amongst all this complexity, it is important to remind ourselves of the importance of simplicity and usability of Schema.org markup for its founding purpose: machine-readable summaries of ordinary web page content. Markup that - when well-formed - helps real people find jobs, educational opportunities, images they can <a href="https://iptc.org/news/schema-org-update-for-better-mapping-to-iptc-photo-metadata/">re-use</a>, learn from fact checkers or find a recipe to cook for dinner.  <br>  This is the focus of the new Schema Markup Validator (SMV). It is simpler than its predecessor SDTT because it is dedicated to checking that you're using JSON-LD, RDFa and Microdata in widely understood ways, and to warning you if you are using Schema.org types and properties in unusual combinations. It does not try to check your content against the information needs of specific services, tools or products (a topic deserving its own blog post). But it will help you understand whether or not your data expresses what you hope it expresses, and to reflect the essence of your structured data back in an intuitive way that reflects its underlying meaning.   <br>  The <a href="http://validator.schema.org">validator.schema.org</a>&nbsp;service&nbsp;is powered by Google's general infrastructure for working with structured data, and is provided to the Schema.org project as a Google-hosted tool. We are also happy to note that many other schema.org-oriented validators are available, both commercial (e.g. <a href="https://yandex.com/support/webmaster/yandex-indexing/validator.html">Yandex's</a>) and opensource. For example, the <a href="http://linter.structured-data.org/">Structured Data Linter,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://json-ld.org/playground/">JSON-LD Playground</a>, <a href="https://github.com/semantifyit/sdo-check/">SDO-Check</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/schemarama/">Schemarama</a>&nbsp;tools. We hope that the new Schema Markup Validator will stimulate collaboration among tool makers to improve consistency and developer experience for all those working on systems that consume Schema.org data.&nbsp;  <br>  Please share any feedback with the Schema.org community via <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2790">Github</a>, Twitter (#schemasmv), or the Schema.org W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">community group</a>.

 A Deep Dive into Five&nbsp;Laws <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/44595d5b-5150-4b26-9c39-be4361d73c7a">Photo</a> by: Mike Licht. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;atype=rich">CC BY&nbsp;2.0</a><p>In March 2021 Russia used the latest in a series of newly passed Internet laws for the <a href="https://rkn.gov.ru/news/rsoc/news73464.htm">first time</a>. The ‘sovereign’ 2019 law was used to throttle Twitter’s speed by 50% on desktops and by 100% on mobile phones. This move was triggered by Twitter’s <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/03/10/russia-slows-twitter-over-failure-to-remove-content-they-say-is-illegal">non-action</a> in deleting content considered illegal by the Roskomnadzor (RKN), Russia’s federal authority overseeing online and media content. This illegal content included the Twitter accounts of several government critics, such as Mihkail Khodorkovsky. This government action was legitimized through the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50259597">Sovereign Internet law of 2019</a>, which empowers the RKN to respond through appropriate measures to “security threats to the Internet’s functioning inside Russia” such as “changing the configuration/routes of communications/telecommunications.”</p><p>Over the past few years, the Russian Parliament has passed <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/11/01/russias-sovereign-internet-law-comes-into-force-a68002">over fifty pieces of legislation</a> in an attempt to further control and hegemonize the Russian Internet infrastructure, both internally and externally. While the official justification for these laws is to create a more ‘reliable’ internet, in actuality, some of these laws have provided nearly unfettered freedom to the government to preemptively block and filter content and independently — without relying on Internet intermediaries, or on securing prior judicial sanctions.</p><p>This article hopes to shed light on the top five most important of these laws or combination of laws and their consequential effect in crippling Russian democracy, freedom of speech, and privacy&nbsp;rights.</p> Number 1: Laws mandating identification and de-anonymization <p>A <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/addwork/scans.nsf/ID/B6DD5C7F">2017 law</a> and the following <a href="http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/View/0001201811060001?index=2&amp;rangeSize=1?index=2&amp;rangeSize=1">government regulation in 2018</a>, have effectively eliminated any means for Russian citizens to raise their concerns with the government anonymously without the fear of facing backlash. The law has mandated that every user of an online application which can be used for “receiving, transferring, delivering or processing users’ electronic messages on the internet” has to link their account with a registered mobile number so that they can be identified and tracked if need be. Non-compliance by platforms leads to an imposition of a fine amounting to USD 82 for individuals, USD 800 for officials, and USD 16,500 for companies. Per the law, non-compliance may also lead to the blocking of the platform in Russian territory. It is a small respite that at the moment, these laws are only applicable to online messaging platforms, relieving other OSPs from the compulsory linking of accounts for the time&nbsp;being.</p><p>Further, the 2018 regulation, which is yet to be implemented, requires such online messaging applications have to partner with mobile operators to ensure that the latter are willing to confirm the identity of any of its users within twenty minutes of such information being sought. As with most other laws discussed in this article, the penalty for non-compliance is the blocking of the online&nbsp;service.</p><p>This law hits at the heart of an important way in which online communication can foster open dialogue — the ability to stay anonymous, especially when showing dissent. It would also have a major impact on citizens’ ability to express their <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_148270/3d0cac60971a511280cbba229d9b6329c07731f7/">religion</a>, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/01/09/russia-escalating-persecution-jehovahs-witnesses">faith</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/russian-constitution-change-ends-hopes-gay-marriage-n1233639">sexuality</a>, which have long been penalized by the Russian government.</p> Number 2: The double-edged sword of content moderation laws <p>In 2013, the <a href="https://wilmap.law.stanford.edu/entries/federal-law-no-398-fz-amending-federal-law-information-information-technologies-and">Logovoy Law</a> was passed, which empowered government officials to block content ‘calling for unsanctioned public events that disturb public order’ within 24 hours and without a court order. In 2019, another <a href="https://sozd.duma.gov.ru/bill/1058572-7">draft law</a>, yet to be passed, would give Russian authorities the ability to block websites that censor Russian state media content. Ironically, the reason that the bill provides for this is that such websites violate Russian citizens’ right to access information.</p><p>In 2019, <a href="https://wilmap.law.stanford.edu/entries/federal-law-no-31-fz-amending-article-153-federal-law-information-information-technologies">four sets of laws</a> were passed that have had the cumulative effect of prohibiting the dissemination of “fake news” and news that is deemed “disrespectful” to the state and government officials. The RKN has the authority to delete such information with immediate effect. The stipulated fine for non-removal amounts to USD 6,400 for individuals and up to USD 24,000 for companies. Repeat offenders “disrespecting” the state could also be imprisoned for up to fifteen days. As a brief aside, the term “disrespectful” being used as a measure for potential jail time brings to mind a 2014 <a href="https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/shreya-singhal-v-union-of-india/">judgment</a> of the Indian Supreme Court that held the word “annoyance”, in the same context and for similar penalties, as vague and overbroad.</p><p>In 2020, the <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_372647/">Federal law N482-FZ</a> was passed, which was a sophisticated version of the 2019 draft law discussed above. It essentially penalized OSPs such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter for censoring Russian state media content. For context, there has been substantial research to show that Russian state media spreads disinformation among its citizens and globally. For instance, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/70/5/623/5912109">this</a> paper highlights how RT (formerly, Russia Today) is an “opportunistic channel that is used as an instrument of state defense policy to meddle in the politics of other states”. However, if any of the tech giants censor content like RT’s, they can now be fined or potentially blocked.</p><p>Finally, in January 2021, the Russian parliament has started <a href="https://ria.ru/20210125/blokirovka-1594461448.html">working on a draft law</a> to fine social media for “illegally blocking users”. This move seems to be a consequence of the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">ban</a> on USA former President Donald Trump’s Twitter&nbsp;account.</p> Number 3: Surveillance through laws on forced Data Retention and Data Localisation <p>The 2016 “Yarovaya amendments”, which have been named after their primary author and member of the State Duma (Russian Parliament’s legislative wing), Irina Yarovaya, provides for compulsory retention of all communications for six months. This includes text messages, voice messages, images, and videos. In addition, it also provides that the metadata that marks the location, timestamp, sender, and receiver of the messages, be retained for three years. The amendments also mandate that this data be stored on Russian territory and that the government be given unfettered access to this data without any prior judicial sanction. Since 2016, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook have been penalized for non-compliance. While Twitter and Facebook were <a href="https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/02/13/russian-court-fines-twitter-62-840-dollars-for-refusing-to-localize-user-data">fined</a> approximately USD 50,000 each, the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/17/russia-blocks-access-to-linkedin-over-foreign-held-data">blocked</a> LinkedIn from the Russian territory entirely. Further, in 2019, the fines for non-compliance with data storage requirements have been <a href="https://rg.ru/2016/09/02/fsb-prikaz432-site-dok.html">increased to USD&nbsp;78,000</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the amendments <a href="https://rg.ru/2016/09/02/fsb-prikaz432-site-dok.html">make way</a> for ‘back door’ access to all such data by requiring companies to provide the government with ‘any information necessary’ to decode electronic messages. This drastically weakens the security of such information and weakens encryption measures.</p><p>The Yarovaya amendments requirement to provide a direct and unrestricted back door to access data, coupled with the compulsion to not only localize data but also to retain it for long periods of time effectively means that every conversation/post/discussion can potentially be served on a platter to the Russian government. This is a sticky situation for all involved, but especially for human rights activists, political rights activists, and journalists, such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/30/kremlin-may-be-slowly-killing-alexei-navalny-prison-world-must-not-let-it-happen/">Alexei Navalny</a>, who will be acutely aware that their conversations and metadata, oftentimes confidential, are exposed to the domestic intelligence agencies. This hampers their ability to work and engage in very important and democratic dialogue&nbsp;freely.</p><p>The full implications of such a law were on display in April last year, when the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/13/telegram-loses-free-expression-battle-russian-authorities">RKN blocked Telegram</a>, a messaging app with over 10 million Russian users, for refusing to provide encryption keys to the government. RKN also ordered the <a href="https://usher2.club/en/">blocking of over 18 million IP addresses</a>, used by Telegram to operate in Russia. This led to chaos and affected many legitimate online services including maps, airline booking, and online shopping, among&nbsp;others.</p> Number 4: Laws Banning IP addresses and regulating VPNs and&nbsp;Proxys <p>The various pieces of legislation discussed in this article have been further bolstered by a <a href="https://meduza.io/news/2018/06/05/gosduma-vvela-shtrafy-za-narushenie-zakona-ob-anonimayzerah">2017 law</a> that imposes fines on Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for allowing users access to content banned by Russian authorities or for providing guidance to access such content. In a<a href="https://rg.ru/2017/07/30/fz276-site-dok.html"> bill introduced in 2018</a>, a fine of USD 9,000 was stipulated for non-compliance. This 2018 bill was a result of the above-mentioned ‘Telegram blocking’ incident, after which many <a href="https://roskomsvoboda.org/39035/">Russians turned to VPNs</a> to be able to continue&nbsp;business</p><p>Further, a <a href="https://meduza.io/news/2019/03/28/roskomnadzor-vpervye-potreboval-ot-vpn-servisov-podklyuchitsya-k-reestru-zapreschennyh-saytov">2019 regulation</a> now requires that VPNs and search engine platforms stay updated with a list of blocked websites maintained by the federal government and on the basis of this list, block access to those websites on their platform.</p> Number 5: Law creating an independent Russian Internet Infrastructure <p>The crown for the most restrictive law proposed by the Russian parliament arguably goes to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50259597">Sovereign Internet Law of 2019</a>. It seems that the Russian government fully understands and fears the extent to which online foreign threats are able to impact domestic outcomes (wonder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/russian-election-hacking">why</a>!). Under the garb of ensuring cybersecurity and preventing the Russian territory from such threats, the Sovereign Internet Law has the effect of putting the entire Russian internet infrastructure in a bubble of sorts. The law legitimizes the ‘<a href="https://medium.com/enrique-dans/understanding-the-splinternet-can-the-world-ever-be-truly-global-97262a60678c">splinternet</a>’ within Russian territory — it provides that at any time that the Russian government sees the need to cut off Russia from the rest of the world, it can take control of this bubble and isolate it from the rest of the world wide web and the global Internet infrastructure.</p><p>While on paper, such a national Internet infrastructure is a reasonable backup plan for “emergencies” to combat any foreign threats, it is left entirely up to the officials to decide what would qualify as such a threat. Hence, the effect of this law will be a complete transfer of control to the Russian government over all aspects of the internet, both content and infrastructure, including, of course, the power to trigger internet shutdowns and removing any content that is deemed undesirable, without any prior judicial authorization.</p><p>This is the first global attempt of its kind. Even China has a firewall that filters parts of the Internet but does not create a separate infrastructure of a ‘national’ Internet. Moreover, China’s introduction to the Internet from the very beginning had been controlled, unlike Russia, which has freely provided Internet access to its citizens over the past few decades. This is an additional reason why the ‘internet bubble’ that the Russian government seeks to create may be a problematic endeavor.</p><p>Even though the law imposes compulsory installation of certain technical equipment and procedures for all OSPs, including deep packet inspections, to enable the “Russian Bubble” infrastructure, technologists also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775366588/russian-law-takes-effect-that-gives-government-sweeping-power-over-internet">argue that this may be technically impossible</a>, somewhat like a situation where one expects the first floor of a building to be filled up with water without the ground floor receiving any water influx at&nbsp;all.</p> Taking stock of this cautionary tale <p>Russia has some of the most disproportionate laws for Internet regulation in the world and maybe that helps explain why it continues to remain ‘<a href="https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-world/scores">not free</a>’ as per Freedom House’s World Freedom Index 2021. In the same vein, in June 2020, the European Court of Human Rights <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#%7B">found</a> in four separate cases brought against Russia by local media outlets and OSPs that blocking entire websites violates the owners’ right to impart information and the public’s right to receive it. Despite this, Russia has, yet again, threatened to ban Twitter in March&nbsp;2021.</p><p>For Russian citizens, Russia’s web of Internet laws is broken and continues to be one of the most disproportionately restrictive in the world. Moving forward, it is imperative that laws restricting a citizens’ right to freedom of speech and/or their right to privacy be weighed against the important and age-old principles carved under human rights instruments such as the <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/documents/convention_eng.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights </a>and the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>. It is not hard to guess what would become of the five-set of laws discussed above if this measure was truly upheld in each of them — they would, without a doubt, either cease to exist or become a lot less restrictive.</p><p>Finally, a fact and a thought — Of the three national broadcasting channels in Russia, the government <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17840134">holds over 51% share</a> in one and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17840134">directly runs </a>the parent companies of the other two. It has also recently introduced <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_169740/3d0cac60971a511280cbba229d9b6329c07731f7/#dst100009">a law</a> reducing the permissible percentage of foreign ownership in print media from 50% to 20%. This makes the state’s objective very clear — complete control over public narrative along with unfettered surveillance abilities.</p><p>It is worth thinking if this could be a cautionary tale that is potentially paving a misguided path for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21273191/trump-twitter-social-media-censorship-executive-order-analysis-bias">other countries</a> and for other world leaders, whose objective is abject control over the narrative in their country, both online and&nbsp;offline.</p><p>_____________________________</p><p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/shreya-tewari">Shreya</a> is an Employee Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center, where she works on the Lumen Project.

 Until AI has completely eliminated human biases, can its results be considered any more trustworthy than a&nbsp;human’s? <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/59202267@N08/39225139155">Photo</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/59202267@N08">Electronic_Frontier_Foundation</a>: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;atype=rich">CC BY&nbsp;2.0</a><p>Facial recognition technology is becoming more powerful and more ubiquitous seemingly every day. In January 2021, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79310-1">study</a> found that a facial recognition algorithm could be better at deducing a person’s political orientation than a human judgment or a personality test. Similarly, earlier this week, the Dubai airport rolled out technology through which an <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/middle-east/the-future-is-coming-at-dubai-airport-passengers-identity-confirmed-by-iris-scans-20210308-p578mx.html">iris-scanner would verify one’s identity</a> and eliminate the need for any human interaction when entering or exiting the&nbsp;country.</p><p>The use of facial recognition by law enforcement agencies has become common practice, despite increasing reports of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html">false arrests</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html">jail time</a>. While there are various downsides to facial recognition technology being used at all, including fears of mass surveillance and invasion of privacy, there are flaws within facial recognition technologies themselves that lead to inaccurate results. One such major challenge for this still-burgeoning technology is gender-based inaccuracies.</p><p>Research has indicated that women are 18% more likely to be misidentified through facial recognition than men. One line of <a href="https://medium.com/@Joy.Buolamwini/response-racial-and-gender-bias-in-amazon-rekognition-commercial-ai-system-for-analyzing-faces-a289222eeced">research found that</a> while Amazon’s Rekognition software’s ability to recognize white women’s faces was down to 92.9%, a darker-skinned woman’s recognition would only be 68.9% accurate. Similarly, a study conducted at the University of Washington revealed that a facial recognition tool was <a href="http://markyatskar.com//publications/bias.pdf">68% more likely to predict that an image of a person cooking in the kitchen is that of a woman</a>. These are clear patterns exhibiting sexism in AI and the use of such technologies for law enforcement is likely to disproportionately affect marginalized groups of people, including genders other than male and&nbsp;female.</p><p>It is true that once a leap in technology has been made, hoping to be able to wipe it off the face of the earth may be a little like trying to put a genie back in a bottle. A more probable step in the right direction could be to first, feed representative and better data sets to AIs, and second, deploy the technology only with substantial democratic oversight.</p><p>Data scientists at the MIT Media Lab have <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212">noted</a> that in the instances where they have trained AI with more diverse data, the accuracy of the results has been less discriminatory and accurate. Hence, presenting AI with a diverse representation of datasets for it to learn from would be a great start in reversing the prevalent biases. Additionally, these technologies would also benefit if the providers of the facial recognition software are transparent about its underlying workings.</p><p>This transparency, if accompanied with democratic oversight regarding the application, could potentially aim at striking a better balance as to when, where, how and to what end facial recognition may be used. For example, such oversight could be in the form of regulations that set an industry standard that an AI must meet before its commercial application. However, regardless of how many leaps facial recognition takes in the coming years, a serious, deliberate discussion is necessary for determining whether facial recognition should be used by law enforcement at all. This is because the consequences of error are so grave. The European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/artificial-intelligence">will release </a>its first legislative proposal later this year and it will be interesting to see how the proposal will attempt to regulate AI application.</p><p>Former UN Special Rapporteur David Kaye’s <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/un-special-rapporteur-report-artificial-intelligence-impact-human-rights/">warning</a> that AI will enforce bias is more pertinent now than ever before. However, until the day that AI has completely eliminated human biases, can its results be considered any more trustworthy than a&nbsp;human’s?</p><p>About the author: <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/shreya-tewari">Shreya</a> is an Employee Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center, where she works on the Lumen Project.

 Killer Whale Jello Bowl Death Match Redux: The Reckoning 
<p>At #IIW32, a mammoth and consequential conversation spanned 4 intense, jam-packed sessions and set new highs for IIW session-name silliness culminating in a massive interoperability watershed and widespread buy-in from many communities! The details of what gets built are being worked out in a <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-presentation-exchange">new work item</a> of the Claims &amp; Credentials WG, building on the recent donation to DIF of the Bloom WACI extension to Presentation Exchange. The goal is both a minimum viable implementable spec for cross-stack credential exchange ("v0.1 scope"), and a longer-term commitment to a more fully-featured iteration of the same spec ("v1 scope").

We wanted to determine ways in which we could use our power and privilege to contribute to dismantling white supremacy (you can read more about our commitments <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/an-investment-in-justice-bad462284f27">here</a>).</p><p>While criminal justice and policing reform is not one of our focus areas at Omidyar Network, there is a close link between economic injustice and racial violence, which is why we called out the need to build an explicitly anti-racist and inclusive economy as the second pillar upholding our <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">reimagined vision for capitalism.</a> It is impossible to build a more just and equitable economy without directly addressing the ways in which our existing economy was intentionally designed to uphold white supremacy by excluding people from opportunities to participate fully in markets based on their race — not to mention gender, class, nationality, disability, and other forms of human diversity.</p><p>Our conviction in the necessity of this pillar has only been compounded by the evidence of the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>In the six weeks that it has taken to write and edit this piece, there have been two mass shootings in Atlanta and Indianapolis that targeted Asian Americans. Police officers killed 20-year-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/daunte-wright-death-minnesota.html">Daunte Wright</a> in Minnesota, 13-year-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/us/adam-toledo-chicago-police-shooting.html">Adam Toledo</a> in Chicago, and 16-year-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/us/makhia-bryant.html">Ma’Khia Bryant</a> in Ohio. A ceaseless drumbeat of violence and trauma continue unabated, with only a glimmer of accountability in the trial and <a href="https://omidyar.com/statement-from-omidyar-network-on-derek-chauvin-verdict-the-first-step-to-justice/">conviction of Derek Chauvin</a> for the murder of George&nbsp;Floyd.</p><p>Meanwhile, the pandemic has exposed the extent to which the prejudices of the past remain embedded in the institutions and systems that we rely on today — to disastrous effect.</p><p>During the initial wave of the pandemic, many spoke of COVID as a great equalizer — a universal threat indifferent to our race, nationality, or class. Yet it quickly became clear that, although the virus itself cannot discriminate, our healthcare and economic structures certainly can and do. Every aspect of the pandemic and our healthcare response was impacted by race. The virus itself spread more quickly in communities of color, and took a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/racial-ethnic-disparities/disparities-illness.html">greater toll</a> on welfare and lives. Meanwhile, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-neighborhoods-access-covid-19-testing-sites-analysis/story?id=71884719">COVID tests</a> and <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200716.620294/full/">lifesaving PPE</a> were more readily available in white neighborhoods at the beginning of the pandemic — and many of these inequities persist.</p><p>The effects of the economic recession are similarly shaped by race. As new data from our recent <a href="https://www.gallup.com/education/267590/great-jobs-report.aspx">Great Jobs survey with Gallup confirms</a>, Black, Latinx, and Asian-American and Pacific Islander workers are <a href="https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-Frontline-Workers.pdf">over-represented in essential, frontline industries</a> such as health care, transportation, and retail, causing them to face greater risk of COVID exposure. Even as our economy has inched toward recovery, Black and Latinx workers, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/black-and-hispanic-women-arent-sharing-in-the-job-market-recovery.html">and especially women</a>, are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-unemployment-race/gap-in-u-s-black-and-white-unemployment-rates-is-widest-in-five-years-idUSKBN2431X7">regaining their jobs much more slowly than their white counterparts</a>. Meanwhile, women, <a href="https://nwlc.org/resources/all-of-the-jobs-lost-in-december-were-womens-jobs/">and especially women of color</a>, were both more likely to lose their job or find it necessary to dedicate their time exclusively to unpaid care work, <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/covid-19-widens-gender-gap-labor-force-participation">erasing decades of gains in women’s labor force participation</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/10/30/492582/covid-19-sent-womens-workforce-progress-backward/">wages</a>.</p><p>These inequalities were not inevitable. Rather, this uneven toll stands as a physical manifestation of our history, etched into our society with every job, home, and life lost. An enduring lesson from this pandemic must be that, even when we face a threat like a virus that cannot intentionally discriminate between us, the institutional and cultural legacies that we have inherited from past efforts to purposefully divide us will ensure that our experiences are unequal and&nbsp;unjust.</p><p>A long legacy of exclusion</p><p>This persistence of social disparities should surprise no one, since intentional exclusion has long been the norm in the United States. For centuries, the power to shape our laws, government, markets, culture, and biases has been restricted by race, gender, and class. Varied forms of exclusion — from slavery and disenfranchisement to imprisonment, institutionalization, and deportation — have been justified by those in power (predominantly white men) in order to concentrate the benefits of American prosperity into their own hands. Acts — and threats — of physical violence against people of color have played a central role in upholding this dynamic, echoes of which we have seen play out in the violent snapshots of police brutality across the country&nbsp;today.</p><p>America’s history of racial exclusion has been integral to shaping our economy, denying people of color the opportunity to profit and accumulate wealth from their own contributions to our economy. The earliest form of American capitalism was one that enriched white Americans who stole land from Native Americans and labor from enslaved Black people. Later iterations of our economy not only permitted racial discrimination, but also exempted employers in sectors with a majority Black or Latinx labor force (namely agriculture, hospitality, and domestic services) from legal requirements to provide a minimum wage, workplace protections, and benefits. Meanwhile, developers, city planners, and the real estate industry redlined Black families into homes and communities with limited job opportunities, few financial service providers, and failing infrastructure. All of these systems were created with the intent of perpetuating white economic supremacy, and, in many cases, remain the foundation of the economy we experience today.</p><p>These patterns of economic marginalization and exploitation are crucial to maintaining power imbalances. Robbing people of the ability to accumulate wealth is tantamount to robbing them of the ability to accumulate power. After all, people without savings find it more difficult to change jobs, to choose where or with whom to live, or <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/01/08/the-politics-of-financial-insecurity-a-democratic-tilt-undercut-by-low-participation/">to contribute time and money to politics.</a> And those robbed of their wealth have less to pass on to their children, thereby perpetuating this theft of opportunity across generations.</p><p>In recent decades, efforts to intentionally exclude people of color, and especially Black Americans, from participating in the markets and accumulating wealth and power may have been less overt, but not less effective. For the past fifty years, we have relied on markets to solve our social problems, even though markets are mechanisms in which people with existing wealth and assets use investments to gain even more wealth and assets. Superimposed over an unequal society, free markets can only exacerbate those inequalities. Meanwhile, many of those in power have worked to weaken the very institutions — government, labor unions, our social safety net — that could mitigate these market imbalances.</p><p>Supporting organizations working to build an anti-racist economy</p><p>Omidyar Network is committed to building an economy that is explicitly anti-racist and inclusive. An economy which simultaneously rejects the justifications for racism and consciously works to remove the structures of our society that perpetuate racial injustice. We are working toward a society where everyone has the power and ability to live the life of their choosing — free to choose their job, choose where they will live, choose how to invest their time and resources, and choose who represents them in government.</p><p>A first step toward achieving this vision is to correct the power imbalances that prevent people of color from have a voice in how the economy impacts them. That’s why we support <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/">Action Center on Race and the Economy (ACRE)</a>, an organization that provides support to groups on the ground campaigning for structural change of, and increased accountability from, the financial sector. ACRE helps grassroots organizations identify the ways in which the financial sector contributes to such challenges as <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/issues/health-care/">healthcare</a>, housing, the <a href="https://fuelingthefire.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PWF_fossilfuelreport_WEB.pdf">environment</a>, and <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/issues/policing-and-incarceration/">policing and incarceration</a>. During the pandemic, ACRE was part of a coalition that supported the <a href="https://westriketogether.org/">We Strike Together campaign</a>, using rent and mortgage strikes to secure relief for renters during the&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://communitychange.org/">Community Change</a>, represents networks of local organizations building power with people of color so they have a say in policies that impact their lives. Its <a href="https://communitychange.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CC_Path-to-Power-2019-doc.pdf">strategy</a> includes efforts to strengthen organizing infrastructure in communities of color, and to increase their influence and develop new models of sustainable, volunteer-led community organizations.</p><p>A second task is to address the ways that existing economic rules perpetuate exclusion, either by changing policies or finding innovative ways to work around an unjust system. One of our partners, <a href="https://www.domesticworkers.org/">National Domestic Workers Alliance</a>(NDWA), advocates on behalf of the 2.5 million nannies, house cleaners, and care workers across the country, most of whom are women, especially Black, Latinx, Native, and Asian American Pacific Island women. During the pandemic, NDWA <a href="https://domesticworkers.org/coronavirus-care-fund">distributed $400 in emergency support</a> to more than 40,000 domestic workers who had lost their jobs during the lockdowns, and helped successfully advocate for the American Jobs Plan to include a $400 billion dollar investment in care&nbsp;jobs.</p><p>Finally, we must weed out and uproot all remaining vestiges of the ideas used to justify exclusion and division, and help new ideas take root. That’s why we support the work of academics, researchers, and other movement and thought leaders who study the stratifications of our economy and propose pathways forward. Most notably, we have worked closely with Professor <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/milano/faculty/darrick-hamilton/">Darrick Hamilton</a> of The New School, a leading economist whose work explores the ways that existing systems perpetuate racial inequality and offers proposals — such as baby bonds or a federal job guarantee — to make the future economy more equitable. We also support the work of <a href="https://www.demos.org/">Demos</a>, a think tank for race-forward progressive policy ideas and an advocacy network that aims to increase the power that communities of color have over economic decisions. It has, for example, designed a platform of policies for <a href="https://www.demos.org/our-issues/economic-justice/climate-equity">equitably addressing the climate crisis</a> and expanding the availability of <a href="https://www.demos.org/our-issues/economic-justice/debt-free-college">debt-free college</a>. Demos is also releasing a number of <a href="https://www.demos.org/our-issues/covid-19-racial-justice">policy proposals to ensure that our pandemic recovery brings us closer to a more democratic and inclusive economy</a>. We believe it is imperative that these ideas are not cordoned off in think tanks or academic institutions, but rather shaped in partnership with those communities that are most impacted — building a ladder from the grassroots all the way up the ivory&nbsp;tower.</p><p>Far from being a time of solidarity and common endurance, this past year exposed a whole host of enduring racial injustices. Our institutions, built on foundations of intentional exclusion, deepened and perpetuated divisions built on old biases and hatreds, that have been nourished for centuries. However, even as the country witnessed the devastation of the pandemic — layered over the continued translation of hate into outright violence against people of color — many responded by joining the movement for racial&nbsp;justice.</p><p>The incredible work of our Reimagining Capitalism grantees is setting a course to build power with communities of color, rewrite the rules that have privileged white and wealthy people for so long, and reshape our ideas of racial justice and&nbsp;equity.</p><p>As America rebuilds, it is the mutual responsibility of funders to be anti-racist in rectifying the consequences of centuries of systemic racism that have robbed communities of color of their wealth, power, and rights, and to ensure that the economic system that is rebuilt supports an inclusive society in which everyone can live with dignity and&nbsp;thrive.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-building-an-anti-racist-and-inclusive-economy-36fc79ab5cbc">Reimagining Capitalism Series: Building an Anti-Racist and Inclusive Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Part 1: Conformance Testing for Measurable Goals</p><p>[Written in consultation with the Interoperability Working Group chairs]<br></p><p>A recurring topic in the Interoperability Working Group is that of defining short-, medium- and long-term goals or “targets” for interoperability. The topic comes up again every few months, and each time it does, the chairs try to tackle it head-on for a full meeting or two, some emails, and various off-line discussions, but doing so never seems to arrive at a satisfactory or definitive answer. Each time, what feels a Herculean outlay of effort only gets us a tentative resolution, as if we’d deflected a debt collector with a minimum payment. Dear reader, we would like to refinance, or at least restructure, this debt to our community!</p><p>In this two-part overview of our goals for 2021, we would like to survey the landscape of “provable,” testable interoperability targets and give some guidance on what we would like to see happen next in the testable interop world. Then, in a companion article, we will lay out clear proposal for parallel, distributed work on multiple fronts, such that progress can be distributed across various subcommunities and hubs of open cooperation, each reasonably confident that they are helping the big picture by “zooming in” on one set of problems. &nbsp;</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christopherphigh">Christopher Paul High</a> A seemingly uncontroversial target state <p>Interoperation is a deceptively transparent etymology: any two things that perform a function are inter-operating if they can perform their operation together and mutually. Two fax machines interoperate if one sends a fax and the other receives it, which is a far more impressive feat if the two machines in question were designed and built by different companies on different continents, fifteen years apart. This is the kind of target state people usually have in mind when they imagine interoperability for an emerging technology.</p><p>This everyday example glosses over a lot of complexity and history, however. Standards bodies had already specified exact definitions of how the “handshake” is established between two unfamiliar fax machines before either model of fax machine was a twinkle in a design team’s eye. In addition to all the plodding, iterative standardization, there has also been a lot of economic trial and error and dead-ends we never heard about. &nbsp;Even acceptable margins of error and variance from the standards have been prototyped, refined, socialized, and normalized, such that generations of fax machines have taken them to heart, while entire factories have been set up to produce standard components like white-label fax chips and fax boards that can be used by many competing brands. On a software level, both design teams probably recycled some of the same libraries and low-level code, whether open-source or licensed.</p><p>Decomposing this example into its requirements at various levels shows how many interdependent and complex subsystems have to achieve internal maturity and sustainable relationships. A time-honored strategy is to treat each of these subsystems in a distinct, parallel maturation process and combine them gradually over time. The goal, after all, is not a working whole, but a working ecosystem. &nbsp;Architectural alternatives, for example, have to be debated carefully, particularly for disruptive and emerging technologies that redistribute power within business processes or ecosystems. Sharing (or better yet, responsibly open-sourcing and governing) common software libraries and low-level hardware specifications is often a “stitch in time” that saves nine later stitches, since it gives coordinators a stable baseline to work from, sooner.</p><p>Naturally, from even fifty or a hundred organizations committed to this target state, a thousand different (mostly sensible) strategies can arise. “How to proceed?” becomes a far-from-trivial question, even when all parties share many common goals and incentives. For instance, almost everyone:</p>  Wants to grow the pie of adoption and market interest  Holds privacy and decentralization as paramount commitments  Strives to avoid repeating the mistakes and assumptions of previous generations of internet technology  <p>And yet, all the same… both strategic and tactical differences arise, threatening to entrench themselves into camps or even schools of thought. How to achieve the same functional consensus on strategy as we have on principles? Our thesis here is that our short-term roadmaps need testable, provable alignment goals that we can all agree on for our little communities and networks of technological thinking to converge gradually. Simply put, we need a few checkpoints and short-term goals, towards which we can all work together.</p> Today’s test suites and interoperability profiles <p>Perhaps the biggest differences turn out not to be about target state or principles, but about what exactly “conformance” means relative to what has already been specified and standardized. Namely, the core specifications for DIDs and VCs are both data models written in the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), which put protocols out of scope. This stems partly from the decisions of the groups convened in the W3C, and partly from a classic division of labor in the internet standards world between W3C, which traditionally governs the data models of web browser and servers, &nbsp;and a distinct group, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p><p>VCs were specified first, with a preference (but not a requirement) for DIDs, with exact parameters for DIDs and DID systems deferred to a separate data model. &nbsp;Then, to accommodate entrenched and seemingly irreconcilable ideas about how DIDs could best be expressed, the DID data model was made less representationally-explicit and turned into an abstract data model. This shift to a representation-agnostic definition of DIDs, combined with the still-tentative and somewhat representation-specific communication and signing protocols defined to date, makes truly agnostic and cross-community data model conformance somewhat difficult to test. This holds back interoperability (and objective claims to conformance)!</p> W3C: Testing the core specifications <p>The only test suite associated with the core W3C specifications is the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/tree/main/packages/vc-http-api-test-server">VC-HTTP-API test suite </a>for VC data model conformance and the fledgling <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/">DID-core test suite</a>, both worked on in the W3C-CCG. The former tests implementations of VC-handling systems against some pre-established sample data and test scripts through a deliberately generalized API interface that strives to be minimally opinionated with respect to context- and implementation-specific questions like API authentication. The latter is still taking shape, given that the DID spec has been very unstable in the home stretch of its editorial process arriving at CR this last week.</p><p>The VC-HTTP-API interface, specified collectively by the first <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">SVIP</a> funding cycle cohort for use in real-world VC systems, has been used in some contexts as a de facto general-purpose architecture profile, even if it is very open-ended on many architectural details traditionally specified in government or compliance profiles. &nbsp;Its authors and editors did not intend it to be the general-purpose profile for the VC data model generally, but in the absence of comparable alternatives, it is sometimes taken as one; it has perhaps taken on more of a definitive role than originally intended. </p><p>Following the second iteration of the SVIP program and the expansion of the cohort, the API and its test suite are poised to accrue features and coverage to make it more useful outside of its original context. Core participants have established a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/">weekly public call</a> at the CCG and a lively re-scoping/documentation process is currently underway to match the documentation and rationale documents to the diversity of contexts deploying the API.</p> Aries: End-to-end conformance testing <p>Other profiles, like the Aries interoperability profile, serve an important role, but it would be misleading to call it a VC data model test suite-- it is more like an end-to-end test harness for showing successful implementation of the Aries protocols and architecture. Here “interoperability” means interoperability with other Aries systems, and conformance with the shared Aries interpretation of the standard VC data model and the protocols this community has defined on the basis of that interpretation. </p><p>Many matters specified by the W3C data model are abstracted out or addressed by shared libraries in Ursa, so its scope is not exactly coterminous with the W3C data model. Instead, the Aries interoperability profile has its own infrastructural focus, which focuses on scaling the privacy guarantees of blockchain-based ZKP systems. In many ways, this focus complements rather than supplants that of the W3C test suites. </p><p>Many of the trickiest questions on which SSI systems differ are rooted in what the Aries and Trust-over-IP communities conceptualize as “<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack">layer 2</a>,” the connective infrastructural building-blocks connecting end-users to VCs and DIDs. As more and more features get added to be testable across language implementations, and as feature-parity is achieved with other systems (such as <a href="https://youtu.be/LC0OXAir3Qw">support for LD VCs</a>), the case for productive complementarity and deep interoperability gets easier and easier to make.</p> The first wave of local profiles and guidelines <p>Other specifications for decentralized-identity APIs and wallets, modelled on that W3C CCG and/or extending the work of Aries-based infrastructures, are starting to crop up around the world. &nbsp;So far these have all arisen out of ambitious government-funded programs to build infrastructure, often with an eye to local governance or healthy competition. Canada and the European Commission are the most high-profile ones to date, building on earlier work in Spain, the UK, and elsewhere; Germany and other countries funding next-generation trust frameworks may soon follow suit. </p><p>It is important, however, to avoid framing these tentative, sometimes cautious attempts at bridging status quo and new models as universal standards. If anything, these frameworks tend to come with major caveats and maturity disclaimers, on top of having carefully narrowed scopes. &nbsp;After all, they are generally the work of experienced regulators, inheriting decades of work exploring identity and infrastructural technologies through a patchwork of requirements and local profiles that tend to align over time. If they are designed with enough circumspection and dialogue, conformance with one should never make conformance with another impossible. (The authors would here like to extend heartfelt sympathy to all DIF members currently trying to conform to multiple of these at once!) </p><p>These profiles test concrete and specific interpretations of a shared data model that provide a testing benchmark for regulatory “green lighting” of specific implementations and perhaps even whole frameworks. Particularly when they specify best practices or requirements for security and API design, they create testable standardization by making explicit their opinions and assumptions about:</p>  approved cryptography,  auditing capabilities,  privacy requirements, and  API access/authentication   <p>These will probably always differ and make a universal abstraction impossible; and that’s not a bad thing! These requirements are always going to be specific to each regulatory context, and without them, innovation (and large-scale investment) are endangered by regulatory uncertainty. Navigating these multiple profiles is going to be a challenge in the coming years, as more of them come online and their differences come into relief as a stumbling block for widely-interoperable protocols with potentially global reach. </p><p>The Interoperability working group will be tracking them and providing guidance and documentation where possible. Importantly, though, there is a new DIF Working Group coming soon, the Wallet Security WG, which will dive deeper into these profiles and requirements, benefiting from a narrow scope and IPR protection, allowing them to speak more bluntly about the above-mentioned details. </p>

 A progress update on implementing decentralized SLAs and the EWT Escrow&nbsp;Model <p>At the end of February our CEO Walter Kok laid out the concept of a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/its-coming-quality-of-service-guarantees-for-decentralized-technologies-c0e133ebe644">decentralized SLA </a>and how it will form the basis of a new type of service-level agreement (SLA) for enterprises and vendors alike. Unlike a traditional, bilateral SLA, a DSLA approach is inherently distributed and establishes multilateral trust that the services will be delivered according to the agreement. This new type of business and technical architecture will enable very transparent reporting on the actual, real-world service&nbsp;quality.</p><p>We see the DSLA as an important aspect of the Utility Layer of the Energy Web tech stack. The Utility Layer comprises a variety of ‘digital machinery’ (i.e., services) that power the dApps running on the Energy Web Chain. That’s why we unveiled the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/the-energy-transition-is-at-stake-ec9f4ececd85">EWT Escrow Model</a>, as a way to unlock the full potential of the Energy Web tech stack to achieve the delivery of a decentralized service operation and its objectives. The EWT Escrow Model allows for both Providers (i.e., vendors providing Utility Layer services) and Patrons (e.g., community members who may stake some amount of EWT in support).</p><p>The entire process leverages <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">EW Switchboard</a> to manage DIDs and roles for Customers, Providers, and&nbsp;Patrons.</p><p>Our goal is to launch the first Utility Layer services, complete with escrow and subscriptions, in production by Q3 2021. Between then and now, we’re aiming for a several key milestones, including: a) an alpha release on our testnet, Volta (this is when Patrons will be able to test an early version of the Escrow Model); b) a beta release on the Energy Web Chain; and c) scaling the Utility Layer service network, onboarding additional Providers and Patrons from the wider Energy Web community, adding new Utility Layer services, and integrating the escrow and subscription models with exchanges and other external systems to make it even easier to participate.</p><p>If you’ve watched our pipeline of major announcements and initiatives in recent weeks and months, you know that the Energy Web team and the broader ecosystem have been incredibly busy. But we’ve also been making progress on the EWT Escrow Model, and are excited to share this update with&nbsp;you.</p><p>SPOILER ALERT: DEAR PATRONS AND PROVIDERS, STAKING IS STILL COMING AND Q3 IS STILL A REALISTIC TARGET.</p> We finalized the architecture, designed the UI, and got the resources (almost) in&nbsp;place… <p>The picture below lays out the architecture of the decentralized service operations. It breaks down into four important blocks: 1) Customer Tasks (consuming the service, in green), 2) Provider Tasks (delivering the service, in yellow), 3) The Watchtower (monitoring and reporting on the service operations, in red), and 4) Governance Tasks (smart contracts executing the DSLAs, in&nbsp;blue).</p><p>And yes, there at the top are the Patrons, who can stake together with their service provider of choice. Let’s get into a little bit more&nbsp;detail.</p> THE SERVICE PROVIDER AND THE&nbsp;PATRON <p>Service Providers (“Providers”) are organizations that operate Utility Layer service nodes. In order to become a qualified Provider, an organization must pass a basic KYC check and deposit a minimum balance of EWT into an escrow smart contract for a multi-year period. Once qualified, Providers can launch service nodes by depositing an incremental amount of EWT in escrow and claim they are ready to deliver the service. The Watchtower will validate the claim (more on the Watchtower below). The following animation shows the User Interface we have developed so far to onboard Service Providers and&nbsp;Patrons:</p><p>To meet the minimum escrow balance requirement, Providers can either acquire the necessary EWT themselves or accept EWT from external Patrons in the wider community. As long as Providers deliver services in accordance with the prescribed rules, they will earn a stable income on their deposited EWT.</p> THE CUSTOMER <p>Customers follow an onboarding process similar to that of Providers. We want the system to be trustless, so the Providers (and Patrons) need to be assured that the Customer will pay for the service once it has been delivered. So basically, they put their pre-payments into escrow, too. Once the Customer claims that they are ready to consume services, the Watchtower will also validate this claim. The following animation shows the user interface we have developed so far to onboard customers and how they can choose the services and SLAs they want to&nbsp;consume:</p> THE WATCHTOWER AND GOVERNANCE TASKS <p>The Watchtower will be a similar decentralized architecture as the one we deploy for the validators of the Energy Web Chain. Watchtower nodes will also follow the Proof-of-Authority consensus algorithm. They are trusted entities, similar to our validators (we expect a subset of our validators to also run a Watchtower node).</p><p>Each Watchtower will validate the claim of readiness from both Provider and Customer and individually report on it. The smart contract (part of the governance tasks) will move both to the operational status when there is consensus amongst the Watchtowers. The services are now ready to be delivered and consumed and all the Watchtowers will start to monitor the actual performance. When it is their turn, they will measure and publish their results individually. Again, the consensus algorithm will ensure a decision of the actual performance for the interval, taking all scores into&nbsp;account.</p><p>We expect that these intervals will aggregate to a daily / weekly Service Level Score. Then depending on the Service Level Agreement, the payment / slashing logic will kick in. The necessary evidence will be stored on the Energy Web Chain so that at any time it can be accessed (taking into account privacy preserving requirements, etc.).</p> So what can you expect&nbsp;next.. <p>Looking ahead at the coming months, we’re forging ahead with the schedule we laid out in the original EWT Escrow Model&nbsp;article:</p>  In May 2021, we will conduct an alpha release of escrow and subscription tools on our testnet Volta. This is when our Patrons will be able to early test the staking&nbsp;feature.  In June and July 2021, we will conduct a beta release of escrow and service components on the Energy Web Chain (EWC), with an initial cohort of Service Providers from the EWC validator community.  Throughout the remainder of the year, we will focus on scaling the Utility Layer service network, onboarding additional Providers and Patrons from the wider Energy Web community, adding new Utility Layer services, and integrating the escrow and subscription models with exchanges and other external systems to make it even easier to participate.  <p>Expect to continue to hear from Energy Web over the coming months. If you have questions or ideas, drop us a note in the comments below! To stay up to date with the latest information, follow us on Twitter or join our Telegram community.</p><p>The EWT Escrow Model is closer than ever to becoming a reality — including the 10–20% return on deposited EWT we mentioned when we first announced the Escrow Model. We are now seeing a convergence of positive developments: major projects deploying on the Energy Web tech stack in partnership with our members, a robust community around EWT, and a stronger-than-ever appetite for digital solutions that address the urgent climate challenge. We continue to act our way into new thinking&nbsp;indeed.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/acting-our-way-into-new-thinking-85fb79b1970a">Acting our way into new thinking…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland—29 April 2021 — Today Energy Web announced that the <a href="https://shareandcharge.com/">Share&amp;Charge Foundation</a> has become a part of the global nonprofit. In March 2020, Share&amp;Charge <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/share-charge-foundation-launches-open-charging-network-on-energy-web-chain-84af7f6f5b3c">launched its Open Charging Network</a> (OCN) on the Energy Web Chain. Share&amp;Charge’s OCN is a decentralized e-roaming solution for seamless electric vehicle (EV) charging across different charge point networks. Today’s announcement makes the Share&amp;Charge team an extension of Energy Web’s core team, while the OCN becomes more tightly integrated with the EW tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>“In the global energy transition, EVs are one of the fastest-growing segments, with customers investing trillions in all-electric cars and trucks, while automakers, charge point operators, and utilities are investing heavily in charging infrastructure,” explained Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of Energy Web. “EVs sit at the intersection of several major use cases for open-source digital technology like the Energy Web tech stack. Giving EVs self-sovereign identities enables them to easily and efficiently register in energy markets to provide services to grid operators. They’re a major new source of demand for renewable energy. And it will become increasingly important to track their batteries throughout their lifecycle, in alignment with regulations around the world. Bringing Share&amp;Charge into the Energy Web family better prepares us to support the coming e-mobility future.”</p><p>Share&amp;Charge will continue to operate as an independent brand, although it will now do so in closer alignment with the Energy Web team and strategy. “This is an exciting transition for Share&amp;Charge and we are happy to be joining forces with EW,” said Dietrich Sümmermann, chair of the Share&amp;Charge Foundation board. “As more and more companies join Energy Web and its global ecosystem, we stand ready to support seamless e-roaming as EVs become the dominant form of mobility in the decades&nbsp;ahead.”</p><p>Energy Web is working together with the OCN community through already-established channels — both supporting the current OCN and the development of a DID-based OCN 2.0. Stay tuned for more on this&nbsp;front.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. We enable any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors our tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/share-charge-becomes-a-part-of-energy-web-33fbffc5f3a4">Share&amp;Charge Becomes a Part of Energy Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Lightweight micro-grants to further the DIF mission <br></p><p>DIF is kicking off a program to administer narrowly-scoped financial support for community initiatives, ranging in format from grants to more competitive implementation bounties, hackathon-style open collaborations, and security reviews. Although the complexity and number of stakeholders involved will naturally vary, all of these bounties will all be structured around public “challenges” that directly reward efforts helpful to the community as a whole. </p><p>Each of these challenges will culminate in a library-, repository-, or narrow specification-sized donation that closes interoperability gaps, generates usable documentation, or solving other tooling and data problems that move the decentralized identity needle. These could be signature suites, libraries, toolkits, or even detailed tutorials and implementation guides. </p><p>Prompts for whitepapers or non-normative implementation guides are harder to define in testable terms, but still welcome; one way of defining them is by listing a significant, finite set of input documents (such as specifications and regulatory profiles) and defining success as simple, useful documentation incorporates all their prescriptions and limitations.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jchatelain">Julien Chatelain</a><p>To make the awarding of these grants as objective and non-controversial as possible, we will be administering them in the form of technically-specified “challenges” that break down into specific, testable criteria. Submissions will be defined as donations to DIF that meet some or all of the criteria of a given challenge; the Technical Steering Committee will administer the adjudication of testing submissions against challenges.</p><p>Grant money can be offered directly from DIF’s budget by decision of the DIF’s governing board (the Steering Committee) and/or offered by a member company and approved by the SC. The donator of the grant funds can choose a specific WG or combination of WGs to specify and fine-tune the challenge. These WGs work with the Technical Steering Committee to ratify successful completion and authorize release of funds once a conforming donation has been received.</p> FAQ for DIF Grants:  Who can offer a Grant?<br>
Any DIF member and/or the DIF Steering Committee can offer a grant (or matching funds) as long as the scope of the challenge benefits the entire DIF community. DIF SC will review grant requests before the challenge is prepared and published. 
Who writes the challenge?<br>
Grants challenges are written by the chairs and/or the members of the WG chosen by the donors to administer the grant. The WG is responsible for writing a challenge acceptable to the SC and the grantor. WG chairs should submit the challenge at least one week before the deadline for Grantor approval (aka “go/no go decision”), to allow for fine-tuning or negotiation of terms.
What makes a good challenge?<br>
A good challenge is testable to make the decision about its success objective rather than subjective, and it should include its own testable definition of success and, where appropriate, usable test fixtures.<br><br>
<p>A good challenge also serves the broader community equally (for instance, not just JWT-, LD-, or Aries-based systems). A challenge should not favor any given commercial product (or infrastructure such as specific blockchains) substantially over others, and care should be taken to think through what the “equivalences” or counterparties are if a challenge comes from a specific community, credential format, etc.</p>
 Who can submit and who reviews it?<br>
Participation is open for the broad community (no prior DIF membership is required), but submissions will only be considered upon donation to the challenge-owning DIF WG. The donation should be “clean IP,” i.e. comprised entirely of IP generated by the donator(s), and the challenge owner may also impose some limitations on external dependencies. 
Is there a minimum and maximum donation size that DIF will administer as a grant?<br>
For now, DIF has decided not to use this structure for grants under 1000U$. DIF cannot manage grants of over 50,000K U$ at this time.
How is/are winner(s) selected?<br>
Each challenge can specify the relationship between testable criteria and winner(s).  The template for challenge authors specifies a few common patterns, i.e., pre-approved grantee(s), bounty-style competition, and sponsored lead/editor for an open work item.<br><br>
Payment is handled through a contract signed with JDF. 
 Checklist for defining a good challenge:  
 Define the solution to the challenge as simply as possible, ideally in one noun phrase, i.e.
 
 “A lossless, general-purpose translator between DID Document representations”, 
 “A sample implementation that reimplements DIDComm access via Bluetooth in a second major language,” or 
 “A specification for how EDVs could be accessed over NFT written by someone with broad NFT and security experience” 
 
 
 Consider redundancy of effort - Do people apply with an idea and get approved to execute (i.e., “grant”), working in reasonable confidence of post-success payment if they meet the deadline? Or do they compete with unknown number of other teams, only applying to get paid after completion? It is recommended that challenge owners decide early between these three modes of operation:
 
 “mini-grant” mode: applicants get pre-approved before beginning work and work privately until donating 
 “Work item” mode: applicants get pre-approved to lead a public work item at DIF, which may accept volunteer contributions from other DIF members. Work should be donated even if the challenge is not completed or is completed sooner by another party. 
 “Open participation” mode, aka implementation bounty: anyone can work privately and successful donation(s) get(s) the award. 
 
 
 A good challenge should not be met merely by addressing known bugs, repackaging prior art, superficial/minor bugs, etc. 
 Where in the interoperability WG’s map of implementer decisions does the challenge “live” and which sections does it directly affect? Answering this question may help argue for direct or indirect benefits to the whole community. 
 How familiar are the authors of the challenge with that specific problem space, in and outside of decentralized identity? Have experts been consulted from outside the WG, or better yet, outside of the decentralized identity community?
 
 How evenly distributed would the benefits be? Please consider (and write out) how various subcommunities (i.e., Aries-based solutions, JWT-/JSON-based solutions, and LD-based solutions) would benefit from this solution. If the benefits would be unevenly distributed, consider adding an additional challenge criterion (perhaps even awardable separately) for extending extra benefits to the least-served community, such as an implementation guide, @Context file, vocabulary to aid translation, etc. 
 
 
 Define criteria for success, ideally testable ones to minimize the subjective judgments to be made by the TSC.
 
 If possible, include dummy data and other test vectors. 
 Securing formal review by an outsider with specified qualities or experience can be written in as a success criteria or payment trigger. 
 Vaguely-worded requirements of “originality” are hard to assess, but negative requirements like “MUST/SHOULD not re-implement existing solutions linked from the reference section of this spec” can help make sure requirements clear to all involved.

  <p>In 2020, GLEIF launched a transformative new role into the Global LEI System: the Validation Agent. </p>
<p>Having listened to the challenges that financial institutions (FIs) were facing when it came to onboarding new clients, we introduced this new operational model to help FIs overcome delays and save time by removing duplicative processes across onboarding and LEI issuance. </p>
<p>The Validation Agent Framework empowers FIs to leverage their know your customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulated business as usual onboarding processes, to obtain an LEI for their customers when verifying a client’s identity during initial onboarding or during a standard client refresh update. As a result, FIs acting as Validation Agents save time and cost while enhancing their client onboarding experience by removing the duplication of data validation processes. </p>
<p>By becoming Validation Agents financial institutions can also streamline, accelerate and diversify their use of the LEI, and ensure their autonomy as they look to digitize their business processes. </p>
<p>GLEIF signed JP Morgan as its first Validation Agent at the end of 2020 and is continuing to invite FIs to participate in the Framework’s trial phase and establish first-mover status in the market. </p>
<p>GLEIF is working to standardize the trial engagement process, but also acknowledges that every FI employs its own processes and departmental functions differently. This is why GLEIF is committed to working with each triallist individually to explore and define the Validation Agent role ‘in context’, and to ensure the Global LEI System continues to meet the sector’s needs. </p>
<p>The trial process is comprised of seven steps, as illustrated in the graphic below. </p>
<a href="https://www.gleif.org/thumbs/newsroom/blog/the-seven-step-process-to-becoming-a-validation-agent/7-step-process-flow-750x364-750x364.png"></a>
<p>To provide more detail around what this process entails, our latest eBook details what FIs can expect at each stage of this trial, the benefits they can look to enjoy working as part of the Framework and answers some frequently asked questions. </p>

<p></p>
 On a Digital Scotland webinar Chris Torres of the <a href="https://tourismmarketing.agency/">Tourism Marketing Agency</a> shared insights on how to leverage Facebook ads to&nbsp;stand out from the crowd. 
 What are the Facebook Ads? 
<p>Facebook ads are paid messages from businesses that are written in their voice and help reach the people who matter most to them. Advertisers create campaigns that have specific goals, which we call advertising objectives and they create ads within those campaigns to help them reach those objectives.</p>
<p>Facebook Advertising is now one of the most effective tools out there to grow your business, create loyal customers, and generate leads and sales. It helps marketers increase visibility for their ads, build brand awareness.</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>In this video Chris will give insights into how a person can make his/her brand stand out from the crowd why a person should change their perspective away from running a tourism business.</p>
<p>Firstly, he starts with customer journey. The three main parts of the journey is usually the dreaming the planning and the booking. The dreaming phase helps with the planning and the purchase and booking. The funnel works through different stages such as –</p>
 
 Brand Awareness Ad 
 Free Value Ad 
 Trust Ad 
 Sales Ad 
 
<p>The purpose of brand awareness ad is to drive targeted traffic to the website and raise brand awareness. The purpose of free value ad is to target people who landed on that landing page and in this instance, they want them to download a free cookbook that this company has created. Another purpose is to offer value in exchange for their email address.</p>
<p>It targets visitors to the website. The purpose of trust ad is to continue value to the customer and build trust in the brand with small videos. It mainly targets the visitors who have downloaded the guide from the website.</p>
<p>The purpose of sale ad is to continue value to the customer and build trust in your brand with a 30 sec video from a guide or carousel image. It targets the visitors who downloaded the guide and past visitors. The overall daily budget for per day is 20-25 pounds.</p>
<p>One of the quick tips to attract audience is to use square images or videos. This helps the ads stand out more. An Irish Tourism company used various technics to attract the American audience to visit a particular spot in Ireland, where a portion of the shooting of Star Wars occurred.</p>
<p>Cool Travel Iceland a tour agency used a video which cost almost $60 to attract the audience. They were pretty successful in this. In the whole campaign it was over a month or two the whole campaigns have produced over 300 leads close to 400 and all from our 30 pounds ads and that’s how an effective video can be made. For Facebook campaign a video can be made without breaking a bank.</p>
<p>The videos are important because it builds the brand reputation, lasting relationships and users actually love to watch them. The 79% of the travellers search for Youtube videos before planning the tour. Consumers process information with videos 60,000 times faster than written form. The videos can be made within budget by using Iphone or GoPro with Karma Grip.</p>
<p>There are many free tools to edit or improve the videos. Creating professional videos for promotion or for attracting audience is very easy in a modern day. To have a successful campaign all the above-mentioned requirements should be fulfilled.</p>

   The history of the ultimate digital disruptor - Napster.

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/category/digital-disruptors/"></a>In the ’90s, it was a great time to be in the music business. Things were booming. And as a result, there were expensive parties, big launches. That was part of the culture. 
<p>This was the era of NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. This was the era where a single hit could sell 10 million albums plus. Artists were just printing money. Artists had the great sales of CDs over that period dwarfing whatever had happened in the industry before. The profits coming in were massive. It was a hell of a lot of fun.</p>
 Birth of the MP3 
<p>We really didn’t foresee the change in the technology. We’ll be telling you tonight about a method of compressing audio data called MP3. And that was the end of everything we know. The birth of the MP3 was a seminal moment for all of media and entertainment. It would completely change the music industry. It opened up people’s minds to what the future would be.</p>
<p>The music industry is not viable. Movies, books, television, nothing creative had any value then. The music industry simply did not embrace the magnitude of the change and it failed. You can’t fight progress. You can’t fight technology. The MP3 totally changed people’s relationship to the internet, to culture, to how society works. It’s a fact that was so much bigger than just the music industry.</p>
<p>The story of the MP3 really begins in West Germany back then in the early ’80s and even late ’70s. People started trying to compress music. Dieter Seitzer was a visionary who came up with the MP3. He was seeing the original digitization of music with a compact disc and thinking, instead of manufacturing millions upon millions of plastic discs, why don’t we store all the data in one centralized computer and then stream it to people in their homes. So, he applied for a patent to use the phone system to transmit music. In 1982, that’s when they had this idea. But they had a huge problem.</p>
<p>The compact disc took about a million bytes of information to store one second of audio. And the pipe they were trying to send it through, the telephone, could only do about 128,000 bytes. For this to work, they somehow had to magically shrink the size of the compact disc by 90% or more. The patent examiner looked at it and said, “No, it’s not possible.” Essentially, almost everyone thought this was impossible.</p>
<p>There’s no way to do this. But around 1987 or 1988, Dieter Seitzer’s brilliant graduate student, Brandenburg, made a breakthrough by taking advantage of this sort of obscure academic discipline – Psychoacoustics (the study of how the ear perceives sound).</p>
 The Era of Peer to Peer 
<p>By 1998, the pirates found out that music can be listened free of cost in computer. Dan Tsurif was the early mp3 pirate. He was the founder of mp3 piracy group known as ‘Audiopunks’. This group specialized in everything from punk rock, to ska, to hardcore and heavy metal. They had downloaders from Indonesia, Japan, or Russia and many more countries. People were downloading from his group. This wasn’t called piracy in that time but rather it was file sharing</p>
<p>The latest advance, called MP3, comes via the internet. It was the future of music and audio. There were millions of people out there who not only understand what digital downloading technology is about, but who use it daily to great personal advantage. There wasn’t any panic in the industry in the early days.</p>
<p>Some people took this thread as an opportunity. People used to call it the celestial jukebox. Celestial jukebox was a theoretical construct at the time. Every song ever made was going to be in the cloud ,and would be instantaneously available to anyone on the planet simply by pressing a button on your gizmo. But the industry really did not embrace that opportunity.</p>
<p>But there was an awareness that the digital revolution was coming and anybody who was in a senior position had to say how do we make this work for us? They began trying to find a way to legitimately sell music on the internet. ‘What systems do we develop? How do we deal with how we sell it? How do you price it?’ these questions were in the mind of music company owner. Sony Music said they will the first major recording company to sell new releases through the internet. These virtual singles will be released at the same time as CDs go into the stores.</p>
<p>When the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) came, it changed everything. In 1999, observing the file sharing system as good, Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker created Napster.</p>
<p>Now at the time, there were all these MP3 files being created, but there was no sort of central index where people could go download them easily. Shawn Fanning thought of creating a technology that could connect peer to peer server and could download music. Parker’s role was essentially the face of the organization. Fanning wrote the code. Fanning kind of did all the technical and computer side stuff. He wrote all the codes.</p>
<p>If you typed any artist’s song in the Napster, you will get the song instantly. It was by far the fastest way to download music from the internet. It allows anyone to copy thousands of musical selections for free. And it’s spread so quickly that it’s clogging computer networks on hundreds of campuses. So, this became hugely popular overnight basically. It was really one of the first viral apps.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/category/technology-futures/"></a>One of the most profound visions for our technology future is ‘the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">Metaverse</a>‘. 
<p>This is explained by Marko Balabanovic in his article <a href="https://medium.com/digital-catapult/who-will-own-the-metaverse-48c2912d7aae">Who Will Own the Metaverse</a>:</p>
<p>“a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet”.</p>
<p>Marko explores the background, industry applications and technology stack that makes up this exciting evolution.</p>
<p>It’s also called the ‘<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/18/the-ar-cloud-will-infuse-meaning-into-every-object-in-the-real-world/">AR Cloud</a>‘, “a persistent 3D digital copy of the real world to enable sharing of AR experiences across multiple users and devices” that will ‘infuse meaning into every object in the real world’. VentureBeat offers <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/09/a-primer-on-the-metaverse-the-next-iteration-of-the-internet/">this primer</a>, describing it as the next version of the Internet, with massive implications for every industry such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjwjomAPMlw">movies</a>.</p>
 Human Co-Experience – Building the Metaverse 
<p>Another vision of the Metaverse is shared by David Baszucki, Founder and CEO and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/28/roblox-guide-children-gaming-platform-developer-minecraft-fortnite">Roblox</a>, a popular game creation site where users design and upload their own games as well as play other games in a multiplayer environment.</p>
<p>Speaking at the 2020 <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/rdc-2020-recap/">Roblox Developers Conference</a> David gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G00GlCJc0mU">this presentation</a>. From 16m:20s David shares the ultimate vision of Roblox, to realize the concept of the Metaverse fantasized about for years by the sci-fi community and more recently by the tech industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Roblox team envisage very fun, large-scale participation scenarios, like a medieval battle with 50,000 players attacking a destructible castle. They’re starting to pioneer the first building blocks of this through hosting their town hall meetings virtually on Roblox.</p>
<p>Key technology innovations to simulate the real world include great avatars and the ability to simulate how the real world sounds. For example being able to whisper to the person next to you while you can still hear the loud speaker announcements, what they call ‘spatial audio’.</p>
<p>Another example demonstrating the concept is their&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2020/04/one-world-together-home-virtual-concert/">One World virtual concert</a>, and given the global pandemic it’s likely to prove a hugely popular trend, another great opportunity for their developers.</p>
 Somnium Space 
<p>Another venture pioneering the concept is <a href="https://somniumspace.com/">Somnium Space</a>, an open-source social VR world powered by blockchain and shaped entirely by its users, allowing them to buy digital land where they can build VR homes and buildings.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://vrscout.com/news/somnium-space-social-vr-ethereum-blockchain/">VR Scout reported</a> in Feb 2020 the platform announced the launch of&nbsp;Somnium 2.0, a new update that promises to move us closer to a true&nbsp;Ready Player One&nbsp;virtual experience.</p>
<p>“Imagine standing on the top of the highest mountain inside of a virtual mountain looking down to see thousands of users exploring the world beneath in real-time; unlike a majority of multiplayer VR games where players are divided into sub servers and mirrored instanced rooms, Somnium 2.0 actually hosts all its players in a single massive world.”</p>

 Futuristic technologies like Augmented Reality can be applied in a practical way to boost success for Scottish businesses. Tourism is a great example. 
  Enhancing the experience with these types of exciting innovations will draw in even greater visitor numbers and continue the massive economic success of this industry. 
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/tourist-attractions-are-being-transformed-by-immersive-experiences-some-lessons-from-scotland-110860">This Conversation article</a> comments on the details of this economic success and the critical role immersive experiences can play in facilitating this boost.</p>
<p>Simple examples include&nbsp;AR tourism guides, such as this one for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_RppvB4rDo">Inverness Castle</a>, and for <a href="https://thelochsidepress.com/2019/04/19/augmented-reality-is-a-world-first-for-tourist-guide/">Loch Lomond</a> they inserted ‘Zapcodes’ into the local guide magazine, to trigger AR links that enhance the printed word with a virtual experience.&nbsp;You can <a href="https://www.scotsmagazine.com/articles/discover-fife-augmented-reality/">discover Fife</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FOSIT_cMCk">discover the Highlands via AR</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 Smartify 
<p>Another great example is described in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19241367.castle-first-scottish-landmark-sign-app-tours/">this recent news</a>, about Blair Castle adopting the <a href="https://about.smartify.org/">Smartify</a> app. Via easy-to-use interfaces and well designed technology available as a native and web app, the Smartify guide allows visitors to follow their own interests and curated tours, with additional features such as e-commerce, targeted push notifications and donations.</p>
<p>Other Scottish venues adopting Smartify include the National Galleries of Scotland. The Smartify <a href="https://about.smartify.org/case-studies/national-galleries-of-scotland-ray-harryhausen-exhibition">case study</a> explains how the venue employed the app for their <a href="https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/ray-harryhausen-titan-cinema-virtual-exhibition-experience">Ray Harryhausen exhibition</a>, to offer visitors a fun (and COVID-safe) experience on site, as well as access from home.</p>
<p>With Smartify already used by the museum across the permanent collection, staff were keen to use the platform to deliver an audio tour safely to visitors’ own smartphones without the need for rented devices or touch screens. They also wanted to provide teaser content and came up with the idea of re-animating one of Harryhausen’s famous skeletons from Clash of the Titans in Augmented Reality.</p>
<p>They worked with Scottish animation agency <a href="https://www.playdead.tv/">Playdead</a> to develop an AR animation of the famous skeletons from Clash of the Titans. Visitors on site could scan the original skeleton model and watch it come to life again, while audiences at home could also play with the AR animation.</p>
<p></p>
 Virtual Treasure Hunts 
<p>For more advanced and engaging experience the technology can be combined with features like ‘Gamification’, to enable super fun activities like Virtual Treasure Hunts. As the Conversation article highlights:</p>
<p>“It’s the sort of immersive experience that many tourist attractions want to have these days. At the <a href="http://www.burnsmuseum.org.uk/">Burns Birthplace Museum</a>&nbsp;in Ayrshire, dedicated to Robert Burns, visitors can download an app aimed at children called the&nbsp;<a href="https://digit.fyi/augmented-reality-scottish-attractions/">Mighty Mission Trail</a>. It sends them on a virtual treasure hunt throughout the site and surroundings.”</p>
<p>This highlights the other types of technologies that can be called into play. For example <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/14/google-maps-gaming-platform-expands-after-a-year-of-success-stories/">Google Maps Gaming</a> provides a capability for making more use of location data in mobile games, the Pokemon Go type, that can ‘can unlock augmented reality and social gameplay, can increase engagement and retention, and can help bring new life to games that were originally designed without a location component.’</p>
<p>This is complimented by their general capabilities for improving navigation, such as <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/02/11/google-maps-ar-navigation/">AR Navigation</a> and harnessing AI for <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/using-global-localization-to-improve.html">Global Navigation</a>, helping you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWbY5jdJnHg">better navigate cities</a>.</p>
<p>These various innovations provide the building blocks for creating any type of highly immersive, highly engaging experience, that better enables visitors to explore and enjoy attractions, with the ability to ‘gamify’ the experience of particular value for those looking to attract children and young families.</p>
<p>In general this barely scratches the surface of the staggering scale of opportunity this technology trend offers Scotland. From Oil &amp; Gas through Telemedicine and Digital Tourism, Augmented Reality can enable a myriad of transformative industry solutions, each with valuable local application and also huge global export potential.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>There are so many things about my job that gets me out of bed in th morning. First, I love that I have the opportunity to solve for a trustworthy, informed and transparent way to control our personal information. We need a simple digital identity in so many facets of our digital lives and it’s sorely lacking. Second, I love knowing that I’m contributing to a safer digital future for my children and the next generation. Finally, and most importantly, I love the people I get to share the experience with – the team at IDENTOS, our customers and the identity community continues to humble me.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Hmm. Hard to say. Where am I today? I am a daughter, a sister, a mom, a tech professional and very grateful for it all. I don’t know how I got here since most of this was likely already planned before my time… but for the moments I had the opportunity to make a choice, I would say that I’ve arrived here thanks to having trust in myself and others who wanted the best for me.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The most important lesson is to really take stock of the people we interact with, especially the people who share in the same vision and are doing their best to create a better future. The more human and connected we are, the better our solutions will be.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>Keeping this focused on identity, I’d say:</p>
 
 START joining other innovators in your community and offer to work on complementary identity projects 
 STOP asking for input from the same groups or people. Surround yourself with different voices and perspectives. 
 CONTINUE bringing your best in identity solutions to build a privacy-respecting, sustainable digital future for citizens, patients, students, parents, children, et al. 
 
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<blockquote><p>Solutions will fall flat unless we can recognize our blind spots.</p></blockquote>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>In a field that is dreaming up the future, it probably comes as no surprise that I like to spend a lot of time with movies that have done the same. Aside from diversity, Sci-fi movies also have the power to offer different perspectives. Flicks like Gattaca, Ai, Hunger Games, Battlestar Galactica, West World all have an identity component in the plot that’s interesting to observe. I love the impact it has on the characters’ quality of life, not to mention the freedoms and liberties of some.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>As a teenager, I was full of big dreams and wanted to fulfill them all. Personally, this caused a lot of stress, and after a while it also didn’t leave a lot of room for connecting with the people and things I cared most for. If I had the opportunity, I’d tell my teenage self:&nbsp; “Continue to dream big and have a compass, but don’t be so hard on yourself. Instead, do your best with what you have while giving yourself space to do the things you find most fulfilling.”</p>

 Sovrin releases two new Guardianship Credentials papers at Internet Identity Workshop&nbsp;#32 <p>In December 2019 the Sovrin Guardianship Task Force released a whitepaper titled “<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Guardianship-Whitepaper2.pdf">On Guardianship in Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.” This groundbreaking paper explored guardianship in the context of SSI, and provided two use cases: one for a refugee, Mya, and one for an elderly living with dementia, Jamie. (Watch the video illustration of these two use cases at the end of this article.)</p><p>Recognising the need to develop the work beyond the whitepaper, the Sovrin Foundation chartered a <a href="https://guardianshipwg.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GWG/overview?homepageId=229378">Sovrin Guardianship Working Group</a> (SGWG) in December 2019. Two key documents were identified as outputs for the working group: a Technical Requirements for Guardianship and Implementation Guidelines. After more than a year of hard work, the two papers were completed and will be publicly presented and released at the Sovrin’s breakout session at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) #32 during April 20–22,&nbsp;2021.</p><blockquote>“When we started the work on defining technical requirements for guardianship in early 2020, we viewed the task as relatively simple. ‘All’ we had to do was extract the guardianship requirements from the use cases in the previous whitepaper… It turned out that this view was optimistic,” said John Phillips, one of the authors and Chairs of SGWG in Asia Pacific. “We found that the gap between the two use cases in the whitepaper and technical requirements was too broad. So we realised we needed to revisit our thinking. We needed a conceptual bridge, a ‘mental model’ to understand Guardianship broadly so we could write appropriately narrow technical requirements. The lesson we have (re)learnt in our journey is that, before you can describe something in simple terms, you need to make sure you have a broad and deep enough understanding of the&nbsp;topic.”</blockquote><p>The first paper is called the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vBePVx8n3MRDWcePkwVDya9ab4BHEyU_/view?usp=sharing">Guardianship Credentials Implementation Guidelines</a> and its purpose is to provide readers with the background they need to implement IT systems that support various kinds of guardianship. In particular, it focuses on what they need to know when using Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised Identifiers, the building blocks of a SSI framework within the frameworks of <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/">Sovrin Governance</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a>&nbsp;(ToIP).</p><p>This paper is intended for all people interested in the design, build and operation of a Guardianship implementation using an SSI framework. It outlines the conceptual framework for Guardianship and provides implementation guidelines. The document introduces and uses a mental model to help understand the interplay and relationships of the key entities and actors involved in the establishment, running and ending of a Guardianship Arrangement.</p><p>While this document provides background explanations of the thinking that led to the technical requirements guidelines, it does not mandate or warrant specific rules for the implementation of Guardianship as these should be Jurisdiction specific, which is defined by the mental model in the document.</p><p>The second paper is called <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M21PznPAd0H6z1t4ODl-jiEoXZjEhwcb/view?usp=sharing">Guardianship Credentials Technical Requirements</a> which was developed by the technical requirements working group within the SGWG. The purpose of this document is twofold: i) provide principles under which guardianship scenario designs and requirements are considered and defined; and ii) provide technical requirements for SSI solutions that offer the capability of guardianship.</p><p>The intended audience for this document includes: i) individuals looking to understand how guardianship should be implemented for their use case; ii) SSI solution designers that require guardianship to support the use of VCs in their specific use case; iii) readers who want to understand how Guardianship can work in an SSI&nbsp;context.</p><p>The requirements described in this paper, together with other SSI standardization, describe when an SSI solution offers the capability of guardianship. In this case, the requirements are mainly for the technical building blocks that live in the bottom three layers of the Technical “Stack” of the Sovrin/ToIP framework. The mental model, however, is also relevant for the top layer (ecosystem), as guardianship is intricately linked to what we will be defining as Jurisdictions, and this enables human governance to be applied to the first three&nbsp;layers.</p><p>This document should be read in conjunction with the Sovrin Guardianship Credentials Implementation Guidelines mentioned above. In particular, readers who are looking to understand the thinking behind these requirements are encouraged to refer to the Implementation Guidelines.</p><p>These two papers are the first public release of implementation guidelines and technical requirements for guardianship in the context of SSI. There are sections at the end of the documents that propose areas of future work, and it is expected that these two documents will be updated as technology evolves and open discussion and decision areas are resolved.</p><p>Download the two papers&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QivpMOIYu0ry-LMfyh5b2pU7eG_SjimJ?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>Sovrin Guardianship Use Case #1— Mya (a refugee&nbsp;girl)</p><p>Sovrin Guardianship Use Case #2 — Jamie (an elderly living with dementia)</p><p>Video credit: John&nbsp;Phillips</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://sovrin.org/a-deeper-understanding-of-implementing-guardianship/">https://sovrin.org</a> on April 22,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>This all-volunteer Sovrin Guardianship Working Group is open to anyone with a genuine interest in and willingness to contribute to digital guardianship.

<p>The first Earth Day — held April 22, 1970 — is considered the birth of the modern environmental movement. More than half a century later, it has taken on renewed focus amidst the climate crisis. Here at Energy Web, we are developing open-source digital infrastructure to accelerate the low-carbon energy transition and expand access to clean energy markets for all. Here are five specific ways we — the Energy Web team, Energy Web members, and the broader Energy Web ecosystem — are working together to speed global decarbonization.</p> 1. Supporting flexibility markets, making it possible for DERs to help balance renewable grids <p>Distributed energy resources (DERs) — from batteries and electric vehicles to “behind the meter’ devices like smart thermostats — are fast becoming crucial components of increasingly decentralized and dynamic power grids that are running on growing amounts of renewable energy. Such DERs can play a valuable role providing grid services, such as helping to balance supply and demand in flexibility markets. Thus we believe it is essential to make it easy for DERs to enroll, participate, and get compensation for delivered grid services. This is why we built and keep advancing <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-flex/">Energy Web Flex</a> as a software development toolkit that grid operators <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/austrian-power-grid-and-energy-web-foundation-launch-proof-of-concept-to-use-distributed-energy-d9a378f5f5ee">like Austrian Power Grid</a> can use to tap into the full potential of DERs at the lowest administrative cost possible.</p> 2. Digitizing renewable energy markets, making it faster and easier to source renewables <p>We are building open-source tools to help buyers more easily achieve their proof-of-impact needs and companies around the globe launch user-friendly, digitized renewable energy market platforms. For example, <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Energy Web Origin</a> is a software development toolkit we built and continue advancing that digitizes the entire energy attribute certificate lifecycle — from certificate issuance to trading and cancellations/claims — for any clean energy market. We are also working directly with various companies around the world to help them use EW Origin to launch their own digitized renewable energy marketplace platforms across Asia, Europe, and the Americas. In addition, Energy Web is developing <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, a renewable energy search-and-match engine that helps buyers discover all available renewable energy products and make direct purchases from platforms (like those built with EW Origin). Think Skyscanner or Kayak.com meets renewable energy&nbsp;markets.</p> 3. Enabling lifecycle asset tracking, such as batteries, as part of a circular green&nbsp;economy <p>We know that it is important to understand and track the environmental impacts of all energy devices — from batteries to solar panels and wind turbines — from cradle to grave. This lifecycle tracking is also part of major legislation such as the European Green Deal, not to mention major movements such as the circular economy. Energy Web is leveraging our tech stack and developing tools that companies are using to bring solutions to the market, such as <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/bebat-launches-easybat-an-open-source-decentralized-solution-for-battery-lifecycle-management-281f2ace61e9">our work with BeBat and Fluvius in Belgium to support EasyBat</a>. EasyBat makes it possible to holistically manage customer-owned batteries (both private &amp; professional use) participating in Belgian electricity markets, including legal takeback obligations and/or extended producers responsibility (EPR) of battery manufacturers.</p> 4. Advancing the Crypto Climate Accord to decarbonize an entire&nbsp;sector <p>We spearheaded the Crypto Climate Accord (CCA) earlier this month in partnership with RMI and the Alliance for Innovative Regulation (AIR) to decarbonize the global crypto and blockchain industry. We are excited to drive it forward with a fast-growing community of <a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoClimAcc/crypto-climate-accord-adds-over-a-dozen-new-supporters-in-two-weeks-since-launch-52dccc7c10a2">now 40 CCA Supporters</a>. More importantly, we have already started identifying, defining, and developing a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/making-crypto-green-with-energy-web-zero-301cf4a979e5">fast-emerging suite of open-source solutions</a> to help decarbonize crypto. If your company can help us advance solutions in this area, we encourage you to become a CCA Supporter. For more frequent updates on progress related to the CCA, check out the new <a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoClimAcc">CCA&nbsp;Medium</a>.</p> 5. Fostering interoperability of digital twins across tech and&nbsp;markets <p>Historically, power grids and electricity markets — and the technologies used to run them — were heavily fragmented and siloed. Important was locked away in proprietary systems. Customer enrollment in various utility programs, such as selling surplus solar energy to a grid operator or participating in a demand response program, was cumbersome and duplicative. Even worse, customer devices in some cases were prohibited from providing services in certain electricity markets, even if they technologically were able to do so. But those metaphorical walls are coming down, with new regulations such as <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ferc-order-2222-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity-for-decentralized-technologies-to-accelerate-the-c35cf41527cb">FERC Order 2222 in the United States</a> and a focus on customer-centric market design in the EU. The key to unlocking this new potential is with digital twins and ‘passports’ anchored to the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.</p><p>This is just a snapshot of all the leading-edge work happening at Energy Web and among our global member community.

  <p>Significant advances are taking place right now in China relative to LEI adoption. Regulatory authorities within the region are proactively driving LEI usage and have set ambitious plans for substantial near-term increases in LEI volume. </p>
<p>For those who missed it, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) published an LEI implementation roadmap at the end of 2020, which looks ahead to 2022. This roadmap is part of the ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative, which is described in the following way on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative">Wikipedia</a>: ‘[…] incorporated into the Constitution of China in 2017. The Chinese government calls the initiative "a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future."’ The roadmap unveils national plans to increase LEI issuance by a minimum of 170% between the end of 2020 (there were 37,000 active LEIs) and the end of 2022 (the target is a minimum LEI volume of 100,000). </p>
<p>In a separate but complementary development, just this month GLEIF has welcomed the news that the Chinese Financial Certification Authority (CFCA) has launched the first commercial demo of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. CFCA has simultaneously become the first Certification Authority to assume a Validation Agent role within the Global LEI System. This innovation from CFCA shows a further commitment from the Chinese market, this time to facilitating and promoting LEI issuance in digital certificates. It is hoped that CFCA’s early mover status on this front will act as a catalyst for other similar demos to emerge. </p>
<p>The combined sum of these two initiatives is significant. It shows an advanced level of proactivity from regulatory authorities within the region, which is driving LEI issuance to support financial services and banking ecosystems, simplify international trade and enhance digital identity across the region. </p>
<p>Understandably, GLEIF advocates these steps being taken to advance LEI adoption across China and applauds the foresight and proactivity of regulators. A commitment to boosting LEI issuance across such a vast region, will not only deliver benefits to Chinese market participants, but has the potential to motivate regulators across other countries and regions to follow suit. GLEIF certainly hopes that this is the case. </p>
<p>A more detailed summary of each initiative is given below.</p>
<p>China’s LEI Implementation Roadmap: 2020-2022</p>
<p>In Q4 2020, four financial regulators in China released a report detailing a roadmap for LEI implementation. The four organizations involved were: PBOC, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). </p>
<p>The report, which is published in Chinese on the PBOC <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4142052/index.html">website</a>, outlines the general objective of the roadmap and details key LEI implementation milestones over the next two years. </p>
<p>As stated in a Regulation Asia <a href="https://www.regulationasia.com/pboc-publishes-roadmap-for-full-lei-adoption-in-china/">article</a>,  the intention of wide LEI implementation in China is to help the country connect with the international market, support China’s bid to open up its financial sector, and facilitate cross-border trade and financial transactions.</p>
<p>In line with a translation from the report on the PBOC website, GLEIF understands that the general objective of the roadmap is to establish a comprehensive LEI usage policy system across China’s financial system in line with international standards by the end of 2022. It envisions that the LEI will become an assisting tool for financial management authorities to maintain financial stability and implement financial supervision. It will become an important means for financial infrastructure, financial industry associations and financial institutions to carry out customer identification of legal persons involved in cross-border transactions. It will also become a corporate passport.  </p>
<p>This is in line with the PBOC’s role as a member of the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC). The ROC aims to promote the broad public interests to improve the quality of data used in financial data reporting, improving the ability to monitor financial risk, and lowering regulatory reporting costs through the harmonization of these standards across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>A number of phase objectives are then outlined for Chinese authorities: </p>
 
 By end of 2020: total LEI volume in China mainland to reach 30,000, covering all financial institutions, member institutions of financial infrastructure and industry associations, and listed companies in China. Proposed LEI application rules in scenarios such as RMB cross-border payments, digital RMB cross-border business, qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) and RMB qualified foreign institutional investor (RQFII) access, derivatives trading, securities trading, and listed company supervision. Establish a mechanism for mapping and updating LEI with the codes of financial institutions, unified social credit codes, and codes of information systems related to major financial infrastructure. 
 By end of 2021: total LEI volume in China mainland reaches 50,000, with a focus on improving coverage among importers and exporters, trading enterprises, and non-financial enterprises involved in cross-border transactions. Proposed LEI application rules in areas such as the financial market transaction reporting system, credit rating, and application of special institutional codes by overseas institutions. Launch and operate the cross-border legal person information service and digital authentication platform to provide value-added LEI-based data services to financial management departments, financial infrastructure, financial industry associations and financial institutions. 
 By end of 2022: total LEI volume in China mainland reaches 100,000. Continued improvements in coverage among non-financial enterprises involved in cross-border transactions. Use LEI in scenarios such as digital identification of cross-border legal persons. Establish a mechanism for commercially sustainable operation of LEI.   
 
<p><br>
CFCA Paves the Way for Increased LEI Usage in Mass Market Digital Identity Products </p>
<p>CFCA has launched the first commercial demonstration of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. It has also become the first Certification Authority to act as a Validation Agent in the Global LEI System, streamlining LEI issuance with digital ID product and service provision.</p>
<p>These developments by CFCA follow the recent launch of the GLEIF CA Stakeholder Group, created as a platform for GLEIF to collaborate with CAs and Trust Service Providers (TSPs) on the coordination and promotion of a global approach to LEI usage across digital identity products. CFCA’s advances are significant because they are the earliest reported successes aligned to the direction of this industry initiative, which is aimed at achieving a critical mass of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. </p>
<p>Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF comments: “This progress by CFCA on both fronts is very welcome as it moves us one step closer to broad LEI usage in digital certificates globally. Realizing the goal of universal LEI usage in digital identity products will be an important step in enhancing trust and creating innovation opportunities across private sector digital identity management applications. Digital certificates linked by an LEI to verified, regularly updated and freely available entity reference data held within the Global LEI System are easier to manage, aggregate and maintain. The result will be significant efficiencies and far less complexity for certificate owners and the provision of greater transparency for all users of the internet and participants within digital exchanges.” </p>

<br></p>
<p>The ‘LEI Lightbulb Blog Series’ from GLEIF aims to shine a light on the breadth of acceptance and advocacy for the LEI across the public and private sectors, geographies and use cases by highlighting which industry leaders, authorities and organizations are supportive of the LEI and for what purpose. By demonstrating how success derived from strong regulatory roots is giving rise to a ground swell of champions for further LEI regulation and voluntary LEI adoption across new and emerging applications, GLEIF hopes to educate on both the current and future potential value that ‘one global identity’ can deliver for businesses, regardless of sector, world-wide.</p>

<p>Eleven months after Derek Chauvin stole George Floyd’s final breaths, jurors took less than 11 hours to find Chauvin guilty on all three counts. The jury’s verdict shows that sometimes — but too rarely — justice can prevail, and it is very welcome, given the long history of acquittals that come before&nbsp;it.</p><p>It does not, however, bring George Floyd back to life, nor the dozens of other unarmed Black and Brown people who have been killed by the police since May 25, 2020. Since the trial began, police have killed at least 64 people, more than half of whom were Black or Latinx. Just 10 miles from the courthouse, Daunte Wright was shot dead, and across the Great Lakes in Chicago, police took the life of 13-year-old Adam Toledo in&nbsp;Chicago.</p><p>So, while we can briefly exhale today, we know there is so much work that remains to be done to build toward a more just system overall, so that outcomes like today’s are less exceptional.</p><p>Listening to the testimony during the trial reopened painful wounds that have been inflicted relentlessly since our country was founded and reflects the continued need for deep systemic change in our society. We know it won’t happen overnight, nor clearly in just one year, but it must happen. As George Floyd’s girlfriend, Courteney Ross, said, “Floyd was one man. George Floyd is a movement.”</p><p>And at Omidyar Network, while criminal justice reform is not one of our focus areas, there is a close link between economic injustice and racial violence. And between those two areas and true democracy. We know we will not bring about the kind of world we aspire to unless and until Black people are no longer trapped by systems that were intentionally created to lock them into poverty and strip them of voice and opportunity.</p><p>Last summer, we once again began a national racial justice reckoning, we looked deeply at our own systems and policies. We committed to become an anti-racist organization, and while we know we still have quite a long journey, we have taken the first of many steps. We gave more than $1 million to organizations fighting to protect and advance Black lives and another $4 million to organizations looking to reimagine our economy through a racial justice lens. Again, these are the first of many steps we are taking to live up to our commitment and we know there is so much more we can and must do until Black Lives&nbsp;Matter.</p><p>As Ibram X. Kendi wrote in How to Be Anti-Racist, “After taking this grueling journey to the dirt road of anti-racism, humanity can come upon the clearing of a potential future: an antiracist world in all its imperfect beauty. It can become real if we focus on power instead of people, if we focus on changing policy instead of groups of people. It’s possible if we overcome our cynicism about the permanence of&nbsp;racism.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/statement-from-omidyar-network-on-derek-chauvin-verdict-the-first-step-to-justice-f28ec7673805">Statement from Omidyar Network on Derek Chauvin Verdict: The First Step to Justice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As we continue our pandemic journey that is 2021, more and more people are getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Once vaccinated, people are (finally!) able to do more “in the real world.” However, in some cases such as international travel, there is a need to prove that you have been vaccinated before you can participate. In the past, that proof has been accomplished in the form of the paper World Health Organization Carte Jaune/Yellow Card. But in our 21st century pandemic, a handwritten paper document is not particularly trusted. It’s just too easy to buy or make your own. The sudden, urgent need to be able to prove health information in a safe, privacy-preserving and secure way has brought the spotlight on the concept of verifiable credentials and, for Hyperledger, on the three identity-focused projects in the community, Indy (a distributed ledger for identity), Aries (data exchange protocols and implementations of agents for people, organizations and things), and Ursa (a cryptographic library underlying Indy and Aries).</p>



<p>While people understand that paper credentials are insufficient and that a trusted digital solution is needed, they don’t understand why verifiable credentials, or more generally, identity, works extremely well with distributed ledger technology (DLT)—a distributed database spread across multiple nodes, of which blockchain is an example. To be clear from the start, it is not to put the credentials on a public ledger so everyone can see them! We’ll reiterate that a lot in this post. No private data ever goes on the blockchain!!!</p>



<p>To understand why DLT is useful for identity, we need to go back to the basics—paper credentials, how that model has worked for 1000s of years, and how the use of DLTs with verifiable credentials allows us to transition the great parts—security and privacy—of that model to the digital age.</p>
<p><br>Since as far back as 450BC, people have used paper credentials to enable trusted identity. Legend has it that King Artixerxes of the Persian Empire signed and gave Nehemiah a paper “safe transit” authorization that he used in travels across the empire. People have been using such documents ever since. In technical terms, a credential is an attestation of qualification, competence, or authority issued to an entity (e.g., an individual or organization) by a third party with a relevant or de facto authority or assumed competence to do so. Examples of credentials issued to people include a driver’s license, a passport, an academic degree, proof-of-vaccination and so on. Credentials are also issued to companies, such as business registrations, building permits, and even health inspection certifications.</p>
<p>



</p>


<p>Examples of Paper Credentials<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a></p>

A typical paper credential, say a driver’s license, is issued by a government authority (an issuer) after you prove to them who you are (usually in person using your passport or birth certificate) and that you are qualified to drive. You then hold this credential (usually in your wallet) and can use it elsewhere whenever you want—for example, to rent a car, to open a bank account or in a bar to show that you are old enough to drink. When you do that, you’re proving (or presenting) the credential to the verifier. The verifier inspects the physical document to decide if it is valid for the business purpose at hand. Note that in verifying the paper credential, the verifier does not call the issuer of the document. The transaction is only between the holder and the verifier. Further, it is the holder’s choice whether they want to share the piece of paper. If they want, they can keep it to themselves.

<p>The Paper Credential Model<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a></p>
<p>Verification in the paper credential model (ideally) proves:</p>
<p>



</p>
 
 Who issued the credential.&nbsp; 
 That the credential was issued to the entity presenting it. 
 That the claims have not been altered. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>The caveat “ideally” is included because of the real possibility of forgery in the use of paper credentials. Back to our “proof-of-vaccination” problem.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the good parts of the paper credential model are retained in the verifiable credentials model. With verifiable credentials:</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>



</p>
 
 An authority decides you are eligible to receive a credential and issues you one. 
 You hold your credential in your (digital) wallet—it does not go on the distributed ledger! 
 At some point, a verifier asks you to prove the claims from one or more credentials. 
 If you decide to share your data with the verifier, you provide a verifiable presentation to the verifier, proving the same three things as with the paper credentials. 
 Plus: You may be able to prove one more thing—that the issued credentials have not been revoked. 
 
<p>As we’ll see, verifiable credentials and presentations are not simple documents that anyone can create. They are cryptographically constructed so that a presentation of the claims within a credential proves four attributes:</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Who issued the credential–their identifier is part of the credential and they signed the credential.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Who holds the credential–there is a cryptographic binding to the prover. 
 The claims have not been altered–they were signed at the time of issuance. 
 The credential has not been revoked. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>Unlike a paper credential, those four attributes are evaluated not based on the judgment and expertise of the person looking at the credential, but rather by machine using cryptographic algorithms that are extremely difficult to forge. Like the paper credential, the verifier does not go back to the issuer to ask about the credential being presented. Only the prover and verifier, the participants in the interaction, need to know about the presentation. So where do the prover and verifier get the information they need for their transaction? We’re just getting to that…</p>
<p>



</p>
<p><br>The Verifiable Credentials Model<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Compared to the paper credentials model, verifiable credentials are far more secure. When the cryptographic verification succeeds, the verifier can be certain of the validity of the data—those four attributes stemming from verifying the presentation. They are left only with the same question that paper credentials have—do I trust the issuer enough</p>
<p>So where does the DLT fit in?</p>
<p>Three of the four things that the verifier has to prove (listed above) involves published data from the issuer that has to be available in some trusted, public distributed place, a place that is not controlled by a central authority (hmm…sounds like a DLT!). In Indy and Aries, data published to a DLT is used to verify the credential without having to check with the issuer. In particular:</p>
 
 The verifier has to know who issued the credential based on an identifier and cryptographic signature. From the presentation, it gets an identifier for the issuer, looks it up on a DLT to get a public key associated with the issuer to verify the signature in the presentation. Thus, the identity of the issuer is known. 
 The verifier has to verify that the claims data has not been altered by verifying a cryptographic signature across the data. Based on an identifier for the type of credential, the verifier gets from a DLT a set of public keys and verifies the signatures. Thus, the verifier knows no one has tampered with the claims data. 
 The issuer periodically updates a revocation registry on a DLT indicating the credentials that have been revoked. If the holder’s credential is revoked, they are unable to create a proof of non-revocation (yes, that’s a double negative…). If the holder can generate that proof, the verifier can check it. Thus, the verifier knows the credential has not been revoked. 
 
<p>

<p>The fourth attribute (the binding of the credential to the holder) in Indy is done using some privacy-preserving cryptographic magic (called a Zero Knowledge Proof) that prevents having a unique identifier for the holder or credential being given to the verifier. Thus, no PII is needed for sharing trusted data.</p>
<p>So why DLT? First, we can get the good parts of paper credentials—private transactions between holders and verifiers and no callback to the issuer. Second, the issuer gets a trusted, open and transparent way to publish the cryptographic material needed for those private holder-verifier transactions. Third, there is no need to have a “Trusted Third Party” participating in the interactions.</p>
<p>And did I mention, no private data goes on the DLT!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa are enabling this approach to “self-sovereign identity” in a big way,&nbsp; bringing about a new layer of trust on the Internet that will let us preserve our privacy and give us control over our identity and data—where it belongs. There is a lot to learn. If you’re curious, a great place to start is this <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-hyperledger-sovereign-identity-blockchain-solutions-indy-aries-and-ursa">Linux Foundation edX course</a>.</p>

<p>This is my first newsletter as the new Executive Director for DINZ and the very first thing I’d like to do is thank Andrew Weaver, our outgoing ED, for his tremendous leadership throughout our establishment phase and to wish him all the very, very best on the next stage of his journey. Andrew has worked tirelessly over the last two and a half years to ensure we are working towards a world where people can safely express their identity to fully participate in the digital economy and society overall.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Good luck Andrew and all the best.

<p>The DIF Steering Committee has approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, “v1” so to speak. Here is a snapshot of the four companies and four implementations that stretched and built the specification.</p> Scalable, Flexible Infrastructure for Decentralized Identity <p>This week, the DIF Steering Committee officially approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, “v1” so to speak. This protocol has already been implemented, and four of its implementers have been collaborating intensively for over a year on expanding and extending this specification together.</p> What exactly is a “Sidetree”? <p>Sidetree is a protocol that extends “decentralized identifiers” (DIDs), one of the core building blocks of decentralized identity. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) enable a person or entity to securely and directly “anchor” their data-sharing activities to a shared ledger, secured by cryptography. The first generation of DID systems accomplished this with a 1-to-1 relationship between “blockchain addresses” (cryptographic identities) and the more flexible, powerful addresses called DIDs. These latter functioned as privacy-preserving extensions of the blockchain addresses to which they were closely coupled. In this way, each DID effortlessly inherited the formidable security guarantees of those blockchains — but in many cases, they also inherited scalability problems and economic models that were a bad fit for many DID use-cases.</p><p>Sidetree is a systematic, carefully-engineered protocol that loosens that coupling between anchor-points on a distributed data system (usually a blockchain) and the DID networks anchored to them. Crucially, it replaces the 1-to-1 relationship with a 1-to-many relationship, pooling resources and security guarantees. Depending on the use-case and implementation strategies chosen, the protocol can optimize for scalable performance, for developer-friendly ergonomics and SDKs, for the portability of DIDs and networks of DIDs across multiple anchoring systems, and even for high-availability in low-connectivity contexts where a global blockchain cannot be relied upon directly.</p><p>The name “sidetree” combines two hints as to its early technical inspirations and superpowers. Each Sidetree network functions as a kind of identity-specific “Layer 2” overlay network where participating nodes root aggregated operational data into transactions of the underlying chain. This mechanism has many high-level conceptual similarities with the “sidechains” of other “Layer 2” systems, such as the Lightning network running atop Bitcoin or state channel implementations on Ethereum. It also shares with merkle “trees” (and <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/#further-resources">DAGs</a> like IPFS) the self-certifying property of content-addressability, a core building block of decentralized and distributed systems.</p><p>Leveraging concepts from sidechains and “Layer 2” network protocols, Sidetree was first <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/blob/master/sidetrees/explainer.md">proposed</a> by Microsoft’s Daniel Buchner and has been incubated in the DIF community, evolving along the way with major contributions from a growing list of DIF&nbsp;members.</p> The team that delivered the specification <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ownyouridentity">Microsoft</a> (Redmond, WA,&nbsp;USA)<p>A global consumer and enterprise app, service, hardware, and cloud infrastructure provider whose mission is to empower every person to achieve more. Microsoft is proud to have worked on Sidetree and implemented the Sidetree protocol via its contributions to ION. As a key piece of infrastructure that is foundational to its Decentralized Identity work, Microsoft is committed to the continued development of Sidetree and ION in&nbsp;DIF.</p><a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> (Toronto, ON,&nbsp;Canada)<p>SecureKey is a leading digital identity and authentication provider, and is a champion of the ecosystem approach to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, revolutionizing the way consumers and organizations approach identity and attribute sharing in the digital age. This ecosystem-first philosophy informs our investment in Sidetree as a protocol for extensibility and scalability, which can evolve its featureset, and its network model over time. Of particular technological interest to us is how Sidetree can be overlaid on a wide variety of ledger and propagation systems. This will enable identity systems that span many use cases and work across public blockchains, federation and witness protocols, and permissioned blockchains without being locked to any particular ledger technology.</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute Industries</a> (Austin, TX,&nbsp;USA)<p>Transmute uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to secure critical trade data by digitizing key trade documents so that they’re traceable and verifiable anywhere in the world, easily accessible and selectively shareable, searchable and auditable, and impossible to forge or alter. Transmute contributed to Sidetree’s development because it leverages batch processing capabilities to achieve enterprise scale and retains maximum optionality for our customers, allowing their business to span many blockchains and trust frameworks. Transmute sees Sidetree-based networks as necessary for scaling up decentralized identity capabilities to a global enterprise scale, where thousands of verifiable transactions per second can be processed at an unbeatable price.</p><a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR Global</a> (Auckland, New&nbsp;Zealand)<p>Mattr works with communities and a growing network of companies to shift industries like digital identity towards a more equitable future, providing tools to support digital inclusion, privacy and end-user control. Sidetree represents a significant leap forward in thinking around how to create truly decentralized infrastructure for resilient identifiers. We welcome the agnostic and extensible approach not just to distributed ledgers but also to content addressable storage and other building-blocks of flexible infrastructure. We look forward to integrating many of the DID systems coming out of the Sidetree standardization effort.</p> The first generation of Sidetree&nbsp;Systems <p>Transmute maintains Sidetree ledger adapters for Ethereum, Amazon QLDB, Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric. We also support interoperability tests with DID Key, the Universal Wallet Interop Spec, the VC HTTP API, and Traceability Vocabulary. Transmute has built Sidetree.js, an implementation of the Sidetree protocol based on the DIF’s codebase that focuses on modularity: it is a Typescript monorepo where each component of a Sidetree node (Ledger, Content Addressable Storage, Cache database) can be substituted with different implementations that use a common interface.</p><p>SecureKey has created a ledger-agnostic <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-core-go">Go implementation</a> of Sidetree along with <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/orb">Orb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> variations built on top. The <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">did:orb</a> method enables independent organizations to create decentralized identifiers that are propagated across a shared decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain. By extending Sidetree into a Fediverse of interconnected registries, Orb provides the foundation for building digital ecosystems on top of decentralized identifiers using a federated, replicated and scalable approach.</p><p>Microsoft is a primary contributor to <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a>, an open source, public, permissionless implementation of Sidetree on the Bitcoin ledger. There are several repositories and public utilities that make working with ION easier, including:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">ION GitHub repo</a>: the main repository for the code that powers ION&nbsp;nodes  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decentralized-identity/ion-tools">ION Tools</a>: JavaScript libraries for Node.js and browser environments that makes using DIDs and interacting with the ION network easier for web developers  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/">ION Install Guide</a>: A step-by-step guide for installing an ION&nbsp;node  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/">ION Explorer</a>: A graphical interface for viewing DIDs and auditing other data transactions published to the public ION&nbsp;network.   What’s next for&nbsp;Sidetree <p>One significant feature on the horizon is to add support for pruning of verbose lineage data (which is no longer needed to maintain the secure backbone of DIDs in a Sidetree implementation) at Sidetree’s anchor points. This addition will allow Sidetree-based networks to purge upwards of 95% of legacy operation data in a decentralized way that maintains all of the security guarantees the protocol currently makes.</p><p>Another near-future feature is the so-called “DID Type Table.” DIDs in various DID Method implementations may be typed to provide an indication as to what they DID might represent. The Sidetree WG will publish a table of types (not including human-centric types) that stand for organizations, machines, code packages, etc., which DID creators can use if they want to tag a DID with a given&nbsp;type.</p><p>The medium-term roadmap is up for discussion, so if you have ideas <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">get involved</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1-9b565cf92db3">Sidetree Protocol reaches V1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      <p>The structural properties of object capability systems favor modularity in code design and ensure reliable encapsulation in code implementation.</p>

      <p>These structural properties facilitate the analysis of some security properties of an object-capability program or operating system. Some of these – in particular, information flow properties – can be analyzed at the level of object references and connectivity, independent of any knowledge or analysis of the code that determines the behavior of the objects. As a consequence, these security properties can be established and maintained in the presence of new objects that contain unknown and possibly malicious code.</p>

      <p>The capability model is, in a sense, the object model taken to its logical extreme. Where object programmers seek modularity – a decrease in the dependencies between separately thought-out units – capability programmers seek security, recognizing that required trust is a form of dependency. Object programmers wish to guard against bugs: a bug in module A should not propagate to module B. Capability programmers wish to guard against malice. However, if B is designed to be invulnerable to A’s malice, it is likely also invulnerable to A’s bugs.</p>

ZCAP-LD supports delegating authority to other entities on the network by chaining together capability documents. “Caveats” may be attached to capability documents which may be used to restrict the scope of their use, for example to restrict the actions which may be used or providing a mechanism by which the capability may be later revoked.</p>

         A stronger implementation of object capabilities involves a digital certificate issued by a public key, for a resource with a set of supported methods:<br>
<code>Issuer: AlicePubKey</code><br>
<code>Resource: did:dad:0x123</code><br>
<code>Actions: Read,Write</code><br>
<code>Signature: 0x456</code>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Object capabilities (ocaps) are increasingly recognized as an important tool for achieving the goals of self-sovereign identity. Many of the principles of self-sovereign identity, such as minimization and protection, can best be achieved through the disciplined pursuit of the principle of least authority that ocaps enable. This paper examines how POLA can be extended to better protect users when exercising their self-sovereign identity.</p>

      <p>Considering different models for handling identity information allows reconciliation, and creates opportunities to address primary use cases across paradigms, increasing overall strength and security of a solution.<br>
[…]<br>
In the Object Capabilities model, authorization is managed by creating, sharing, attenuating, and using “capabilities” instead of, for example, access control lists. If you have a valid “capability”, you have the authorization. Like a car key, Object Capabilities may be used no matter who you are. This model shifts the burden of identification from error-prone correlations to directly work with individuals’ actual capabilities.</p>

We need a language that is powerful and flexible enough to meet our needs while safe and bounded to run while remaining simple enough to feasibly implement.</p>

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_programming_language">Scheme</a> is a turing-complete language with a (at least stated) fondness for minimalism. Unfortunately Scheme on its own is neither “safe” nor (necessarily) deterministic. Thankfully we can get the properties we want through:</p>

       
         Making object capabilities a core part of the language. Specifically, <a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/pubs/secureos/secureos.html">Jonathan Rees’ “W7 security kernel”</a> demonstrates that a pure lexically scoped environment is itself an appropritate substrate for object capabilities.

    <blockquote>
      <p>Identity Hubs as currently proposed in the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) are a subset of a general Decentralized Identifier (DID) based user-controlled agent, based on ACLs rather than an object-capabilities (ocap) architecture.  The current approach has both security and scalability issues. Transitioning the Hubs design to an ocap model can be achieved by introducing an UMA authorization server as the control endpoint. This avoids creating confused-deputy security issues and expands scale by enabling the hub to delegate access to resources not stored in the hub itself.</p>

      <p>We are all painfully aware of the economic and social restrictions imparted on us as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) focuses its efforts on supporting technology projects that work to meet these requirements through the utilization of W3C compliant ‘Verifiable Credentials (VCs)’, a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified.</p>

      <p>When the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) was formed in April 2020, we were a self-organizing group of companies and individuals, held together by a few mailing lists and working groups, to explore how Verifiable Credentials (VCs), an open standard and an emerging technology, could be used for the public health crisis unfolding with COVID-19. Recognizing our limits early on as an informal group, we quickly pivoted from developing a solution together to supporting each other to build for their local contexts. Over the course of nine months, we have seen over 20 projects present their work to the CCI community and developed an MVP governance framework that can be adapted to specific COVID-19 use cases.</p>

<blockquote>“Before we start, I’d like to acknowledge that the decisions we make in this room today may have implications into the future and far beyond the lifetime of this project, team or organisation. We make those decisions with that in mind.”- The Long Time&nbsp;Project</blockquote>Image by Carol Gaessler — shared under Creative Commons-Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-NC-SA</a>).<p>This is the first public ‘writing out loud’ of my dual fellowship with the<a href="https://medium.com/u/188295c21f1c"> Berkman Klein Center</a> and the Carr Centre for Human Rights, both at<a href="https://medium.com/u/cb35da43ade5"> Harvard University</a>. In the spirit of a true exploration, rather than starting from a point of ‘expertise’ and homogeneity, I offer this as an emergent thought process, and to invite in participation. I must also point out that though this blog is written through the lens of my journey, my learning isn’t mine alone — it is greatly informed by so many people, disciplines and research and I am grateful to the countless people that have gracefully shared their knowledge and wisdom so that we might collectively grow together.</p><blockquote>“Who and what gets fixed in place to enable progress? What social groups are classified, corralled, coerced and capitalized upon so others are free to tinker, experiment and engineer the future?” Ruha&nbsp;Benjamin</blockquote><p>I started off my exploration with this hypothesis: Can humanitarian digital policy be decolonized?</p><p>I started with this, as I’ve often argued that the humanitarian aid system perpetuates hierarchical, patriarchal, hegemonic views of what ‘development’ and ‘progress’ looks like, ignoring other world-views, and underlying systemic and structural pillars of inequality and bias. As the humanitarian aid system increasingly intersects with technology systems developed in the context of Western capitalism and in small pockets of privileged power, I have not been alone in raising concerns on the implications of collision of two systems that are fundamentally patriarchal and hegemonic on those that are minoritized in the Global&nbsp;South.</p><p>To put in context, the range of digital or technology systems that humanitarian actors engage with is incredibly wide. This can range from (as a snapshot):</p>  Systems used to support the coordination of aid efforts — for example, biometric digital identities with refugee assistance programs or earth observing technology in disaster&nbsp;relief  Digital platforms or digital transformation with partners — for example, e-government services that link social protection and citizen&nbsp;welfare  Technology innovations to support affected populations access to aid — for example, ICTs, apps, digital ledgers, hardware and many&nbsp;others  <p>Even what we constitute as ‘humanitarian’ has shades of grey — whether it’s at the pointy end of a crisis, to support during peacetime. The wide array of aid provision does not easily exist within the carefully designed terminology found in textbooks and political resolutions.</p><p>Additionally, who works on technology or digital innovations within humanitarian institutions is wildly divergent — mostly within institutions innovation labs, or within digital or thematic teams — then deployed to the global south for implementation or testing (the notion of testing on vulnerable groups is already contentious and has its own set of critiques).</p><p>The diversity of use cases, contexts, stakeholders and owners does have one common thread however. As humanitarian organisations do not tend to traditionally have the requisite digital or technology expertise in-house, they partner externally to achieve their aims. And this is the sticking point — it easily falls into expertise and partnerships that predominantly come from small communities of public-private, technology partners, and academic institutions from the global north. What this does (whether implicitly or unconsciously) is to reinforce a dominant, hegemonic narrative that&nbsp;assumes:</p>  The experiences of global civil society and its actors, is homogeneous  The singular ‘Silicon Valley’ values that underpin such digital policies are the ones that all people aspire to, regardless of where they live or their cultural, societal, economic, geographic bearings  Power dynamics will continue to be affirmed in the hands of those that currently hold it without considering the cascading impacts of those policy decisions on those that are most going to be affected by&nbsp;it  <p>The appropriateness and impacts of digital technologies and AI within aid systems is still being discovered and understood. An incredible amount of work has gone into establishing data governance guidance and data protection protocols but not as much into broader policy governing the deployment and use of these technologies sector wide. Often they are siloed into communities or thematic areas of work, or perhaps resulting in codes of conduct — but not systematically looking at a sector wide approach that interrogates whether the use of these technologies paradoxically expose, mitigate or expand harm on often marginalised, minoritised constituents AND whether the digital futures we are chasing merely replicate or reinforce existing or past inequalities?.</p><blockquote>“..the relationship between tech industries and those populations who are outside their ambit of power — women, populations in the Global South, including black, Indigenous and Latinx communities in North America, immigrants in Europe — is a colonial one” Sareetyta Amrute, Data and&nbsp;Society</blockquote><p>So, could humanitarian actors play a more intentional role in designing just and equitable digital futures? Could we in fact, unshackle ourselves from our neo-colonial humanitarian mental models, and push back against the hierarchies of techno-chauvinism and meritocracy? Could we use this moment in time to design worlds that don’t imagine some figures, especially populations in the Global South — to merely be passive beneficiaries and outside of the borders of expertise we seek? Could we invert the pathways of tech colonialism in the aid&nbsp;sector?</p><p>As I started my exploration, I realised that my original hypothesis needed more rigour. There were tensions inherent in my original starting point. Firstly, what in fact constitutes digital policy? For whom? For what purpose? What influence does policy have in fact over systems? Different actors have their own policy making instruments — that are incumbent on different leverage points that service multiple agendas. Considering the multiplicity of use cases, actors, and contexts — what I was softly heading to was the governance of the deployment and use of digital systems and technologies within the aid sector. Notwithstanding the work in data governance and data protection in aid, there are still gaps in governance in terms of how and when we deploy tech innovation, the digital systems we are creating and supporting to create, supply chains that we are a part of, due diligence processes, accountability and risk ownership, and many other elements. In addition to this, are questions of immunity (traditionally, humanitarian organisations do not go beyond the individual institutional governance mechanisms, that often are bordered by the institution’s immunity); and appropriateness of the technology innovations we&nbsp;deploy.</p><p>How then do we design digital governance systems that speak to these complex, intertwined issues? Instead of merely looking at digital governance in terms of control, could weaving in feminist and decolonial approaches help us liberate our digital futures so that it is a space of safety, of humanity — for those whom we are meant to support? Are these approaches ways in which we can design new forms of digital humanism?</p><blockquote>“We could build systems for durability, but instead some dipshits told you we needed to move fast and break things” Audrey&nbsp;Watters</blockquote><p>Could a digital governance approach consider questions like the following:</p>  How then do we go beyond what we are merely legally required to do versus what is right to do? And importantly, are humanitarian actors willing to go beyond their immunity?  How do we extend digital governance to go beyond the fortresses of individual institutions to a multi-actor, sector wide approach that is emergent and iterative?  Can and should governance systems help users realize and/or amplify their rights and in fact use it as a way to hold humanitarian actors to&nbsp;account?  How might governance systems actually flatten power in decision&nbsp;making  Can governance systems help us monitor our accountability to our promises to affected populations?  Who has the power to draw the conclusions from assessments done?  Just because we *can* deploy a specific asset or tech, *should*&nbsp;we?  How do we increase percentage of risk/harm that gets absolved by humanitarian institutions rather than that risk/harm being pushed further down the chain to affected populations?  How might we incentivise governance systems to do the right&nbsp;thing?  <p>Digital technologies and AI mask ideologies of power, and are wed to a market ideology of dominance. To intentionally carve a different type of ideology would require governance systems that are informed by different knowledge sources into decision making. That prioritise those that are most impacted by or are on the receiving end of that initiative, rather than cantering donor or aid institutions privileges. Good digital governance in the vein that this research is pursuing then, must disrupt the idea of ‘solutionism’, must also critique the systems in which that technology is being deployed and the impacts of that deployment — now and into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>And this is when my hypothesis started to fork out. Where I originally thought to use elements of futures methodologies to analyse future states and imaginaries of what we might collectively desire, I realised this was not enough for the rigour of what is needed to be achieved. What I have learned in my practice of strategic foresight within systems and institutional transformation is that the facilitation of the method does not automatically result in a change in policy and/or strategic decision making. And that is because the application of insights isn’t weaved into and within how change actually occurs. Often in humanitarian/development work, we are fire-fighting the now — the problem right in front of us. We design solutions and interventions aimed to problem solving what is immediately in front of us without necessarily assessing three&nbsp;things:</p>  The complexity of the system in which that issue&nbsp;lives  Just as rights are not static, neither is harm. What is the current and future theory of harm that might arise out of that solution/intervention  What might be the impact of the solution/intervention on future generations and on our&nbsp;planet  Who holds the fiduciary duty to future digital selves of affected populations?  <p>I now radically pursue the idea of foresight within ethics systems to inform governance. Can we consider the ethics of intervention through the lens of constraining future good and mitigating future bad? Might this in fact be where it can add rigour and&nbsp;value?</p><blockquote>“Our radical imagination is a tool for decolonization, for reclaiming our right to shape our lived reality.” ― Adrienne Maree&nbsp;Brown</blockquote><p>Lastly, I realised that my focus on decolonisation was somewhat, and honestly — skewed.</p><p>Decolonisation is the process of undoing and giving up social and economic power, and restoring what has been taken away in the past, which arguably includes reparations. As Eve Tuck and Wayne Yang argue — decolonisation is also not a metaphor for diversity and inclusion nor is it a replacement for social justice efforts. Would the efforts of humanitarian aid ever include reparations? Could we ethically profess to even do so? We often argue that for the humanitarian system to change, it would involve giving up the status quo that we have a strangle-hold on. However, could this ever be achieved through the result of this one approach/framework? Am I being authentic, am I being honest if I were to declare it so? The answer was&nbsp;no.</p><p>What I was unpacking in actuality, was the notion of decoloniality — an aspiration to restore, renew, elevate, rediscover, acknowledge and validate the multiplicity of lives, lived-experiences, culture and knowledge of indigenous people, people of colour, and colonised people as well as to decenter hetere/cis-normativity, gender hierarchies and racial privilege. I think of this as how do we exist in plurality — in a multiverse so to speak. And to include this in governance, not as a tokenistic or virtue-signalling flag, but rather to help us consider different lenses, perspectives, sources of truth in even how we think about what is right, what is fair and what is just. How might decolonial and feminist approaches help us reframe our starting points and in fact influence governance design? This isn’t about just getting different under-represented groups around the table, but rather how might we shift the knowledge and experiences we draw from in the very design and decision making of policy and governance frames. It is to ensure that we are considering the multiplicity of ways in which issues of rights, privacy and agency are understood and experienced the world over, and not imposing just one or a narrow valued judgement on these&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Through applying a decolonial lens to governance, might we in fact be able to intentionally design for equity rather than for privilege?</p><blockquote>“Decolonisation, expressed by your lips, differs from the decolonisation that comes from within, as a revolutionary concept that speaks about rehumanization — a fundamental planetary project” — Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni</blockquote><p>Thus, I am gently landing on Decolonial Humanitarian Digital Governance. An emergent process that is grounded in the following hypothesis: How do we not lock people into future harm, indebtedness or future inequity? It seeks to help start answering the questions unearthed through the journey thus far. Importantly, its primacy is to shift the focus of current humanitarian digital efforts that prioritise the problem solving of now, to one that aims to mitigate future harm and inequity. It aims at not binding nor narrowing the governance actions of humanitarian actors to merely their institutional legal liabilities and privileges but rather allows self-regulation for a shared responsibility for our collective futures across all actors and constituents in the aid&nbsp;sector.</p><p>The Decolonial Humanitarian Digital Governance is a framework that&nbsp;is:</p>  Multi-Dimensional (intentionally includes plurality of perspectives affected populations, minoritized groups, humanitarian and tech governance actors, activists, and ethicists)  Rigorously analyses future harms and impacts on future generations  Interrogates who absorbs future&nbsp;harm  Grounded in the rights and equity of impacted minoritized people  Is emergent and acts as a compass (not a checkbox)  <p>I see it visualised in three&nbsp;weaves:</p><p>And how we might judge this? Though not complete, perhaps some questions we might weave into that could&nbsp;include:</p><p>1. For the improvements it makes relative to what is&nbsp;replaced</p><p>2. For its understanding and active management of unintended consequences</p><p>3. For its mitigation and absorption of current and future&nbsp;harm</p><p>4. For its ability to cultivate an evolved awareness of rights, accountability and collective humanity</p><p>And that is where I am up to. This is a journey that isn’t complete by any measure. In fact, this framework must never be complete. It must never be static. The complexities we are dealing with are continuously evolving, and our commons have irrevocably shifted. We must unpack decades of mental models and behaviours as the range of choices about the type of futures we want to inhabit — has expanded exponentially, and the choices we make now will decide our collective fates.</p><p>To design more flourishing and liberated futures for all, we must uncover the plurality that is available to all of us, to frame how we see the&nbsp;world.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/decolonial-humanitarian-digital-governance-48b35b05b110">Decolonial Humanitarian Digital Governance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Between Games and Apocalyptic Robots: Considering Near-Term Social Risks of Reinforcement Learning  An increasingly popular branch of Machine Learning challenges current approaches to algorithmic governance. <p>With many of us stuck at home this past year, we’ve seen a surge in the popularity of video games. That trend hasn’t been limited to humans. DeepMind and Google AI both released results from their Atari playing AIs, which have taught themselves to play over fifty Atari games from scratch, with no provided rules or guidelines. The unique thing about these new results is how general the AI agent is. While previous efforts have achieved human performance on the games they were trained to play, DeepMind’s new AI Agent, MuZero could teach itself to beat humans at Atari games it had never encountered in under a day. If this reminds you of AlphaZero which taught itself to play Go then Chess well enough to outperform world champions, that’s because it demonstrates an advance in the same suite of algorithms, a class of machine learning called Reinforcement Learning&nbsp;(RL).</p><p>While traditional machine learning parses out its model of the world (typically a small world pertaining only to the problem it’s designed to solve) from swathes of data, RL is real-time observation based. This means RL learns its model primarily through trial and error interactions with its environment, not by pulling out correlations from data representing a historical snapshot of it. In the RL framework, each interaction with the environment is an opportunity to build towards an overarching goal, referred to as a reward. An RL agent is trained to make a sequence of decisions on how to interact with its environment that will ultimately maximize its reward (i.e. help it win the&nbsp;game).</p><p>This unique iterative learning paradigm allows the AI model to change and adapt to its environment, making RL an attractive solution for open-ended, real-world problem-solving. It also makes it a leading candidate for artificial general intelligence (AGI) and has some researchers concerned about the rise of truly autonomous AI that does not align with human values. Nick Bostrom first posed what is now the canonical example of this risk among AI Safety researchers — a paperclip robot with one goal: optimize the production efficiency of paperclips. With no other specifications, the agent quickly drifts from optimizing its own paperclip factory to commandeering food production supply chains for the paperclip making cause. It proceeds to place paperclips above all other human needs until all that’s left of the world is a barren wasteland covered end to end with unused paper clips. The takeaway? Extremely literal problem solving combined with inaccurate problem definition can lead to bad outcomes.</p><p>This rogue AGI (albeit in more high-stakes incarnations like weapons management) is the type of harm usually thought of when trying to make RL safe in the context of society. However, between an autonomous agent teaching itself games in the virtual world and an intelligent but misguided AI putting humanity in existential risk lay a multitude of sociotechnical concerns. As RL is being rolled out in domains ranging from social media to medicine and education, it’s time we seriously think about these near-term risks.</p><p>How the paperclip problem will play out in the near term is likely to be rather subtle. For example, medical treatment protocols are currently popular candidates for RL modeling; they involve a series of decisions (which treatment options to try) with uncertain outcomes (different options work better for different people) that all connect to the eventual outcome (patient health). One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lIr8rgo5zE&amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks">such study</a> tried to identify the best treatment decisions to avoid sepsis in ICU patients based off of multitudes of data, including medical histories, clinical charts and doctor’s notes. Their first iteration was an astounding success. With very high accuracy, it identified treatment paths that resulted in patient death. However, upon further examination and consultation with clinicians it turned out that though the agent had been allowed to learn from a plethora of potentially relevant treatment considerations, it had latched onto only one main indicator for death — whether or not a chaplain was called. The goal of the system was to flag treatment paths that led to deaths, and in a very literal sense that’s what it did. Clinicians only called a chaplain when a patient presented as close to&nbsp;death.</p><p>You’ll notice that in this example, the incredibly literal yet unhelpful solution the RL agent was taking was discovered by the researchers. This is no accident. The field of modern medicine is built around the reality that connections between treatment and outcomes typically have no known causal explanations. Aspirin, for example, was used as an anti-inflammatory for over seventy years before we had any insight into why it worked. This lack of causal understanding is sometimes referred to as <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c">intellectual debt</a>; if we can’t describe why something works, we may not be able to predict when or how it will fail. Medicine has grown around this fundamental uncertainty. Through strict codes of ethics, industry standards, and regulatory infrastructure (i.e. clinical trials), the field has developed the scaffolding to minimize the accompanying harms. RL systems aiming to help with diagnosis and treatment have to develop within this infrastructure. Compliance with the machinery medicine has around intellectual debt is more likely to result in slow and steady progress, without colossal misalignment. This same level of oversight does not apply to fields like social media, the potential harms of which are hard to pin down and which have virtually no regulatory scaffolding in&nbsp;place.</p><p>We may have already experienced some of the early harms of RL based algorithms in complex domains. In 2018 YouTube engineers released a paper describing an RL addition to their recommendation algorithm that increased daily watch time by 6 million hours in the beta testing phase. Meanwhile, anecdotal accounts of radicalization through YouTube rabbit holes of increasingly conspiratorial content (e.g., NYTimes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html">reporting</a> on YouTube’s role in empowering Brazil’s far right) were on the rise. While it is impossible to know exactly which algorithms powered the platform’s recommendations at the time, this rabbit hole effect would be a natural result of an RL algorithm trying to maximize view time by nudging users towards increasingly addictive content.</p><p>In the near future, dynamic manipulation of this sort may end up at odds with established protections under the law. For example, Facebook has recently been put under scrutiny by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18286660/facebook-hud-housing-discrimination-case-section-230-legal-defense">discriminatory housing advertisements</a>. The HUD suit alleges that even without explicit targeting filters that amount to the exclusion of protected groups, its algorithms are likely to hide ads from ‘users whom the system determines are unlikely to engage with the ad, even if the advertiser explicitly wants to reach those users.’ Given the types of (non-RL) ML algorithms FB currently uses in advertising, proving this disparate impact would be a matter of examining the data and features used to train the algorithm. While the current lack of transparency makes this challenging, it is fundamentally possible to roll out benchmarks capable of flagging such discrimination.</p><p>If advertising were instead powered by RL, benchmarks would not be enough. An RL advertising algorithm tasked with ensuring it does not discriminate against protected classes, could easily end up making it look as though it were not discriminating instead. If the RL agent were optimized for profit and the practice of discrimination was profitable, the RL agent would be incentivized to find loopholes under which it could circumvent protections. Just like in the sepsis treatment case, the system is likely to find a shortcut towards reaching its objective, only in this case the lack of regulatory scaffolding makes it unlikely this failure will be picked up. The propensity of RL to adapt to meet metrics, while skirting over intent, will make it challenging to tag such undesirable behavior. This situation is further complicated by our heavy reliance on ‘data’ as a means to flag potential bias in ML&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Unlike RL, traditional machine learning is innately static; it takes in loads of data, parses it for correlations, and outputs a model. Once a system has been trained, updating it to accommodate a new environment or changes to the status quo requires repeating most or all of that initial training with updated data. Even for firms that have the computing power to make such retraining seamless, the reliance on data has allowed an ‘in’ for transparency. The saying goes, machine learning is like money laundering for bias. If an ML system is trained using biased or unrepresentative data, its model of the world will reflect that. In traditional machine learning, we can at least follow the marked bills and point out when an ML system is going to be prone to discrimination by examining its training data. We may even be able to preprocess the data before training the system in an attempt to preemptively correct for&nbsp;bias.</p><p>Since RL is generally real-time observation-based rather than training data-based, this ‘follow-the-data’ approach to algorithmic oversight does not apply. There is no controlled input data to help us anticipate or correct for where an RL system can go wrong before we set it loose in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>In certain domains, this lack of data-born insight may not be too problematic. The more we can specify what the moving parts of a given application are and the ways in which they may fail–be it through an understanding of the domain or regulatory scaffolding–the safer it is for us to use RL. DeepMind’s use of RL to lower the energy costs of its computing centers, a process ultimately governed by the laws of physics, deserves less scrutiny than the RL based K-12 curriculum generator Google’s Ed Chi views as a near-term goal of the field. The harder it is to describe what success looks like within a given domain, the more prone to bad outcomes it is. This is true of all ML systems, but even more crucial for RL systems that cannot be meaningfully validated ahead of use. As regulators, we need to think about which domains need more regulatory scaffolding to minimize the fallout from our intellectual debt, while allowing for the immense promise of algorithms that can learn from their mistakes.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/between-games-and-apocalyptic-robots-considering-near-term-societal-risks-of-reinforcement-35ec5af8f04a">Between Games and Apocalyptic Robots: Considering Near-Term Societal Risks of Reinforcement…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      <p>Ursa aims to include things like a comprehensive library of modular signatures and symmetric-key primitives built on top of existing implementations, so blockchain developers can choose and modify their cryptographic schemes with a simple configuration file change. Ursa will also have implementations of newer, fancier cryptography, including things like pairing-based signatures, threshold signatures, and aggregate signatures, and also zero-knowledge primitives like SNARKs.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Ursa is a library for cryptography and the result of a collaborative effort from teams at ACM, Bitwise, DFINITY, Evernym, Fujitsu, Intel, the Linux Foundation, the Sovrin Foundation, and State Street. Duplication among blockchain project features heightens security risks. Ursa, however, gathers up crypto implementations across projects and compiles them into a single metalibrary, creating a central repository for crypto code. This way, projects can select sources of code from Ursa, instead of the original source, decreasing duplication security risks and boosting interoperability among projects.</p>

      <p>Kiva Protocol is built using Hyperledger Indy, Aries, and Ursa, and as implemented in Sierra Leone, allows citizens to perform electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) verifications in about 11 seconds, using just their national ID number and a fingerprint. With this verification, it is possible for the nation’s unbanked to open a savings account and move into the formally banked population.</p>

 Manifesto 
<p><a href="https://id2020.org/manifesto">The Alliance Manifesto</a></p>
 
   The ability to prove one’s identity is a fundamental and universal human right. 
   We live in a digital era. Individuals need a trusted, verifiable way to prove who they are, both in the physical world and online. 
   Over 1 billion people worldwide are unable to prove their identity through any recognized means. As such, they are without the protection of law, and are unable to access basic services, participate as a citizen or voter, or transact in the modern economy. Most of those affected are children and adolescents, and many are refugees, forcibly displaced, or stateless persons. 
   For some, including refugees, the stateless, and other marginalized groups, reliance on national identification systems isn’t possible. This may be due to exclusion, inaccessibility, or risk, or because the credentials they do hold are not broadly recognized. While we support efforts to expand access to national identity programs, we believe it is imperative to complement such efforts by providing an alternative to individuals lacking safe and reliable access to state-based systems. 
   We believe that individuals must have control over their own digital identities, including how personal data is collected, used, and shared. Everyone should be able to assert their identity across institutional and national borders, and across time. Privacy, portability, and persistence are necessary for digital identity to meaningfully empower and protect individuals. 
   Digital identity carries significant risk if not thoughtfully designed and carefully implemented. We do not underestimate the risks of data misuse and abuse, particularly when digital identity systems are designed as large, centralized databases. 
   Technical design can mitigate some of the risks of digital identity. Emerging technology — for example, cryptographically secure, decentralized systems — could provide greater privacy protection for users, while also allowing for portability and verifiability. But widespread agreement on principles, technical design patterns, and interoperability standards is needed for decentralized digital identities to be trusted and recognized. 
   This “better” model of digital identity will not emerge spontaneously. In order for digital identities to be broadly trusted and recognized, we need sustained and transparent collaboration aligned around these shared principles, along with supporting regulatory and policy frameworks. 
   ID2020 Alliance partners jointly define functional requirements, influencing the course of technical innovation and providing a route to technical interoperability, and therefore trust and recognition. 
   The ID2020 Alliance recognizes that taking these ideas to scale requires a robust evidence base, which will inform advocacy and policy. As such, ID2020 Alliance-supported pilots are designed around a common monitoring and evaluation framework.

<p>NOTE: This article was updated to align to the&nbsp;FAPI 1.0 Final version&nbsp;which was published in March, 2021.</p>
 Introduction 
<p>Financial-grade API&nbsp;(FAPI) is a technical specification that&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">Financial-grade API Working Group</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a>&nbsp;has developed. It uses&nbsp;OAuth 2.0&nbsp;and&nbsp;OpenID Connect&nbsp;(OIDC) as its base and defines additional technical requirements for the financial industry and other industries that require higher API security.</p>

 
 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 OpenID Foundation Working Groups and Financial-grade API Stack
 History 
<p>Implementer’s Draft 1&nbsp;— The initial version of the FAPI specification was published in 2017. The version is called Implementer’s Draft 1 (ID1).</p>
<p>Implementer’s&nbsp;Draft 2&nbsp;— The second version was published in October, 2018. The version is called Implementer’s Draft 2 (ID2). In this version, the FAPI specification was renamed from “Financial API” to “Financial-grade API” for wider adoption across various industries.</p>
<p>Final Version&nbsp;— The final version was published in March, 2021. In this version, the main two parts of the FAPI sepecification, “Part 1: Read-Only Security Profile” and “Part 2: Read and Write API Security Profile”, were renamed to “Part 1: Baseline Security Profile” and “Part 2: Advanced Security Profile”, respectively.</p>
<p>FAPI 2.0&nbsp;— The FAPI WG has started to discuss the next version of the FAPI specification, which is called “FAPI 2.0”. The&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI FAQ</a>&nbsp;published on March 31, 2021 (<a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/31/picking-up-speed-on-the-fapi-roadmap-from-the-fapi-rw-implementers-draft-2-to-fapi-1-0-advanced-final/">announcement</a>) mentions FAPI 2.0. Authlete is mentioned in the answer to the question “Are there FAPI 2.0 implementations?” because Authlete has already implemented new technical components of FAPI 2.0 such as&nbsp;PAR&nbsp;(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-par/">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>),&nbsp;RAR&nbsp;(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-rar/">OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests</a>) and&nbsp;DPoP&nbsp;(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop/">OAuth 2.0 Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer</a>).</p>

 Prior Knowledge 
 Basic Specifications 
<p>The format of the FAPI specification is a terse list of technical requirements, so the document is not long. In exchange, a lot of prior knowledge is required to read it smoothly. Especially, you have to learn&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750">RFC 6750</a>&nbsp;(the core of OAuth 2.0) and&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</a>&nbsp;(the core of OpenID Connect) by heart.</p>
<p>In addition, because specifications related to JWT (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515">JWS</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516">JWE</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517">JWK</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518">JWA</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">JWT</a>) are prior knowledge to understand OIDC Core, they are of course prior knowledge to read the FAPI specification. Therefore, you need to understand them perfectly.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 JWS Compact Serialization (RFC 7515 Section 7.1)
<p>Furthermore,&nbsp;PKCE&nbsp;(<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">RFC 7636</a>) which was published in September, 2015 is now regarded as a part of the basic set of OAuth 2.0 specifications as well as RFC 6749 and RFC 6750.</p>

 Mutual TLS 
<p>In general, “Mutual TLS” means that a client is also required to present its X.509 certificate in a TLS connection. However, in the context of FAPI, Mutual TLS means the following two which are defined in “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>” (MTLS).</p>
 
 OAuth client authentication using a client certificate 
 Tokens bound to a client certificate 
 
 OAuth Client Authentication using a Client Certificate 
<p>When a&nbsp;confidential client&nbsp;(RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">2. Client Types</a>) accesses a token endpoint (RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.2">3.2. Token Endpoint</a>),&nbsp;client authentication&nbsp;(RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3">2.3. Client Authentication</a>) is required. Client authentication is a process where a client application proves it has its confidential authentication information.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication at Token Endpoint
<p>There are several ways for client authentication. The following are client authentication methods listed in OIDC Core,&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication">9. Client Authentication</a>&nbsp;(except&nbsp;<code>none</code>).</p>
 
 <code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;— Basic Authentication using a pair of client ID and client secret 
 <code>client_secret_post</code>&nbsp;— Embedding a pair of client ID and client secret in a request body 
 <code>client_secret_jwt</code>&nbsp;— Passing a JWT signed by a key based on a client secret with a symmetric algorithm 
 <code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;— Passing a JWT signed by a private key with an asymmetric algorithm 
 
<p>In&nbsp;<code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>client_secret_post</code>, a client application directly shows the server its client secret to prove that it has the confidential information.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Client Authentication using Basic Authentication
<p>In&nbsp;<code>client_secret_jwt</code>, a client application indirectly proves that it has the client secret by signing a JWT with the client secret and passing the JWT to the server. On the other hand, in&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>, signing is performed with an asymmetric private key and the server verifies the signature with the public key corresponding to the private key.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Client Authentication using JWT
<p>Apart from the above, “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-for-oauth-client">2. Mutual TLS for OAuth Client Authentication</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>&nbsp;introduces new client authentication methods below.</p>
 
 <code>tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;— Utilizing a PKI client certificate used in a TLS connection 
 <code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;— Utilizing a self-signed client certificate used in a TLS connection 
 
<p>These two utilize the client certificate used in a TLS connection between the client and the token endpoint for client authentication.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Certificate for Client Authentication
<p>In&nbsp;<code>tls_client_auth</code>, the PKI client certificate used in a TLS connection established between a client and a server is used for client authentication. The server verifies the client certificate (this should be done even in a context irrelevant to OAuth) and then checks whether the Subject Distinguished Name or Subject Alternative Name matches the pre-registered one. For this process, client applications that want to use&nbsp;<code>tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;for client authentication must register Subject Distinguished Name or Subject Alternative Name into the server in advance. The specification newly defines the following client metadata for this purpose (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-client-registration-metadata">2.1.2 Client Registration Metadata</a>).</p>
 
 <code>tls_client_auth_subject_dn</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_dns</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_uri</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_ip</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_email</code> 
 
<p>In&nbsp;<code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>, a self-signed client certificate is used instead of a PKI client certificate. To use this client authentication method, client applications have to register a self-signed client certificate into the server in advance.</p>
<p>The following table is the list of client authentication methods mentioned in the FAPI specification.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication Methods
<p>For detailed explanation about client authentication, please read “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/oauth-2-0-client-authentication-4b5f929305d4">OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication</a>”. Also, if you are not familiar with X.509 certificate, please read “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/illustrated-x-509-certificate-84aece2c5c2e">Illustrated X.509 Certificate</a>”.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 X.509 Certificate Chain

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 X.509 Certificate in PEM Format
 Certificate-Bound Tokens 
<p>Once a traditional access token is leaked, an attacker can access APIs with the access token. Traditional access tokens are just like a train ticket which anyone can use once it is stolen.</p>
<p>An idea to mitigate this vulnerability is to check whether the API caller bringing an access token matches the legitimate holder of the access token when an API call is made. This is just like the boarding procedure for international flights where passengers are required to show not only a plane ticket but also their passport.</p>
<p>This idea is called “Proof of Possession” (PoP) and FAPI lists “Mutual TLS” as an only possible option of PoP ( — in the previous versions (ID1 &amp; ID2), “Token Binding” was mentioned as a PoP mechanim but it was dropped by the final version). In this context, “Mutual TLS” means the specification defined in “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-client-certifica">3. Mutual-TLS Client Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>.</p>
<p>Because Mutual TLS has several meanings as explained above and I actually experienced a problematic conversation like below,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: The API management solution of your company does not support Mutual TLS (as a PoP mechanism).<br>
The company: Not correct. Our solution supports Mutual TLS (because it can be configured to request a client certificate for TLS communication).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve personally decided to call Mutual TLS as a PoP mechanism “Certificate Binding”. This naming is not so bad (at least for me) because it sounds symmetrical to Token Binding and because actual implementations will eventually become just binding a certificate to an access token and won’t care whether the certificate has been extracted from a mutual TLS connection or has come from somewhere else.</p>
<p>In an implementation of Certificate Binding, when the token endpoint of an authorization server issues an access token, it calculates the hash value of the client certificate presented by the client application in the TLS connection and remembers the binding between the access token and the hash value (or embeds the hash value into the access token if the implementation of the access token is a self-contained JWT). When the client application accesses an API of the target resource server, it uses the same client certificate that was previously used in the communication with the token endpoint. The implementation of the API extracts an access token and a client certificate from the request, calculates the hash value of the client certificate and checks the hash value matches the one that is associated with the access token. If they match, the API implementation accepts the request. If not, it rejects the request.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Certificate Binding
<p>It is relatively easy to implement Certificate Binding because it can be implemented only if the client certificate is accessible. On the other hand, Token Binding is relatively hard because it is necessary to modify multiple layers such as TLS layer and HTTP layer. In addition, the future is uncertain as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5097603234529280">Chrome has removed the Token Binding feature</a>&nbsp;although the community strongly tried to urge Chrome team to rethink it (“<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/OkdLUyYmY1E">Intent to Remove: Token Binding</a>”). However, anyway, related specifications were promoted to RFCs at the beginning of October, 2018.</p>
 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8471">RFC 8471&nbsp;</a>— The Token Binding Protocol Version 1.0 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8472">RFC 8472</a>&nbsp;— Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extension for Token Binding Protocol Negotiation 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8473">RFC 8473</a>&nbsp;— Token Binding over HTTP 
 
<p>“<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-token-binding/?include_text=1">OAuth 2.0 Token Binding</a>” (its status is “expired”) is a specification that defines rules to apply Token Binding to OAuth 2.0 tokens based on the specifications listed above.</p>
<p>NOTE: The final version of the FAPI specification dropped Token Binding due to its unlikeliness of future availability.</p>
 JARM 
<p>JARM&nbsp;is a new specification which was approved at the same timing with FAPI Implementer’s Draft 2. JARM is referred to in FAPI Part 2.</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-jarm-ID1.html">Financial-grade API: JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode for OAuth 2.0 (JARM)</a> 
 
<p>The specification defines new values for the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;request parameter as shown below.</p>
 
 <code>query.jwt</code> 
 <code>fragment.jwt</code> 
 <code>form_post.jwt</code> 
 <code>jwt</code> 
 
<p>If one of the above is specified, response parameters of an authorization response are packed into a JWT and the JWT is returned as the value of a single&nbsp;<code>response</code>&nbsp;response parameter.</p>
<p>For example, a traditional authorization response in the authorization code flow looks like below.&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;response parameters are included separately.</p>
 HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://client.com/callback?code={CODE}&amp;state={STATE} 
<p>On the other hand, if&nbsp;<code>response_mode=query.jwt</code>&nbsp;is added to an authorization request, the authorization response will become like below.</p>
 HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://client.com/callback?response={JWT} 

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 JARM example
<p>Because the JWT is signed by a key of the server, a client can confirm that the response has not been tampered by verifying the signature of the JWT.</p>
<p>Client Metadata for JARM</p>
<p>Before using JARM, client applications have to set a value to the&nbsp;<code>authorization_signed_response_alg</code>&nbsp;metadata in advance. The metadata represents an algorithm for signature of response JWTs. If the value of the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;request parameter is&nbsp;<code>*.jwt</code>&nbsp;although the metadata is not set, the authorization request fails because the specification requires response JWTs be always signed.</p>
<p>To encrypt response JWTs, algorithms have to be set in advance to the&nbsp;<code>authorization_encrypted_response_alg</code>&nbsp;metadata and the&nbsp;<code>authorization_encrypted_response_enc</code>&nbsp;metadata. To use an asymmetric algorithm, configuration about client’s public key is necessary, too.</p>
<p>The screenshot below is client-side settings for JARM in Authlete’s web console that is provided for client management.</p>

 Part 1: Baseline 
<p>As introduction of prior knowledge was done, let’s start the main part of this article. To begin with, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html">Part 1</a>” which defines baseline security profile.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Authorization Server 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#authorization-server">5.2.2. Authorization server</a>” in “Part 1” lists requirements for authorization server. Let’s take a look one by one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 1.</p>
<p>shall support confidential clients;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 2.</p>
<p>should support public clients;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definition of “confidential clients” and “public clients” is described in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">2.1. Client Types</a>” of RFC 6749. I don’t explain the difference between the client types here as it is prior knowledge for those who read the FAPI specification. However, the relationship between client types and OAuth 2.0 flows is often misunderstood even by those who are familiar with OAuth 2.0. It is only the combination of a “public client” and “client credentials flow” that RFC 6749 explicitly prohibits. Other combinations are allowed. Without this understanding, you would misread the FAPI specification.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Combinations of Flow and Client Type (RFC 6749)
<p>Just FYI. It is confidential clients only that are allowed to make backchannel authentication requests which are defined in CIBA.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Combinations of Flow and Client Type (CIBA)
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 3.</p>
<p>shall provide a client secret that adheres to the requirements in section 16.19 of OIDC if a symmetric key is used;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OIDC Core states that a value calculated based on a client secret must be used as the shared key when a symmetric algorithm is used for signing and encryption. If the entropy of the client secret is lower than the one required by the algorithm, the strength of the algorithm is weakened. Therefore, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SymmetricKeyEntropy">16.19. Symmetric Key Entropy</a>” requires that client secrets have entropy strong enough for used algorithms. For example, when&nbsp;<code>HS256</code>&nbsp;(HMAC using SHA-256) is used for signing algorithm of ID tokens, client secrets must have 256-bit entropy at minimum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 4.</p>
<p>shall authenticate the confidential client using one of the following methods:</p>
<p>1. Mutual TLS for OAuth Client Authentication as specified in section 2 of MTLS;</p>
<p>2.<code>client_secret_jwt</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;as specified in section 9 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that&nbsp;<code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>client_secret_post</code> defined in RFC 6749 are not allowed as client authentication methods at the token endpoint.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication Methods allowed in FAPI Part 1
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 5.</p>
<p>shall require and use a key of size 2048 bits or larger for RSA algorithms;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 6.</p>
<p>shall require and use a key of size 160 bits or larger for elliptic curve algorithms;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, when&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;is used as client authentication method and RSA is used for signing the JWT, the key size must be 2048 or bigger. Likewise, when an elliptic curve algorithm is used, the key size must be 160 at minimum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 7.</p>
<p>shall require RFC7636 with&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is required to implement RFC 7636 (PKCE) which is a countermeasure for “authorization code interception attack”.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Authorization Code Interception Attack
<p>RFC 7636 has added&nbsp;<code>code_challenge</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method</code>&nbsp;request parameters to the authorization request and&nbsp;<code>code_verifier</code>&nbsp;request parameter to the token request. Because the default value of&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method</code>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<code>plain</code>, authorization requests that comply with FAPI must include&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method=S256</code>&nbsp;explicitly.</p>
<p>See “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/pkce/">Proof Key for Code Exchange (RFC 7636)</a>” for details about PKCE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 8.</p>
<p>shall require redirect URIs to be pre-registered;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, registration of redirect URIs is not required under some conditions. For FAPI, registration of redirect URIs is always required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 9.</p>
<p>shall require the&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter in the authorization request;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, the&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;request parameter of an authorization request can be omitted under some conditions. For FAPI, the request parameter must be always included. OIDC has the same requirement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 10.</p>
<p>shall require the value of&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;to exactly match one of the pre-registered redirect URIs;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When an authorization server checks whether the value of the&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;request parameter matches a pre-registered one, the rule described in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6">6. Normalization and Comparison</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a>&nbsp;(Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax) is applied unless the pre-registered one is an absolute URI. On the other hand, FAPI (and OIDC also) requires that simple string comparison be always used to check whether the redirect URIs match.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 11.</p>
<p>shall require user authentication to an appropriate Level of Assurance for the operations the client will be authorized to perform on behalf of the user;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is required that user authentication performed during authorization process satisfy an appropriate level of assurance. ID1 and ID2 required LoA (Level of Assurance) 2, which is defined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.1254">X.1254</a>&nbsp;(Entity authentication assurance framework. However, the Final version made the requirement more abstract (= changed the requirement from “LoA2” to “appropriate LoA”).</p>
<p>FYI: The following is the definition of LoA 2 described in “6.2 Level of assurance 2 (LoA2)” of X.1254.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At LoA2, there is some confidence in the claimed or asserted identity of the entity. This LoA is used when moderate risk is associated with erroneous authentication. Single-factor authentication is acceptable. Successful authentication shall be dependent upon the entity proving, through a secure authentication protocol, that the entity has control of the credential. Controls should be in place to reduce the effectiveness of eavesdroppers and online guessing attacks. Controls shall be in place to protect against attacks on stored credentials.</p>
<p>For example, a service provider might operate a website that enables its customers to change their address of record. The transaction in which a beneficiary changes an address of record may be considered an LoA2 authentication transaction, as the transaction may involve a moderate risk of inconvenience. Since official notices regarding payment amounts, account status, and records of changes are usually sent to the beneficiary’s address of record, the transaction additionally entails moderate risk of unauthorized release of PII. As a result, the service provider should obtain at least some authentication assurance before allowing this transaction to take place.</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 12.</p>
<p>shall require explicit approval by the user to authorize the requested scope if it has not been previously authorized;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 13.</p>
<p>shall reject an authorization code (Section 1.3.1 of RFC6749) if it has been previously used;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prohibiting reuse of authorization codes and ensuring that authorization codes have never been used previously are different things. If the current implementation of an authorization server uses randomly-generated strings as authorization codes and removes them from the database after they are used, the authorization codes have to be kept in the database even after they are used just only for the verification. If strings that represent authorization codes are generated randomly with high enough entropy, it is wasteful to keep authorization codes in the database even after their use. A certain famous engineer says&nbsp;“Most implementations prevent reuse of authorization codes by deleting corresponding database records and don’t check if they have been used previously, and such implementations are sufficient enough.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 14.</p>
<p>shall return token responses that conform to Section 4.1.4 of RFC6749;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a FAPI-specific requirement. Every authorization server implementation that claims it supports OAuth 2.0 must conform to&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.4">Section 4.1.4</a>&nbsp;of RFC 6749.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 15.</p>
<p>shall return the list of granted scopes with the issued access token if the request was passed in the front channel and was not integrity protected;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;response parameter can be omitted unless requested scopes and granted ones are different (RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-5.1">5.1. Successful Response</a>). In FAPI, the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;response parameter is required (even if the requested scopes and granted ones are equal) if the authorization request is passed in the front channel and is not integrity protected.</p>
<p>“Integrity protected” here means that a Request Object (OIDC Core&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests">Section 6</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-jwsreq/">JAR</a>) is used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 16.</p>
<p>shall provide non-guessable access tokens, authorization codes, and refresh token (where applicable), with sufficient entropy such that the probability of an attacker guessing the generated token is computationally infeasible as per RFC 6749 Section 10.10;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ID2 requires that access tokens have a minimum of 128 bits of entropy, but the Final version avoids mentioning the exact size of the minimum entropy and just says “sufficient entropy”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 17.</p>
<p>should clearly identify the details of the grant to the user during authorization as in 16.18 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suppose that a client application requests&nbsp;<code>payment</code>&nbsp;scope. A typical authorization page will tell the user just that the client application is requesting the&nbsp;<code>payment</code>&nbsp;scope. However, recent regulations in financial industries require that details be explained to the user. For example, information about the purpose of the&nbsp;<code>payment</code>&nbsp;scope, the amount of money transferred, and so on. Generally speaking, recent regulations require that grant be more specific.</p>
<p>UK Open Banking has invented “Lodging Intent” for the purpose. In the mechanism, (a) a client application registers details of grant it wants into an authorization server in advance, (b) the authorization server issues an intent ID that represents the registered details, and (c) the client makes an authorization request with the intent ID. As a result, the authorization server can generate an authorization page which includes the details of the authorization request.</p>
<p>To make the lodging intent pattern available as standards, OpenID Foundation has developed two separate specifications; “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-par/">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>” (PAR) and “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-rar/">OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests</a>” (RAR). These specifications will be mentioned again later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 18.</p>
<p>should provide a mechanism for the end-user to revoke access tokens and refresh tokens granted to a client as in 16.18 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that,&nbsp;if the format of access tokens is self-contained-type (e.g. JWT), the access tokens cannot be revoked&nbsp;unless the system implements and operates a mechanism like&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">CRL</a>&nbsp;(Certificate Revocation List) or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">OCSP</a>&nbsp;(Online Certificate Status Protocol) of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">PKI</a>&nbsp;(Public Key Infrastructure). If the system does not provide such mechanism, it means that the system has decided to give up revocation of access tokens. In this case, the duration of access tokens must be short enough to mitigate damage of access token leakage. See “<a href="https://medium.com/@darutk/oauth-access-token-implementation-30c2e8b90ff0">OAuth Access Token Implementation</a>” for further discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 19.</p>
<p>shall return an&nbsp;<code>invalid_client</code>&nbsp;error as defined in 5.2 of RFC6749 when mis-matched client identifiers were provided through the client authentication methods that permits sending the client identifier in more than one way;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FAPI Part 1 requires MTLS (<code>tls_client_auth</code>,&nbsp;<code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>) or JWT (<code>client_secret_jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>) for client authentication.</p>
<p>MTLS uses a client certificate but a certificate does not include the client identifier of the client which tries to authenticate itself with the certificate. Therefore, the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter needs to be given explicitly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, JWT-based client authentication methods present a JWT as the value of the&nbsp;<code>client_assertion</code>&nbsp;request parameter and the JWT contains the client identifier as the value of the&nbsp;<code>iss</code>&nbsp;claim. Therefore, the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter is not necessary. In addition, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523">RFC 7523</a>, 3. and OIDC Core, 9., the&nbsp;<code>sub</code> claim also holds the client identifier when a JWT is used for client authentication.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 JWT-based Client Authentication and Client Identifiers
<p>In MTLS, it is only the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter that represents a client identifier. On the other hand, in JWT-based client authentication, both the&nbsp;<code>iss</code>&nbsp;claim and the&nbsp;<code>sub</code>&nbsp;claim hold a client identifier. The values of the claims must match. Also, if the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter is redundantly given although JWT-based client authentication is used, the value of the request parameter must match the client identifier, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 20.</p>
<p>shall require redirect URIs to use the&nbsp;<code>https</code>&nbsp;scheme;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence added by FAPI Implementer’s Draft 2 is short but has a big impact. Because of this sentence, developers&nbsp;cannot use custom schemes in FAPI&nbsp;any more. To process redirection on client side only without preparing an external Web server, developers have to use the method described in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.2">7.2. Claimed “https” Scheme URI Redirection</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212">BCP 212</a>&nbsp;(OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 21.</p>
<p>should issue access tokens with a lifetime of under 10 minutes unless the tokens are sender-constrained; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement was added by the FAPI Final version. “sender-constrained” here means that access tokens have to be bound to a client certificate (MTLS).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 22.</p>
<p>shall support OIDD, may support RFC8414 and shall not distribute discovery metadata (such as the authorization endpoint) by any other means.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement was added by the FAPI Final version. OIDD here is short for “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</a>”. Therefore, authorization servers for FAPI must implement a “discovery endpoint” which is defined in OIDD&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig">Section 4</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier</p>
<p>Further, if it is desired to provide the authenticated user’s identifier to the client in the token response, the authorization server:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 5.2.2.1. lists requirements that an authorization server must follow when the authenticated user’s identifier is requested. In other words, when an ID token is requested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 1.</p>
<p>shall support the authentication request as in Section 3.1.2.1 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest">3.1.2.1. Authentication Request</a>” of OIDC Core is the definition of a request to an authorization endpoint in the context of OpenID Connect. RFC 6749 calls a request to an authorization endpoint “authorization request”. OIDC Core calls it “authentication request”. Aside from the names, considering that the specification of an authorization endpoint is the main part of OIDC Core, the FAPI’s requirement is almost equal to stating&nbsp;“shall support OIDC Core”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 2.</p>
<p>shall perform the authentication request verification as in Section 3.1.2.2 of OIDC;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 3.</p>
<p>shall authenticate the user as in Section 3.1.2.2 and 3.1.2.3 of OIDC;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 4.</p>
<p>shall provide the authentication response as in Section 3.1.2.4 and 3.1.2.5 of OIDC depending on the outcome of the authentication;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 5.</p>
<p>shall perform the token request verification as in Section 3.1.3.2 of OIDC; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 6.</p>
<p>shall issue an ID Token in the token response when&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;was included in the requested&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;as in Section 3.1.3.3 of OIDC with its&nbsp;<code>sub</code>&nbsp;value corresponding to the authenticated user and optional&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;value in ID Token.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summary of the requirements above is&nbsp;“shall follow OIDC Core specification.”&nbsp;Nothing special for FAPI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.2. Client requesting openid scope</p>
<p>If the client requests the&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;scope, the authorization server</p>
<p>1. shall require the&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of OIDC in the authentication request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OIDC&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest">Section 3.1.2.1</a>&nbsp;(Authorization Code Flow) states that&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;is optional. On the other hand, OIDC&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitAuthRequest">Section 3.2.2.1</a>&nbsp;(Implicit Flow) states that&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;is mandatory.</p>
<p>The FAPI requirement above requires&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;even in the authorization code flow if&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;is included in&nbsp;<code>scope</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.3. Clients not requesting openid scope</p>
<p>If the client does not requests the&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;scope, the authorization server</p>
<p>1. shall require the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in Section 4 of RFC6749</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter is optional. FAPI makes the parameter mandatory when&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;is not included in&nbsp;<code>scope</code>.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Public Client 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#public-client">5.2.3. Public client</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for public clients. Let’s take a look one by one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 1.</p>
<p>shall support RFC7636;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RFC 7636 is PKCE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 2.</p>
<p>shall use&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method for the RFC7636;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means&nbsp;“an authorization request must include&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method=S256</code>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 3.</p>
<p>shall use separate and distinct redirect URI for each authorization server that it talks to;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 4.</p>
<p>shall store the redirect URI value in the resource owner’s user-agents (such as browser) session and compare it with the redirect URI that the authorization response was received at, where, if the URIs do not match, the client shall terminate the process with error;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These requirements are so clear that further explanation is not needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 5.</p>
<p>(withdrawn); and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“(withdrawn)” here indicates that the requirement which existed in the previous FAPI versions has been withdrawn. You’ll see more “withdrawn”s in following sections, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 6.</p>
<p>shall implement an effective CSRF protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In normal cases, CSRF protection is implemented on server side. What is CSRF protection as a requirement for public clients? This is CSRF protection for redirect URIs. The following is an excerpt from “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12">10.12. Cross-Site Request Forgery</a>” of RFC 6749.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The client MUST implement CSRF protection for its redirection URI. This is typically accomplished by requiring any request sent to the redirection URI endpoint to include a value that binds the request to the user-agent’s authenticated state (e.g., a hash of the session cookie used to authenticate the user-agent). The client SHOULD utilize the “state” request parameter to deliver this value to the authorization server when making an authorization request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the requirements from “Public client, 1” to “Public client, 6”, “if it is desired to obtain a persistent identifier of the authenticated user”, that is, if an ID token is requested, an authorization request by a public client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 7.</p>
<p>shall include&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;value; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 8.</p>
<p>shall include the&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of OIDC in the authentication request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, “If&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;is not in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;value”, an authorization request by a public client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 9.</p>
<p>shall include the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in section 4.1.1 of RFC6749;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 10.</p>
<p>shall verify that the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;received in the token response is either an exact match, or contains a subset of the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;sent in the authorization request; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 11.</p>
<p>shall only use Authorization Server metadata obtained from the metadata document published by the Authorization Server at its well known endpoint as defined in OIDD or RFC 8414.</p>
</blockquote>
 Part 1: Requirements for Confidential Client 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#confidential-client">5.2.4. Confidential client</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for confidential clients. The requirements are positioned as additions to the requirements for public clients. Therefore, confidential clients must follow not only the requirements in 5.2.4 but also the requirements in 5.2.3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 1.</p>
<p>shall support the following methods to authenticate against the token endpoint:</p>
<p>1. Mutual TLS for OAuth Client Authentication as specified in Section 2 of MTLS, and</p>
<p>2.<code>client_secret_jwt</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;as specified in Section 9 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that client authentication methods defined in RFC 6749 (<code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>client_secret_post</code>) cannot be used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 2.</p>
<p>shall use RSA keys with a minimum 2048 bits if using RSA cryptography;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 3.</p>
<p>shall use elliptic curve keys with a minimum of 160 bits if using Elliptic Curve cryptography; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 4.</p>
<p>shall verify that its client secret has a minimum of 128 bits if using symmetric key cryptography.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These requirements apply when encrypted JWTs are used.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Protected Resources 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#protected-resources-provisions">6.2.1. Protected resources provisions</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for protected resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 1.</p>
<p>shall support the use of the HTTP GET method as in Section 4.3.1 of RFC7231;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 2.</p>
<p>shall accept access tokens in the HTTP header as in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage RFC6750;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, protected resource endpoints must support HTTP&nbsp;<code>GET</code>&nbsp;method and be able to accept an access token in the format of&nbsp;<code>Authorization: Bearer&nbsp;{AccessToken}</code>.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Request to Protected Resource Endpoint
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 3.</p>
<p>shall not accept access tokens in the query parameters stated in Section 2.3 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage RFC6750;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, protected resource endpoints must not accept a query parameter in the format of&nbsp;<code>access_token={AccessToken}</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 4.</p>
<p>shall verify that the access token is neither expired nor revoked;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 5.</p>
<p>shall verify that the scope associated with the access token authorizes access to the resource it is representing;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 6.</p>
<p>shall identify the associated entity to the access token;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 7.</p>
<p>shall only return the resource identified by the combination of the entity implicit in the access and the granted scope and otherwise return errors as in Section 3.1 of RFC6750;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are general steps of access token verification that protected resource endpoints are expected to take.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-3.1">3.1. Error Codes</a>” of RFC 6750 defines three error codes. They are&nbsp;<code>invalid_request</code>,&nbsp;<code>invalid_token</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>insufficient_scope</code>. One point those who are not familiar with RFC 6750 may feel strange is that an error code is embedded not in the response body but in the&nbsp;<code>WWW-Authenticate</code> HTTP header.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 RFC 6750 Error Response
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 8.</p>
<p>shall encode the response in UTF-8 if applicable;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 9.</p>
<p>shall send the&nbsp;<code>Content-type</code>&nbsp;HTTP header&nbsp;<code>Content-Type: application/json;&nbsp;</code>if applicable;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Protected resource endpoints in FAPI are expected to return their responses in JSON format.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 10.</p>
<p>shall send the server date in HTTP&nbsp;<code>Date</code>&nbsp;header as in Section 7.1.1.2 of RFC7231;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The format of&nbsp;<code>Date</code>&nbsp;header is defined in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1">7.1.1.1. Date/Time Formats</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231">RFC 7231</a>. Below is an example.</p>
 Date: Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT 
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 11.</p>
<p>shall set the response header&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;to the value received from the corresponding FAPI client request header or to a RFC4122 UUID value if the request header was not provided to track the interaction, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id: c770aef3-6784-41f7-8e0e-ff5f97bddb3a</code>;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a requirement specific to FAPI. Responses from FAPI protected resource endpoints must include an&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;header.</p>
<p>When an incoming request has&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>, the same value of the header must be included in the response. Otherwise, the protected resource endpoint must generate a new value for&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 12.</p>
<p>shall log the value of&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;in the log entry; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is also specific to FAPI. This requirement doesn’t have any impact on request and response formats, but this can make it easy to correlate server-side logs and client-side logs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 13.</p>
<p>shall not reject requests with a&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address</code>&nbsp;header containing a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 14.</p>
<p>should support the use of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) [CORS] and or other methods as appropriate to enable JavaScript clients to access the endpoint if it decides to provide access to JavaScript clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if a protected resource endpoint wants to allow JavaScript clients to access it from anywhere, the endpoint should include an&nbsp;<code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>&nbsp;header in responses.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Clients to Protected Resources 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#client-provisions">6.2.2. Client provisions</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for clients to follow in accessing protected resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 1.</p>
<p>shall send access tokens in the HTTP header as in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage RFC6750; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, clients send an access token in the format of&nbsp;<code>Authorization: Bearer&nbsp;{AccessToken}</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 2.</p>
<p>(withdrawn);</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 3.</p>
<p>may send the last time the customer logged into the client in the&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-auth-date</code>&nbsp;header where the value is supplied as a HTTP-date as in Section 7.1.1.1 of RFC7231, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-auth-date: Tue, 11 Sep 2012 19:43:31 GMT</code>;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 4.</p>
<p>may send the customer’s IP address if this data is available in the&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address</code>&nbsp;header, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address: 2001:DB8::1893:25c8:1946</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address: 198.51.100.119</code>; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 5.</p>
<p>may send the&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;request header, in which case the value shall be a RFC4122 UUID to the server to help correlate log entries between client and server, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id: c770aef3-6784-41f7-8e0e-ff5f97bddb3a</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are FAPI-specific HTTP headers. It is up to clients whether to send the headers or not.</p>

 Part 1: Security Considerations 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#security-considerations">7. Security considerations</a>” of “Part 1” lists security considerations. Summary is as follows.</p>
<p>7.1.&nbsp;— Follow&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp195">BCP 195</a>. Use TLS 1.2 or newer. Follow&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125">RFC 6125</a>.</p>
<p>7.2.&nbsp;— Part 1 doesn’t authenticate authorization request and response.</p>
<p>7.3.&nbsp;— Part 1 doesn’t assure message integrity of authorization request.</p>
<p>7.4.1.&nbsp;— Part 1 doesn’t discuss encryption of authorization request.</p>
<p>7.4.2.&nbsp;— Be careful not to leak information through logs.</p>
<p>7.4.3.&nbsp;— Be careful not to leak information through referrer. Make duration of access tokens short.</p>
<p>7.5.&nbsp;— Native applications shall follow&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212">BCP 212</a>&nbsp;but must not support “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.1">Private-Use URI Scheme Redirection</a>” and “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.3">Loopback Interface Redirection</a>”. They must use&nbsp;<code>https</code>&nbsp;for the scheme of redirect URI as introduced in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.2">Claimed https Scheme URI Redirection</a>”.</p>
<p>7.6.&nbsp;— Both FAPI implementation and underlying OAuth/OIDC implementation must be complete and correct. See&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Certification</a>.</p>
<p>7.7.&nbsp;— Use a separate&nbsp;<code>issuer</code>&nbsp;per brand if multiple brands need to be supported.</p>
<p>“Part 2” provides solutions for security considerations listed in “Part 1”, for example, by making “request object” mandatory. “Part 2” is recommended when higher security than “Part 1” is needed.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Part 2: Advanced 
<p>Next, let’s read “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html">Part 2</a>” which defines advanced security profile.</p>
 Detached Signature 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#id-token-as-detached-signature">5.1.1. ID Token as Detached Signature</a>” of “Part 2” states that it uses “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken">ID token</a>” as “detached signature”.</p>
<p>An ID token is signed by an authorization server, so even if an attacker tampered the content of the ID token, it could be detected. A client application that has received an ID token can confirm that the ID token has not been tampered by verifying the signature of the ID token.</p>
<p>If an authorization server embeds hash values of response parameters (such as&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>state</code>) into an ID token, a client application can confirm that the values of the response parameters have not been tampered by computing hash values of the response parameter values and comparing them to the hash values embedded in the ID token. In the context, the ID token is regarded as a detached signature.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 ID Token as Detached Signature
<p>For the&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;response parameter that represents an authorization code,&nbsp;<code>c_hash</code>&nbsp;has already been defined in OIDC Core as a claim that represents the hash value of&nbsp;<code>code</code>. Likewise,&nbsp;<code>at_hash</code>&nbsp;has been defined as a claim that represents the hash value of&nbsp;<code>access_token</code>.</p>
<p>What is missing is a claim that represents the hash value of the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;response parameter. So, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#id-token-as-detached-signature">5.1.1. ID Token as Detached Signature</a>” defines&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;for that purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>s_hash<br>
State hash value. Its value is the base64url encoding of the left-most half of the hash of the octets of the ASCII representation of the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;value, where the hash algorithm used is the hash algorithm used in the&nbsp;<code>alg</code>&nbsp;header parameter of the ID Token’s JOSE header. For instance, if the&nbsp;<code>alg</code>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<code>HS512</code>, hash the state value with SHA-512, then take the left-most 256 bits and base64url encode them. The&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;value is a case sensitive string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because “Part 2” uses ID tokens as detached signatures, even if client applications don’t need ID tokens in their application layer, they have to send authorization requests that require an ID token. To be exact, they have to include&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter. This is the reason that the second requirement in “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#authorization-server">5.2.2. Authorization Server</a>” is saying&nbsp;“shall require the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;values&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>”.</p>
<p>However, since Implementer’s Draft 2,&nbsp;ID tokens don’t have to be used as detached signatures when JARM is used. It is because the entire set of response parameters is packed into a JWT.</p>
 Part 2: Requirements for Authorization Server 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#authorization-server">5.2.2. Authorization server</a>” of “Part 2” lists requirements for authorization server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 1.</p>
<p>shall require a JWS signed JWT request object passed by value with the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter or by reference with the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameters are defined in “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests">6. Passing Request Parameters as JWTs</a>” of OIDC Core. To use these parameters, the first step is&nbsp;to pack request parameters into a JWT. This JWT is called “request object”. An authorization request (1) passes the request object as the value of the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter directly or (2) puts the request object somewhere accessible from the authorization server and passes the URI pointing to the location as the value of the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code> parameter.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Passing a Request Object by Value
<p>Signing a request object is not mandatory in OIDC Core, but signing is mandatory in FAPI Part 2. If request objects are signed, authorization servers can confirm that the request parameters have not been tampered by verifying signatures of the request objects.</p>
<p>To be honest, what surprised me most when I read the FAPI specification for the first time (many years ago) is this requirement. It’s because I knew from my experience it is hard to implement the request object feature on authorization server side. As the feature is hard to implement and optional in OIDC, there are many authorization server implementations that claim they support OIDC but don’t support request object.&nbsp;Be careful not to choose an authorization server implementation that doesn’t support request object if you want to build a system that supports FAPI Part 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 2.</p>
<p>shall require</p>
<p>1. the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;values&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>, or</p>
<p>2. the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;in conjunction with the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>jwt</code>;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To use ID token as detached signature, even if an ID token is not needed in the application layer,&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;must be included in the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter.</p>
<p>But, as mentioned in the previous section,&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;doesn’t have to be included in the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter when JARM is used. “When JARM is used” is, to be concrete, “when the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;request parameter is included and its value is one of&nbsp;<code>query.jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>fragment.jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>form_post.jwt</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>jwt</code>”.</p>
<p>NOTE: ID2 requires that&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;be either&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>code id_token token</code>&nbsp;when JARM is not used, but the Final version has removed&nbsp;<code>code id_token token</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 3.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 4.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 5.</p>
<p>shall only issue sender-constrained access tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ID2, this clause was&nbsp;“shall only issue authorization code, access token, and refresh token that are holder of key bound;”. However, because the requirement was impractical, it was changed to the current one. See&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/202">FAPI Issue 202</a>&nbsp;for details if you are interested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 6.</p>
<p>shall support MTLS as mechanism for constraining the legitimate senders of access tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ID2, this clause was&nbsp;“shall support [OAUTB] or [MTLS] as a holder of key mechanisms;”. However, OAUTB (Token Binding) was removed from the Final version due to its unlikeliness of future availability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 7.</p>
<p>(withdrawn);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 8.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 9.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 10.</p>
<p>shall only use the parameters included in the signed request object passed via the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;</p>
<p>shall require that all parameters are present inside the signed request object passed in the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ID2, this requirement was&nbsp;“shall require that all parameters are present inside the signed request object passed in the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;”. The expression was changed but the point remains the same. A request object must include all request parameters to conform to FAPI Part 2.</p>
<p>This is different from OIDC Core which allows request parameters to be put inside or outside a request object and merges them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 11.</p>
<p>may support the pushed authorization request endpoint as described in PAR;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “pushed authorization request endpoint” is a new endpoint defined in “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-par/">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>” (PAR). A client application can register an authorization request at the endpoint and obtain a&nbsp;Request URI&nbsp;which represents the registered authorization request. The client specifies the issued Request URI as the value of the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;request parameter when sending an authorization request to the authorization endpoint.</p>
<p>The following diagram excerpted from “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/illustrated-par-oauth-2-0-pushed-authorization-requests-652d71ed5cfb">Illustrated PAR: OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>” shows the authorization code flow which utilizes the pushed authorization request endpoint.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Authorization Code Flow with Pushed Authorization Request Endpoint
<p>HISTORY:&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-ID2.html#request-object-endpoint">The 7th section of ID2</a>&nbsp;showed an idea about pre-registration of an authorization request. The section named the endpoint for the pre-registration “request object endpoint”. The specification of PAR was developed based on the idea. As a result, the FAPI Final version has withdrawn the 7th section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 12.</p>
<p>(withdrawn)</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 13.</p>
<p>shall require the request object to contain an&nbsp;<code>exp</code>&nbsp;claim that has a lifetime of no longer than 60 minutes after the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OIDC Core does not require that request objects include the&nbsp;<code>exp</code>&nbsp;claim. In contrast, FAPI Part 2 requires&nbsp;<code>exp</code>&nbsp;as a mandatory claim.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Final version has added a requirement&nbsp;“a lifetime of no longer than 60 minutes after the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim”. Because of this requirement, the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim has become mandatory.</p>
<p>The new requirement is a breaking change from a viewpoint of client applications because authorization servers now reject authorization requests whose request object does not include the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim. As a matter of fact, some test cases in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite">conformance suite</a>&nbsp;had to be updated for the new requirement.</p>
<p>Authorization server implementations may provide a mechanism to mitigate the impact of the breaking change. For example, Authlete has defined&nbsp;<code><a href="https://authlete.github.io/authlete-java-common/com/authlete/common/dto/Service.html#isNbfOptional--">Service.nbfOptional</a></code>&nbsp;flag that indicates whether the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code> claim in the request object is optional even when the authorization request is regarded as a FAPI-Part2 request. The value of the flag can be changed by “nbf Claim” in the Service Owner Console.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Service Configuration: nbf Claim
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 14.</p>
<p>shall authenticate the confidential client using one of the following methods (this overrides FAPI Security Profile 1.0 – Part 1: clause 5.2.2-4):</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<code>tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;as specified in section 2 of MTLS, or</p>
<p>2.<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;as specified in section 9 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that&nbsp;<code>client_secret_jwt</code> is not allowed in Part 2. This is different from Part 1.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication Methods in FAPI
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 15.</p>
<p>shall return the&nbsp;<code>aud</code>&nbsp;claim in the request object to be, or to be an array containing, the OP’s Issuer Identifier URL;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement was added by the Final version. Client applications have to put the&nbsp;<code>aud</code>&nbsp;claim in request objects. The value of&nbsp;“OP’s Issuer Identifier URL”&nbsp;can be found in the discovery document as the value of the&nbsp;<code>issuer</code>&nbsp;metadata (cf. OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0,&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata">3. OpenID Provider Metadata</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 16.</p>
<p>shall not support public clients;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement is a new one added by the Final version, but it is said that it has been logically impossible to support public clients in the context of FAPI Part 2 since older FAPI versions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 17.</p>
<p>shall require the request object to contain an&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim that is no longer than 60 minutes in the past; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 13th requirement implies that the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim is mandatory. This 17th requirement states it explicitly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 18.</p>
<p>shall require PAR requests, if supported, to use PKCE (RFC7636) with&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“PAR” here is “OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature</p>
<p>In addition, if the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>value&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;is used, the authorization server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 5.2.2.1. lists requirements for authorization servers which are applied when an ID token is used as a detached signature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 1.</p>
<p>shall support OIDC;</p>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 2.</p>
<p>shall support signed ID Tokens;</p>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 3.</p>
<p>should support signed and encrypted ID Tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a viewpoint of OIDC, these requirements are not new. By definition, ID tokens are always signed. Encryption of ID tokens is optional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 4.</p>
<p>shall return ID Token as a detached signature to the authorization response;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requires that an authorization server issue an ID token, but because the condition written at the top of Section 5.2.2.1 requires that&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;be included in&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;and so an ID token is issued as a general consequence, this requirement doesn’t have to exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 5.</p>
<p>shall include state hash,&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>, in the ID Token to protect the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;value if the client supplied a value for&nbsp;<code>state</code>.&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;may be omitted from the ID Token returned from the Token Endpoint when&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;is present in the ID Token returned from the Authorization Endpoint; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When JARM is used, this requirement doesn’t have to be followed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 6.</p>
<p>should not return sensitive PII in the ID Token in the authorization response, but if it needs to, then it should encrypt the ID Token.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PII is short for “Personally Identifiable Information”.</p>
<p>The feature of ID token encryption has existed since OIDC Core. When the encryption algorithm for ID tokens is an asymmetric one, the authorization server must either (1) manage public keys of client applications directly in its database or (2) fetch JWK Set documents from the locations pointed to by clients’&nbsp;<code>jwks_uri</code>&nbsp;metadata and extract public keys from the documents.</p>
<p>For signing ID tokens, it is server-side keys only that an authorization server has to handle.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 ID Token Signing
<p>In contrast, if an authorization server wants to support encryption of ID tokens, the authorization server has to handle client-side keys, too.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 ID Token Encryption
<p>This is the reason that not a small number of authorization server implementations don’t support ID token encryption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5.2.2.2. JARM</p>
<p>In addition, if the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;is used in conjunction with the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>jwt</code>, the authorization server</p>
<p>5.2.2.2. JARM, 1.</p>
<p>shall create JWT-secured authorization responses as specified in JARM, Section 4.3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This clause does not include any FAPI-specific requirements. It just says that JARM implementations should function as the JARM specification requires.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;does not contain&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>, no ID token is issued. Therefore, an ID token cannot be used as a detached signature. In this case, JARM has to be used to assure that the authorization response has not been tampered.</p>
 Part 2: Requirements for Confidential Client 
<p>The FAPI Final version has renamed Part 2: Section 5.2.3 from “Public client” to “Confidential client”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 1.</p>
<p>shall support MTLS as mechanism for sender-constrained access tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, the authorization server must issue certificated-bound access tokens as defined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-client-certifica">Section 3</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 2.</p>
<p>shall include the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter as defined in Section 6 of OIDC in the authentication request;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As listed in the list of requirements for authorization servers, either the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter or the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter must be included. Note that OIDC Core says&nbsp;“If one of these parameters is used, the other MUST NOT be used in the same request.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 3.</p>
<p>shall ensure the Authorization Server has authenticated the user to an appropriate Level of Assurance for the client’s intended purpose;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement states just that the user shall be authenticated appropriately. The FAPI Final version removed the requirement&nbsp;“by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim”&nbsp;which once existed in the clause.</p>
<p>HISTORY:</p>
<p>In ID2, this requirement was&nbsp;“shall request user authentication at LoA 3 or greater by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim as defined in section 5.5.1.1 of [OIDC];”.</p>
<p>When a client wants to require claims as essential ones, the&nbsp;<code>acr_values</code>&nbsp;request parameter cannot be used. Instead, a client must use the&nbsp;<code>claims</code>&nbsp;request parameter, pass JSON as its value, and include&nbsp;<code>{“essential":true}</code>&nbsp;inside the JSON. The following is an example of JSON that needs to be given as the value of the&nbsp;<code>claims</code>&nbsp;request parameter in order to mark&nbsp;<code>urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver</code> as an essential ACR.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Claims for Essential ACR
<p>BTW, this requirement is loosened in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/">UK Open Banking</a>&nbsp;which is based on FAPI Part 2. That is, clients don’t have to require ACRs as essential. Probably, it is not intentional. I guess that the snapshot of FAPI specification which was referred to when&nbsp;Open Banking Profile&nbsp;(OBP) was developed didn’t contain the sentence, “by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim”.</p>
<p>The official Financial-grade API conformance test suite (<a href="https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite">conformance-suite</a>) developed and maintained by&nbsp;<a href="https://fintechlabs.io/">FinTechLabs.io</a>&nbsp;contains test cases for OBP. When FinTechLabs ran the OBP test cases using Authlete to test the test suite itself, they encountered an error. Because Authlete strictly follows FAPI specification, Authlete reported&nbsp;“<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim is not required as essential.”&nbsp;However, the expected behavior in the context of OBP is to ignore the FAPI requirement.</p>
<p>The right approach for the error was to amend OBP (to make OBP compliant with the latest FAPI specification). However, I was given explanation like&nbsp;“if the official conformance test suite did it, all the existing OBP implementations wouldn’t be able to pass the official tests. Changing the tests at this timing might cause delay in the officially-announced schedule of Open Banking.”</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided to tweak Authlete and added OPEN_BANKING option in addition to FAPI option.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Supported Service Profiles (in Service Owner Console provided by Authlete)
<p>If OPEN_BANKING is enabled, Authlete dare not to check if the&nbsp;<code>acr</code> claim is required as essential even in the context of FAPI Part 2. The code snippet below is the actual implementation excerpted from Authlete’s source code.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Code to judge whether acr should be required as an essential claim
<p>As a result of this, Authlete is listed as a platform vendor that has passed “<a href="https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/126321042/Open+Banking+Security+Profile+Conformance">Open Banking Security Profile Conformance</a>”.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Authlete listed in Open Banking Security Profile Conformance
<p>~HISTORY END</p>
<p>However, again, the FAPI Final has removed the requirement&nbsp;“by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim”, so Authlete no longer checks whether ACRs are requested as essential ones. Therefore, the flag OPEN_BANKING is not meaningful any more.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If request parameters are all put into a request object, either the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter or the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter is sufficient. However, if parameters that are mandatory in OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Core (e.g.&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>) are omitted, the request is no longer compliant with OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Core. Therefore, parameters that are mandatory in OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Core must be put outside the request object duplicately even if they exist inside the request object.</p>
<p>The FAPI Final version has added a condition&nbsp;“if not using PAR”. This implies that the set of request parameters don’t have to be compliant with OAuth 2.0 / OIDC when PAR is used. This incompatibility comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-jwsreq/">JWT Secured Authorization Request</a>&nbsp;(JAR). See “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/implementers-note-about-jar-fff4cbd158fe">Implementer’s note about JAR (JWT Secured Authorization Request)</a>” for details.</p>

<p>The same requirement can be found in Section 5.2.2. Authorization server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 15.</p>
<p>shall use RFC7636 with&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method if using PAR; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, an authorization request must include&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method=S256</code>&nbsp;request parameter when PAR is used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 16.</p>
<p>shall additionally send a duplicate of the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;parameter/value using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax to the authorization endpoint, as required by Section 5 of JAR, if using PAR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PAR specification requires that authorization servers handle request objects based on the rules defined in JAR. The JAR specification has made the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter optional, but the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;remains mandatory. See “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/implementers-note-about-jar-fff4cbd158fe">Implementer’s note about JAR (JWT Secured Authorization Request)</a>” for details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature</p>
<p>In addition, if the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;is used, the client</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 5.2.3.1. lists requirements for client applications which are applied when an ID token is used as a detached signature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 1.</p>
<p>shall include the value&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;into the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;parameter in order to activate OIDC support;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a FAPI-specific requirement. OIDC Core requires that an OIDC request include&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;parameter. See the explanation about the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;parameter written in&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest">Section 3.1.2.1. Authentication Request</a>&nbsp;in OIDC Core for details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 2.</p>
<p>shall require JWS signed ID Token be returned from endpoints;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing new from OIDC’s viewpoint. By definition, ID tokens are always signed. And when&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;contains&nbsp;<code>openid</code>, both the authorization endpoint and the token endpoint return an ID token. See “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/diagrams-of-all-the-openid-connect-flows-6968e3990660">Diagrams of All The OpenID Connect Flows</a>” for details about what the endpoints return.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 3.</p>
<p>shall verify that the authorization response was not tampered using ID Token as the detached signature;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, client applications have to compute hash values of response parameters outside the issued ID token and compare the values to the hash values in the ID token.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 4.</p>
<p>shall verify that&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;value is equal to the value calculated from the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;value in the authorization response in addition to all the requirements in 3.3.2.12 of OIDC; and</p>
<p>NOTE: This enables the client to verify that the authorization response was not tampered with, using the ID Token as a detached signature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement particularly mentions the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter and the&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;claim in the ID token although they are just one of parameter/hash pairs that have to be considered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 5.</p>
<p>shall support both signed and signed &amp; encrypted ID Tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By definition, ID tokens are always signed. When ID tokens are encrypted, the order of signing and encrypting is “sign then encrypt”. As a result, an encrypted ID token takes the form of “Nested JWT” as illustrated below.</p>

 Part 2: Security Considerations 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#security-considerations">8. Security considerations</a>” of “Part 2” lists security considerations. Summary is as follows.</p>
<p>8.1&nbsp;— This specification references security considerations in&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10">Section 10</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819">RFC 6819</a>.</p>
<p>8.2&nbsp;— Protected resource endpoints shall accept only certificate-bound access tokens.</p>
<p>8.3.1&nbsp;— Clients should use a different redirect URI per authorization server.</p>
<p>8.3.2&nbsp;— Authorization codes and client secrets are passed to attackers if developers are deceived into using a fake token endpoint.</p>
<p>8.3.3&nbsp;— Hybrid flow or JARM can be used as a countermeasure for IdP mix-up attack.</p>
<p>8.3.4&nbsp;— (removed)</p>
<p>8.3.5&nbsp;— Because an access token is bound to an X.509 certificate, stolen access tokens cannot be used without corresponding certificates.</p>
<p>8.4.1&nbsp;— RFC 6749 doesn’t assure message integrity of authorization request and response.</p>
<p>8.4.2&nbsp;— Using request objects prevents authorization request parameter injection attack.</p>
<p>8.4.3&nbsp;— Using hybrid flow or JARM prevents authorization response parameter injection attack.</p>
<p>8.5&nbsp;— Cipher suites for TLS 1.2 are restricted.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#tls-considerations">8.5. TLS considerations</a>” of “Part 2” permits only the following cipher suites for TLS communication when the TLS version in use is below 1.3.</p>
 
 <code>TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code> 
 <code>TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code> 
 <code>TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code> 
 <code>TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code> 
 
<p>But, from a viewpoint of interoperability of web browsers, additional cipher suites allowed in the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp195">BCP 195</a>&nbsp;are permitted for authorization endpoints.</p>
<p>Because I couldn’t find any good reasons to exclude the following cipher suites,</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<code>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code></p>
<p>6.<code>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code></p>
<p>I created&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/216">Issue 216</a>&nbsp;(TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suites) to suggest adding them to the list of permitted cipher suites. 1 year and 4 months later, the issue was closed with the reason that FAPI now allows TLS 1.3.</p>
<p>8.6&nbsp;—&nbsp;<code>PS256</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>ES256</code>&nbsp;only are allowed for JWS signature algorithm.</p>
<p>Signing algorithms of JWS are listed in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.1">3.1. “alg” (Algorithm) Header Parameter Values for JWS</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518">RFC 7518</a>&nbsp;(JSON Web Algorithms). Among the 13 algorithms, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#algorithm-considerations">8.6. Algorithm considerations</a>” of “Part 2” permits&nbsp;<code>PS256</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>ES256</code>&nbsp;only. The section explicitly states that RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (e.g.&nbsp;<code>RS256</code>) should not be used and&nbsp;<code>none</code> must not be used.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 JWS algorithms permitted by Financial-grade API, Part 2
<p>FYI: JWT is used at the following places in an authorization server implementation.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 JWT Usage in Authorization Server Implementation
<p>8.6.1&nbsp;—&nbsp;<code>RSA1_5</code>&nbsp;encryption algorithm must not be used.</p>
<p>This requirement about encryption algorithms was added by the FAPI Final version. FAPI prohibits&nbsp;<code>RSA1_5</code>. The algorighm identifier is defined in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-4.1">4.1. “alg” (Algorithm) Header Parameter Values for JWE</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518">RFC 7518</a>&nbsp;(JSON Web Algorithms). The identifier represents RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5.</p>
<p>8.7&nbsp;— Use certified FAPI implementations.</p>
<p>8.8&nbsp;—Don’t allow privileged actions without an access token.</p>
<p>8.9&nbsp;— Keys for signature verification should be accessible via the&nbsp;<code>jwks_uri</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>jwks</code>&nbsp;client metadata (cf.&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>) and the&nbsp;<code>jwks_uri</code>&nbsp;server metadata (cf.&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414">RFC 8414</a>).</p>
<p>8.10&nbsp;— A compromise of any client that shares the same key with other clients would result in a compromise of all the clients.</p>
<p>8.11&nbsp;— JWK sets should not contain multiple keys with the same&nbsp;<code>kid</code>, but other key attributes may be used to select one among multiple key candidates.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 FAPI implementation 
<p>This chapter picks up some topics related to FAPI implementation.</p>
 Baseline or Advanced? 
<p>When a client application requests an access token and accesses APIs with the access token, which security profile should apply, FAPI Part 1 or FAPI Part 2, or neither of them?</p>
<p>Some implementations may configure themselves statically and others may make the decision dynamically at runtime.&nbsp;The FAPI specification mentions nothing about how to determine which security profile should apply.</p>
<p>A simple approach would be&nbsp;“Regard all authorization requests as FAPI Part 2 requests.”&nbsp;Actually, UK Open Banking has adopted this approach. A hard-coded implementation like this may be acceptable if the system development is a one-time work.</p>
<p>However, this approach is not appropriate for a generic authorization server implementation. It’s because a hard-coded implementation hinders flexibility of system design too much. Therefore, in a generic implementation, it is better to judge dynamically at runtime whether an authorization request is for FAPI Part 1 or for FAPI Part 2 (or for normal OAuth 2.0 / OIDC).</p>
<p>If so, how to judge dynamically? The conclusion everyone will eventually reach after thinking will be just one. It is&nbsp;judged by checking the requested scopes.</p>
<p>(Note: Another possible way would be to utilize the&nbsp;<code>resource</code>&nbsp;request parameter defined in “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html">RFC 8707 Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0</a>”.)</p>
<p>For example, (1) prepare scopes named&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>write</code>, (2) adopt a rule where the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;scope requires FAPI Part 1 requirements be satisfied and the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope requires FAPI Part 2 requirements be satisfied, and (3) implement APIs so that they interpret the scopes accordingly. If APIs are implemented in this way, the implementation of an authorization endpoint can change its behavior dynamically by (a) applying FAPI Part 2 requirements when the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter includes the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope, (b) applying FAPI Part 1 requirements when the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter does not include the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope but includes the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;scope, and (c) applying normal OAuth 2.0 and OIDC requirements when the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter includes neither the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;scope nor the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope.</p>
<p>How to implement the scope-based switch? For instance, one approach might be to regard scopes whose name starts with&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;as scopes for FAPI Part 1. However, this approach imposes heavy restrictions on scope names. If that is the case, what approach has Authlete adopted?</p>
<p>As the first step, Authlete implemented a generic mechanism to set arbitrary attributes to each scope. On the mechanism, Authlete treats the attribute name&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;in a special way. An attribute having name&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;and value&nbsp;<code>r</code>&nbsp;represents Read-Only (= Baseline). Likewise, an attribute having name&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;and value&nbsp;<code>rw</code>&nbsp;represents Read-and-Write (Advanced).</p>
<p>The web console for FAPI-aware Authlete (version 2.0+) provides UI for scope attributes. The screenshot below defines a scope named&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;with an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=r</code>.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Scope Settings for FAPI Read-Only
<p>Authlete’s&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.authlete.com/#auth-authorization-api">/auth/authorization API</a>&nbsp;that parses an authorization request checks scopes listed in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter in the authorization request and regards the request as a request for FAPI Part 2 if the scope list includes a scope that has an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=rw</code>. If the scope list does not include any scope having an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=rw</code>&nbsp;but includes a scope having an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=r</code>, the authorization request is regarded as a request for FAPI Part 1. In other cases, the authorization request is treated as a normal OAuth 2.0 / OIDC request.</p>
<p>NOTE: In ID2, the names of FAPI Part 1 and Part 2 were “Read-Only Security Profile” and “Read and Write Security Profile”. The FAPI Final verison renamed them to “Baseline Security Profile” and “Advanced Security Profile”. The values of&nbsp;<code>r</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>rw</code>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;attribute were determined based on the old names.</p>
 Mutual TLS 
<p>“Mutual TLS” has three meanings as listed below (as already explained previously).</p>
 
 TLS communication using a client certificate 
 Client authentication using a client certificate 
 Certificate binding 
 
<p>The first part is handled by API management solutions. On the other hand, the second and the third parts don’t necessarily have to be handled by the API management layer. Rather, a better system architecture would handle them in a different layer that is independent of the API management layer.</p>
<p>Because of its unique architecture, Authlete doesn’t take on any task in the API management layer. That is, Authlete does nothing for the first part. On the other hand, Authlete supports the second and the third parts. Thanks to this, with Authlete, systems can support MTLS (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>) required by FAPI on any API management solution that developers want to use. I actually tried MTLS on Amazon API Gateway and wrote an article titled “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/tutorial/financial_grade_apigateway/">Financial-grade Amazon API Gateway</a>” to explains how to achieve it.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Example of Component Deployment for MTLS on Amazon API Gateway
<p>Any API management solution can support MTLS by using Authlete as long as the solution provides a mechanism which enables developers to access the client certificate used in TLS communication.</p>
<p>Existing API management solutions may try to implement MTLS directly. However, it would take time, and above all, it is not a good system design to support the functionality directly in the API management layer. At the time of this writing, if you use an API management solution provided by one of giant cloud vendors, Authlete is the best answer for MTLS.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/hYhHan5FzlA">video</a>&nbsp;below is a session in “<a href="https://financial-api.net/en/">Financial APIs Workshop</a>” that took place in Tokyo on July 24, 2018. In the video,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinricher/">Justin Richer</a>, one of the most famous software engineers in the community and the author of “<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/oauth-2-in-action">OAuth 2 in Action</a>”, is explaining Authlete’s MTLS implementation.</p>
<p>The material and transcript of the presentation are available at “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/resources/videos/20180724/authlete-fapi-enhancements/">Authlete FAPI Enhancements</a>”.</p>
 Access Token Duration 
<p>This is not related to FAPI, but I explain this feature here because I’m often consulted about the feature in the context of Bank API by customers who want to make duration of access tokens for remittance shorter than that of access tokens for other purposes.</p>
<p>The functionality can be achieved by making access token duration shorter when an authorization request contains a scope for remittance. For example, if an API for remittance requires a scope named&nbsp;<code>remit</code>, the authorization server would shorten access token duration when an authorization request contains the scope.</p>
<p>Authlete supports the functionality by treating a scope attribute named&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;in a special way.</p>
<p>Authlete checks all scope attributes of requested scopes, picks up the smallest value among values of&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attributes, and uses it as the duration of an access token being issued. If none of the requested scopes has an&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attribute, Authlete uses the default value of access token duration set per authorization server instance. If the default value is smaller than the smallest value of&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attributes, the default value is used.</p>
<p>The screenshot below shows how to set&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration=300</code>as a scope attribute.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Scope Settings for Access Token Duration
<p>Likewise, duration of refresh tokens can be set by utilizing&nbsp;<code>refresh_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attributes.</p>
<p>NOTE: Authlete 2.1 and newer versions support “access token duration per client”. See “<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/how-to-calculate-token-duration">How Authlete determines token duration</a>” on&nbsp;<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/">Authlete Knowledge Base</a>&nbsp;for details.</p>
 Access Token with Transaction Information 
<p>This feature is not related to FAPI, either, but I explain it here as I’m often consulted about it in the context of Bank API by customers who want to associate detailed transaction information with an access token. I hear that some regulations in Europe require an access token be issued per transaction under some conditions.</p>
<p>This functionality cannot be achieved by “scope attribute” which was explained in “Access Token Duration” because the functionality requires data be handled per access token, not per scope.</p>
<p>Since old days, Authlete has provided a mechanism to set arbitrary key-value pairs to an access token. This feature can be utilized to associate transaction information with an access token. Technical details about this feature are explained in “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/documents/definitive_guide/extra_properties">Extra Properties</a>”. See also “<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/extra-properties">How to add extra properties to an access token</a>” in&nbsp;<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/">Authlete Knowledge Base</a>.</p>
<p>However, note that it is not a smart way to associate detailed information such as amount of money with an access token directly. Instead, a recommended way is to (1) store detailed transaction information into another database and (2) associate the unique identifier of the database record with an access token.</p>
 Authorization Details 
<p>Since the version 2.2, Authlete supports “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-rar/">OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests</a>” (RAR). The standard specification adds a request/response parameter,&nbsp;<code>authorization_details</code>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>authorization_details</code>&nbsp;parameter is used to enable an access token to hold detailed information about authorization.&nbsp;For example, detailed information about payment such as “How much?”, “To whom?”, etc.</p>
<p>According to the specification, the&nbsp;<code>authorization_details</code>&nbsp;parameter can be used anywhere the&nbsp;<code>scope</code> parameter is used. For instance, (a) in the authorization request, (b) in the token response, (c) in the introspection response, and so on.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 (a) authorization_details in Authorization Request (RAR Section 3)

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 (b) authorization_details in Token Response (RAR Section 7)

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 (c) authorization_details in Introspection Response (RAR Section 8.2)
<p>RAR is an open standard to describe details about authorization and tie the information to an access token. RAR is to be adopted as a component of FAPI 2.0 (cf. “Are there FAPI 2.0 implementations?” in&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI FAQ</a>).</p>
<p>Authlete’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/definitive_guide/extra_properties/">Extra Properties</a>&nbsp;can be used for the same purpose. One functional difference is that Extra Properties can choose to expose or hide extra properties. Hidden extra properties never appear in any OAuth/OIDC responses but can be retrieved by Authlete’s introspection API (<a href="http://docs.authlete.com/#auth-introspection-api">/auth/introspection API</a>). There are some use cases where you want to tie information to an access token but hide the information from the client application and the user. In such cases, Extra Properties is useful.</p>
 Finally 
<p>Thank you for reading this long post till the end.</p>

 Gordian Work 

<p>Our advances on Gordian were linked to a large-scale transition in the meaning of the Gordian system. Prior to 2021, we were offering a variety of applications, but we were simultaneously working with companies to create specifications. This created a real tension. Now that we’ve seen the beginnings of adoption of our best practices, we’ve been able to change the focus of our applications from being consumer-focused to being exemplars for other companies to study. In Q2, we expect this to mature into a Gordian Seal™ program that denotes companies who are producing products that follow the Gordian principles and our best practices. Like similar projects such as the FIDO Alliance, we expect the Gordian Seal to make it easier for everyone in the blockchain ecosystem to work together, creating  bizdev and interoperability opportunities.</p>

<p>Gordian Testing. Blockchain Commons now has three iOS reference apps available for public beta testing via Apple’s Testflight: <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/sJTaoUsM">Gordian Cosigner</a>, <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/0LIl6H1h">Gordian Guardian</a>, and <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/OQHyL0a8">Guardian Wallet</a>. Wallet was our original app, recently updated to support the newest Lifehash and <code>crypto-request</code> features; Cosigner is the companion signing app that we introduced last quarter; and Guardian is our newest release, a key-storage tool for iOS. As reference apps, these projects are mainly meant as exemplars, demonstrating the best practices and principles suggested by the Gordian architecture as well as exemplifying how multiple apps can interact through Airgaps and Universal Resources (URs). See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TosqR8a2OXg">our video</a> for a real-life example of Gordian Cosigner, Guardian, and Wallet working together to securely create a multisig account and sign a PSBT, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19GVOIZNedU">this video</a> that demonstrates AirGap signing between LetheKit and Gordian Cosigner.</p>

<p>Independent Recovery. We are already working to split a new app, “Gordian Recovery”, off of Gordian Guardian. One of our best practices for the Gordian system demands that a user can recover funds from a Gordian-approved wallet even if the company producing it disappears. Gordian Recovery will provide one way to do so, allowing a user to independently use the app to recover and sweep funds held in a multisig wallet, no matter the status of the wallet manufacturer. At its debut, we expect Gordian Recovery to support at least three different companies with their own multisig hardware or software wallet systems. Generally, Guardian Recovery, like Gordian Cosigner, demonstrates how Blockchain Commons will interact with the wallet ecosystem by providing not just specifications, best practices, and references, but also complementary apps that can support third-party wallets.</p>

<p>Keytool Updates. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/keytool-cli">keytool CLI (command-line interface) app</a> also received major upgrades in Q1. We expanded it to support the new UR (Universal Resource) <code>crypto-request</code> and <code>crypto-response</code> features that add support for arbitrary requests. This is a first step in moving away from the <code>m/48'</code> derivation used by current hardware wallets for multisig, which often results in master or cosigner xpub reuse and thus a risk to privacy. This means that we now have the infrastructure to demonstrate different solutions to the problems of <code>m/48'</code>xpub reuse, but there’s still a lot of legacy use cases that need to be resolved. (We also reviewed one solution for the <code>m/48'</code> derivation problem and found it unnecessarily complex, so: onward.)</p>

<p>Lifehash Improvements. Most of the Gordian specifications that we’ve created while working with our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">Airgapped Wallet Community</a> focus on interoperability, particularly moving data across airgaps. Lifehash is something else: it’s a user-interface specification meant to give users trust in the continuity of cryptocurrency accounts without having to depend on reading text addresses, which aren’t user-intuitive. Instead, Lifehash creates unique, colored icons for each account that remain consistent over time. This quarter, we adjusted the colors used by Lifehash so that they look better in black &amp; white printing, and simultaneously experimented with dithering on the 200x200 LetheKit display, to ensure that we could display meaningful information on a worst-case small black &amp; white display.</p>

 

<p></p>

 

<p></p>

 

<p>Lethekit Updates. The DIY <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lethekit/">LetheKit</a> has been our prime reference for testing hardware implementations of our Gordian best practices. Not only did we test it out with dithered Lifehashes last quarter, but we also were able to use its display to test out animated QRs for transferring PSBTs. It worked! (Albeit, slowly.) See also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19GVOIZNedU">this video</a> of LetheKit exporting derived keys to Gordian Signer.</p>

<p>Gordian Adoption. Finally, as noted, we’re very happy to see continued adoption of Gordian. Last quarter, we talked about all of the software and library development being done by wallet companies. This quarter, we’re seeing more companies committing to including SSKRs (Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction), URs (Universal Resources), and other Gordian features in their wallets. <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a> has been expanding its capabilities, while <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a> was the newest to announce their integration of some UR features, including animated PSBTs. Foundation and Sparrow have both been working with us for a while: we’re thrilled to see both hardware and software wallet companies incorporating Blockchain Commons specifications! We’re also aware of two more software-wallet companies who haven’t made announcements yet, and we’ve been extensively working with a third company to produce a Gordian-approved wallet that entirely matches our principles and best practices and adds on some great UI besides. We can now announce that third company is Bitmark …</p>

<p>Autonomy Architecting. Blockchain Commons has been working with Bitmark to design Autonomy, a bitcoin wallet and digital assets manager. Their goal is to make it easy for families to gain independence and preserve generational wealth. Autonomy combines a mobile app with your own dedicated full node running privately in the cloud. We used a partitioned architecture (keys across app+node) and a personal recovery network (using SSKR) to remove all single points of failure. When you transact, everything is multisig between your app and full node. Any single key can fail and you won’t lose your funds. Nothing else like this currently exists in the market.</p>

 Other Advances 

<p>Here’s some details on our other major projects:</p>

<p>Multisig Documents. This quarter, we released our first major expansion to our #SmartCustody tutorials since 2019: a 10,000-word document on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md">Designing Multisig for Independence &amp; Resilience</a>. The state of multisig wasn’t sufficiently advanced to provide specific advice when we originally wrote #SmartCustody, so we’re now happy to include it by breaking down the design of multisig addresses into theoretical, transactional, operational, and functional elements and providing design patterns and examples to help you put those elements together. Want to know why Blockchain Commons is today focused on multisig technology and how to create them to meet your own needs? It’s all here.</p>

<p>DID Recommendation. We’ve been working with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID specification</a> since it was incubated at early <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting-the-Web-of-Trust workshops</a>, and co-authored by Blockchain Commons founder Christopher Allen. We’re thrilled that it’s now a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Candidate Recommendation</a>. There might still be revisions and new candidates, but this is the beginning of the last stage in creating an official internet standard for decentralized identity on the internet.</p>

<p>DID Method Expansion. Meanwhile, Blockchain Commons is doing its own work on DIDs, with a new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/did-method-onion">did:onion method implementation</a>. We’re happy to say that <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/">Spruce Systems</a> is already considering it for their DID resolver. We’re also considering returning to work on our own <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">BTCR DID method</a>, which was one of the first DID methods, but has gotten somewhat out of date with recent updates to Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Apt Packages. We have produced apt packages for installing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli">seedtool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/keytool-cli">keytool</a> for use with Debian and Tails OSes. This is a first step in providing support tools for human-rights activists, which we expect to get more emphasis in our work in Q3.</p>

<p>Legislative Work. Finally, Christopher Allen’s work with legislatures multiplied last quarter. In Wyoming, he led efforts that resulted in the <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">Wyoming Digital Identity Act</a>, which includes a specific definition of digital identity that works toward the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">principles of self-sovereign identity</a>. Work on a private-key-protection bill was less successful, as it had to be withdrawn after being spoiled by an amendment. Christopher has also recently testified before legislatures in <a href="https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/67-2021/testimony/HIBL-3024-20210208-5787-F-ALLEN_CHRISTOPHER.pdf">North Dakota</a> and Nevada. This is all crucial work because actual engineering will ultimately be limited and directed by what states legislate, so we want to make sure the laws fit the technology and the needs of the individual.</p>

<p>Intern Search. We’re thrilled that our Summer 2021 internship program has been sponsored by the <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/1366880813845909506">Humans Rights Foundation</a>. We’ve thus put out <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/32">a call for interns</a>, and we’re expanding our usual development work to also include direct support for activists, who need help to maintain their privacy in potentially hostile regimes. However, to really support activists requires knowing what they need. So, we’re also considering working with interns to do research and conduct interviews to create user engagement models for activists. This would be similar to the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf">Amira model</a> from RWOT. If you are interested in having developers work with or mentor blockchain interns, want to suggest intern projects, or even have engineers who might be interested in working on Blockchain Commons projects briefly during the summer, <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">please mail us</a>.</p>

<p>Taproot &amp; Schnorr First Steps. We may see a major upgrade for Bitcoin as soon as this fall, if Speedy Trial is approved for Taproot and Schnorr. The first will increase privacy for #SmartCustody features such as timelocks and multisig, while the second will allow aggregated multisig, which offer several advantages over traditional ECDSA signatures. Our brand-new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli">musign CLI</a> app provides the first experimental support for Schnorr signatures leveraging the Taproot/Schnorr BIPS, but independent from <code>bitcoind</code>. More to come as we ramp up to this expansion.</p>

 Supporting the Future 

<p>We’ve laid out our initial roadmap for the next two cycles of Blockchain Commons efforts, covering spring and summer. Important topics includes finalizing our Gordian Seal program, solving problems with xpub reuse in Bitcon multisig, supporting and advancing SSKR (Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction) for not just cryptographic seeds but other data, continuing to support and advance URs (Universal Resources) with encrypted and/or signed CBOR, and architecting a new QuickConnect 2.0 for initiating TorGap-based services between peers. If you’d like to know more about our roadmap, especially if you considering becoming a sustaining sponsor or to sponsor a specific project on our roadmap, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">contact us directly</a>.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland — 13 April 2021 — Today Energy Web announced a new initiative, funded by a €1 million grant from Google.org’s Impact Challenge program, to provide a digital framework for coordinating distributed energy resources (DERs) across the transmission and distribution market interface of Europe’s power grid. <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/who-we-are/what-is-climate-kic/">Climate-KIC</a>, the EU’s leading knowledge and innovation community focused on climate, helped to select winning grantees.</p><p>The initiative will leverage the open-source Energy Web stack to make it easy for prosumers and DERs to register and participate in local and regional energy markets. Working with mobile network operators, IoT service providers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and grid operators across Europe, the initiative will foster the procurement of flexibility services in a transparent, non-discriminatory, and market-based way, as prioritized by the <a href="https://acer.europa.eu/en/Electricity/CLEAN_ENERGY_PACKAGE">EU Clean Energy&nbsp;Package</a>.</p><p>Energy Web’s grant comes from the <a href="https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/climate2020">Google.org Impact Challenge on Climate</a>, which commits €10M to fund bold ideas that aim to use technology to accelerate Europe’s progress toward a greener, more-resilient future. It is expected to accelerate the strong momentum Energy Web has already generated working with European grid operators. This grant and initiative will build upon existing open-source software developed to support near-identical use cases with transmission system operators (TSOs) Austrian Power Grid, 50 Hertz, and Elia as well as distribution system operators (DSOs) Electra Caldense and Fluvius. The common theme across these projects is easing the digitization, registration, and participation of DERs in energy markets managed by both DSOs and TSOs. More recently, this same architecture underpinned <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/bebat-launches-easybat-an-open-source-decentralized-solution-for-battery-lifecycle-management-281f2ace61e9">EasyBat</a>, used to track the lifecycle of residential and commercial batteries in&nbsp;Belgium.</p><p>“This Google.org grant and the work it will fund supporting a pan-European electric flexibility market is the culmination of Energy Web’s mission to enable any customer and any asset to participate in any energy market,” explained Walter Kok, CEO of Energy Web. “We are able to harness the flexibility of prosumers to provide value throughout the electricity value chain to make DERs the backbone of the European&nbsp;grid.”</p><p>The initiative will focus on integrating the Energy Web stack with a number of electricity market participants, including but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>  Mobile Network Operators: in order to assign digital identities to all GSM-enabled energy assets via SIM&nbsp;cards.  IoT Service Providers: in order to co-develop SIM cards with electricity-sector roaming capabilities (i.e., independent of the Mobile Network Operator) that will allow energy assets to directly register with the Energy Web technology stack.  OEMs: in order to enable new generations of energy assets to directly embed an identity on the&nbsp;stack.  DSOs / TSOs: once integrated, DSOs will be able to tap into the flexible capacity of DERs connected to their networks and use them to procure flexibility. Likewise, TSOs will be able to simultaneously leverage DERs for regional / national markets in support of safer, greener, more-resilient electricity grids.  <p>Since it is common for Mobile Network Operators, IoT service providers, and payment solution providers to operate their own proprietary data systems and architectures, the project will ensure interoperability between these systems — including multiple blockchains — and the public Energy Web stack. Ultimately, at least 1 million DERs will integrate into electricity markets as part of the Google.org-funded project.</p><p>“We have received an overwhelming number of applications for our Google.org Impact Challenge on Climate,” said Rowan Barnett, head of Google.org in EMEA and APAC. “The Energy Web project is so exciting because it has tremendous transformative potential, not just for Europe, but for power grids around the world. We are catching a glimpse of the future electricity system — one that is inherently decentralized and democratized.”</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. We enable any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors our tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://energyweb.org.">https://energyweb.org.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/google-backs-energy-web-to-harmonize-low-carbon-electricity-markets-across-europe-204c18cd2f12">Google Backs Energy Web to Harmonize Low-Carbon Electricity Markets Across Europe</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Clouds hover over the horizon. The San Gabriel foothills smell of sage and soil after the rain. I feel my muscles begin to relax for the first time in a&nbsp;while.</p><p>I’m not alone. Though serious hurdles remain in the United States and globally, increasing numbers of American adults see hope on the horizon. A recurring Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-poll-coronavirus-americans-hope-4bcc2761-82f0-43d0-b9eb-552f6a9ada71.html">poll</a> shows “hopeful” taking the lead over “stressed” and “frustrated” for the first time since the pandemic began. Roughly one-third of US adults have been vaccinated; the rest will be eligible by the end of April. Recent jobs reports show signs of an economy waking from hibernation. The American Rescue Plan and proposed American Jobs Plan would invest a combined $4 trillion in recovery and infrastructure.</p><p>These new possibilities bring a rush of questions. What does life look like after the pandemic for my community; my generation? How will we juggle work, education, and care to make ends meet? Whose lives and livelihoods are valued? After a year of isolation, where will we find belonging?</p><blockquote>When we look back on 2020, will we remember it as the year everything changed?</blockquote><p>“Disasters are extraordinarily generative,” Rebecca Solnit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/books/excerpt-paradise-built-in-hell.html">writes</a>, but “there is no simple formula for what arises: it has everything to do with who or what individuals or communities were before the disaster.”</p><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">Our new PORTALS report</a> imagines possible futures arising out of today’s disasters. It is the latest installment of the annual <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/trends-to-watch-in-2020-beyond-16d457bf6b48">Trends to Watch</a> series, curated by our Exploration and Future Sensing team to support Omidyar Network’s mission of reimagining systems to build more inclusive and equitable societies. Across our focus areas of <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">Reimagining Capitalism</a>, <a href="https://omidyar.com/responsible-technology-2/">Responsible Technology</a>, and <a href="https://omidyar.com/pluralism/">Pluralism</a>, the work of “reimagining” requires that we interrogate our own assumptions about how systems need to change by <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/listening-to-the-future-5d709ea30d7d">listening to diverse viewpoints</a>.</p><p>Created in collaboration with <a href="https://futurearchitects.com/">Guild of Future Architects</a>, the 2021 report distills four open-ended provocations, designed to stir imagination and action, from a yearlong process of collective foresight. Between November 2019 and February 2021, the Guild invited 1,000 people to participate in a series of virtual sessions asking how systems that shape our daily lives could become more just and inclusive by 2036. A critical part of looking ahead was also looking back at how we arrived at today’s social, economic, and political realities.</p><p>Here are the provocations:</p>  What if shared well-being became the standard of success for our&nbsp;nations?  Are we ready to move from an era that rewards extraction to one that prioritizes regeneration?  How will we move from an era of destabilizing information into an age of trusted&nbsp;wisdom?  Can we dismantle industrial-age silos between work, home, education, play, and community?  <p>Each one pairs with a “Spectrum of Possibility” exercise to stir your own thinking about how imagined futures could become reality. Taken together, we hope that these provocations offer useful foundations for people working now to build tomorrow’s systems.</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">Download the full report&nbsp;here</a>. <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=5">What if shared well-being became the standard of success for our&nbsp;nations?</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=14">Are we ready to move from an era that rewards extraction to one that prioritizes regeneration?</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=23">How will we move from an era of destabilizing information into an age of trusted&nbsp;wisdom?</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=32">Can we dismantle industrial-age silos between work, home, education, play, and community?</a><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">The PORTALS report</a> is a collaboration between Omidyar Network and the Guild of Future Architects. It was envisioned and written by a diverse group of fellows, employees, and consultants, based upon foresight sessions convened by the Guild throughout 2020 involving 1,000+ participants.</p><p>Guild of Future Architects contributors include Sharon Chang, Kamal Sinclair, Rachel Yezbick, Sheena Matheiken, Jessica Clark, Tony Patrick, Amelia Winger-Bearskin, and Robert Sinclair.</p><p>Omidyar Network’s Exploration and Future Sensing team includes Eshanthi Ranasinghe, David Hsu, Julia Solano, and Nicole Allred.

 It was business as&nbsp;usual <p>‘’Human rights protected offline should also be protected online’’</p><p>This was the resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) — the <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/38/L.10/Rev.1">resolution</a> on “the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet” at the 38th Session of the Human Rights Council of July 2018 which affirmed what we all held sacrosanct — that digital rights are human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Internet and digital access have <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ITU_regional_global_Key_ICT_indicator_aggregates_Nov_2020.xlsx">deepened</a> across Africa in the past 20 years, in the process ushering in new vistas of human development. An important dimension of this development has been the expansion of new media, where new technologies such as social media have <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-new-media-platforms-have-become-powerful-across-africa-107294">given voices</a> to the hitherto voiceless and amplifying once stifled perspectives.</p><p>Given that the tight control many authoritarian regimes on the continent exercised relied on having a tight grip on public discourse, the Internet and the new media it spawned soon ran into <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37300272">cross hairs</a> with governments from Cairo to Cape Town. Africa has one of the most censored digital environments in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Pushing back against this censorship is a community of digital rights defenders. A basic, yet important tool in their efforts to promote media freedom is <a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018/05/23/why-and-how-do-we-document-the-impact-of-rights-violations/">documentation</a>. In the aid of digital rights defenders everywhere, here’s a summary of some of the most important developments in digital rights in Africa in Q1&nbsp;2021.</p>Photo: <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/human-humanity-silhouettes-camera-109103/">Pixabay</a> Internet shutdowns and website&nbsp;blocks <p>Sage-like, I had <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/internet-shutdowns-in-2021-c2a4e8dd4845">written presciently</a> in the first week of January that it was not a matter of if, rather when Internet shutdowns will occur in 2021. Like clockwork, the first Internet <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/uganda-shuts-down-internet-during-presidential-election/av-56243961">shutdown</a> happened shortly later in Uganda on January 13 on the eve of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55649467">Presidential elections</a> which saw young activist Robert Kyagulanyi (aka Bobi Wine) challenge Yoweri Museveni, the Ugandan President. The Internet shutdown was ordered by the government in retaliation for Facebook’s move to block a number of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-uganda-election-facebook-idUSKBN29G1H9">pro-government accounts</a>.</p><p>On November 4 2020, the Ethiopian government cut off <a href="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/rest-of-africa/ethiopia-telephone-internet-services-tigray-2731442">telephone and Internet service</a> in the northern region of Tigray at the commencement of military offensive against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The restrictions on telephone and Internet service persisted into 2021. Curiously, numerous Twitter accounts <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/17/ethiopias-cracking-down-tigray-activists-are-spreading-news/">were created</a> elsewhere in the country in the following days to fill the information vacuum created in the Tigray&nbsp;region.</p><p>Following opposition protests after run-off elections in Niger on February 21, mobile Internet service providers <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/niger-election-internet-blackout/">disrupted service</a>. The election was won by Mohamed Bazoum, a former Interior Minister and candidate of the ruling party in the first <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56175439">democratic transition</a> in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>On March 5, Facebook, YouTube, and Whatsapp were <a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/social-media-and-messaging-apps-disrupted-in-senegal-amid-political-unrest-eA1R5pBp">restricted</a> on the Orange/Sonatel network in Senegal following protests against the arrest of opposition politician Ousmane Sonko of the Pastef party. Ousmane Sonko had been earlier accused of rape — an allegation he claimed was <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/03/05/senegal-blocks-social-media/">politically motivated</a>.</p><p>On Election day March 21, there was a disruption to Internet connectivity in Congo. The election, won by incumbent President Dennis Sassou Nguesso who was seeking his fourth term in office, was marked by low <a href="https://www.africanews.com/2021/03/21/congo-election-low-voter-turn-out-internet-shutdown-mark-polls//">voter turn-out</a>. The major opponent to the incumbent Guy-Brice Parfait Kolélas died of Covid-19 on <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56474855">election day</a>, after being flown out to France for medical attention.</p><p>In January, People’s Gazette, a critical website in Nigeria, was <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2021/01/28/nigerian-government-blocks-peoples-gazette-website-over-critical-media-reports">blocked</a> ostensibly from orders from the Nigerian government following an <a href="https://www.gazettengr.com/atiku-rsf-global-rights-gatefield-others-condemn-nigerian-govts-blocking-of-peoples-gazette-website/">investigative report</a> about senior officials of the President.</p> Legal and Policy developments <p>In Kenya, the Finance Act of 2019 empowered the Kenya Revenue Authority to announce a Digital Services Tax in 2020. The tax came into <a href="https://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/12/tnf-kenya-digital-services-tax-regulations-effective-date-2021.html#:~:text=Overview%20of%20the%20digital%20services,of%20the%20gross%20transaction%20value.&amp;text=The%20digital%20services%20tax%20will,services%20through%20a%20digital%20marketplace.">effect</a> on January 1 2021. The tax is 1.5% of the total value of business services <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-africa-47639452?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_live&amp;ns_linkname=6006b04354a69202e80dcf9f%26Kenya%27s%20digital%20tax%20will%20%27undermine%20online%20businesses%27%262021-01-19T15%3A44%3A49.875Z&amp;ns_fee=0&amp;pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:f0b242e5-daae-48c4-b704-ae3e99075ddc&amp;pinned_post_asset_id=6006b04354a69202e80dcf9f&amp;pinned_post_type=share">rendered</a> through online platforms and is expected to hinder the development of online businesses.</p><p>Also in Kenya, the Statute Law Miscellaneous Amendment Act, an amendment to the Official Secrets Act, was signed on December 11 2020. According to AccessNow, it gives sweeping <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/kenya-right-to-privacy/">powers</a> to the Cabinet Secretary of Interior and Coordination of National Security to access data from any phone or computer.</p><p>In a landmark judgment in <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/news-analysis/4416/south-african-constitutional-court-declares-bulk-surveillance-powers-unlawful">favour</a> of privacy in February, South Africa’s Constitutional Court declared the bulk interception of communications by the country’s spy agencies unlawful. The case was based <a href="https://www.techfinancials.co.za/2021/02/15/top-court-ruling-on-south-africas-spy-law-is-a-victory-for-privacy-but-loopholes-remain/">on evidence</a> that the state spied on investigative journalist Stephen Patrick Sole of amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism while communicating with a source. The applicants including amaBhungane Centre argued that the Regulation of Interception of Communications Act of 2002 (RICA) and the National Strategic Intelligence Act 39 of 1994 (NSIA) violate the right to&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>In Uganda, the Tax Amendment Bills, 2021 is before Parliament for debate. If passed into law, will take effect from 1st July 2021. Among its goals are <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ug/Documents/tax/Uganda%20Draft%20Tax%20Amendment%20Bills%20Highlights%202021-2022.pdf?id=ke:2sm:3tw:4%23TaxAlert,%23Tax::6tax:20210401144115::4687826861:5&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_campaign=%23TaxAlert,%23Tax&amp;utm_content=tax&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;linkId=115105719">repealing</a> the top services (OTT) tax (reducing the rate of over the top tax from 20% to 12%) and introducing a new tax on internet&nbsp;data.</p><p>Zambia enacted a Cybersecurity and <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.zm/sites/default/files/documents/acts/Act%20No.%202%20of%202021The%20Cyber%20Security%20and%20Cyber%20Crimes.pdf">Cybercrime Act</a> which gives sweeping powers to the government to exercise greater control over social media and conduct communications surveillance without a court order. The Law has been quickly <a href="https://misa.org/news/zambias-newly-enacted-cybercrime-law-challenged-in-court/">challenged</a> in the High Court of Zambia by a coalition of civil society organizations who are praying the court to declare the law unconstitutional.</p> Arrests and detentions <p>In Zimbabwe Devine Panashe Maregere and his wife Vongai Nomatter Chiminya were both arrested in January for sending <a href="https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/africa/couple-detained-for-claiming-mnangagwa-died-of-covid-19-3272772">a message</a> on WhatsApp claiming that President Emmerson Mnangagwa had died of Covid-19. They were charged at Beitbridge magistrate court with publishing or communicating falsehoods.</p><p>On February 9 2021 Innocent Bahati, a poet and singer was <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/30/rwanda-arrests-prosecutions-over-youtube-posts">reported missing</a>. He was last seen a few prior in Nyanza, Southern Province. Innocent’s poems, which he recited in videos posted on YouTube, focused on issues such as poverty or criticism of the government, for which he had once been detained.</p> Countering Business as usual in Q2&nbsp;2021 <p>Why digital rights violations persist in the most brazen forms such as Internet shutdowns and clampdowns on freedom of expression in Africa has roots in the broader dysfunctional state of politics and society in general on the continent. We can only improve human rights standards when there has been a more fundamental change in the way our societies are run — which will include key institutional reforms in electoral democracy and economic justice. It is a campaign we’ve <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/internet-shutdowns-in-2021-c2a4e8dd4845">commenced</a> in Q1 2021 and will gladly continue in Q2&nbsp;2021.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/what-happened-with-digital-rights-in-africa-in-q1-2021-93a890cf3e2d">What happened with digital rights in Africa in Q1 2021?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Scalable, Flexible Infrastructure for Decentralized Identity</p><p>This week, the DIF Steering Committee officially approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, "v1" so to speak. This protocol has already been implemented, and four of its implementers have been collaborating intensively for over a year on expanding and extending this specification together.</p> What exactly is a “Sidetree”? <p>Sidetree is a protocol that extends “decentralized identifiers” (DIDs), one of the core building blocks of decentralized identity. &nbsp;Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) enable a person or entity to securely and directly “anchor” their data-sharing activities to a shared ledger, secured by cryptography. The first generation of DID systems accomplished this with a 1-to-1 relationship between “blockchain addresses” (cryptographic identities) and the more flexible, powerful addresses called DIDs. These latter functioned as privacy-preserving extensions of the blockchain addresses to which they were closely coupled. In this way, each DID effortlessly inherited the formidable security guarantees of those blockchains-- but in many cases, they also inherited scalability problems and economic models that were a bad fit for many DID use-cases.</p><p>Sidetree is a systematic, carefully-engineered protocol that loosens that coupling between anchor-points on a distributed data system (usually a blockchain) and the DID networks anchored to them. Crucially, it replaces the 1-to-1 relationship with a 1-to-many relationship, pooling resources and security guarantees. Depending on the use-case and implementation strategies chosen, the protocol can optimize for scalable performance, for developer-friendly ergonomics and SDKs, for the portability of DIDs and networks of DIDs across multiple anchoring systems, and even for high-availability in low-connectivity contexts where a global blockchain cannot be relied upon directly.</p><p>The name “sidetree” combines two hints as to its early technical inspirations and superpowers. Each Sidetree network functions as a kind of identity-specific “Layer 2” overlay network where participating nodes root aggregated operational data into transactions of the underlying chain. This mechanism has many high-level conceptual similarities with the “sidechains” of other “Layer 2” systems, such as the &nbsp;Lightning network running atop Bitcoin or state channel implementations on Ethereum. It also shares with merkle “trees” (and <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/#further-resources">DAGs</a> like IPFS) the self-certifying property of content-addressability, a core building block of decentralized and distributed systems.</p><p>Leveraging concepts from sidechains and “Layer 2” network protocols, Sidetree was first <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/blob/master/sidetrees/explainer.md">proposed</a> by Microsoft’s Daniel Buchner and has been incubated in the DIF community, evolving along the way with major contributions from a growing list of DIF members.</p> The team that delivered the specification <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ownyouridentity">Microsoft</a> (Redmond, WA, USA)<p>A global consumer and enterprise app, service, hardware, and cloud infrastructure provider whose mission is to empower every person to achieve more. Microsoft is proud to have worked on Sidetree and implemented the Sidetree protocol via its contributions to ION. As a key piece of infrastructure that is foundational to its Decentralized Identity work, Microsoft is committed to the continued development of Sidetree and ION in DIF.</p><a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> (Toronto, ON, Canada)<p>SecureKey is a leading digital identity and authentication provider, and is a champion of the ecosystem approach to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, revolutionizing the way consumers and organizations approach identity and attribute sharing in the digital age. This ecosystem-first philosophy informs our investment in Sidetree as a protocol for extensibility and scalability, which can evolve its featureset, and its network model over time. &nbsp;Of particular technological interest to us is how Sidetree can be overlaid on a wide variety of ledger and propagation systems. This will enable identity systems that span many use cases and work across public blockchains, federation and witness protocols, and permissioned blockchains without being locked to any particular ledger technology.</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute Industries</a> (Austin, TX, USA)<p>Transmute uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to secure critical trade data by digitizing key trade documents so that they’re traceable and verifiable anywhere in the world, easily accessible and selectively shareable, searchable and auditable, and impossible to forge or alter. Transmute contributed to Sidetree’s development because it leverages batch processing capabilities to achieve enterprise scale and retains maximum optionality for our customers, allowing their business to span many blockchains and trust frameworks. Transmute sees Sidetree-based networks as necessary for scaling up decentralized identity capabilities to a global enterprise scale, where thousands of verifiable transactions per second can be processed at an unbeatable price.</p><a href="https://mattr.global">MATTR Global</a> (Auckland, New Zealand)<p>Mattr works with communities and a growing network of companies to shift industries like digital identity towards a more equitable future, providing tools to support digital inclusion, privacy and end-user control. Sidetree represents a significant leap forward in thinking around how to create truly decentralized infrastructure for resilient identifiers. We welcome the agnostic and extensible approach not just to distributed ledgers but also to content addressable storage and other building-blocks of flexible infrastructure. We look forward to integrating many of the DID systems coming out of the Sidetree standardization effort.</p> The first generation of Sidetree Systems <p>Transmute maintains Sidetree ledger adapters for Ethereum, Amazon QLDB, Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric. We also support interoperability tests with DID Key, the Universal Wallet Interop Spec, the VC HTTP API, and Traceability Vocabulary. Transmute has built Sidetree.js, an implementation of the Sidetree protocol based on the DIF’s codebase that focuses on modularity: it is a Typescript monorepo where each component of a Sidetree node (Ledger, Content Addressable Storage, Cache database) can be substituted with different implementations that use a common interface.</p><p>SecureKey &nbsp;has created a ledger-agnostic <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-core-go">Go implementation</a> of Sidetree along with <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/orb">Orb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> variations built on top. The <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">did:orb</a> method enables independent organizations to create decentralized identifiers that are propagated across a shared decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain. By extending Sidetree into a Fediverse of interconnected registries, Orb provides the foundation for building digital ecosystems on top of decentralized identifiers using a federated, replicated and scalable approach.</p><p>Microsoft is a primary contributor to <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a>, an open source, public, permissionless implementation of Sidetree on the Bitcoin ledger. There are several repositories and public utilities that make working with ION easier, including:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">ION GitHub repo</a>: the main repository for the code that powers ION nodes  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decentralized-identity/ion-tools">ION Tools</a>: JavaScript libraries for Node.js and browser environments that makes using DIDs and interacting with the ION network easier for web developers  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/">ION Install Guide</a>: A step-by-step guide for installing an ION node  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/">ION Explorer</a>: A graphical interface for viewing DIDs and auditing other data transactions published to the public ION network.   What's next for Sidetree  <p>One significant feature on the horizon is to add support for pruning of verbose lineage data (which is no longer needed to maintain the secure backbone of DIDs in a Sidetree implementation) at Sidetree’s anchor points. This addition will allow Sidetree-based networks to purge upwards of 95% of legacy operation data in a decentralized way that maintains all of the security guarantees the protocol currently makes.</p><p>Another near-future feature is the so-called “DID Type Table.” DIDs in various DID Method implementations may be typed to provide an indication as to what they DID might represent. The Sidetree WG will publish a table of types (not including human-centric types) that stand for organizations, machines, code packages, etc., which DID creators can use if they want to tag a DID with a given type.</p><p>The medium-term roadmap is up for discussion, so if you have ideas <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">get involved</a>!</p>

<p>Digital health passes — often mischaracterized as “vaccine passports” in the popular press — are making headlines as a key component in the drive to restore global travel and restart the global economy after the massive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Enabling individuals to receive and selectively share proof-of-test, proof-of-vaccination, and proof-of-recovery with the highest standards for security, privacy and data protection will allow destination countries and travel systems worldwide to accept credentials from multiple market vendors. But concerns related to equity and access can only be addressed if these health pass implementations are designed to be interoperable.</p>



<p>As the leading global consortium for interoperable digital trust infrastructure, the ToIP Foundation has partnered with the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> –&nbsp;a project of <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020</a> –&nbsp;to host a new Working Group focused on the core issues of interoperability, privacy, and equity for digital health passes. The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pahttps://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=73790">Interoperability Working Group for Good Health Pass </a>consists of nine drafting groups, each focused on a specific interoperability challenge as defined in the<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GHPC-Interoperability-Blueprint-Outline-v2.pdf"> Interoperability Blueprint Outline</a>.</p>



<p>“The Good Health Pass Collaborative is bringing people together to solve a set of problems that affect the entire world,” said John Jordan, executive director of the ToIP Foundation. “This ambitious effort uniquely aligns with the mission of ToIP because it requires interoperable digital credentials that can be accepted and verified anywhere they are needed. Getting this right, and doing so now, will not only make it safe for people to travel again, it will open the door for new tools and services that can solve other challenging problems that also require global-scale digital trust. For these reasons, ToIP is honored to contribute to this urgent global mission by hosting the Interoperability Working Group on behalf of the Good Health Pass Collaborative.”</p>



<p>Each drafting group, consisting of volunteer representatives from around the world representing the health, travel, technology, and policy sectors, will first conduct an intensive 30-day sprint to develop an initial set of draft recommendations. This will be followed by a second 30 day community and public review process to develop a final set of recommendations.</p>



<p>“Digital health passes –&nbsp;If properly designed and implemented –&nbsp;could offer a path to safely restore domestic and international travel, resume certain aspects of public life, and restart the global economy,“ said ID2020 executive director, Dakota Gruener. “Collaboration is critical at this juncture. Our organizations share a commitment to ensuring that digital health passes are designed and implemented in ways that serve the needs of the individuals and institutions that rely on them, while simultaneously protecting core values like privacy, civil liberties, and equity. ToIP has developed a powerful set of tools and models for digital trust frameworks, and we are delighted to be partnering with them in this critically important effort.”</p>



<p>The nine drafting groups collaborating within the new Working Group are:</p>



  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Paper+Based+Credentials+Drafting+Group">Paper Based Credentials</a> will define how a paper-based alternative can be created for any digital health pass so access will be available to all.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Consistent+User+Experience+Drafting+Group">Consistent User Experience</a> will specify the common elements required so that individuals can easily, intuitively, and safely use digital health pass implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Standard+Data+Models+and+Elements+Drafting+Group">Standard Data Models and Elements</a> will determine the core data items needed across all digital health pass implementations for both COVID-19 testing and vaccinations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Credential+Formats%2C+Signatures%2C+and+Exchange+Protocols+Drafting+Group">Credential Formats, Signatures, and Exchange Protocols</a> will specify the requirements for technical interoperability of Good Health Pass implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Security%2C+Privacy%2C+and+Data+Protection+Drafting+Group">Security, Privacy, and Data Protection</a> will define the safety requirements for Good Health Pass compliant implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registries+Drafting+Group">Trust Registries</a> will specify how verifiers can confirm that a digital health pass has been issued by an authorized issuer.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Rules+Engines+Drafting+Group">Rules Engines</a> will define how digital health pass apps can access different sources of policy information to determine what test or vaccination status is needed for a specific usage scenario.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Identity+Binding+Drafting+Group">Identity Binding</a> will specify the options for verifying that the holder of a digital health pass is the individual who received the test or vaccination credential.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Framework+Drafting+Group">Governance Framework</a> will define the overall set of policies that must be followed for an implementation to qualify as Good Health Pass compliant.  



<p>By adhering to the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint that will be synthesized from the outputs of these nine drafting groups, airlines, airports, hospitality industries, international customs officials and others will be able to process visitors easily without requiring additional unnecessary steps mandated by proprietary systems. Travelers will not be confused about which credential they need for each point of verification. Moreover, since individuals will be fully in control of their own personal data in credentials in their own wallets or devices, they can be confident that their private health data is not being tracked or misused.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested organizations are invited to join the ToIP Foundation to participate directly in this new Working Group or in the public comment period in May. They are also encouraged to join the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> at ID2020 to participate in the construction, adoption, and advocacy of the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.</p>

<p>Ceramic is a public, permissionless, open source protocol that provides computation, state transformations, and consensus for all types of data structures stored on the decentralized web. Ceramic's stream processing enables developers to build with dynamic information without trusted database servers to create powerful, secure, trustless, censorship-resistant applications.</p><p>This overview introduces how:</p>  Decentralized content computation gives rise to a new era of open source information  Stream processing provides an appropriate framework for dynamic, decentralized content  You can use Ceramic to replace your database with a truly decentralized alternative  <p>To skip ahead and get started building, try <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Playground</a> to demo Ceramic in a browser application, the <a>Quick Start</a> guide to learn the basics using the Ceramic CLI, or follow the <a>Installation</a> page to integrate Ceramic into your project.</p><p>This post was originally published on the Ceramic documentation site. Contents here may fall out of date, but you can always find the most up to date version <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/">here</a>.</p> The internet of open source information <p>At its core, the internet is a collection of applications running on stateful data sources – from identity systems and user tables to databases and feeds for storing all kinds of content generated by users, services, or machines.</p><p>Most of the information on today's internet is locked away on application-specific database servers designed to protect data as a proprietary resource. Acting as a trusted middleman, applications make it difficult and opaque for others to access this information by requiring explicit permissions, one-off API integrations, and trust that returned state is correct. This siloed and competitive environment results in more friction for developers and worse experiences for users.</p><p>Along other dimensions, the web has rapidly evolved into a more open source, composable, and collaborative ecosystem. We can observe this trend in open source software enabled by Git's distributed version control and in open source finance enabled by blockchain's double-spend protection. The same principles of open source have not yet been applied to content.</p><p>The next wave of transformative innovation will be in applying the same open source principles to the world's information, unlocking a universe of content that can be frictionlessly shared across application or organizational boundaries. Achieving this requires a decentralized computation network designed specifically for content with flexibility, scalability, and composability as first class requirements.</p> Decentralized content computation <p>Open sourcing the content layer for applications requires deploying information to a public, permissionless environment where files can be stored, computation can be performed, state can be tracked, and others can easily access content.</p><p>Advancements in other Web3 protocols have already achieved success in decentralized file storage. As a universal file system for the decentralized web, <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> (including <a href="https://ipld.io">IPLD</a> and <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a>) provides an extremely flexible content naming and routing system. As a storage disk, durable persistence networks (such as <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>, and <a href="https://sia.tech/">Sia</a>) ensure that the content represented in IPFS files are persisted and kept available. This stack of Web3 protocols performs well for storing static files, but on its own lacks the computation and state management capacity for more advanced database-like features such as mutability, version control, access control, and programmable logic. These are required to enable developers to build fully-featured decentralized applications.</p><p>Ceramic enables static files to be composed into higher-order mutable data structures, programmed to behave in any desired manner, and whose resulting state is stored and replicated across a decentralized network of nodes. Ceramic builds upon and extends the IPFS file system and underlying persistence networks, as well as other open standards in the decentralized ecosystem, with a general-purpose decentralized content computation substrate. Due to Ceramic's permissionless design and unified global network, anyone in the world can openly create, discover, query, and build upon existing data without needing to trust a centralized server, integrate one-off APIs, or worry if the state of information being returned is correct.</p> Streams <p>Ceramic's decentralized content computation network is modeled after various stream processing frameworks found in Web2. In these types of systems, events are ingested, processed as they arrive, and the resulting output is applied to a log. When queried and reduced, this log represents the current state of a piece of information. This is an appropriate framework for conceptualizing how dynamic information should be modeled on the decentralized web. Furthermore because the function that processes incoming events on any particular stream can be custom written with logic for any use case, it provides the general-purpose flexibility and extensibility needed to represent the diversity of information that may exist on the web.</p><p>On Ceramic, each piece of information is represented as an append-only log of commits, called a Stream. Each stream is a DAG stored in IPLD, with an immutable name called a StreamID, and a verifiable state called a StreamState. Streams are similar in concept to Git trees, and each stream can be thought of as its own blockchain, ledger, or event log.</p> StreamTypes <p>Each stream must specify a StreamType, which is the processing logic used by the particular stream. A StreamType is essentially a function that is executed by a Ceramic node upon receipt of a new commit to the stream that governs the stream's state transitions and resulting output. StreamTypes are responsible for enforcing all rules and logic for the stream, such as data structure, content format, authentication or access control, and consensus algorithm. If an update does not conform to the logic specified by the StreamType, the update is disregarded. After applying a valid commit to the stream, the resulting StreamState is broadcast out to the rest of the nodes on the Ceramic Network. Each of the other nodes that are also maintaining this stream will update their StreamState to reflect this new transaction.</p><p>Ceramic's flexible StreamTypes framework enables developers to deploy any kind of information that conforms to any set of arbitrary rules as a stateful stream of events. Ceramic clients come pre-packaged with a standard set of StreamTypes that cover a wide range of common use cases, making it easy to get started building applications:</p>  Tile Document: a StreamType that stores a JSON document, providing similar functionality as a NoSQL document store. Tile Documents are frequently used as a database replacement for identity metadata (profiles, social graphs, reputation scores, linked social accounts), user-generated content (blog posts, social media, etc), indexes of other StreamIDs to form collections and user tables (IDX), DID documents, verifiable claims, and more. Tile Documents rely on DIDs for authentication and all valid updates to a stream must be signed by the DID that controls the stream.  CAIP-10 Link: a StreamType that stores a cryptographically verifiable proof that links a blockchain address to a DID. A DID can have an unlimited number of CAIP-10 Links that bind it to many different addresses on many different blockchain networks. CAIP-10 Links also rely on DIDs for authentication, same as the Tile Document.  Custom: You can implement your own StreamType and deploy it to your Ceramic node if the pre-packaged StreamTypes are not suitable for your use case.   Authentication <p>StreamTypes are able to specify their authentication requirements for how new data is authorized to be added to a particular stream. Different StreamTypes may choose to implement different authentication requirements. One of the most powerful and important authentication mechanisms that Ceramic StreamTypes support is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, the W3C standard for decentralized identifiers. DIDs are used by the default StreamTypes (Tile Documents and CAIP-10 Links).</p><p>DIDs provide a way to go from a globally-unique, platform-agnostic string identifier to a DID document containing public keys for signature verification and encryption. Ceramic is capable of supporting any DID method implementation. Below, find the DID methods that are currently supported by Ceramic:</p>  3ID DID Method: A DID method that uses Ceramic's Tile Document StreamType to represent a mutable DID document. 3IDs are typically used for end-user accounts. When 3IDs are used in conjunction with <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-20/CIP-20.md">3ID Keychain</a> (as is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a>), a 3ID can easily be controlled with any number of blockchain accounts from any L1 or L2 network. This provides a way to unify a user's identity across all other platforms.  Key DID Method: A DID method statically generated from any Ed25519 key pair. Key DIDs are typically used for developer accounts. Key DID is lightweight, but the drawback is that its DID document is immutable and has no ability to rotate keys if it is compromised.  NFT DID Method (coming soon): A DID method for any NFT on any blockchain. The DID document is statically generated from on-chain data. The DID associated to the blockchain account of the asset's current owner (using CAIP-10 Links) is the only entity authorized to act on behalf of the NFT DID, authenticate in DID-based systems, and make updates to streams or other data owned by the NFT DID. When ownership of the NFT changes, so does the controller permissions.  Safe DID Method (coming soon): A DID method for a Gnosis Safe smart contract on any blockchain. Typically used for organizations, DAOs, and other multi-sig entities.   Ceramic Network <p>The Ceramic Network is a decentralized, worldwide network of nodes running the Ceramic protocol that communicate over a dedicated topic on the Libp2p peer-to-peer networking protocol. Ceramic is able to achieve maximum horizontal scalability, throughput, and performance due to its unique design.</p> Sharded execution environment <p>Unlike traditional blockchain systems where scalability is limited to a single global virtual execution environment (VM) and the state of a single ledger is shared between all nodes, each Ceramic node acts as an individual execution environment for performing computations and validating transactions on streams – there is no global ledger. This "built-in" execution sharding enables the Ceramic Network to scale horizontally to parallelize the processing of an increasing number of simultaneous stream transactions as the number of nodes on the network increases. Such a design is needed to handle the scale of the world's data, which is orders of magnitude greater than the throughput needed on a financial blockchain. Another benefit of this design is that a Ceramic node can perform stream transactions in an offline-first environment and then later sync updates with the rest of the network when it comes back online.</p> Global namespace <p>Since all nodes are part of the same Ceramic Network, every stream on Ceramic exists within a single global namespace where it can be accessed by any other node or referenced by any other stream. This creates a public data web of open source information.</p> Additional node responsibilities <p>In addition to executing stream transactions according to StreamType logic, Ceramic nodes also maintain a few other key responsibilities:</p>  StreamState storage: A Ceramic node only persists StreamStates for the streams it cares to keep around, a process called "pinning." Different nodes will maintain StreamStates for different streams, but multiple nodes can maintain the state of a single stream.  Commit log storage: A Ceramic node maintains a local copy of all commits to the streams it is pinning.  Persistence connectors: Ceramic nodes can optionally utilize an additional durable storage backend for backing up commits for streams it is pinning. This can be any of the persistence networks mentioned above, including Filecoin, Arweave, Sia, etc. (coming soon).  Query responses: Ceramic nodes respond to stream queries from clients. If the node has the stream pinned it will return the response; if not, it will ask the rest of the network for the stream over libp2p and then return the response.  Broadcasting transactions: When a Ceramic node successfully performs a transaction on a stream, it broadcasts this transaction out the rest of the network over libp2p so other nodes also pinning this stream can update their StreamState to reflect this new transaction.   Clients <p>Clients provide standard interfaces for performing transactions and queries on streams, and are installed into applications. Clients are also responsible for authenticating users and signing transactions.</p><p>Currently there are three clients for Ceramic. Additional client implementations can easily be developed in other programming languages:</p>  JS HTTP client: A lightweight JavaScript client which connects to a remote Ceramic node over HTTP. The JS HTTP client is recommended for application developers.  JS Core client: A JavaScript client which also includes a full Ceramic node. The JS Core client is for those who want the maximum decentralization of running the full Ceramic protocol directly in a browser application.  CLI: A command line interface for interacting with a Ceramic node.   Getting started  Try Ceramic <p>To experience how Ceramic works in a browser application, try the <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Playground</a> app.</p> Installation <p>Getting started with Ceramic is simple. Visit the <a>Quick Start</a> guide to learn the basics using the Ceramic CLI or follow the <a>Installation</a> page to integrate Ceramic into your project.</p> Tools and services <p>In addition to various standards referenced throughout this document, the Ceramic community has already begun developing many different open source protocols, tools, and services that simplify the experience of developing on Ceramic. Here are a few notable examples:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect:</a> A authentication SDK for browser-based applications that allows your users to transact with Ceramic using their blockchain wallet.  <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX:</a> A protocol for decentralized identity that allows a DID to aggregate an index of all their data from across all apps in one place. IDX enables user-centric data storage, discovery, and interoperability. It is effectively a decentralized, cross-platform user table. IDX can reference all data source types, including Ceramic streams and other peer-to-peer databases and files.  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/identitylink-services">IdentityLink:</a> A service that issues verifiable claims which prove a DID owns various other Web2 social accounts such as Twitter, Github, Discord, Discourse, Telegram, Instagram, etc. Once issued, claims are stored in the DID's IDX.  <a href="https://tiles.ceramic.community/">Tiles:</a> An explorer for the Ceramic Network.  <a href="http://documint.net/">Documint:</a> A browser-based IDE for creating and editing streams.

<p>The OpenID Foundation is proud to participate in the first ever ‘Identity Management Day,’ an annual awareness event that will take place on the second Tuesday in April each year. The inaugural Identity Management Day is&nbsp;April 13, 2021.</p>
<p>Founded by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/">Identity Defined Security Alliance</a>&nbsp;(IDSA), the mission of Identity Management Day is to educate business leaders and IT decision makers on the importance of identity management and key components including governance, identity-centric security best practices, processes, and technology, with a special focus on the dangers of not properly securing identities and access credentials.</p>
<p>In addition, the&nbsp;<a href="https://staysafeonline.org/">National Cyber Security Alliance</a>&nbsp;(NCSA) will provide guidance for consumers, to ensure that their online identities are protected through security awareness, best practices, and readily-available technologies.</p>
<p>From the point of view of an open identity standards development organization and with a hat tip to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">Kim Cameron’s 7 Laws of Idenity</a>, here are my 7 Laws of Identity Standards:</p>
 
 A identity standard’s adoption is driven by its value of the reliability, repeatability and security of its implementations. 
 A standard’s value can be measured by the number of instances of certified technical conformance extant in the market. 
 Certified technical conformance is necessary but insufficient for global adoption. 
 Adoption at scale requires widespread awareness, ongoing technical improvement and a open and authoritative reference source. 
 When Libraries/Directories/ Registries act as authoritative sources they amplify awareness, extend adoption&nbsp;and promote&nbsp;certification. 
 Certified technical conformance importantly complements legal compliance and together optimize interoperability. 
 Interoperability&nbsp;enhances security, contains costs and drives profitability. 
 
<p>On behalf of the OpenID Foundation, I want to thank Julie Smith, Executive Director of the IDSA for her and her colleagues’ leadership. The OpenID Foundation looks forward to supporting this important event in the years to come.</p>

				 <p>iGrant.io is an SSI enabled consented data exchange platform with auditable data agreements, helping organisations unlock the value of personal data.&nbsp;In the Automated Data Agreement (ADA) project, we accelerate SSI adoption by connecting Data Agreements to a legally endorsed Data Protection Impact Analysis (DPIA), automating the flow from DPIA to SSI workflow. This ensures that any company adopting SSI for data exchange has a highly auditable solution where any data agreement receipt can be substantiated by a code of conduct to the originating DPIA performed. </p>
<p>The project aims to standardize data agreement schemas and receipts (Consent being one type of data agreement) and a component that standardizes the process and decision tree to populate the verifiable credential and remove the pain point from organisations related to data regulatory compliance. In addition, it addresses the challenges with delegated consents. <br>The key value propositions offered by the iGrant.io platform are:</p>
 
 Automated compliance, by reducing the risk of non-compliance to data regulation when it comes to personal data usage, for example by linking Data Agreements to a legally endorsed DPIA process. 
 Improved access to high quality personal data by providing transparency and empowering users to control data usage.

 And nominations are now being accepted <p>DIF was established to represent our fast changing community and to create a safe space for the co-development of next-generation code and specifications. From the original handful of members 4 years ago, the foundation has grown to become an organization with over 200 member companies, representing thousands of PRs and a strong commitment to decentralizing identity software.</p><p>Since its inception, DIF has been primarily governed by a Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is a &nbsp;group of member representatives whom lead DIF, set strategy, assure the high quality of ratified work items, react to the community’s needs, among other decisions.</p>Photo courtesy of <a href="https://unsplash.com/@element5digital">Element5digital</a><p>Over the last year, one of the main foci of the current Steering Committee has been restructuring itself to ensure it will represent the interests and diversity of its growing membership. Among the conclusions of this analysis was that a larger steering committee would garner more trust and visibility into DIF's internal governance as an organization. An operating addendum was adopted last month which formalizes procedures for periodic elections and distribution requirements. The following repackages those policies in the form of a Frequently Asked Questions document: for further clarification, see the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/c06c17bd2df58633eb74d9d5237281c79d9b676e/Org%20documents/Membership%20agreements/DIF%20Governance%20-%20Operating%20Addendum%20-%2020210304.pdf">addendum itself</a>.</p> 
    When are the dates and deadlines for this election cycle?
<br>  Announcement of election + Nomination starts - 8th April (Thu) 
 Last day for questions to candidates - 6th May (Thu) 
 Nomination Closes - 13th May (Thu) 
 SC ballot opens - 20th May (Thu) 
 SC ballot closes - 27th May (Thu) 
 New SC first meeting - 3rd June (Thu) 
 

    Who can be nominated and by whom?
    <br><p>Any individual who is active in DIF can nominate a DIF member to the Steering Committee, and/or get nominated for the Steering Committee by someone else. We recommend nominating members of the DIF community with high visibility and recognition, whether among DIF's membership or among the wider community. Only one individual can represent each DIF member organization, and there are distribution criteria to keep the Steering Committee balanced, but those considerations are applied *after* the election. This means that multiple colleagues from the same member organization can be nominated and accept that nomination, but only one of them can sit on the Steering Committee. The DIF membership includes Associate members, Contributors, individuals who signed a Feedback Agreement, and adjacent/partner organizations referred to as Liaisons (i.e. OIDF or Hyperledger).
    </p><p><br>
Nominations should be sent to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Nomination">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address.
</p><br> 

    How and when do nominated people become candidates?<br>
    <p>Nominees will be contacted by DIF staff and must accept the nomination before the nomination period closes. Along with confirmation that they would serve if elected, they also provide a short biography and an optional statement describing their interest in and qualifications for serving on the Committee.
Early nominations are encouraged.
</p>
<br>
    How do voting members select which candidates to support?<br>
    <p>DIF Staff will share this list of accepting nominees and their statements with the membership via Slack. Since all Associate Members are eligible for one vote, it is recommended that colleagues within one member company confer or discuss in backchannel before submitting a vote on behalf of their whole company.</p>
<br>
    How can interested DIF members ask questions of all the candidates to help them decide?<br>
    <p>    
    If there are specific issues of interest to all or most of the DIF membership, any DIF member (whether they work at an Associate Member organization or not) may send clear questions to DIF staff.  Nominees should send these questions to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Questions_for_the_candidates">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address, and a representative cross-section of these (lightly edited or unedited) will be compiled into a document sent to all nominees.
</p>
<br>
    Who votes and how?<br>
    <p>Only associate members can vote, and each votes as a whole on one ballot. This too is done as via email: ballots should be sent to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Ballot_for_NAME_OF_MEMBER_ORGANIZATION">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address. These will be audited confidentially and not published in any way (not even as tallies). If one member organization accidentally votes more than once, DIF staff will reply to the emails to clarify the issue, so please use a monitored/normal email address in the organization's domain rather an personal accounts or "alts". All ballots are assumed to be collective/company-wide decisions even if multiple are received.</p>
<br>
    How many candidates can each associate member vote for?<br>
    <p>Each ballot should contain between 0 and X names, where X is the number of open seats.  Most elections, X should be between 4 and 6.  If less than X are named, the rest of the organization's votes are forfeited-- each vote counts singly.</p>
<br>
    When is the actual election period?<br>
    <p>DIF elections run for one week, from the distribution of the final list of candidates to one week later at midnight EST. In this election, those dates will be Thursday 20 May and Thursday 27 May, respectively. In the weeks leading up to 20 May, DIF staff will also contact all associate members to clarify any questions about the process and confirm the dates, the number of seats, the nominee statements, etc.</p>
<br>
    How often will the Steering Committee elections take place?<br>
    <p>They are expected to be annual, with 2-year terms to preserve continuity across elections.  If seats are unexpectedly made available between elections, they will stay open until the next election.</p>

<p>Energy Web is thrilled to be one of the three founding organizations behind the newly announced <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord (CCA)</a>. In the next year, we anticipate dozens of novel approaches coming to market focused on decarbonizing the crypto industry in the spirit of the CCA. But we’ve also developed an open-source application that can play a major role in decarbonizing Crypto: <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero (EW&nbsp;Zero)</a>.</p><p>EW Zero is a public, low-cost application built on top of the open-source Energy Web stack that helps renewable energy buyers drive their carbon footprint to zero via purchases of different renewable energy products, such as <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/prec">impact-rich renewable energy certificates</a> from emerging economies and power-purchase agreements. We can use EW Zero beginning today to help the crypto industry achieve the provisional targets of the CCA by 1) helping crypto holders directly decarbonize crypto holdings while 2) enabling entire crypto networks to decarbonize from the bottom-up.</p> Demand-side solution: help crypto holders directly decarbonize their crypto&nbsp;holdings <p>Because of how energy markets are structured, cryptocurrency producers (such as miners) in many places around the world have very little choice in exactly where their power comes from. And even where that choice exists, given the extremely fragmented nature of renewable energy markets and regulatory frameworks with varying degrees of support for renewables, finding the right renewable energy product is a daunting task. EW Zero attacks both of these problems head-on by providing renewable energy buyers with a digital application for locating, procuring, and claiming emissions reductions from verified renewables around the world in a user-friendly, streamlined way.</p><p>In the spirit of the CCA, EW Zero can be used by crypto holders to make their crypto holdings green. Whether you are an institutional cryptocurrency investor, a retail crypto hodler, application developer, crypto service provider, or an exchange, EW Zero enables you to purchase renewable energy equal to the non-renewable energy used to create and maintain your cryptocurrency holdings.</p><p>This isn’t a new concept: corporates from around the world have been purchasing low-carbon products to help decarbonize supply chains in support of corporate sustainability objectives. In climate-speak, this concept of covering the power consumption from crypto purchases/holdings is analogous to actions to reduce Scope 3 carbon emissions. What’s new here is that we’re using EW Zero to apply these kinds of transactions to decentralized sources of power consumption: blockchains.</p><p>Here’s a simple example: you are an institutional cryptocurrency investor who purchased 20,000 BTC. Based on publicly available data, we can estimate the amount of electricity attributable to your 20,000 BTC holdings each year. By extension we can estimate the total carbon footprint of your BTC by making assumptions about how green various grids are around the world (in fact, one of the provisional objectives of the CCA is to develop an industry-wide open source account standard to make this even easier). With that information in hand, you can use EW Zero to search for different renewable energy products around the world. You can then buy enough renewables to make-up for the non-green energy that went into your 20,000 BTC. There are several renewable energy products to choose from: energy attribute certificates (EACs) from existing and future assets, power-purchase agreements, and onsite solar. Energy Web will encourage buyers to support impact-rich EACs, in part because locationality standards are less applicable compared to standard corporate renewables procurement. And once you’ve bought your renewables, you can “claim” the emissions reduction from them since EW Zero makes it easy for buyers to trace the full lifecycle of every megawatt-hour of clean power they bought all the way back to the specific power plant that the energy came&nbsp;from.</p><p>This is just one example for an institutional buyer. We can make the same kinds of transactions possible in a more automated way for retail crypto holders via exchanges (think “green crypto” features directly on your favorite exchange) and integrations with&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>This is just what we can do with EW Zero today. Our vision is for a whole new category of “negative emissions” products to make their way onto Zero. Here, instead of purchasing renewable energy, cryptocurrency holders invest in different negative emissions projects from around the world to remove and lock away carbon associated with their crypto holdings.</p> Supply-side solution: enable crypto networks to decarbonize from the bottom-up <p>Grids around the world are decarbonizing and so are the blockchains underpinning them. However, verifying and credibly measuring the share of crypto production powered by renewables is extremely challenging since most data come from self-reported surveys and proxies (see <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/18/18642645/bitcoin-energy-price-renewable-china">Vox’s article </a>on this topic) and entities like crypto miners don’t normally get the certificates or bills they need to prove where their renewables come&nbsp;from.</p><p>EW Zero and other components of the Energy Web stack address exactly this issue irrespective of the geography or market. Crypto miners and other blockchain actors will be able to automatically track renewables consumption at any given time and report that while preserving privacy. These claims will be, on the other hand, verifiable using a validation mechanism. For example, imagine a miner has onsite solar connected to the grid. This solar, along with the miner, each have unique, self-sovereign digital identities verified by trusted sources like corresponding solar manufacturers and local grid operators. All relevant events, such as estimated power production and excess power sent to the grid, are documented and validated on a highly granular level (e.g., every 30 minutes). That way, this specific miner can provide a verifiable proof of renewably powered, mining-related consumption anywhere in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The last point is key for all industries, not just crypto. Today corporates face significant challenges with reporting their impact in countries without an official tracking system. Energy Web’s open-source tech stack solves this issue. This proposed concept is similar to how Google and Microsoft are working to make their data centers 100% renewably-powered on an hourly basis according to when their data centers actually consume electricity in line with the emerging <a href="https://www.energytag.org/">EnergyTag</a> standard for&nbsp;EACs,</p> Join the Crypto Climate&nbsp;Accord <p>We are excited to act on the goals of the CCA and decarbonize blockchains. Interested companies from the energy and crypto sectors can join the CCA by contacting Energy Web directly via <a href="mailto:doug.miller@energyweb.org">doug.miller@energyweb.org</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/making-crypto-green-with-energy-web-zero-301cf4a979e5">Making Crypto Green with Energy Web Zero</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 An Open Letter to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Advocating for Financial Inclusion in its Regulations <p>April 7,&nbsp;2021</p><p>On December 23, 2020, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the US Treasury Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) regarding “<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/15/2021-01016/requirements-for-certain-transactions-involving-convertible-virtual-currency-or-digital-assets">Requirements for banks and money services businesses</a>” related to certain transactions involving convertible virtual currency (CVC) or digital assets with legal tender status (“legal tender digital assets” or LTDA). FinCEN is identifying additional statutory authority for the proposed rule under the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, providing additional information regarding the reporting form, and reopening the comment period for the proposal.</p><p>The<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0EAHbtr2GFDoK7_WlbrOJO1p8rUv9HrKCFBsPdnaUo/edit"> Sovrin Compliance and Inclusive Finance Working Group (CIFWG)</a> took the opportunity to submit its formal response to FinCEN on March 29, 2021 — focusing explicitly on how their proposed rules will impact financial inclusion.</p><p>Sovrin Foundation asked Amit Sharma, Chair of the Sovrin CIFWG, to tell us more about the potential impact of the NPRM, their response and recommendations to&nbsp;FinCEN.</p><p>Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the Sovrin CIFWG? What’s your mission and who are your group&nbsp;members?</p><p>The purpose of the Sovrin CIFWG is to advance the mission of financial inclusion globally, by addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by innovations in the financial services and payments landscape, and the attendant financial and regulatory compliance implications. We are an open group of traditional bank and non-bank financial institutions, regulators, policymakers, technologists, ethicists, and legal experts who monitor the challenges faced by the financially excluded and under-served. CIFWG focuses on how economic and regulatory technologies can bridge the gap between traditional banking compliance and associated risks injected by innovation. We have developed and been actively promoting the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Sovrin Compliance and Inclusive Finance Rulebook</a>, an innovative best practices framework that extends traditional banking compliance and payments guidance to emerging fintech and virtual asset service providers (VASP) processes.</p><p>Q: What do you mean by global financial inclusion, and why is it important?</p><p>Global financial inclusion remains a desirable and necessary development goal — 1.7 billion adults lack a bank account[1], and millions more have limited or no access to traditional financial services around the world. Furthermore, “de-risking” — the efforts of financial institutions to terminate or restrict relationships of certain clients and customers — has continued to be amplified by the continued growth of global anti-money laundry (AML) / counter-terrorism financing (CTF) controls[2]. The result is a disproportionate impact for the financially under-served, the global poor, and institutions and sectors that provide services to these segments of the economy. The attendant consequences of financial exclusion cannot be overstated given that remittances from migrant workers alone total over $500 billion a year (three to four times foreign aid) and is a vital source of finance for poor countries.</p><p>Q: What is the NPRM regarding “Requirements for banks and money services businesses” proposed by FinCEN&nbsp;about?</p><p>The December NPRM proposed to address the threat of illicit finance with respect to certain transactions involving CVC or LTDA by (a) establishing new reporting requirements for certain CVC or LTDA transactions analogous to existing currency transaction reports, and (b) establishing new record keeping requirements for certain CVC or LTDA transactions that is similar to the record keeping and travel rule regulations pertaining to funds transfers and transmittal of&nbsp;funds.</p><p>On January 1, 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (Division F of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283?link-type=html">Pub. L. 116–283</a>) (“AML Act of 2020”) became law. FinCEN proposed that by regulation, CVC and LTDA are monetary instruments because they are “similar material” to “coins and currency of a foreign country, travelers checks, bearer negotiable instruments, bearer investment securities, bearer securities, [and] stock on which title is passed on delivery[3].”</p><p>Q: What do you think about the NPRM? How does it impact the fintech sector and its key stakeholders?</p><p>We believe combating illicit finance activities is necessary and a top priority for FinCEN. But efforts to serve both law enforcement equities and financial inclusion do not present a binary choice. An effective anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime should also prioritize increased engagement of financially underserved, de-risked and/or excluded parties to foster a financial system that provides enhanced participation, greater transparency, and innovation in domestic financial systems.</p><p>Further, the data on illicit finance risks in the CVC sector don’t necessarily support the need for the proposed rule changes which are motivated to strengthen law enforcement and regulatory oversight efforts. According to a recently released report by Chainalysis, illicit activities or crime related to virtual assets has continued to decline, with the illicit share of cryptocurrency activity falling to just 0.34% in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Importantly within the data analyzed by Chainalysis, the concentration of illicit activities has shown to be primarily with a “small group of shady cryptocurrency services, mostly operating on top of large exchanges, [who] conduct most of the money laundering that cybercriminals rely on to make cryptocurrency-based crime profitable[4].” This data would seem to call for more targeted efforts by law enforcement to concentrate investigations of criminals by identifying owners of these deposit addresses and the organizations that are conducting deliberate money laundering operations at scale (among otherwise legitimate activities).</p><p>As such, we are concerned with the proposed rules as they impact a growing sector that is increasingly providing solutions to marginalized and financially excluded constituencies. Also, organizations operating in CVCs, including fintech companies, virtual asset services providers (VASPs), and other similar organizations may fall under the broader definition of nonbank financial institutions or money services businesses/money transfer operators (MSBs/MTOs) that already face enormous scrutiny by mainstream financial institutions when evaluating their respective risks related to onboarding into new accounts. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) itself has acknowledged the fact of de-risking disproportionately impacting certain sectors like MSBs/MTOs[5].</p><p>Q: What is the role of the CVC services in regards to global financial inclusion, and how secure are&nbsp;they?</p><p>As CVC services continue to evolve and grow, so do the applications and opportunities inherent in facilitating greater inclusion of underserved and marginalized communities and organizations into the global financial ecosystems. As such, self-hosted wallets are playing an increasingly important role with virtual assets, as global financial operations continue to be unbundled, and an ongoing trend toward de-centralized financial services continues unabated[6].</p><p>Self-hosted wallets enable anyone with an internet connection to transact with others in digital assets on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis. Additionally, these wallets can be used to store value or digital assets securely and provide capability for the user/consumer to hold resources personally that enable them to interact in the fiat and digital financial context. This enables consumers to transact with counterparties directly without the need for a third-party intermediary–similar to making a cash transaction for a purchase of a good, pay an expense, or transfer value to a friend or family&nbsp;member.</p><p>When combined with blockchain technology, P2P transactions are arguably more secure and more transparent than activities undertaken in cash, as the convenience of cash and the efficiencies that come with electronic payments are combined with the risk controls associated with pseudonymous transactions that are not otherwise dependent on a specific financial intermediary[7].</p><p>Q: In sum, what are your recommendations to FinCEN regarding the&nbsp;NPRM?</p><p>We really appreciated the opportunity to comment on the NPRM. We believe that any proposed rule should explicitly include a thorough assessment of the threats to financial inclusion that may come about with such a proposal, and the Agencies should consider the concerns outlined in the response in our letter as part of such an assessment.</p><p>Secondly, increased targeted enforcement and requirements for transaction monitoring would strengthen law enforcement regulatory intentions with the proposed rules vs a more wholesale application of record keeping and reporting for related to all noncustodial wallet holders and their activities. In short, a smaller group of actors are engaged in such activity, and enforcement and regulatory measures should be better targeted to them vs the industry as a whole — especially in light of the financial exclusion implications of such proposed&nbsp;rules.</p><p>Strengthening financial inclusion, including by encouraging innovation in the financial services arena with technology applications that extend beyond existing banking and payments systems can actually provide enhanced security, risk and compliance controls, while bringing greater opportunities to marginalized and otherwise financially underserved or excluded communities. The underlying technologies include:</p>  The facilitation of cross-border remittances via P2P and blockchain networks that provide efficiency, cost advantages and security;  The enhanced auditability and traceability of transactions conducted via these applications that better enable financial services regulators and law enforcement interests; and  The application of digital and sovereign identity management capabilities that strengthen know-your-customers processes and customer information programs while preserving the essential privacy protections inherent in financial services.  <p>We welcome follow up with Agencies and participating members that are interested in providing guidance, examples and use cases of inclusion efforts — including the application of self-hosted/un-hosted wallets in particular.</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;Amit!</p><p>Anyone can download the full letter <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvQOHN9LeyoLAZFMgpYENLUXhYZaWClK/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<p>By: FIDO Alliance staff</p>



<p>A major milestone has been realized, with the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI-Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) becoming the first organization to the achieve the Certified Authenticator Level 3+ level, which is the highest level of validation currently offered by the FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The path toward the Level 3+ designation has been several years in the making.</p>



<p>Dr. Rae Rivera, Certification Director for the FIDO Alliance explained that the Certified Authenticator program was originally launched in August 2018 in a bid to define greater levels of assurance for FIDO authenticators. She noted that the FIDO Specifications include an inherent amount of security and privacy. The goal with the Certified Authenticator program is to provide additional security assurances for the authenticators themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the first Certified Authenticator Level 3+ designation now granted, Rivera expects other organizations will follow, helping to improve strong authentication for users and organizations around the world.</p>



<p>“We’re continuing to see more pickup and uptake in the Certified Authenticator program,” Rivera said. “At each higher level, there’s less risk of a vulnerability.”</p>



<p>Understanding the Different Certified Authenticator Levels</p>



<p>There are three core levels (L1, L2, L3 and ) in the Certified Authenticator program with each level building on the requirements of the preceding level. Incremental additional assurance can be obtained to allow a vendor to achieve a “+” within each level (L1+, L2+, L3+).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program evaluates authenticators to answer the question ‘how well does the authenticator protect the private key?The most basic entry level is L1 which Rivera said a vendor can achieve by supporting and implementing the FIDO specifications. An authenticator certified at L1 provides protection against phishing and credential abuse.</p>



<p>Moving up to L2, Rivera noted that restricted operating environments are required to protect against malware attacks. When you get to L3 and L3+, Rivera said that it’s all about looking at hardware authenticators, and how they provide protection against brute force attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the core attributes of our higher level programs, specifically level three and three plus, is that they require the product to have what we call a companion program certification,” Rivera said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She noted that the companion program certification that has been defined for those higher levels is <a href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/">Common Criteria</a> &nbsp;which provides sets of evaluations and designations to help define the security posture for a given device or service.</p>



<p>“The higher level that you go, the less vulnerable the authenticator is to any kind of attack,” Rivera said.</p>



<p>Why the Level 3+ Certification is Significant</p>



<p>With BSI now certified at L3+ the door is open to others to follow the same path toward the highest level of security assurance.</p>



<p>“Personally I feel like this is a huge leap forward for the program,” Rivera said.</p>



<p>Rivera noted that to date there have been many products that have been certified at the lower levels of the Certified Authenticator program. Now that the first L3+ has been achieved she anticipates that there will be more interest from organizations to go through the program to gain that additional higher level of assurance.</p>



<p>“This certification clearly demonstrates the value of our certified authenticator program – particularly at the higher levels,” she said. “Government and regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, energy and education often have more sensitive use cases that require specific types of authentication into their networks. Vendors and relying parties in these markets see this as a benefit because it meets the need for hardware protection and is also Common Criteria certified.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>How Others Can Benefit from the First Level 3+ Certification</p>



<p>Now that BSI has hit the Level 3+ certification, there is now quite literally a path for others to follow.</p>



<p>Rivera explained that with the L3+ certification there is a protection profile associated with it. The protection profile contains all the components that are used to achieve the L3+. As such, another vendor could utilize the protection profile to develop their product to get certified at the higher level.</p>



<p>“The protection profile serves as good guidance for those that are seeking the higher levels as to what they need to do and what modifications they need to make to their implementation,” Rivera said. “BSI getting certified at Level 3+ has made it a little easier for others to start achieving this level.”</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation held three interop events for implementations of the OpenID Connect Federation specification during 2020.  The learnings from each were used to iteratively refine the specification after each round, just as we did when developing OpenID Connect itself.  The current specification is the result of the iterative rounds of improvement, informed by the experiences of multiple implementations.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/RolandHedberg">Roland Hedberg</a> for organizing these useful interop events and to all those who brought their code to test with one another.</p>
<p>The specification is published at:</p>

<p>The FAPI Working Group published a <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> as a resource for those new to FAPI and implementing FAPI. This FAQ will evolve over time as the Foundation engages with new members like the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission as well as colleagues in the US, Australia, Brazil and other jurisdictions on their open banking initiatives which were <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/16/standards-adoption-and-the-adoption-of-standards-financial-grade-api-fapi-1-0-final-specifications-published/">recently highlighted in an OIDF blog</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the OpenID Foundation achieved a major milestone in <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/12/fapi-1-0-part-1-and-part-2-are-now-final-specifications/">publishing the Financial-grade API (FAPI) Parts 1.0 and 2.0 final specifications</a>. This is a true accomplishment for open banking initiatives worldwide.</p>
<p>Many organizations and jurisdictions have utilized the FAPI Implementers Draft 2 as the starting point of their adoption of FAPI in defining their open banking solution stacks. To assist these organizations and jurisdictions in transitioning from the FAPI RW Implementers Draft 2 to the FAPI 1.0 Advanced Final specification, Joseph Heenan, led the OpenID certification work and&nbsp; <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/src/master/FAPI_1.0/changes-between-id2-and-final.md">published a non-normative list of changes document</a>.</p>
<p>This document is a non-normative list of the changes between the second implementers draft of FAPI1 part 1 (read only / baseline) and part 2 (read-write / advanced) and the final versions:</p>
 
 Changes are listed as major if they may require alterations to implementations. 
 Changes are listed as minor if they are generally clarifications and are unlikely to require alterations to existing implementations that were already applying best current practice. 
 Most changes have both client and server clauses that reflect the same change to the protocol; such a change is only listed once below in the interests of brevity. 
 
<p>The progress and pace of standards development is a function of the contribution of human capital, especially domain expertise. The Foundation would like to thank member, Authlete, a consistent key contributor to the FAPI standards. Authlete’s contribution of Joseph Heenan’s time and talent that was key to the ongoing improvements in the evolution of the FAPI standard.</p>

<p>Introducing the new Executive Director for Digital Identity NZ and formally farewelling Andrew Weaver as the outgoing Executive Director.&nbsp;<br><br>We are excited to announce that Michael Murphy joins us as the new Executive Director for DINZ. With a wide and diverse background, Michael is active in the investment and startup communities along with business mentoring.&nbsp;He had some early involvement in the Digital Identity Forum, the precursor to DINZ and so joins us with a broad understanding of the importance of digital identity in furthering a trust based economy and society.<br><br>Over the next few months Michael will be connecting with our members and stakeholders to better understand what people need and desire from the work of Digital Identity NZ and from the wider ecosystem activity, including the Trust Framework development being led by DIA.&nbsp;Please do make Michael feel welcome as he appears in various events in the near future.</p>



  



 Executive Director – Michael Murphy 



<p>Across several roles, Michael is focused on helping Aotearoa’s best and boldest entrepreneurs in creating truly world-class companies that will employ coming generations of Kiwis and underpin the economic and social development of our country.&nbsp;<br><br>As Executive Director at Digital Identity New Zealand, Michael sees trust and digital identity as being at the very heart of how people, communities, businesses and economies will thrive and prosper in a future driven by disruptive innovation.&nbsp;He is highly motivated to explore how the many threads of digital identity and trust can be most effectively woven together to create the firm foundations needed for the development of a truly trust based economy in Aotearoa, for the benefit of us all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his other roles as investor, director, advisor and mentor, Michael works with globally ambitious start-up and early-stage ventures as well as more established businesses, looking to innovate and adopt a more exponential mindset to drive their growth. Working across both groups, cross pollinating ideas and methods, is where Michael is most energised: bringing experience and disciplined entrepreneurship to early stage ventures and helping more mature businesses explore the opportunities for growth and manage the risks presented by these massively disruptive times.</p>



  



 Outgoing Executive Director – Andrew Weaver 



<p>From the 31st March we bid farewell to Andrew Weaver who has so ably steered DINZ as the inaugural Executive Director since&nbsp;November 2018.&nbsp;Andrew has been such an active and positive influence in&nbsp;the digital identity&nbsp;sector it is hard to imagine him moving on.&nbsp;As the Chair of the Executive Council of DINZ I have had the pleasure of working with Andrew weekly over the past two years and have great admiration for his approach to the role.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>He has developed a fantastic platform from which we can continue the work of enabling a world where people can express their identity using validated and trusted digital means in order to fully participate in a digital economy and&nbsp;society.&nbsp;The fact that the past 12 months has seen&nbsp;DINZ&nbsp;adapt seamlessly to a world with COVID-19 is a testament to Andrew’s flexibility and professionalism in getting the work done.<br><br>Andrew, thank you for all you have contributed to the work of DINZ.&nbsp;We truly wish you all the best in wherever your journey takes you.&nbsp;<br><br>Michael, a warm welcome and we look forward to working with you!</p>

<p>By Beth Kanter, Chief Advocacy &amp; Strategic Communications Officer</p><p>For many women, March symbolizes more than just a month of observance. It’s a time where women across all industries and geographies celebrate the achievements of their peers and colleagues today and take a critical look at the opportunities they’re creating for young women just entering the workforce. It’s also a chance for us to celebrate the historic achievements of the pioneering women that came before us. At Omidyar Network, we’re constantly working to create a culture and world where all women have equitable access to the systems and powers that govern our daily&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Like many, I was inspired to do this work by the first woman in my life — my mother. My commitment to social justice was developed while watching her work as a special education teacher for more than 30 years. As an educator, she worked passionately to support and empower students who were often marginalized because of their race, class, or learning abilities. As an active member of her union, she understood why it was critical for people to have power and voice in the workplace. She taught me the importance of being engaged in my community and how to live my values and support my community through politics — one of my first memories is stuffing envelopes for our neighbor who was running for the Montgomery County Council and reading her NOW newsletter.</p><p>After her sudden death in 2000, I’ve always wondered what she would think of some of the unfortunate events the country has endured over the years. Part of me is relieved that she did not have to witness the horrors of 9/11, the recession, and the pandemic. On the other hand, I think she would have been amazed to see the remarkable women who have trailblazed their way through the world by challenging the status quo, reimaging what’s possible, and ensuring equality for the leaders of the future. My mom, along with other women before me, would have beamed with pride to bear witness to the accomplishments of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and most recently, Vice President Kamala&nbsp;Harris.</p><p>I am constantly awed and inspired by the incredible women grantees we work with at Omidyar Network who are shaping a new inclusive economy, ensuring a responsible tech ecosystem, and positively impacting our society. We have the honor to work with a powerhouse team of women leaders such&nbsp;as:</p>  Ifeoma Ozoma with Earthseed who’s taking on the role of Big Tech as a brave whistleblower at Pinterest, holding the company to account for racial bias and inequality;  Lisa Donner from <a href="https://ourfinancialsecurity.org">Americans for Financial Reform</a> who’s working to reimagine our economic system by way of representation and ensuring equality; and  Solana Rice from <a href="https://www.liberationinageneration.org">Liberation in a Generation</a> who’s providing equitable access to communities for meaningful social&nbsp;change.  <p>Click <a href="https://twitter.com/OmidyarNetwork">here</a> for a look at how we’ve highlighted our grantees for our Women’s History Month campaign!</p><p>I feel an obligation and a great sense of joy to carry out the legacy built by these women, my mother, and many others, through the work Omidyar Network does every day. We’re committed to showing up for each other and addressing all instances of biases and inequality. I see so much of what my mother believed in and stood for in Omidyar Network’s mission and through our phenomenal team of women grantees, including:</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/legacy-community-and-equity-reflecting-on-womens-history-month-9ac5c5edff80">Legacy, Community, and Equity: Reflecting on Women’s History Month</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

What “co-development” and “coöpetition” really mean, concretely  <p>The next installment in this series will offer some concrete steps that a DIF member organization (or even a non-member organization) can take to roll up their sleeves and get involved.</p><p>We can start with this 2020 diagram of how specific specifications fit in the landscape of open-source and open-standards organizations.

Rouven Heck 2019, updated by Interoperability Working Group,&nbsp;2020 What is DIF’s role in “standardizing” decentralized identity? <p>The governance of the decentralized identity standards space is, by design, decentralized: many different complementary organizations make steady, focused progress on specifications and codebases. In these coextensive communities, each garners consensus and buy-in for a focused set of data models and protocols with overlapping scopes and functions. Claiming the mantle of central authority for decentralization would be a pyrrhic victory for any Standards Development Organization (SDO).</p><p>Having been founded as a joint development project, DIF’s guiding mission is to effect harmonization, interoperability, and usability among early adopters, growing rather than controlling the development community. This nurtures healthy competition in the market growing around these technologies and provides a space for competitors to work together openly but safely, balancing “code-first” open source approaches and “standards-first” or protocol-driven ones. Allowing any single standards body (even DIF itself) to set the tone for all of decentralized identity or speak on its behalf would run counter to this&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Instead, the DIF exists to support, promote and facilitate two processes that seem to contradict each other at first blush. On the one hand, DIF accelerates the advance of standards and pre-standard specifications and libraries for emerging, decentralized identity systems. On the other hand, DIF strives to decentralize the landscape of identity technology and encourage new forms of data governance, new business models, and meaningful competition in our corner of the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>We unite these two processes with a pragmatic, considered, and adoption-ready strategy that is grounded in cooperation with external stakeholders and adjacent organizations. Most of these focus more squarely on technical standards or industry coordination and development, or some narrower set of technologies or protocols; decentralizing identity requires a both/and approach, which is deeply encoded in the DNA of DIF as an organization.</p> Who are the other major organizations in decentralized identity? <p>Of the various standards development organizations with which DIF cooperates closely, the World-Wide Web Consortium clearly has pride of place. The core specifications of decentralized identity were incubated there. The verifiable credential <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a> was ratified (or in W3C parlance, moved to “candidate recommendation” status) over a year ago, and the decentralized identifier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">specification</a> joined it <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizedID/status/1372480031184842753">two weeks ago</a>. As its name would imply, the WWW consortium is squarely focused on the standards structuring the WWW: browsers, cookies, web servers, and other “agents” in the topology of public web browsing.</p><p>Many important standards and specifications for data formats outside of the web problem space take place at the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>), particularly around data representations, transports, and security engineering. This includes many primitives and building blocks of modern programming, like JSON representations, cryptographic primitives, and universal tokens and authentication standards, usage of which extends far beyond the public web. There is a traditional division of labor according to which the web’s data models are standardized at W3C and its protocols are standardized in the IETF, leading to a kind of odd-couple dynamic whereby two very different cultures have grown up around these specialties.</p><p>Another major site of coordination for primitives and building blocks is the more constitutively open-source-focused Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</a>). Originally a governance group for XML and the earliest forms of what we now call “Big Data”, OASIS saw its purview and power extended when various global trade and messaging standards were built extending XML. To this day, the Open Office document standards and much of the open-source tooling for PDF, DITA, and other non-proprietary document standards are still governed and advanced through&nbsp;OASIS.</p><p>DIF supports decentralized identity by incubating and co-developing prototypes and specifications, some of which are handed off to these more deliberative organizations for formal review and standardization where appropriate. Importantly, though, not all “pre-standards” work has as its goal a standardized or universalized version of that work. In many cases, a specification that was good enough to guide an experimental or contingent implementation making its way to market might serve its purpose well enough without further hardening.</p><p>These “DIF-terminal” specifications and sample implementations are apt contributions to the field and the market without going on to formal review. They serve to bootstrap and jumpstart other development by getting more credentials or identifiers into circulation, while growing the pool of developers experienced and excited about the technology and the community. This “build early” approach is crucial to refining and hardening other parts of the stack, as well as building up a market and its workforce.</p> How does DIF work together with these organizations? <p>DIF is not the only pre-standards organization in which specifications and implementations are co-developed by early adopters and explorers of this family of technologies and applications. Anywhere companies and individual experimenters collaborate on open-source projects, “co-development” is happening, but these too vary in the kinds of collaboration for which they have designed and optimized their processes.</p><p>The earliest work in this space, as well as much of the long-view-oriented work developing tooling for open-world data models and Linked Data tooling, takes place in the Credentials Community Group (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>) of the W3C. The CCG is a community group operated through the W3C but open to participants that do not pay W3C dues. It promotes and hosts pre-standards work and maintains dialogue with various other W3C groups, not just those chartered to work on the VC and DID specifications. Since the CCG is hosted by the W3C, it inherits many of the procedures and specification publication processes from the members-only processes of the Consortium. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage</a> working group is cosponsored by the CCG and DIF to maximize the community-wide participation creating a pre-standards specification for <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a> structures that can serve many different kinds of decentralized identity and data&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The Linux Foundation houses a complex family of Hyperledger projects, which coordinate global contributors to massive open-source codebases that power blockchains and other decentralized data and identity systems. <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>, the first major fit-for-purpose permissioned distributed ledger optimized for decentralized identity applications, is the oldest and most high-profile of the identity-focused projects in Hyperledger, designed to anchor decentralized identities and governed by the Sovrin Foundation.</p><p>Another major Hyperledger project is the modular and progressively more blockchain-agnostic <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries </a>community, which evolved out of Indy-specific open-source systems. The Aries Project offers many common libraries, entire single-language frameworks, and cross-framework protocols so that small companies can quickly build into an ecosystem of interoperable service providers and business models. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DID-Communications</a> working group is co-sponsored by Aries and DIF, allowing members of either group to participate directly in the specification of a DID-based communications protocol for the entire decentralized identity community, not just the ecosystem built around the Aries codebases.</p><p>Other groups also overlap and coordinate with DIF in their development of implementations and specifications in advance of formal standards. One of these is the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>), which governs increasingly widespread standards for authentication that federate identity systems across most of the commercial consumer internet. As with Hyperledger Aries and CCG, this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ae0719a23e9405c6d61fc19c8b938277">relationship is formalized</a> as a “liaison agreement” between the two organizations, and also entails a Liaison Officer to coordinate the relationship; DIF’s DID Auth WG was put on pause in mid 2020 to focus on work happening in OIDF working groups, and hopes to re-open regular meetings to work on items on the DIF side again&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Another is the Linux Foundation’s first project devoted exclusively to data governance and related legal and ecosystem management issues, the Trust-over-IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>), where many DIF members work on task forces and working groups on compliance issues, consent tracking, data-capture best practices, and industry-specific governance issues. The decentralization-friendly but wider-scoped <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, which promotes user-centricity and data subject rights in legacy identity systems, is also an important touchstone for regulatory and legal issues. The <a href="http://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> continues to maintain the active Indy production network and house many important <a href="https://sovrin.org/interoperability-series-linking-and-exchanging-attachments-with-verifiable-credentials/">collaborations</a> and <a href="https://sovrin.org/the-sovrin-community-releases-new-ssi-iot-whitepaper/">working groups</a>, and are represented in many DIF working&nbsp;groups.</p> Coöpetition and DIF’s particular brand of co-development <p>The way DIF relates to other organizations working in the same space arose naturally from DIF optimizing its processes for neutrality and collaboration between companies of different sizes and market positions. DIF’s culture is one of business collaboration aligned with the increasingly buzzy term “co-opetition” (sometimes spelled “coöpetition” to emphasize the pronunciation). The term is a portmanteau combining cooperation and competition, but the clearest definition might be “coöperation between competitors, who remain competitors before and after coöperating”.</p><p>“Coöpeting” early in the design process makes for a unique pact between competitors, one that is crucial to the DNA of DIF: it is a forward commitment, before the design process, to cooperate through and after release of an open standard or codebase. This kind of pact makes the most sense in situations where network effects and portability of data and users matter more than platform control and vendor lock-in. Indeed, when your business plan is to maximize openness and interoperability, you end up cooperating earlier and more deeply than in more siloed forms of “open source” development. After all, much of what we consider open-source wasengineered for a single vendor’s business goals and opened up after release, once all the major design decisions had been made and tested. The difference of timeline and design process is hard to overstate!</p><p>Put bluntly, committing to coöpetitive development of common standards and protocols is committing in advance to a truly open standard, rather than one which advantages its designers on its path to general adoption. This kind of pact is particularly useful when forged between companies that are direct competitors or companies of vastly different sizes.</p> Cooperating in the patent-free zone <p>In large part, competitors and companies of different sizes find it far easier to work together substantively on new ideas once a safe space has been established for new ideas. Startups stay up at night worrying that their best ideas could be patented out from beneath them by collaborators with well-staffed legal departments, and large enterprises hesitate to do any work in the open that might endanger their R&amp;D inventions. The solution for both is often coming together openly on a precisely-scoped working group or project with proper “IPR protections.”</p><blockquote>Put in plain language, the IPR agreements protecting DIF’s work prevent all contributors from taking legal action against the results of the group, whether on the basis of previously-held patents, or the new ideas originating in the&nbsp;group.</blockquote><p>The terms of these IPR agreements can seem cumbersome to people coming from non-profit or academic research, but in the private sector and particularly at industrial or global scale, the enforceability in global courts of ownership over ideas and patents is absolutely essential to software investments, infrastructural governance, and even geopolitics. The protocols, specifications, and libraries co-authored in an IPR-protected group can be thought of as safe dependencies, which cannot have their open-source status (i.e., their royalty-free status!) endangered by the current or pre-existing intellectual property of any of its contributors. The relative degree of this safety is of huge importance to infrastructural decision-making and long-term planning. These assurances can be an important insurance policy against one major risk in software development — patent action against code or its dependencies.</p><p>Another crucial way in which this kind of “co-development” protects participants from the risks inherent in cooperating with competitors is that DIF, not the contributing member organizations, “owns” the products of its members’ collective labors. In concrete terms, this means the ongoing governance, maintenance, and licensing of the products of working groups, often referred to as “technical control” of resulting code or specifications, stays with the Foundation rather than with any of the legal entities contributing. The risk that a trusted co-development partner will change its strategy, its culture, or its ownership and thus its governance structure is only one of the many unsavory surprises a product or a company can meet on the road to&nbsp;market.</p><p>This means that if the relationship sours between two parties collaborating on a standard or a reference implementation, the work might “fork” and take on two different future paths, but the version ratified by DIF stays open to the public under DIF’s management. In such a case, any DIF member can join the relevant group and maintain the project’s main branch, or influence future versions if the group continues the open work. In fact, DIF’s licensing even imposes some restrictions on contributing organizations forking a DIF collaboration to continue the work elsewhere, whether further development is carried out in the open or&nbsp;not.</p><p>It is important to note that DIF is not original here, but rather, standing on the shoulders of giants. We were founded within the Joint Development Foundation, now part of the Linux Foundation, and inherits not only their licenses and legal structures but also their culture of co-development and IPR protection. While the staff of DIF is happy to help socialize, navigate, and enforce these structures, none of us are lawyers and we defer to the professionals (including those available to DIF through the JDF) for all serious matters and conflict resolution on the subject of intellectual property.</p> Drilling further&nbsp;down <p>We’ve sketched out the different kinds of open source development and the many ways variously-open standards can structure markets, and positioned DIF among all these concepts and its neighbors in the community. There’s not much further down we can drill in general terms: it’s time to get particular and start positioning you and your organization in this landscape! In our next piece, we’ll sketch out how you can get strategic about open source, roll up your sleeves, and get your hands dirty at&nbsp;DIF.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-co-development-in-the-open-765a86ab153f">Drilling Down: [Co-]Development in the Open</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Berkman Klein Center event explores how technology factors into pandemic&nbsp;response Kendra Albert, Tanya Cooper, Roslyn Satchel, and Thema Bryant-Davis during a Berkman Klein Center event on “Marginalized Women, Technology, COVID-19, and Intimate Partner Violence.” Screenshot by Lydia Rosenberg.<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has upended myriad aspects of everyday life, from education to the economy to interpersonal relationships. For victims and survivors of intimate partner violence, the many struggles of escaping or finding support are particularly exacerbated by the pandemic. An <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/marginalized-women-technology-covid-19-and-intimate-partner-violence">event</a> hosted by the Berkman Klein Center explored how technology factors into this problem — how it can help, and how it can&nbsp;harm.</p><p>Moderated by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/roslyn-satchel">Roslyn Satchel</a>, a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center and the Blanche Seaver Professor of Communication at Pepperdine, the event convened an interdisciplinary group of scholars to discuss various issues surrounding intimate partner violence, particularly for marginalized women, during the pandemic. The discussion covered fostering safe spaces online, access to resources, and navigating the legal system during the pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://gsep.pepperdine.edu/about/our-people/faculty/thema-bryant-davis/">Thema Bryant-Davis</a>, an associate professor of psychology at Pepperdine University, and director of the Culture and Trauma Research Lab, spoke about coping with trauma and supporting victims and survivors.</p><p>“The reality is that COVID-19 has also increased the risk of intimate partner violence when we see the large number of people who are practicing physical distancing and social distancing. There has been less of a buffer, less of an opportunity to come outside of the home and to seek services. And so we are mindful of the urgency of this work, as well as the additional barriers that make help-seeking difficult,” Bryant-Davis said.</p><p>“Part of what we are mindful of in the midst of COVID is the need for technology to be utilized in order to reach survivors and in order to protect survivors and help us to heal and restore,” Bryant-Davis said. “Many clinicians like me are currently practicing telehealth solely, so working with people in their healing journey by phone and by Internet which has benefits and challenges.” She pointed to easier access to resources not requiring travel, but also the dangers of sharing spaces with&nbsp;abusers.</p><p><a href="https://law.pepperdine.edu/faculty-research/tanya-asim-cooper/">Tanya Asim Cooper</a>, associate clinical professor of law and director of the Restoration and Justice Clinic, shared her experience working with victims of intimate partner victims from a legal perspective and illustrated her work through a case&nbsp;study.</p><p>“Studies show racial disparities in domestic violence for victims of color, predominantly women and they are in the greatest danger,” she said. “From my experience and based on my research, victims of color generally are perceived as less credible victims, suffer more serious violence, and require more concrete evidence of abuse, especially physical violence. They need photographs, they need not just medical records, they need medical professional live testimony.”</p><p>These demands are hard for people to meet — especially during the pandemic, with courts closing and forcing victims to wait. Cooper described how her clinic transferred their work online, but how she worries about people lacking technological skills or access to the internet.</p><p>“If law enforcement and courts can’t or won’t assist, especially during the pandemic, let’s equip faith communities and other online communities where marginalized women go, and let’s equip them to help,” she&nbsp;said.</p><p>Several event participants mentioned the idea of fostering online communities and safe digital spaces during the event. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kalbert">Kendra Albert</a>, a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic, prompted the panel to question some of the values embedded in technologies and online tools and how those can be challenged in the intimate partner violence&nbsp;context.</p><p>As examples, Albert cited how phone companies may provide data about recently contacted phone numbers because “insiders are assumed to be safe.” Albert also pointed to Facebook’s “People You May Know” feature as a tool that has been shown to suggest mutual friends but that may expose degrees of connection that should remain private, such as therapist relationships “It’s just one example of these technologies that are often built on the assumption that more connection is better, that Facebook wants to connect to all of us or thinking about sharing as a net good, while not considering the very real reasons that people’s sharing or engagement with these platforms might be deeply contextual and they may have concerns about this information getting shared more broadly,” Albert&nbsp;said.</p><p>Although these contexts and situations are often not considered when developing such technology or their values, marginalized people are able to adapt the technologies to their circumstances, circumventing the intended uses and norms, Albert&nbsp;added.</p><p>“The reality is marginalized folks have been using, thriving, and changing technologies that were built without them in mind forever, for as long as we’ve had technologies,” they said. “And that we can think of examples of marginalized folks innovating and actually driving these technologies forward as the things that create change and in some cases, create money for these platforms. So I think while still keeping in mind that domestic violence victims and survivors, especially domestic violence victims and survivors that are women of color, Black and brown women could be much better served by these platforms and that their needs for contextual controls and control over one’s information.”</p><p>Towards the end of the conversation, Satchel drew connections between the speakers; she highlighted the theme of safety and security and acknowledged that the event is continuing an important conversation about centering the experiences of marginalized people and the value of cross-disciplinary discourse.</p><p>“This question of safety and security is really animating the very core of this discussion. And as a communication ethicist, as a person who actually studies communication in a variety of contexts, I really value interdisciplinarity. Why? Because it allows for conversations like this to happen,” she said. “The beauty is that we’re coming back to a common core, marginalized women. Women who are marginalized by race, socioeconomic status, ability, gender, sexual orientation, language, ethnicity, immigration status, and many more caste markers have very unique experiences, unique experiences that may very well cause them to call for different solutions and different options for justice.”</p><p>A podcast version of the event is available <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/marginalized-women-technology-covid-19-and-intimate-partner-violence">here</a>.

<p>Contributed by Sebastian Elfors, Senior Solutions Architect, Yubico</p>



<p>Recognition of the value of FIDO in European digital identity systems and eIDAS continues to grow.&nbsp; This month has featured two new updates in Europe on the FIDO front: the release of a landmark ENISA report that discusses the role FIDO2 plays in eIDAS, and the accreditation by the Czech government of a new eID solution using FIDO2.</p>



<p>In March 2021, the EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA) issued the report <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-report-remote-id-proofing">Remote ID Proofing</a>, which describes the current regulatory landscape and supporting standards for the European countries’ remote identity proofing laws, regulations and practices. ENISA’s report is based on the ETSI TR 119 460 and ETSI TS 119 461 documents, which describe the policies and practices for remote identity proofing among trust service providers in the EU. Especially the eIDAS regulation, the AMLD5 directive to prevent money laundering, and EU directives on issuing ID-cards and exchanging identity information have been taken into account from a legal perspective.</p>



<p>Several methods for remote identification are proposed in the ENISA report: video recorded sessions, identification based on eID schemes or electronic signatures, bank identification, scanning of existing ID-cards, or a combination of several methods. In particular the option to identify a user with an eID scheme is of interest from a FIDO perspective. The following statement is written in section “2.2.4 Electronic identification means” of the ENISA report:</p>



<blockquote><p>“A protocol used by several electronic identity means providers is OpenID connect. It is an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0 and is specified by the OpenID foundation. This protocol allows to verify the identity of the applicant based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, and by obtaining basic information about the applicant. Another technology that can be used in eID solutions is FIDO2. The FIDO Alliance explains in a <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FIDO_Using-FIDO-with-eIDAS-Services-White-Paper.pdf">whitepaper</a> how FIDO2 can be used for eID means corresponding to eIDAS article 8.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In the very same month, the Czech ministry of interior <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/e-podpis-povinne-zverejnovane-informace-oznameni-o-udeleni-akreditace-pro-spravu-kvalifikovaneho-systemu-elektronicke-identifikace-poskytovatel-cz-nic-z-s-p-o.aspx">issued eIDAS accreditation</a> for the Czech domain registry CZ.NIC, meaning that their identity provider mojeID can deploy FIDO2 as an eID scheme at eIDAS level of assurance High under the following conditions:</p>



  The FIDO2 authenticator is FIDO certified at Level 2 (or higher)  The FIDO2 authenticator is based on a secure element that is certified at FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or Common Criteria EAL4 + AVA_VAN.5  The FIDO2 authenticator has a PIN set and the PIN is required for all transactions at level of assurance High  Username and password are used in conjunction with FIDO2  



<p>Both ENISA’s report on remote identity proofing and the official approval of CZ.NIC’s FIDO-based eID scheme are great examples of how FIDO has been recognized as a viable authentication protocol for eIDAS compliant eID schemes in the EU.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-recognition-for-european-digital-identity-systems-and-eidas-grows/">FIDO Recognition for European Digital Identity Systems and eIDAS Grows</a> appeared first on <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO Alliance</a>.</p>

<p></p><p>Having gone over the subtleties and complexities of <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76?source=friends_link&amp;sk=c61c55cdec30169ea99471b9bd09e81b">open-source software</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495?source=friends_link&amp;sk=971c11824b0023758c34114cffc6c339">open standards</a> in general, we will now drill down into how exactly DIF advances both, in the form of a “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) document. In this FAQ, we'll cover what co-development means in general, at DIF, beyond DIF, and in legal terms. The next installment in this series will offer some concrete steps that a DIF member organization (or even a non-member organization) can take to roll up their sleeves and get involved.</p><p>Let's start with this 2020 diagram of how specific specifications fit in the landscape of open-source and open-standards organizations. &nbsp;Click on the image below to download a clickable PDF file.</p> What is DIF’s role in “standardizing” decentralized identity? <p>The governance of the decentralized identity standards space is, by design, decentralized: many different complementary organizations make steady, focused progress on specifications and codebases. In these coextensive communities, each garners consensus and buy-in for a focused set of data models and protocols with overlapping scopes and functions. Claiming the mantle of central authority for decentralization would be a pyrrhic victory for any Standards Development Organization (SDO).</p><p>Having been founded as a joint development project, DIF’s guiding mission is to effect harmonization, interoperability, and usability among early adopters, growing rather than controlling the development community. This nurtures healthy competition in the market growing around these &nbsp;technologies and provides a space for competitors to work together openly but safely, balancing “code-first” open source approaches and “standards-first” or protocol-driven ones. Allowing any single standards body (even DIF itself) to set the tone for all of decentralized identity or speak on its behalf would run counter to this mission.</p><p>Instead, the DIF exists to support, promote and facilitate two processes that seem to contradict each other at first blush. On the one hand, DIF accelerates the advance of standards and pre-standard specifications and libraries for emerging, decentralized identity systems. &nbsp;On the other hand, DIF strives to decentralize the landscape of identity technology and encourage new forms of data governance, new business models, and meaningful competition in our corner of the sector. </p><p>We unite these two processes with a pragmatic, considered, and adoption-ready strategy that is grounded in cooperation with external stakeholders and adjacent organizations. Most of these focus more squarely on technical standards or industry coordination and development, or some narrower set of technologies or protocols; decentralizing identity requires a both/and approach, which is deeply encoded in the DNA of DIF as an organization. </p> Who are the other major organizations in decentralized identity? <p>Of the various standards development organizations with which DIF cooperates closely, the World-Wide Web Consortium clearly has pride of place. The core specifications of decentralized identity were incubated there. The verifiable credential <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a> was ratified (or in W3C parlance, moved to “candidate recommendation” status) over a year ago, and the decentralized identifier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">specification</a> joined it <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizedID/status/1372480031184842753">two weeks ago</a>. As its name would imply, the WWW consortium is squarely focused on the standards structuring the WWW: browsers, cookies, web servers, and other “agents” in the topology of public web browsing.</p><p>Many important standards and specifications for data formats outside of the web problem space take place at the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>), particularly around data representations, transports, and security engineering. This includes many primitives and building blocks of modern programming, like JSON representations, cryptographic primitives, and universal tokens and authentication standards, usage of which extends far beyond the public web. There is a traditional division of labor according to which the web’s data models are standardized at W3C and its protocols are standardized in the IETF, leading to a kind of odd-couple dynamic whereby two very different cultures have grown up around these specialties.</p><p>Another major site of coordination for primitives and building blocks is the more constitutively open-source-focused Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</a>). Originally a governance group for XML and the earliest forms of what we now call “Big Data”, OASIS saw its purview and power extended when various global trade and messaging standards were built extending XML. To this day, the Open Office document standards and much of the open-source tooling for PDF, DITA, and other non-proprietary document standards are still governed and advanced through OASIS.</p><p>DIF supports decentralized identity by incubating and co-developing prototypes and specifications, some of which are handed off to these more deliberative organizations for formal review and standardization where appropriate. Importantly, though, not all “pre-standards” work has as its goal a standardized or universalized version of that work. In many cases, a specification that was good enough to guide an experimental or contingent implementation making its way to market might serve its purpose well enough without further hardening. </p><p>These “DIF-terminal” specifications and sample implementations are apt contributions to the field and the market without going on to formal review. They serve to bootstrap and jumpstart other development by getting more credentials or identifiers into circulation, while growing the pool of developers experienced and excited about the technology and the community. This “build early” approach is crucial to refining and hardening other parts of the stack, as well as building up a market and its workforce.</p> How does DIF work together with these organizations? <p>DIF is not the only pre-standards organization in which specifications and implementations are co-developed by early adopters and explorers of this family of technologies and applications. Anywhere companies and individual experimenters collaborate on open-source projects, “co-development” is happening, but these too vary in the kinds of collaboration for which they have designed and optimized their processes.</p><p>The earliest work in this space, as well as much of the long-view-oriented work developing tooling for open-world data models and Linked Data tooling, takes place in the Credentials Community Group (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>) of the W3C. The CCG is a community group operated through the W3C but open to participants that do not pay W3C dues. &nbsp;It promotes and hosts pre-standards work and maintains dialogue with various other W3C groups, not just those chartered to work on the VC and DID specifications. Since the CCG is hosted by the W3C, it inherits many of the procedures and specification publication processes from the members-only processes of the Consortium. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage</a> working group is cosponsored by the CCG and DIF to maximize the community-wide participation creating a pre-standards specification for <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a> structures that can serve many different kinds of decentralized identity and data systems.</p><p>The Linux Foundation houses a complex family of Hyperledger projects, which coordinate global contributors to massive open-source codebases that power blockchains and other decentralized data and identity systems. <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>, the first major fit-for-purpose permissioned distributed ledger optimized for decentralized identity applications, is the oldest and most high-profile of the identity-focused projects in Hyperledger, designed to anchor decentralized identities and governed by the Sovrin Foundation. </p><p>Another major Hyperledger project is the modular and progressively more blockchain-agnostic <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries </a>community, which evolved out of Indy-specific open-source systems. The Aries Project offers many common libraries, entire single-language frameworks, and cross-framework protocols so that small companies can quickly build into an ecosystem of interoperable service providers and business models. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DID-Communications</a> working group is co-sponsored by Aries and DIF, allowing members of either group to participate directly in the specification of a DID-based communications protocol for the entire decentralized identity community, not just the ecosystem built around the Aries codebases.</p><p>Other groups also overlap and coordinate with DIF in their development of implementations and specifications in advance of formal standards. One of these is the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>), which governs increasingly widespread standards for authentication that federate identity systems across most of the commercial consumer internet. As with Hyperledger Aries and CCG, this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ae0719a23e9405c6d61fc19c8b938277">relationship is formalized</a> as a “liaison agreement” between the two organizations, and also entails a Liaison Officer to coordinate the relationship; DIF’s DID Auth WG was put on pause in mid 2020 to focus on work happening in OIDF working groups, and hopes to re-open regular meetings to work on items on the DIF side again soon.</p><p>Another is the Linux Foundation’s first project devoted exclusively to data governance and related legal and ecosystem management issues, the Trust-over-IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>), where many DIF members work on task forces and working groups on compliance issues, consent tracking, data-capture best practices, and industry-specific governance issues. &nbsp;The decentralization-friendly but wider-scoped <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, which promotes user-centricity and data subject rights in legacy identity systems, is also an important touchstone for regulatory and legal issues. &nbsp;The <a href="http://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> continues to maintain the active Indy production network and house many important <a href="https://sovrin.org/interoperability-series-linking-and-exchanging-attachments-with-verifiable-credentials/">collaborations</a> and <a href="https://sovrin.org/the-sovrin-community-releases-new-ssi-iot-whitepaper/">working groups</a>, and are represented in many DIF working groups. &nbsp;</p> Coöpetition and DIF’s particular brand of co-development <p>The way DIF relates to other organizations working in the same space arose naturally from DIF optimizing its processes for neutrality and collaboration between companies of different sizes and market positions. &nbsp;DIF’s culture is one of business collaboration aligned with the increasingly buzzy term “co-opetition” (sometimes spelled “coöpetition” to emphasize the pronunciation). &nbsp;The term is a portmanteau combining cooperation and competition, but the clearest definition might be “coöperation between competitors, who remain competitors before and after coöperating”. <br></p><p>“Coöpeting” early in the design process makes for a unique pact between competitors, one that is crucial to the DNA of DIF: it is a forward commitment, before the design process, to cooperate through and after release of an open standard or codebase. This kind of pact makes the most sense in situations where network effects and portability of data and users matter more than platform control and vendor lock-in. Indeed, when your business plan is to maximize openness and interoperability, you end up cooperating earlier and more deeply than in more siloed forms of “open source” development. After all, much of what we consider open-source wasengineered for a single vendor’s business goals and opened up after release, once all the major design decisions had been made and tested. The difference of timeline and design process is hard to overstate!</p><p>Put bluntly, committing to coöpetitive development of common standards and protocols is committing in advance to a truly open standard, rather than one which advantages its designers on its path to general adoption. This kind of pact is particularly useful when forged between companies that are direct competitors or companies of vastly different sizes.</p> Cooperating in the patent-free zone <p>In large part, competitors and companies of different sizes find it far easier to work together substantively on new ideas once a safe space has been established for new ideas. Startups stay up at night worrying that their best ideas could be patented out from beneath them by collaborators with well-staffed legal departments, and large enterprises hesitate to do any work in the open that might endanger their R&amp;D inventions. The solution for both is often coming together openly on a precisely-scoped working group or project with proper “IPR protections.” </p><blockquote>Put in plain language, the IPR agreements protecting DIF’s work prevent all contributors from taking legal action against the results of the group, whether on the basis of previously-held patents, or the new ideas originating in the group. </blockquote><p>The terms of these IPR agreements can seem cumbersome to people coming from non-profit or academic research, but in the private sector and particularly at industrial or global scale, the enforceability in global courts of ownership over ideas and patents is absolutely essential to software investments, infrastructural governance, and even geopolitics. The protocols, specifications, and libraries co-authored in an IPR-protected group can be thought of as safe dependencies, which cannot have their open-source status (i.e., their royalty-free status!) endangered by the current or pre-existing intellectual property of any of its contributors. The relative degree of this safety is of huge importance to infrastructural decision-making and long-term planning. &nbsp;These assurances can be an important insurance policy against one major risk in software development -- patent action against code or its dependencies.</p><p>Another crucial way in which this kind of “co-development” protects participants from the risks inherent in cooperating with competitors is that DIF, not the contributing member organizations, “owns” the products of its members’ collective labors. In concrete terms, this means the ongoing governance, maintenance, and licensing of the products of working groups, often referred to as “technical control” of resulting code or specifications, stays with the Foundation rather than with any of the legal entities contributing. The risk that a trusted co-development partner will change its strategy, its culture, or its ownership and thus its governance structure is only one of the many unsavory surprises a product or a company can meet on the road to market.</p><p>This means that if the relationship sours between two parties collaborating on a standard or a reference implementation, the work might “fork” and take on two different future paths, but the version ratified by DIF stays open to the public under DIF’s management. &nbsp;In such a case, any DIF member can join the relevant group and maintain the project’s main branch, or influence future versions if the group continues the open work. In fact, DIF’s licensing even imposes some restrictions on contributing organizations forking a DIF collaboration to continue the work elsewhere, whether further development is carried out in the open or not. </p><p>It is important to note that DIF is not original here, but rather, standing on the shoulders of giants. We were founded within the Joint Development Foundation, now part of the Linux Foundation, and inherits not only their licenses and legal structures but also their culture of co-development and IPR protection. While the staff of DIF is happy to help socialize, navigate, and enforce these structures, none of us are lawyers and we defer to the professionals (including those available to DIF through the JDF) for all serious matters and conflict resolution on the subject of intellectual property.</p> Drilling further down <p>We’ve sketched out the different kinds of open source development and the many ways variously-open standards can structure markets, and positioned DIF among all these concepts and its neighbors in the community. There’s not much further down we can drill in general terms: it’s time to get particular and start positioning you and your organization in this landscape! In our next piece, we’ll sketch out how you can get strategic about open source, roll up your sleeves, and get your hands dirty at DIF.</p>

<p>By: FIDO Alliance Staff</p>



<p>What’s the role of FIDO authentication in financial services and what can be done to help consumers and issuers be more secure? Those topics were at the foundation of the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Modern Authentication for Financial Services, hosted by the FIDO Alliance on March 25.</p>



<p>The financial services focused event included speakers from eBay, Financial Data Exchange, Gemini, Google, Javelin Strategy and Research, Mastercard, JP Morgan Chase, StrongKey, Trusona and Visa, with topics spanning from the future of authentication to best practices on how to optimize the authentication experience for users.</p>



<p>In his opening keynote, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance noted that over the course of the pandemic there has been an increase in cyberattacks against financial services institutions, which has only heightened the need for stronger authentication methods.</p>



<p>“At the end of the day, the vast majority of statistics and the vast majority of these problems come down to fundamental truth, which is that we’re trying to run a hyper connected economy, a networked society, on a authentication model that simply is not fit for purpose and that of course is our dependence on passwords,” Shikiar said.</p>



  



<p>Shikiar detailed how the FIDO Alliance is working to help move the world away from passwords and help users benefit from stronger forms of authentication. In particular, FIDO is playing a key role in the financial services market across a number of categories. FIDO specifications are being used today by financial services firms to help protect online accounts against account takeovers and phishing attacks. A key goal is to also make it easier for organizations to use strong authentication. Shikiar emphasized that the FIDO Alliance’s tagline is: simpler, stronger authentication.</p>



<p>“If there’s one thing the industry has seen is that the more complex the approach is for MFA [Multi-Factor Authentication] , the less likely someone is to stick with it,” Shikiar said. “So for people to keep using strong authentication, it needs to be easy and single gesture, which is the core of FIDO’s approach.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Improving Authentication with FIDO at Visa</p>



<p>Visa is one of the world’s largest credit card brands and financial services firms on the planet and it sees FIDO as being a strong tool for helping to improve security and reduce fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a keynote presentation, David Henstock, Head of Identity and Authentication Products at Visa, observed that FIDO specifications have a significant role to play in helping to drive better outcomes within the payments industry. Henstock noted that what has increasingly occurred in recent years is that fraudsters are targeting the authentication layer.</p>



  



<p>“The question that always comes up is what can Visa do to help fight account takeover fraud?” Henstock stated. “The culprit more often than not is knowledge based authentication, or simply put&nbsp; – passwords.”</p>



<p>Henstock noted that FIDO is an easy way to upgrade from usernames and passwords to a more secure standard upgrading the authentication experience that sellers have. He added that overall FIDO helps to provide a better, more easy to use customer experience for authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO is also important to help with regulatory compliance. In Europe, the PSD2 [Payment Services Directive version 2] is a key driver for strong authentication adoption as it mandates the use of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).</p>



<p>“If you’re doing digital commerce in Europe, you must abide by the SCA regulations,” Henstock said.</p>



<p>In a bid to help organizations with FIDO deployment, Arshad Noor, CTO at StrongKey used his Authenticate session to detail new capabilities in the StrongKey FIDO server that can help organizations meet the challenges of global requirements.</p>



<p>“We see a lot of confusion in the WebAuthn and FIDO ecosystem where people are confused between security capability, and the user experience that consumers go through when interacting with FIDO,” Noor said. “We believe that FIDO should first be viewed as a security technology, and second as a convenience technology.”</p>



<p>Consumer Confidence in Passwords is Declining</p>



<p>The need to move away from passwords isn’t just about regulation, it’s also about consumer confidence in the security of password based authentication.</p>



<p>In a session, Javelin Strategy &amp; Research analysts Rachel Huber and John Buzzard outlined the state of the market in terms of fraud and online security.</p>



  



<p>“We have discovered trend wise that consumer confidence with passwords is down substantially and I want to say -finally,” Buzzard stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Buzzard noted that consumers have begun to realize that stronger authentication methods including biometrics are effective ways to validate identity. He added that consumers are now indicating that they are ready to move away from passwords.</p>



<p>“Whether the password disappears, maybe it becomes sort of like the Mayor McCheese of the city in the sense that it’s there but it doesn’t mean anything if that’s what it requires,” Buzzard said. “That’s still okay because we’re ready to move forward with stronger forms of authentication.”</p>



<p>Payments and the Future of Authentication&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO standards are at the core of security efforts at eBay, which helps the online marketplace meet the needs of its diverse user base. In a panel on Payments and the Future of Authentication Ashish Jain, Product Management Executive, Identity, Mobility &amp; Analytics, eBay explained that a key challenge for his platform is having the right experience that can fit the needs and requirements of a broad customer base.</p>



  



<p>“When we started investigating FIDO and saw that it was supported by Google, Microsoft, and Apple, it gave us the confidence that it can meet the needs for a variety of our customers and hence, we continue to investigate and invest in the protocol,” Jain said.</p>



<p>For Christiaan Brand, Product Manager for Identity &amp; Security at Google, FIDO adoption started out as a way to help curb phishing risks and has evolved to become a way to help improve multiple aspects of security for both Google and its users.</p>



<p>“FIDO is one of those few security inventions, which aims to both address security and improve on that axis, while at the same time also improving on the usability front,” Brand said. “The FIDO components that have been built into the platforms nowadays do give our users, better and more secure experiences.”</p>



<p>For Ranjita Iyer, SVP, Identity Solutions at Mastercard, FIDO specifications are being combined with other standards including the<a href="https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/3d-secure/"> EMV 3D Secure</a> effort to enable a seamless authentication and payment experience that can lead to better approval rates for digital transactions and lower fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Integrating FIDO with other standards is also something that the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) is implementing with its stack. Don Cardinal, Managing Director, Financial Data Exchange explained in a session that his organization is dedicated to unifying the financial service industry around an interoperable royalty free standard for secure permission to access data.</p>



  



<p>“The whole idea is to stop sharing user IDs and passwords and stop using them in the entire session,” Cardinal said. “Ideally, if you have OIDC [<a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>] and FIDO throughout FDX you can enroll, use and consume the whole setup and never use a credential, which I think is really powerful in today’s day and age.”</p>



<p>Optimizing UX for Strong Authentication&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the technical details of FIDO specifications are critical to enabling strong authentication, optimizing the user experience is critical to adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the final panel of the day, Megan Shamas, Director of Marketing, FIDO Alliance noted that there is an effort that is currently underway to to test and improve the FIDO user experience. Guidance from that testing effort is set to be publicly available in late 2021.</p>



<p>Kerry Hebert, Design Director (CX/UI) at Visa emphasized that it’s likely that FIDO implementation hinges on user adoption and adoption is only going to happen if the user registers. She noted that for&nbsp; users to take the step of registering, they need to believe that there’s value in what it provides and in some way makes the consumer’s life a little bit better.</p>



  



<p>Kevin Goldman, Chief Experience Officer, Trusona strongly suggests that financial services firms not think about user experience as something that is bolted on to the end of the process. Rather he suggests that it’s an integrated part of the entire process of supporting and enabling FIDO standards.</p>



<p>Judy Clare, Vice President, Product Manager, Digital Identity and Authentication at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, suggested during the panel that from an experience perspective, FIDO engagement needs to be easily digestible for consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You really have to have that value proposition out there&nbsp; – what’s in it for me, and why should I be clicking through this and take an extra 30 seconds to sign up for it and then go on my way, because I am here to do something and this wasn’t it,” Clare stated. “So it’s really important to keep the user in mind.”</p>



<p>Next Up: More Authenticate Summits and Authenticate 2021 Conference</p>



<p>There’s much more content to come from the FIDO Alliance in 2021.</p>



<p>Looking forward there is another virtual event coming in June which will focus on strong authentication in Europe. Plans are also coming together for a physical Authenticate conference set for October in Seattle.</p>



<p>“In general, what we see is a lot of best practice sharing, everyone is in this together, and is motivated to help protect the networked economy and FIDO authentication presents a great way of doing so,” Shikiar said. “So we encourage you to certainly take part.”</p>

<p>Today, SecureAuth is an official member of the OpenID Foundation a non-profit international standardization organization committed to enabling, promoting and protecting OpenID technologies. As a distinguished member of the Foundation, SecureAuth also now has a voice in the elections for the governing body.</p>
<p>SecureAuth Innovation Labs is dedicated to actively supporting and participating in the Shared Signals and Events Working Group (SSE WG) of the OpenID Foundation. This includes research and development teams commitment to the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. This protocol serves as the identity layer for human-based and machine-to-machine communications alike, which is built into SecureAuth’s Protect platform.</p>
<p>Always at the forefront of innovation, SecureAuth has been a long-time advocate and contributor of the OpenID Foundation prior to becoming an official member. As a trailblazer of the interoperability and extensions of authentication protocols that are integrated into every app to verify users, SecureAuth aligned with the latest standards for customers across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>“We welcome SecureAuth’s membership in the OpenID Foundation and look forward to their contributions to the SSE WG and their support for open standards in identity, access control and authentication”, said Don Thibeau of the OpenID Foundation. “The success of the Shared Signals Working Group is one of the great hidden successes. One objective is to define mechanisms to deliver system implementers with an approved standard for securely sending signals and receiving signals, access and avoid account takeover.”</p>
<p>The mission fits with SecureAuth’s core objective, which is to enable the continuous assessment of risk and trust, by leveraging signal and events in a way that security can be achieved without compromising the user experience and sharing of security events, state changes, and other signals between dependent systems.</p>
<p>SecureAuth’s participation in the SSE WG will aid in implementing two new standards: Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol (CAEP) and Risk &amp; Incident Sharing and Collaboration Initiative (RISC).</p>

<p>This is a transcript of a keynote originally delivered at the 2021 Stefan A. Riesenfeld Symposium, <a href="https://globalspeechunderpressure.com/">Global Speech Under Pressure</a>. The video of the speech can be viewed&nbsp;<a href="https://globalspeechunderpressure.com/recordings">here</a>.</p><p>Thank you so very much: both for this incredible honour and for these kind words. And thank you to everyone who is joining us today via Zoom or the livecast — I am deeply grateful that you are making the time to engage with us on the many important topics we will be discussing at the Symposium today and tomorrow. To me the honour to kick us off with a few words, so let me do&nbsp;that.</p><p>Freedom of expression is an important right in and of itself. It plays a key role in our societies as an enabler of democratic debate, in holding our leaders to account, and it is crucial for truth finding. It is a fundamental right for us as individuals: expressing our views, convictions and beliefs is a central aspect of our self-determination.</p><blockquote>…expressing our views, convictions and beliefs is a central aspect of our self-determination.</blockquote><p>Freedom of expression also is a basic right for us as we act and organise in groups: it allows us to share information with each other, exchange views and opinions, and debate matters that concern us all. The American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman Frederick Douglass summed up the important role freedom of expression plays by saying that: “To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker. It is just as criminal to rob a man of his right to speak and hear as it would be to rob him of his&nbsp;money.”</p><p>But one of the things that makes freedom of expression so especially important is the way in which it facilitates the enjoyment of other fundamental rights. Here, it is obvious to think of the role of the press in bringing wrongs to light and thereby helping the enforcement of human rights standards. And the press, often referred to as the “lifeblood of democracy”, is indeed crucial. However, what I am getting at is something more all-encompassing. It is the interconnectedness of the different human rights acknowledged in international and national frameworks, and the role freedom of expression plays in that constellation as a facilitator.</p><p>This special role that freedom of expression plays as a supporting right inevitably also has its drawbacks.</p><p>Because freedom of expression underpins and is so closely connected to the exercise of other rights, it is also open to exploitation for the purpose of undermining, abusing or even destroying these other rights. Put very simply: if you can make good things happen, it also offers an opening for bad things to happen. Today, I want to look at some examples of the benefits of freedom of expression in this facilitating and supporting role, and also reflect on some of the challenges it&nbsp;brings.</p><blockquote>Because freedom of expression underpins and is so closely connected to the exercise of other rights, it is also open to exploitation</blockquote><p>In doing so, I want to take a slightly broader view than many of us have the liberty of taking day to day, confronted with a world in which — currently by necessity due to the pandemic — we are living significant parts of our lives online. Much focus is placed at the moment on the challenges that technology and social media bring for freedom of expression — and human rights in general — in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>In doing so, we don’t always properly take into account that the right — which the drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights wisely framed as applying without frontiers and as a right that can be exercised through any means — already has a history of having been tried and tested through a variety of contexts and rapid societal developments.</p><p>When I say this, I by no means intend to downplay the novelty of the developments we are seeing unfold at the moment, nor the speed or scale at which this is happening. But I do want to emphasise that the human rights framework has made it through a lot already and it is my view that it will be able to withstand this,&nbsp;too.</p><blockquote>…the human rights framework has made it through a lot already and it is my view that it will be able to withstand this,&nbsp;too</blockquote><p>Another aspect I want to place squarely within the frame before we enter into the panel discussions today and tomorrow (which I am very much looking forward to), is that the way freedom of expression plays out in different contexts, online and offline, is a manifestation of the choices we make as a society and the power structures that govern it. This is a consideration that I don’t think is always sufficiently taken into account. Too often the focus in our debates about free speech in the digital age lies in dealing with symptoms, rather than reflecting on their root&nbsp;causes.</p><p>To illustrate these points, I want to highlight three contexts in which we’ve seen freedom of expression facilitate other rights in both the offline and online contexts: publishing, protest, and the fight for LGBTQ rights. After that, I’ll conclude with some reflections that we can jointly look at in more detail during the various panel conversations of the Symposium.</p> Examples of Freedom of Expression as a Facilitating Right <p>The Impact of Printing and Digital Publishing</p><p>The ability to express ourselves in writing and to share those writings with others has facilitated a great deal of other rights and advances in our societies over the centuries. It has helped the promotion of freedom of religion, the right to health, the right to rest and leisure, education, culture, and generally allowed us to share ideas and scientific discoveries across frontiers when we were not yet able to text or e-mail each other in&nbsp;seconds.</p><p>To start with its offline variety: the printed word has been referred to as one of the “Four Great Inventions” of ancient China, alongside the compass, gunpowder, and papermaking. When the German goldsmith Gutenberg adapted the technique in the 15th century, it made printing more affordable, easier to use, and more accessible. Historians often note the printing press’ significance as an “agent of change” throughout history, including during the Reformation, Renaissance and Scientific Revolution.</p><p>The printing press also provided more general access to the written word, which in Europe had been the domain of universities and the church. Universities and church institutions managed libraries and if books needed to be reproduced, this was done by making careful copies by hand. These books were mainly written in Latin, which made them inaccessible to anyone who did not master the language, even if they were literate.</p><p>As printing made the production of written texts at scale so much easier and affordable, it became lucrative to start printing works in languages that were accessible to those outside of ecclesiastic and academic circles. By starting to print in languages other than Latin, “regular” languages were standardised. It also facilitated the creation of communities around commonly read works to discuss their&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Of course, this did not mean that anyone was able to get printed whatever they wanted. Governments were able to restrict what did and did not get printed, and the workings of the “market” also made sure that not just everyone was able to see their ideas published and circulated.</p><p>Prior restraint, a form of censorship that allows government to review the content of printed materials and prevent their publication, was, and in some countries still is, a reality. Just like the practise of banning certain books on grounds such as national security, or for being perceived as obscene or blasphemous. Here, it is good to keep in mind that even books we would deem fairly innocent now, such as Alice in Wonderland, Ivanhoe, and Oliver Twist, all have been banned by various governments at some point in&nbsp;time.</p><p>Besides government interference, “access” — a concept I always find hard to define, but which speaks volumes about our ability or inability to effectively get to those with power in our societies — to a large extent determined who got to publish. A lot of power lies in the hands of the publishing industry, whose decisions of what “audiences” will want to read are made by teams and individuals that, according to recent survey data, still are predominantly white, cis-gender, straight and able-bodied. This inevitably has led to an underrepresentation on the shelves of our public libraries and bookshops of authors that do not fit that&nbsp;picture.</p><p>The arrival of digital publishing and online self-publication has shaken up the publishing landscape to some extent, in the sense that the lower barrier for “access” and the lower cost of publishing mean that authors have more options to get their work out in public now that this no longer is the same as getting “printed”.</p><blockquote>The new publishing landscape also allows for marginalised groups to create their own platforms to fill a gap left by mainstream publications</blockquote><p>The new publishing landscape also allows for marginalised groups to create their own platforms to fill a gap left by mainstream publications and reach a wider, more international audience than would be possible with, say a physical “”, the nonconformist, self-published booklets made by&nbsp;hand.</p><p>This does not mean that we’re now, in the digital age, completely free from the power dynamics and censorship at play in traditional printing and publishing. First, the traditional barriers that exist for those who are systematically excluded remain: think of the time, space and resources it takes to write in the first place. The “room of one’s own” and money to support themselves that Virginia Woolf argued women needed in order to write was accessible only to a privileged few.</p><blockquote>…we should all wonder if bypassing a publishing house to directly e-publish on Amazon truly is a win for the free&nbsp;word</blockquote><p>Second, digital publishing brings its own specific drawbacks with it. The website of an online Zine can be geographically blocked, doxxed or taken down; and we should all wonder if bypassing a publishing house to directly e-publish on Amazon truly is a win for the free word, trading traditional publishing houses as gatekeepers for a trillion-dollar capitalist behemoth.</p><p>The Galvanising Effect of Seeing Civil Rights&nbsp;Protests</p><p>Freedom of expression has traditionally been closely linked to the right to protest and the right to assembly. We organise and take to the streets to express our views on matters we believe should change in our societies, to get those in power to listen to us and, sometimes, even to tell them to step down. An important role in this is played by the media, and nowadays by us as citizen journalists and activists.</p><p>Gil Scott-Heron said that the revolution will not be televised, but television did play an important role in advancing the fight for civil rights in the South of the United States. Dr Martin Luther King Jr. understood the role the press and television could play in the civil rights movement by helping make visible to audiences across the United States — where, by the early 1960s, about 90% of households had a television set — what the Black experience in the country was. In their history of television news, Unsilent Revolution, journalists Robert Donovan and Ray Scherer wrote that “The civil-rights revolution in the South began when a man and the eye of the television film camera came together, giving the camera a focal point for events breaking from state to state, and the man, Martin Luther King Jr., high exposure on television sets from coast to&nbsp;coast.”</p><p>This attention from the media is often credited to have helped activists and politicians push for the adoption of key legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in&nbsp;1965.</p><blockquote>…the news we get to see and read about entails editorial choices, as does the way in which it is presented to&nbsp;us.</blockquote><p>There are also some critical notes to be placed here, of course. Not only is who gets to broadcast determined by a licencing system, which is administered by the state; the news we get to see and read about entails editorial choices, as does the way in which it is presented to us. We’ll talk about the theoretical aspect of that in a moment, but I want to note here that the way in which events in the South were covered and the imagery of resistance that was spread was to a large extent shaped by the needs of the then-new television stations and their desire to connect with a wide audience across the US. I think I do not need to make explicit what the makeup of those news stations looked like — today, still, diversity within broadcasting and news companies is lamentable.</p><p>Social activist and civil rights movement leader Julian Bond summed up the media’s approach at the time as follows: “What the media craved was a steady diet of bold mass action campaigns in the streets, ideally faced by violent white resistance, which could dramatize the issues at stake and make good print or electronic copy.”</p><p>The television networks had a clear idea of what their viewers wanted to see, and this resulted in an imagery of Black suffering, combined with extraordinary restraint in not responding in kind to any violence endured. This means that other narratives and perspectives of the fight for civil rights, which was of course a lot more complex than the TV version, did not get a place on prime time television. To come back to Gil Scott-Heron: to the extent that the revolution was televised, it was only a small part of it, curated and made presentable and palatable for a predominantly white audience.</p><blockquote>…to the extent that the revolution was televised, it was only a small part of it, curated and made presentable and palatable for a predominantly white&nbsp;audience</blockquote><p>If television was the medium that controlled audiences at scale in the 1960s, social media platforms perform that function in our current day and age. And of course especially since the COVID-19 pandemic took on a global scale in early 2020. Here, we are not dependent on a state body granting broadcasting licenses or newsroom making editorial choices, but what we do and do not see appear in our timelines is just as curated, and guided by the terms of service on which social media platforms operate and the algorithms that make sure items either end up “trending” or quietly slip out of&nbsp;sight.</p><p>There are many examples of social media playing a role in organising protests offline, of which the street protests against structural racism and police violence against Black people and people of colour last year is a recent and vivid&nbsp;example.</p><p>The Black Lives Matter hashtag and movement was born in the summer of 2013, when labour organiser Alicia Garza responded on her Facebook page to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the man who murdered Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</p><p>Following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, the Black Lives Matter movement swelled in numbers, with protests not only taking place across the United States, but also internationally. Social media facilitated much of the organising and allowed information, images and videos of protests to be instantly shared with millions worldwide.</p><blockquote>The live protests built on social media and after people took to the streets, the violent response to some of the demonstrations was livestreamed for all the world to&nbsp;see</blockquote><p>Another protest that we saw in 2020 was the #EndSARS demonstrations in Nigeria. The movement had started in 2017 to protest against police brutality in the country by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and was reinvigorated in October last year after new abuses were brought to light. The live protests built on social media and after people took to the streets, the violent response to some of the demonstrations was livestreamed for all the world to&nbsp;see.</p><p>This online sharing of information — photos, protest details, livestreaming videos — is also where the greatest vulnerability lies for movement organising. Surveillance becomes easy with so much information at the ready and it is something governments have made grateful use of and, of course, a variety of private companies have been able to monetise. By monitoring messages and images posted on social media, sometimes through the use of fake user accounts, and combining that with other information, it is possible to identify upcoming protests and even individual protesters.</p><blockquote>Surveillance becomes easy with so much information at the ready and it is something governments have made grateful use&nbsp;of</blockquote><p>While the FBI needed to get Attorney General Robert Kennedy’s approval to place wiretaps on Dr King’s home and offices in an attempt to discredit him and destroy his reputation, no such measures are needed when surveilling movements through public social media posts. The same information that helps us mobilise in the streets can be collected and turned against&nbsp;us.</p><p>Supporting the Fight for LGBTQ&nbsp;rights</p><p>Freedom of expression ties in with the fight for equal rights of LGBTQ people in many ways. Amongst others by bringing to light inequalities and calling for them to be addressed; through organising and demonstrating, as we just touched upon; and by supporting the expression of individual identity.</p><p>Just like exposure was important for the civil rights movement to get racial inequalities examined and addressed, it is important for many other rights movements to see their cause featured in the media. But: who decides what makes it into the morning paper and the evening&nbsp;news?</p><blockquote>But: who decides what makes it into the morning paper and the evening&nbsp;news?</blockquote><p>A well-established media theory is that of “Hallin’s spheres”, developed by journalism historian Daniel C. Hallin in the late 1980’s. Hallin divides the world of political discourse into three concentric spheres: the middle circle is the sphere of consensus, which concerns topics on which there is widespread agreement. In the sphere of consensus, journalists assume everyone agrees. There is not a lot of exciting material for them to cover there, but it is also not kept out of the press. The next circle is that of legitimate controversy, topics on which people hold differing views. These topics are the most important to cover for journalists: there will be a lot of interest in them and journalists can help facilitate an informed debate. The outer circle is that of “deviance”, a label we wouldn’t really choose anymore nowadays, and those are the topics that fall outside the bounds of legitimate debate. Journalists are free to ignore these topics in their coverage. What falls within these categories shifts as public opinion shifts, which of course raises a bit of a chicken and egg question on how public opinion can shift if no one is reporting on certain&nbsp;issues.</p><p>For a long period of time, LGBTQ issues were part of the third circle we just looked at: they were not reported on at all in mainstream media or only to a limited degree, and then often negatively. In response to a nationwide demand in the United Kingdom by lesbians and gay men to be able to access news on the gay and lesbian liberation movement, the newspaper Gay News was founded in 1972 in a collaboration between former members of the Gay Liberation Front and members of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality.</p><p>The paper played a key role in the struggle for gay rights in the 1970s in the UK. Described as the movement’s “debating chamber”, the paper reported on discrimination, progress that was made in the fight for political and social equalities, and campaigned for further law reform, including equal rights in employment and the trade union movement. It also published personal ads, even though this was illegal at the time, under the headline “Love knoweth no&nbsp;laws.”</p><blockquote>Overcoming the obstacle of publishing alone is not enough: if you want to also reach your readership, your paper will need to be distributed</blockquote><p>Overcoming the obstacle of publishing alone is not enough: if you want to also reach your readership, your paper will need to be distributed. And this is where Gay News ran into difficulty a number of times. It had repeated clashes with W.H. Smith, which controlled one-third of the newspaper and magazine distribution in the UK at the time and who initially refused to stock the paper due to an alleged “low potential for&nbsp;sales”.</p><p>In countries like the UK, distribution is less of a problem these days for LGBTQ publications. In addition to self-published online Zines as touched upon earlier, big commercial publishers like Condé Nast have started to take on intersectional queer publications like the community platform them. To speak with Hallin’s circles: they are no longer part of the “outer” circle. This is not to say that the playing field is even now, but the landscape is starting to&nbsp;change.</p><blockquote>Social media platforms more generally have served as spaces for community building, information sharing and organising for queer communities</blockquote><p>Social media platforms more generally have served as spaces for community building, information sharing and organising for queer communities. It is not entirely a rosy picture, however. While there is no need to rely on a conservative establishment to get content distributed, like Gay News had to if it wanted to effectively reach its audience, social media platforms bring their own obstacles. Content “moderation” is often skewed against queer expression, and platform policies, such as Facebook’s real name policy, which effectively forces transgender persons to use their dead name if they want to be able to access the platform, are highly problematic. Going online also doesn’t mean it is possible to fully escape government censorship: platforms tend to comply with local “gay propaganda” legislation like we see in, for example Russia, and take down LGBTQ content or suppress related hashtags and search&nbsp;results.</p><p>Freedom of Expression and&nbsp;Power</p><p>We just looked at publishing, protest, and the fight for LGBTQ rights, and how freedom of expression facilitates — and sometimes hampers — other rights both offline and online in those contexts. Now, before we move on to the panel discussions, I would like to share some further reflections on where we are with freedom of expression at the moment and what I believe we should be thinking of as we navigate the digital landscape.</p><p>At the outset of this talk, I said I did not want to downplay the challenges we are facing at the moment, with most of our lives moving online and the exercise of our human rights along with it. And it is of course a reality that the exercise of many of our rights are now taking place on private platforms.</p><p>But: the question how we hold “big business” to account for human rights violations is also something we have struggled with before speech moved online. We are all too familiar with the images of, for example, big oil companies destroying wildlife and the livelihood of farmers through their negligence, as well stories about the use of child slavery in the production of our food, clothes, and smartphones. And while the conversation about corporate social responsibility and business and human rights is still very much ongoing, there are some positive lessons we can draw on for rethinking responsibility and accountability when it comes to corporations.</p><blockquote>…the effectiveness of any of this, whether it is the responsibility of the Shells, Exxons or Facebooks of this world, will depend on political will.</blockquote><p>In the end, though, the effectiveness of any of this, whether it is the responsibility of the Shells, Exxons or Facebooks of this world, will depend on political will. How far are our societies, the governments that we elect, willing to go to guarantee that human rights are upheld, guaranteed and protected?</p><p>The main challenge is of course how the human rights framework is set up, which is state-centric: the state has a number of obligations — to respect, protect and fulfil human rights — vis-à-vis individuals. We are not yet at a stage where direct horizontal effect of human rights, which would allow individuals to seek redress for human rights violations from another individual directly, including from actors like companies, is a&nbsp;fact.</p><p>So for the moment, we will need to work within the framework that we have, which means that human rights enforcement against companies and corporations, including the platforms on which much of our public debate takes place nowadays, will have to go via the&nbsp;state.</p><p>And this brings us back to the question of power dynamics: as individuals, we are dependent on the state and the international systems that states have created to see our human rights respected. Who actually gets to seek redress is a matter of access to justice, which is by no means equally distributed. The quip that “justice is open to all, like the Ritz hotel” still very much holds&nbsp;true.</p><p>This is what often makes me a bit anxious about the discussions on “regulating platform power”. Especially when these discussions point towards putting in place more legislation, I get very nervous. As some of the examples we just looked at demonstrated, and the overall picture around the globe when it comes to protecting free speech and journalism shows, government is often the problem and not the answer when it comes to stifling the free flow of information.</p><blockquote>Especially when these discussions point towards putting in place more legislation, I get very&nbsp;nervous</blockquote><p>Take an example like the NetzDG legislation in Germany, which makes it mandatory for companies like Facebook to remove “hate speech” from its platform or risk hefty fines. Enthusiastically copied by countries across the world, often by countries that do not have a good track record when it comes to protecting free speech, and often modified to expand the type of speech that should be taken down, this type of legislation has been shown to incentivise an overly zealous approach to speech removal. Putting the wrong type of pressure on platforms, and giving governments more power to suppress expression is not the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>If we are talking about regulation, I am much more in favour of thinking in the direction of parallels to the way another powerful private sector, that of banking and finance, is regulated. This would include putting in place stringent transparency obligations: what is taken down and promoted online and why; how are these processes and decisions automated? It would need to be combined with clear and accessible procedures for people to seek redress for perceived violations within an acceptable timeframe (as “justice delayed is also justice denied”…).</p><p>My main qualm with theorising about “solutions” for the conundrum of online speech regulation, however, is that we must ensure to not mistake the manifestation of a problem for the problem itself. Our societies have big, structural problems: power asymmetries that maintain structural inequalities, institutional racism, capitalism. Whatever we create in that setting, including internet platforms, will reproduce that.</p><blockquote>…while it’s nice to think we can “fix the internet”, I believe we should have no illusions of succeeding beyond symptom suppression if we aren’t willing to look&nbsp;deeper</blockquote><p>So while it’s nice to think we can “fix the internet”, I believe we should have no illusions of succeeding beyond symptom suppression if we aren’t willing to look deeper at the root causes of why it’s broken in the first place. If we accept societies in which those whose human rights are routinely violated generally won’t be able to easily seek justice, how do we expect to do better when it comes to safeguarding their human rights&nbsp;online?</p><p>You have heard me be critical of our societies and its power structures and I imagine some of you might be asking the question: “But wait: what about the human rights system itself? This, too, is a product of those same power structures and interests.” This is a very good point, and one I often struggle with, especially when I am reminded of Audre Lorde’s quote that “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s&nbsp;house”.</p><p>Where I stand on this at the moment is a belief that we need to combine a longer-term, aspirational vision with a certain degree of pragmatism. Even if our human rights framework may not be perfect, it is a good place to start to fight for our rights as individuals and as communities. And while we do so, we can work on changing the system itself in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>In doing this, we have to continue to be mindful of the broader impact our work has. Will taking up this particular fight lower barriers for others or increase them? Are we trading individual success for common good? This will entail making difficult choices at times, in which especially those of us who are lawyers and litigators will need to set our egos aside and look beyond short-term wins and ask what structural, systemic change we want to work towards in the longer&nbsp;term.</p><p>Coming back to the right to freedom of expression, and the role it plays in facilitating not only other human rights, but also the very struggle for their realisation, I want to make one final&nbsp;note.</p><blockquote>Progress, especially if we want it to lead to addressing some of the fundamental power inequalities I mentioned before, requires vigorous debate and sometimes fiery disagreement</blockquote><p>And that is that it is important to make sure that, whatever we do, we don’t end up with a lowest common denominator approach or a restrictive interpretation of what a good space for debate is. Progress, especially if we want it to lead to addressing some of the fundamental power inequalities I mentioned before, requires vigorous debate and sometimes fiery disagreement. When I say this, I am not arguing for a right to insult, but rather for a right to provoke. Professor, feminist, and social activist bell hooks expressed this wonderfully in her 1994 essay “Censorship from Left and Right”, and I would like to close with her&nbsp;words:</p><p>“When repression via censorship becomes the norm in progressive political circles, we not only undermine our collective struggles to end domination, we act in complicity with that brand of contemporary, chic fascism that evokes romantic images of unity and solidarity, a return to traditional values, while working to deny free speech and suppress all forms of rebellious thought and action. In recent years, feminist thinkers have fought long and hard to make feminist thinking, theorizing, and practice a radical space of openness where critical dialogue can take place. Much of that struggle has been waged by women of color, beginning with the conflict over whether or not to see issues of race and racism as feminist agendas. Feminist movement, black liberation struggle, and all our progressive political movements to end domination must work to protect free speech. To maintain the space for constructive contestation and confrontation, we must oppose censorship. We remember the pain of silence and work to sustain our power to speak-freely, openly, provocatively.”</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://digitalfreedomfund.org/the-great-facilitator-free-speech-and-power-online-and-off/">https://digitalfreedomfund.org</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-great-facilitator-free-speech-and-power-online-and-off-9651b38c4803">The Great Facilitator: Free Speech and Power, Online and Off</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m very grateful for the opportunities provided to me as an employee of RBC. The bank has created a fast paced environment where I truly learn something new each day. I’m constantly challenged to grow in my role, something I find very rewarding as I know it’s because my team sees potential in me.</p>
<p>This type of environment is something I never thought I’d be able to find in a role that doesn’t require me to travel extensively. I’m very fortunate that I can develop my my career each day while still being home in time for dinner with my family each night.</p>
<p>My work allows me to be my best self in all aspects of my life and that’s what drives me to get out of bed.</p>
 
How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Throughout my career, I’ve been in many different roles – systems administrator, business analyst, technical lead, project manager and project control officer. The wide variety of experiences has really helped me understand how these various functions work together technically.&nbsp; More importantly, I’ve learned many power skills from the people that I’ve worked with. Each person we meet has a story to tell and a lesson to teach.</p>
<p>In one of my first corporate roles, my supervisor was a former submariner, obviously carrying a superhuman level of diligence that I try to incorporate into my own work. There we shared a manager who taught us the importance of being calm and approaching things rationally in every situation.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, I’ve had an amazing manager and mentor, Melissa Carvalho, who has taught me what it means to be agile. Melissa has taught me to always be prepared with facts and data surrounding every situation so we know when to push and when to pivot. This has allowed me to accomplish more and deliver higher quality work than I honestly knew I was capable of.</p>
<blockquote>
 It’s much more important to learn what works for people before learning processes or technology.<br>
What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
</blockquote>
<p>Another mentor I’ve learned a lot from taught me about working with people in unique environments. Every environment is truly unique. As non-unionized employees in a union environment, we needed to learn very quickly how to be aware of and always respectful of the protections afforded to our unionized counterparts. The team had a large workload and needed to comply by certain timelines to ensure they were following their commitments to the union too. With limited time to get to know everyone and learn the roles I’d be helping them with, I found that it’s much more important to learn what works for people before learning processes or technology.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>I want to focus on continue here…Continue setting baselines and benchmarks to ensure we’re all held accountable to providing equitable opportunities. Continue facilitating discussions on how we can build better products that work for all of our clients. Continue cascading these messages into the workforce.</p>
<p>I know we still have so much work to do, but I’m very inspired by the conversations I’ve had in recent months. A lot of questions after previous WiD engagements centered on why diversity matters. In the past year, there’s definitely been a shift. People are now asking how they can be a part of creating diverse teams and providing equitable opportunities.</p>
 
In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>In terms of technology, diverse workforces create better solutions that work for more people. More importantly, diversity brings a richness to our lives that make us all better, stronger, more creative and more compassionate.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>We’ve been looking at a lot of art over the past year- almost like a tour of museums from home. I’m currently reading about Burhan Doğançay (1929 – 2013), a Turkish-American artist probably best known for his works turning graffiti and signs posted on urban walls into modern art. I love that art transcends time and provides a geo-political view of the past.</p>
  
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Work on time management and develop a better understanding of your priorities!</p>

 Tell us a little bit about what you do in the world of identity 
<p>My current role is Director, IAM Business Systems Analysis at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). In this role I oversee a team of Business Analysts who are assigned to work on the various solutions we implement to help centralize the bank’s internal enterprise Identity and Access Management</p>
<p>Another service I oversee is the enhancement process, basically managing requests to enhance and innovate the solutions that support our various objectives. We also manage the Intake process for new capability requests across the many IAM services to ensure they align to our roadmaps and strategic direction.</p>
<p>More recently we have started to focus on Customer IAM (CIAM) and my team will support these initiatives that look to centralize not only our enterprise IAM but also CIAM within the bank. It’s a really exciting development for us as it aligns to such a core focus for our industry.</p>
<p>I can certainly say no two days are the same!! There are so many moving parts. Recently, I have been handling the organizational change management responsibilities for the IAM services we work on, which has added an exciting new layer not only for me but for the wider team.</p>
<p>What I really love most about my role is the combination of self-growth opportunities, the people I work with, the organization as a whole, the great leadership I have experienced,&nbsp; Leading a team of amazing and resilient individuals, I am so proud to be able to support their career growth and development,</p>
<blockquote>
 Diversity helps establish a better sense of community, ensuring everyone has a seat at the table. 
</blockquote>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Firstly I had to remove any self-doubt and trust that I was capable.</p>
<p>Although I have been in the IAM space for 10+ years, I came in with no experience or formal training and that was scary. Much of what I know I learned on the job but I was also fortunate to have had a number of great leaders and mentors. Here I want to call out Melissa Carvalho, Her knowledge and expertise really motivated me. Thanks to her and my other mentors I became a sponge just absorbing everything they taught me. I am convinced that has contributed to getting me to this point, encouraging me to continue to grow and learn.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>To ask questions and encourage questions, feedback, recommendations and input.</p>
<p>We may have always done things a certain way&nbsp; but it does not always mean this is the only way. Being curious allows us to find efficiencies and improvements. It helps build a culture of creativity and thought leadership, driving and seeking change.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>As we focus on identity trends from advancing MFA with adaptive authentication, AI, biometrics or even self-sovereign identity, challenge the status quo.&nbsp; Do not rush into digital identity solutions without the backing of a diverse team who can help address the wide range of issues faced by our users.</p>
<p>Continue to focus on diversity within this space, to make room for different opinions and drive new discussions.</p>
<p>Stop looking for specific, pre-defined skillsets and start and/or continue to provide opportunities for candidates from outside our sector and ‘different’ backgrounds. Different people bring different perspectives which is exactly what we need if the identity sector is to thrive.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Because it broadens our perspective and allows for a variety of viewpoints that inspire me. I see real creativity and innovation come through from our teams but, more importantly, diversity helps establish a better sense of community, ensuring everyone has a seat at the table.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80240086">RBG (Ruth Bader Ginsburg)</a></p>
<p>This documentary is so powerful and moving and gives a real insight into the life and personality of this amazing woman who drove so much change around women’s rights.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>When a plan does not work out the way you envision, don’t let it stop you!</p>
<p>Adapt to change; failure is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Look at the lessons it taught you, rather than the setbacks or discomfort you felt.</p>
<p>And, finally, fall forward and use it to build your resiliency tool kit!</p>

 Berkman Klein event explores the early years of online platforms, the state of current platforms, and the&nbsp;future <p>“Today’s platforms were inspired by the many that preceded them, but along the way, we started to go astray. How can we make sense of where we are today? What can we understand about the decisions that were made and the structures we had in place? And most importantly, how can the builders of new platforms that also intend to bring the world closer together, give everyone the power to create or organize the world’s information, do it&nbsp;better?”</p><p>BKC fellow <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jad-esber">Jad Esber</a> posed these overarching questions at the start of a Berkman Klein Center <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/hindsight-2020">event</a> that looked back on online platforms over the past 30 years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Fake">Caterina Fake</a>, the founder of Flickr, <a href="http://www.bohnettfoundation.org/david-bohnett-bio/">David Bohnett</a>, the founder of Geocities, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/baym/">Nancy Baym</a>, Sr. Principal Research Manager, Microsoft Research, joined Esber to reflect on early platforms, the state of newer platforms today, and what they could look like in the future. Their conversation covered topics including subcultures, content moderation, and the evolution of technology.</p><p>Fake and Bohnett are themselves founders of early popular platforms, and early in the discussion, the panelists highlighted the significance of founders’ values shaping the platforms, and how that trend continues today.</p><p>“You can do a lot to influence and change and manage how a community grows and develops from the outset,” Fake said. “And so much of it is based on the personalities of the founders: what they value, what they don’t value, how they design the software,” she said, also pointing out the important role of business&nbsp;models.</p><p>“I paid a lot of particular attention to the values of building communities of interest,” Bohnett added, highlighting that founders’ values also play a critical role in the inclusiveness of platforms. “Do the founders and the early settlers or participants in these communities value inclusiveness and diversity through their actions?” he asked. “That’s what helps foster&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Baym, in turn, emphasized that values may be harmful in the long run. “They’re essential but I think that we see platforms over and over kind of lose their way when it becomes about the founder’s values,” she said. “And one of the ways I think that they go really wrong is that early on their users who are different from the founders who were running into real problems with those platforms and the users are going, ‘hello, there’s this really bad thing happening to me here.’ And the founders for whatever reasons are not fully able to absorb what they’re hearing about the dangers their platforms are posing. And I don’t mean to underestimate the technical and human labor demands of trying to deal with all of that adequately. They’re very, very hard problems.”</p><p>The discussants also talked about the shift from free services that run on users’ data towards fee-based platforms and how these business models may shape or inform user behavior and investment in the online communities.</p><p>“I do think that people are evolving into a kind of a paid model in reaction to a lot of the exploitation that they’ve suffered under for a long time. And as a result of that, I think, these are obviously very positive trends,” she said, citing Patreon and Substack as examples. “I do think Internet business models swing back and forth between the paid and the free and it’s a pendulum swing that many of us, I think that work in kind of online social systems actually welcome to a great degree. So, I do think that the behaviors are different on platforms that you pay for for all of the reasons David and Nancy have already kind of explained.”</p><p>But the pay-to-play model is not an option for everyone, Baym noted. “I think the trick with platforms you have to pay for, of course, is that we want people who don’t have excess income to be able to participate in online communities,” she said. “So we have to think through how do you enable that so that people in poverty are not getting a third rate internet while the rich folks get the really good community, which of course exacerbates wealth and&nbsp;equity.”</p><p>A podcast version of the event is available <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/hindsight-2020">here</a>.

  <p>The origin of the LEI is firmly rooted in financial services and regulation, yet its future undeniably points to universal applicability across public and private sectors, with relevance to organizations large and small. This potential was recognized at the nascence of the LEI by its chief endorsers, the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). While the LEI’s initial purpose was to provide unique identification of legal entities participating in financial transactions across the globe, the G20 and the FSB were clear from the start that the LEI should become a broad public good and that it holds vast opportunity for the private sector. </p>
<p>Happily, the success of the LEI in context of its initial purpose has stimulated enthusiastic attention for the potential it offers outside of financial services regulation. With 1.82 million LEIs issued to date, 116 regulations and laws globally mandating LEI usage across financial services reporting, supervision and identification use cases worldwide, and a well-established and optimally functioning global LEI issuance and management infrastructure, there is a very convincing and reliable case for its use to be explored and championed in other areas.    </p>
<p>Consequently, in recent years there has been advancing acceptance and advocacy of the LEI’s value as a unique universal identifier among regulators, governments, public authorities and private sectors worldwide. Alongside increasing legislation that mandates the LEI as an identifier for participants in certain financial transactions, there is a growing appetite among leading industry influencers for LEI usage to be extended across existing and new markets and applications. All of this signals that we are on the verge of exciting and transformational developments as we look to the years ahead. </p>
<p>Yet with so many – as yet unidentified and untested - ways in which the LEI’s capabilities can be harnessed, there are many current and potential LEI stakeholders who are unaware or unclear of its potential to deliver unique trust benefits to identity management scenarios and ecosystems globally. GLEIF recognizes that the universal relevance of the LEI means that its future potential far exceeds its current application. Quite simply, all use cases have not yet been envisioned, least of all demonstrated, because its use cases are potentially limitless. This is especially true as society moves towards digitalization, and digital identity management systems are increasingly required to establish trust and transparency in online exchanges. The LEI is perfectly poised to support this challenge. </p>
<p>For this reason, GLEIF is launching this ‘LEI Lightbulb Series’. Its aim is to bring clarity, knowledge and understanding of how the LEI is being used and championed, both inside and outside of regulatory realms and who its advocates are, in order to create a ‘complete picture’ of the LEI’s progress. We hope that by sharing news of high-profile support and implementation by regulators and public and private sector influencers across a myriad of sectors, applications and geographies, we may help readers arrive at their own ‘light bulb’ moment regarding the increasing relevance and universal application of the LEI in use cases and industries beyond those circles where it is already well established.   </p>
<p>While educating on the powerful impact the LEI has already had on industry transformation and digitalization through regulatory mandates, and where its value has been recognized through endorsements by credible authorities, this blog series will also aim to outline the business case for consideration of further LEI usage and potential regulation, in industries and for use cases where it could make an immediate and positive impact. </p>
<p>By demonstrating how success derived from strong regulatory roots is giving rise to a groundswell of champions for further LEI regulation and voluntary LEI adoption across new and emerging applications, GLEIF hopes to educate on both the current and future potential value that ‘one global identity’ can deliver for businesses, regardless of sector, world-wide.</p>

 Here’s what the next three months look like for BrightID. BrightID Q2 2021&nbsp;Roadmap<p>Let’s go into each of the six milestones in a little more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>🔬 Node discovery. How does a client (for example the BrightID app on your mobile device) know which node in the BrightID network to connect to? After this milestone, clients will be able to find out about other nodes from a small list of hard-coded “seed” nodes. If seed nodes trust other nodes, they’ll be added to the list. Then clients can use a “<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race">promise race</a>” and other data to find the best node to connect&nbsp;to.</p><p>👩‍🔬 Anti-Sybil: Stronger connection types. You may have noticed there are different connection levels in BrightID. Different connection levels create different graphs of users. The goal is to have a verification that uses the very strong “recovery” connection level, which real people only assign to others they trust enough to help guard their BrightID against theft or&nbsp;loss.</p><p>🕵🏽‍♀️ Blind signatures. Currently, BrightID nodes store mappings between anonymous identifiers used by apps and BrightID identifiers so that an app can query about someone’s unique verification using their own identifiers. (BrightIDs are not shared with apps.) While this structure makes it less likely that a data leak could reveal information from one app to another, we can do even better. <a href="https://forum.brightid.org/t/improved-privacy-social-recovery-for-apps-no-need-for-contexts/54">With blind signatures, we can remove this mapping completely</a>. This simplifies the architecture and makes the system even more immune to data&nbsp;leaks.</p><p>📲 Client portability. We’ve already created the necessary features in the node API for a user to install BrightID on multiple devices and backup or recover their BrightID using another device, but would be hard to implement this without an example. We’re going to build a web version of BrightID that supports these features so that others can use it as an example to make their own BrightID&nbsp;clients.</p><p>💉 Anti-Sybil: attack modeling and injection. <a href="https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-AntiSybil">We’ve already created a great platform for modeling sybil attacks and comparing the results of different algorithms or parameters</a>. In some approaches to sybil-resistance in social networks, there is a manual review step, and the algorithm is used to prioritize accounts to review. As a pseudonymous network, BrightID prefers an automated way to define the line between sybil and honest users. We can do this by automatically injecting modeled attacks into the real graph and measuring their rank against previously measured&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>🛡️Node Security. BrightID nodes have already gone through a hardening process, with sensible rate limits in place by default, but we want to take another pass at this. We also want to create <a href="https://stoplight.io/blog/introduction-to-api-testing/#api-producer-contract-testing">API contract tests</a> to make sure our node API and <a href="https://dev.brightid.org/docs/node-api/">reference docs</a> match. We will also audit the use of digital signatures and secure message&nbsp;passing.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/brightid/brightid-2021-q2-roadmap-e8585a42c3fc">BrightID 2021 Q2 Roadmap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/brightid">BrightID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 We meet Krista Pawley to find out about her role as a&nbsp; ‘woman in identity’ …. 
<p></p>
 Tell us about yourself and your work as Co-Lead at IdentityNORTH 
<p>We started IdentityNORTH as a small group of 30 people in a conference room and we’ve now grown into a community of over 3000 leaders from all sectors dedicated to working together to build a more innovative, secure, and inclusive digital economy.</p>
<p>What gets me excited about this work is the ability to connect with some of the smartest people in tech, public policy, civil society and business on some of the biggest questions facing our our world.</p>
<p>Over the years that I have been doing this work, I have seen how our conversations have evolved&nbsp; from highly technical discussions focused on IT and workflows to a more user-centric dialogue, focused on people, privacy and leveraging digital Identity.&nbsp; We are much more focused now on how we enable a more inclusive and safe digital economy.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that we have the talent, vision, and community in Canada to lead the world in digital transformation. It’s what gets me up each morning!&nbsp; And I know we can do it in an inclusive, privacy-enhancing way that will benefit all Canadians. The ability to be part of something that makes that kind of positive impact is so exciting to me.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I have had the privilege of working at senior levels across government&nbsp; (on and off Parliament Hill),&nbsp; the private sector (financial services, loyalty, and consumer retail sector leading teams in over 50 countries) and the non-profit world (working with a global leader in education and financial inclusion). Five years ago I decided to take what I had learned over the past 20 years and turn my experience, network, and energy towards building communities of action around the big questions that have the potential to drive positive change in Canada and around the world.</p>
<p>Inspired by the leaders and mentors who guided me throughout my career, I worked with communities like IdentityNORTH, SingularityU Canada, the Atlantic Council Geo Tech Centre, and Equitas to build communities of leaders who believe that we have the tools, the technology, and the responsibility to build a better future together.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seek out the different and invite them to be part of the conversation.</p></blockquote>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>People like to be asked, and they like to be thanked. A political boss taught me that!</p>
<p>If you are looking to build a community, you need to think about who should be part of that community. Don’t go just for those you already know and who look, sound, and think like you. Invite people from different backgrounds and perspectives. Seek out the different and invite them to be part of the conversation. This is how we grow, how we learn. When people feel included, they are more likely to help you and you are more likely to learn.</p>
<p>Oh, and say thank you. Being grateful and expressing that gratitude shows others that you recognize and appreciate them. It also re-enforces your own sense of appreciation for all that is good and constructive around you. That gratitude can help see you through a lot of challenges.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>If you are looking to grow your business in the digital age, digital identity is a vital enabler of that growth. The Pandemic pushed us forward at least five years in terms of customers’ willingness to adopt and demand secure, trusted, convenient, and user-centric digital services. From e-commerce and on-line banking to healthcare and education, every sector has the potential to be transformed through digitisation. The leaders who recognize this and build tools to enable their organisations to adapt will not only survive; they will thrive.</p>
<p>CEOs and Boards need to STOP looking in the rearview mirror and building strategies and business models that imagine a future that looks like our past. They need to START thinking about the exponential technologies that are transforming our world and think about how these might impact their business and sector. This new way of leading will require both courage and imagination. They need to START seeking out truly diverse perspectives to help them imagine the unimaginable future and plan for it – because chances are what is unimaginable is more likely than many believe.</p>
<p>Lastly, they need to CONTINUE building the critical infrastructure that will enable them to seize these opportunities. Working with organizations like DiACC (Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada), Women in Identity, and IdentityNORTH, leaders have the opportunity to move ahead of the competition. Diverse viewpoints from these extended teams helps with understanding and implementing the critical frameworks and tools that will make a real difference.</p>
<blockquote><p>diverse perspectives help to imagine the unimaginable future</p></blockquote>
 
Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the key to learning. If all we ever hear are the voices of those who look, think, and feel like us, we will fail to learn and grow.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>Warren Berger’s A More Beautiful Question.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many of us have lost our curiosity; we are afraid to ask questions for fear of looking foolish. Berger shows us that the foolish thing is , in fact, to stop asking. That learning, wisdom, and growth come from the courage to ask and stay curious.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Seek out the people you admire and ask them for advice. I was too shy as a teen to do this. When I got older, I learned that many of the people I admired were kind, generous people who were happy to help when approached with a thoughtful, clear request.</p>

<p>Digital Identity NZ is entering a new phase of its journey; our superlative inaugural Chair David Morrison is joined by Ben Tairea as Co-Chair and Tamāra Al-Salim as Deputy Chair.&nbsp; You can read more about Tamāra’s and Ben’s stories below.&nbsp; The trio will lead the governance of the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council</a>&nbsp;as we navigate the next period of rapid change.&nbsp; This is also my last newsletter as Executive Director of Digital Identity NZ.&nbsp; Like David, I took on this role upon the formation of Digital Identity NZ in 2019, and after nearly 2 ½ years it is time to hand over the pleasure and responsibility to someone new.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I reflect on the last 2+ years, an overriding theme is one of interconnectedness, both technically and socially.&nbsp; The premise and promise of digital identity is more seamless and efficient ways of interacting online, whilst at the same time improving privacy, transparency, security and choice (solutions that are truly mana-enhancing).&nbsp; The words of the karakia gifted to us by Janelle Riki-Waaka (kaiwhakahaere/advisor and member of our Executive Council) are apt to the journey we are on:</p>



<p>Unuhia te pō, te pō whiri mārama<br>Tomokia te ao, te ao whatu tāngata<br>Tātai ki runga, tātai ki raro, tātai aho rau<br>Haumi e, hui e, tāiki e!<br>&nbsp;<br>From the confusion comes understanding<br>From understanding comes unity<br>We are interwoven, we are interconnected<br>Together as one!</p>



<p>We start and end all of our Council meetings, webinars and working groups with these words as a reminder of our shared past, present and future.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is much work still to be done as we collectively work on a digital identity ecosystem designed for Aotearoa.&nbsp; This is the work of Government, iwi, innovators, advocates, academics, community groups and businesses of all shapes and sizes.&nbsp; My parting challenge to us all is to continue to work in trusted collaboration for the benefit of all people in Aotearoa, and to do so with the core principles of Te Tiriti anchoring the mahi (work); kāwanatanga (honourable governance), rangatiratanga (self determination and agency) and ōretitanga (equity and partnership).</p>

<p>President Biden’s ability to rebuild alliances, restore America’s standing in the world and unite the nation hinges on his ability to reign in tech giants here at&nbsp;home</p><p>By Gus Rossi, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>President Biden’s pledge to restore diplomacy as the United States’ primary instrument of foreign policy is an important and necessary shift away from his predecessor’s destructive America First approach that shunned multilateralism and jeopardized relationships with important allies.</p><p>But diplomacy alone is not a cure-all for America’s diminished standing abroad. To regain the trust of our allies and the American people, the Biden administration must wrest control of international affairs from American technology giants and into the hands of US citizens.</p><p>For decades, America’s foreign and digital trade policies had been guided by the notion that whatever Silicon Valley wanted was good for America — and for the world. That naive assumption is finally giving way to the recognition that unregulated and unaccountable tech giants pose great and literal danger for public safety, democracy, and competitive markets.</p><p>President Biden now has an opportunity to act against these&nbsp;threats.</p><p>The hands-off approach began in an era when the internet promised a free flow of information and ideas around the world. Technology, many believed, brought down autocracies in the Arab Spring with tweets instead of bombs. By unlocking social media’s organizing and mobilizing power, Barack Obama became America’s first Black president.</p><p>Democrats, including the Obama administration, were enamored by the tech industry. It helped that many tech leaders supported the administration’s priorities and gave generously to support those progressive causes. Inevitably, this love affair shaped Democrats’ digital foreign and trade&nbsp;policy.</p><p>But Big Tech has long enjoyed a cozy relationship with the executive branch, regardless of which party occupies the White&nbsp;House.</p><p>Silicon Valley has for decades pressured the US to limit the role of the International Telecommunication Union (the U.N. body tasked with setting internet, telecom, and other technical standards) so that tech companies can operate with as few regulations as possible.</p><p>In the early 2010s, the US Embassy to the E.U. lobbied on behalf of Silicon Valley against Europe’s privacy laws and promoted the APEC privacy framework, an alternative that was both toothless and&nbsp;weak.</p><p>When negotiating trade agreements, the US Trade Representative tried to include the Communications Decency Act (CDA) third-party liability shield that enables tech platforms to profit from disinformation and hate&nbsp;speech.</p><p>Both the Obama and Trump administrations consistently fought European efforts to tax tech companies.</p><p>By doing Big Tech’s bidding, US policies left consumers — and our national interest — vulnerable. The result is waning US influence across the globe and a fraying democracy at&nbsp;home.</p><p>Abroad, the EU has become the de-facto regulator of the tech economy with the 2014 adoption of its data and privacy regime, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It has since threatened to ban American companies from moving data across the Atlantic because the US does not offer guarantees for Europeans’ data. China has also seized the opportunity and is promoting its technology to manage our ally’s critical telecom infrastructure. Meanwhile, Chinese social media companies are collecting reams of American and European personal data through social media platforms.</p><p>Stateside, organized online and in plain sight across a variety of internet platforms, the failed insurrection at the Capitol was only the latest, most shocking example of Big Tech’s perverse incentive to promote disinformation and radicalization, suppress innovation, monopolize markets and other anti-democratic activities.</p><p>Fortunately, there signs that the love affair between Democrats and Big Tech is disintegrating:</p><p>Last year, dozens of Democratic state attorneys general brought antitrust cases against Google and Facebook. Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Facebook of being complicit in adding disinformation to the public debate. California, the heavily Democratic home to Silicon Valley, adopted a second landmark privacy law. The House Antitrust Subcommittee subpoenaed thousands of documents from tech titans, grilled CEOs at hearings, and published a report that outlines how to make digital markets competitive. And many Democratic members of Congress are actively considering bills to curtail the power of tech platforms.</p><p>Now, President Biden can both strengthen US democracy and rebuild relationship with allies by making substantial updates to America’s digital foreign policy including:</p><p>· Collaborate with the EU’s to develop and promote a framework for democratic governance of the tech economy, pro-competitive rules, and accountability principles.</p><p>· End trade agreements that make it harder for third countries to hold platforms responsible for promoting disinformation and hate speech. The CDA should not be exported.</p><p>· Protect transatlantic data flows and consumer data with an international agreement that commits the US to a privacy framework compatible and equivalent to Europe’s.</p><p>· Update global corporate tax rules for online companies to avoid a costly balkanization of taxation to American companies and allow third countries to collect a fair amount of taxes from the profit that companies make&nbsp;abroad.</p><p>· Diversify the State Department’s delegations to international institutions by offering travel stipends to independent academics and civil society experts to ensure corporate interests are not the only ones represented.</p><p>How we approach diplomacy abroad should reflect our values and interests at home. More than ever the world needs to hear that America and President Biden believe in the democratic governance and regulation of the tech economy for the public’s interest, not Silicon Valley.

<p>One of the key principles of DIDAS is that we help experts coming from various industries and professions to work together, learn from each other and bring new ideas on how to apply SSI technology in real world.</p>
<p>To make it happen, we encourage our members to propose topics and explore ideas in dedicated working groups.&nbsp; Working Groups allow us to agree on the goals that the experts will pursue jointly,&nbsp; structure the work and define the results. After all, we want to see SSI become a reality in Switzerland!</p>
<p>We are very happy that more than 15 experts got together to kick off our Onboarding Working Group. This group grew out of the idea that many different activities today require sharing of verifiable information – personal identity, company registration, tax identifiers, addresses, and so on and so forth.<br>
In Switzerland, Financial sector is very strong and so a lot of innovation happens around Fintech.&nbsp; Our original idea, therefore, was to focus on Fintech use-cases around onboarding, KYC and AML processing and similar activities.</p>
<p>As we started to explore these ideas in depth during the session, we understood that not only Fintech, but other Industries ( e.g. Insurance, B2B Supplier onboarding, etc) can benefit strongly from an ability to securely exchange identity and registration data using Verifiable Credentials, which are easy to maintain in the future, including automated invalidation of credentials that were recalled by their issuers.</p>
<p>It is also clear that various use-cases depend on the existing legislation and might be difficult to implement in today’s legal environment.<br>
In recognition of this fact, the group has agreed to catalog various use-cases, examine their legal implications and requirements, explore whether or not it is possible to find solutions and approaches that are compatible with the today’s set of laws, plan technical PoCs and implementations.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Swiss lawyers are among the most creative professionals in the world and are enthusiastic about opportunities to find improvements in the legal system that are required to make Switzerland the best and the most innovative country to do business. The recent legislation on Blockchain Assets in Switzerland is a great demonstration of that fact.<br>
Even in the case that some SSI onboarding use-cases might be difficult to implement within the limits of the current legislation, the group will identify the needed improvements and&nbsp; work with the lawmakers, regulators and politicians to develop and promote the required changes.</p>
<p>This is one of the core missions of DIDAS –&nbsp; drive Thought Leadership and remove barriers to implementation of SSI and Verifiable Claims technology&nbsp;in Switzerland.</p>
<p>If you are interested and want to bring your technical, business, legal and/or creative skills and ideas into the effort, even if you know nothing about the SSI yet, we are looking for you!</p>

<p>By Beth Kanter, Chief Advocacy &amp; Strategic Communications Officer</p><p>The past year has seen working Americans struggle amidst a global pandemic and economic crisis, further exacerbating the deep, structural inequities in our society. Over and over again, the rules, ideas, and power that lie at the heart of our economy and democracy have rewarded the few at the expense of the many. In order to build a truly equitable and inclusive society, these trends must be quickly reversed. President Biden signing the American Rescue Plan into law today moves us one step closer to that&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Because of critical aid in the American Rescue Plan, child poverty in the United States is expected to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/26/970999998/with-one-move-congress-could-lift-millions-of-children-out-of-poverty">drop by half</a>. More than one million unionized working people who faced the prospect of losing their pensions will now receive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/business/dealbook/bailout-pensions-stimulus.html">full retirement benefits</a> for at least the next 30 years. The government will be sending direct <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/1400-stimulus-checks-who-is-eligible-how-soon-they-could-arrive.html">relief checks</a> to the majority of Americans who earn less than $75,000 a year. Unemployed Americans will receive an extra $300 on top of their current benefits through the end of this summer. State and local governments will finally get <a href="https://statescoop.com/senate-approves-relief-package-with-350b-in-state-and-local-aid/">urgently needed aid</a> so they don’t have to make harmful cuts or enact&nbsp;layoffs.</p><p>This $1.9 trillion investment in families will help set us on a course toward an economy that works for all Americans. While there is still much to be done, Omidyar Network welcomes this momentous piece of legislation and we look forward to collaborating with our partners, grantees and policy makers to continue the path forward to a more equitable and inclusive society.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/omidyar-network-applauds-enactment-of-the-american-rescue-plan-5d2b395e90d5">Omidyar Network Applauds Enactment of the American Rescue Plan</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Announcing ELP <p>Today we're excited to announce that we are officially opening applications for the Ceramic Mainnet Early Launch Program (ELP). This program allows a limited number of projects to get early access to the Ceramic mainnet before it is opened to the general public later this year.</p><p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Apply to the Early Launch Program</a> if you want to deploy your <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> and/or <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> project to production in the coming months. </p> FAQs  Who is the program for? <p>ELP is for projects that want to use Ceramic and/or IDX in production ASAP. We created this program so you could get started immediately.</p> When does the program start? <p>Starting today we will begin accepting applications on a rolling basis. For those accepted into the program, mainnet access will begin in approximately 4-6 weeks. We will communicate the official mainnet start date via email. Before mainnet is ready, you can start prototyping your application on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a>.</p> How do I apply? <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Apply using this form</a>. Our team will promptly evaluate submissions and reach out via email when we are ready to onboard your project. Please provide as much detail as possible to help us evaluate your submission.</p> How will you evaluate applications? <p>We have a set of evaluation criteria but generally we will prioritize projects with the most active users, those who have been most active in our community, those who plan to go live with Ceramic/IDX as soon as possible, those with the most interesting use cases, those that deliver the most aggregate value to the Ceramic ecosystem, and those who can commit to providing us detailed feedback.</p> What happens if I'm on the waitlist? <p>While you're waiting, you can begin prototyping and building your application on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a> and contributing in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>. We will accept projects from the waitlist on a rolling basis.</p> What are the program details? <p>Projects that have been accepted into the ELP get early access to Ceramic mainnet nodes running on <a href="https://3boxlabs.com/">3Box Labs</a> infrastructure. For the duration of the program, these will be the only nodes connected to mainnet.</p> Is this a "centralized mainnet"? <p>We like to think of ELP as a mainnet with training wheels. All the primary features of mainnet are there such as a Ceramic mainnet pubsub topic and anchoring document updates on the Ethereum mainnet, but by limiting variables such as the number of nodes on the network and the number of overall participants we can make sure everything works well in a controlled production environment before opening the network to the chaos of the general public.</p> How long does the program last? <p>We have not yet set an end date. We will conclude the program and launch the public Ceramic mainnet when we feel the network has been battle tested enough by applications in production during ELP.</p> What happens at the conclusion of the program? <p>After ELP has concluded, Ceramic mainnet will be released to the general public and anyone can run a node and deploy their project in production.</p> When is public mainnet launching? <p>At the conclusion of ELP.</p> Where can I learn more? <p>Join the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Sign up today <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Complete the ELP application</a></p>

<p>Conviction Voting (CV) is a governance mechanism that allows users to signal their preference on various issues by staking their tokens on proposals. A proposal passes if it has sufficient weight allocated to it. The weight of a proposal is calculated based on the amount of tokens that have been staked and the amount of time these tokens have been staked. The <a href="https://medium.com/commonsstack/announcing-the-conviction-voting-cadcad-model-release-8e907ce67e4e">introduction to conviction voting</a> by Common Stack is a great primer if you want to learn more about how CV works. </p><p>Implementations of CV so far have been developed on the EVM, which makes the results and outcomes completely trustless. While there are some deployments like <a href="https://1hive.org">1Hive</a> and <a href="https://cv.commonsstack.org">Common Stack</a>, high gas costs and the sub-optimal user experience of transferring tokens for every vote make this quite problematic. Fortunately conviction voting systems can be securely implemented using off-chain, verifiable data structures. Building CV systems off-chain, as opposed to on-chain, avoids the high gas costs and poor user experience that plagues current implementations while still achieving verifiability and participant trust.</p><p>This article will explain how you can use <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> and <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> as an underlying data structure to build a conviction voting dapp.</p> Intro to Ceramic and IDX <p>Ceramic is a decentralized protocol for verifiable, version-controlled content. Ceramic is used to create mutable data on IPFS with permanent identifiers, called StreamIDs. All updates are signed and then periodically anchored into the blockchain for time-stamping and consensus. You can think of a single Ceramic stream as its own ledger which contains all the information needed to reconstruct the state of the stream in a completely trustless manner. For more details refer to the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md">Ceramic specification</a>.</p><p>IDX is a decentralized identity protocol built on top of Ceramic which makes it easy to associate data to a user, discover data a user has created, and build user-centric applications. You can think of IDX as a decentralized user table. Each user has their own index which is a map from definitions to records. Definitions are globally-defined descriptions of data created by developers. Each user has their own individual record for each definition which stores their content. For more information have a look at the <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/overview/">IDX developer documentation</a>.</p> System overview <p>The proposed conviction voting system is based on an ERC20 token that is periodically snapshotted. This means that the token balances of all users are not updated continuously but instead on a set interval, e.g. twice a day. Additionally, users can easily change their voting preferences at any time.</p><p>There are three main system components:</p>  User-created content including: 1) proposal documents which contain information for a given proposal, and 2) conviction documents where users set their preferences among all live proposals. Both proposal and conviction documents are stored as Ceramic TileDocuments.  A snapshot service that takes snapshots of the balances of all users of a particular ERC20 token, calculates the total conviction weight for all proposals from users' conviction documents, and saves them into a conviction state document  An oracle system that resolves passed proposals on-chain when the conviction state document has sufficient conviction weight for any given proposal   User-created content  Proposal document <p>Any user can create a proposal document when they want to request funds for a project. This document could contain any amount of information, but most important to be included is: <code>context</code> the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-19.md">caip-19 asset id</a> (ERC20 token address) that is used for the conviction voting, <code>beneficiary</code> the receiver of the funds if the proposal passes, <code>amount</code> the amount of funds to send if the proposal passes.</p><p>Example content<br>This example is a proposal to get some funding for a project. Other proposals might include executing a transaction with call data, setting a protocol parameter, or updating some organizational document.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  title: "Develop an off-chain conviction voting system",
  currency: "ETH",
  amount: 200,
  beneficiary: "0xabcdef",
  description: "Fund team X to implement off-chain conviction voting using Ceramic &amp; IDX.",
  url: "https://ceramic.network"
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Proposal document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Convictions document <p>Each participant in the conviction voting system creates their own convictions document when they first interact with the conviction voting dapp. This document contains the convictions the user has assigned to various proposals as a fraction of their entire token holdings. Every time they change their preference the underlying Ceramic document gets updated, signed, and eventually anchored on-chain.</p><p>A conviction voting dapp would create a definition as defined in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">CIP-87</a> and each user would store a convictions document as a record in their IDX.</p><p>Example content<br>In this example we see a single user's convictions document. They have created <code>proposal2</code> and they have allocated different fractions of their token holdings to proposal 1, 2, and 3.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  proposals: ["&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;"],
  convictions: [{
    proposal: "&lt;proposal1-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.2,
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.5,
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal3-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.3,
  }]
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Preference document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Snapshot service <p>The snapshot service performs the task of periodically taking a snapshot of the balances of all token holders of the particular ERC20 being used. Using this information together with individual users' conviction documents, it <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">calculates the total conviction</a> and writes it to a conviction state document. This service is not trusted since anyone could compute the same conviction state by simply grabbing the data from the blockchain. The service executes at a set time interval, for example twice a day.</p> Syncing data &amp; performing calculations <p>Since we are not restricted to calculate the conviction score for all proposals on-chain we can simply use the discrete version of the conviction voting algorithm which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad</a>. On every discrete time interval the snapshot service grabs all token holders and their balances from the blockchain (e.g. using TheGraph). The address of each token holder is used to look up their individual IDX document which should contain their convictions document. The total conviction y_t+1 can now be calculated for each proposal using the formula in Figure 1.</p>Figure 1: How to calculate the total conviction for each proposal j. Source: <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb</a><p>Once total conviction for each proposal is calculated, the snapshot service also calculates the trigger function for each proposal. Finally the service updates the conviction state document with the new state.</p> Conviction state document <p>The conviction state document stores the full state of the conviction voting system. It is created and updated by the snapshot service. It contains two main arrays as well as supply information:</p>  <code>participants</code> - all token holders, their current token balance, and the latest CommitID of their convictions document at the time the snapshot was made  <code>proposals</code> - all active proposals and their total conviction which has been calculated by the snapshot service  <code>supply</code> - the total supply of the ERC20 token that is used for governance  <p>Example content<br>In this example we see that there are two participants who have a token balance and have created their own convictions documents. We also see that there are two active proposals, both of which have not yet been triggered, and have different levels of total conviction.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  supply: 9001,

    triggered: false
  }]
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Conviction state document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Oracle system <p>Once we have the conviction state document it's trivial to check the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BlockScience/Aragon_Conviction_Voting/blob/master/models/v3/Trigger_Function_Explanation.ipynb">trigger function</a> for any particular proposal. When a proposal has sufficient weight an oracle service (e.g. Chainlink) can be triggered to submit the data of the passed proposal on-chain. This would send the requested funds to the beneficiary in the proposal. It's also possible to use conviction voting to set smart contract parameters or proposal ranking (not execution). In these cases we would calculate a dynamic average instead of using a trigger function.</p> Executing proposals on-chain <p>In order to execute the transaction on-chain we can use an oracle system to get the relevant state from the conviction state document on-chain if a proposal has been triggered. Ideally this would be a set of oracles that can independently verify the state of this document before it's committed on-chain. However, in many cases it might be sufficient to use a simpler oracle system such as Chainlink to simply fetch the state of the document from the Ceramic gateway. The main data that needs to make it on-chain is <code>beneficiary</code> and <code>amount</code>.</p> Notes on security  Snapshot trust <p>The main point of trust in this system is the snapshot service. While anyone can independently verify that it has performed the proper calculations, this might not always happen. When implementing this CV system in production there likely needs to be some additional checks and balances that enable the snapshot service to be replaced. Alternatively a system may choose to require multiple snapshot service providers that are operated by independent parties.</p> Proposal manipulation <p>The proposal document could be updated to request a larger <code>amount</code> of funds after it has already started getting a large amount of conviction. In order to mitigate this attack, the snapshot service might require users to reconfirm their conviction for the proposal, without losing the time staked, before it is triggered.</p> Convictions reorg attack <p>Since Ceramic TileDocuments currently rely on the "earliest anchor wins" conflict resolution method, a user could perform a <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md#data-withholding-attacks">data withholding attack</a> where their conviction would be counted twice. The attack would involve the user first updating their preference document to proposal A and anchoring it, but withholding this data by not submitting it to the Ceramic network. Then they would set their preference doc to proposal B and publicly submit this to the network. Once proposal B has been passed, they would publish their data about proposal A which would invalidate their conviction on proposal B (because A was anchored earlier) and it would look as if they have staked their tokens on proposal A for a long period of time. This entire problem is solved by the fact that the snapshot service sets the CommitID of the user's preference doc in the snapshot document. So if a user cheats like this it would be simple to see that they have double voted and all of their votes would be invalidated from that point in time.</p> Alternative implementations <p>IDX can be used to store any type of user-related data such as verifications for social accounts (Twitter, Github, Discord, Discourse, ...), a BrightID score, or any other similar information. This flexibility makes it possible to easily experiment with quadratic voting where accounts that are less likely to be sybils can influence the vote more.</p><p>Using an oracle to trigger actions on-chain would be ideal, but as a minimum viable product it might be simpler to just use the off-chain voting system as a way to generate signal. A trusted multi-sig can then be used to execute on-chain actions, similar to how <a href="http://snapshot.page">snapshot.page</a> is used.</p> Get involved! <p>This article outlines a basic framework for how off-chain conviction voting systems can be built, but there are still many details that need to be solved.

<p>By Audrey Stienon, Analyst, Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>This post expands on the first key pillar for building a new economic paradigm as outlined in <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Our Call to Reimagine Capitalism</a>. Read the first post in this series, “An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and Economy”&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">here</a>.</p><p>Five decades ago, our society experienced a seismic shift. Underneath the layers of headlines about the crises of the day — lingering economic stagnation, growing calls for civil rights and racial justice, and the departure of a disgraced president — the values that we used to guide our lives were changing. Old traditions and ideals were being abandoned, and new ones were emerging. <br> <br>One value, in particular, quickly rose to the forefront of our social discourse and crystalized to become our cultural touchstone: individual liberty. <br> <br> Liberty, of course, is a bedrock American value — ranking right in between “life” and “the pursuit of happiness” in the Declaration of Independence. Our country was founded on the belief that a society and economy can only truly thrive when individuals are free to pursue their desires and self-interests, both at the ballot box as a citizen of a democratic nation, and in the free market as an enterprising participant of a capitalist system.<br> <br>For two hundred years, a commitment to liberty was one of the integral pieces of the base on which we sought to construct an ever-larger, ever-more-inclusive American society. In the 1970s, however, this base of diverse values and norms failed to shelter us from the crises of the time, and we chose to prioritize liberty as the base value that could keep our social edifice standing. Meanwhile, we abandoned the other values, norms, and institutions supporting our society as unnecessary constraints on liberty, and through willful neglect if not active undermining, allowed these parts of our social foundations to erode and decay.<br> <br>To build on this new, more sparse, foundation of values, we turned to a set of ideas that described markets as the ideal tool for maximizing liberty. Ideal markets, after all, are ones where anyone is free to buy, sell, work, or trade without interference. We therefore accepted as fact a simple, yet compelling theory: that these free markets, by generating wealth and automatically distributing it from businesses to working people, would create the best possible society for everyone. <br> <br>For the past fifty years, these ideas have been the blueprint we used to design and build our society.<br> <br>We have measured the wellbeing of our society by tracking the wellbeing of markets, and lauded ourselves as GDP, corporate profits, job numbers, and the stock market continued to rise. <br> <br>We have sought to remove government from markets and our lives: lowering taxes, deregulating, and increasingly relying on markets to provide services that had once been the responsibility of government. We worked to weaken labor unions, community leaders, even our own elected representatives — anyone who threatened to challenge the wisdom of markets. <br> <br>At the same time, we have empowered business leaders and trade associations, assured that these job creators knew best how to generate profits that would naturally, and without intervention, trickle down to the rest of society. <br> <br>Have trickle-down economics worked? If we view our society through the narrow frame of profits and growth, we could almost believe that the last fifty years have been a success. Look at the stock market! If it’s reaching record heights, then we must all be richer than we’ve ever been before!<br> <br>But, of course, we all know this view to be a delusion. By so many measures, our economy has failed us. Our growing GDP masks our growing inequality, just as rising job numbers ignore how job quality and wages have been falling, forcing more and more people to work multiple jobs while still being barely able to support their families. Meanwhile, growing corporate profits do not mean this wealth is shared with the working people who made those profits possible — let alone invested to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/windfall-profits-and-deadly-risks/">protect people’s health during a pandemic. </a>Finally, an excess focus on free markets has, if anything made the markets themselves weaker — less innovative, less competitive, less resilient — as businesses used their new freedom to earn profits through monopolies and rent seeking rather than producing services of value to society.<br> <br>If these fifty years have been an experiment of an economic theory, it is time to conclude, based on overwhelming evidence, that it has failed. Freer markets did not create a freer society. In fact, by “freeing” business from having to account for the negative consequences of their behavior, we burdened people, communities, and the planet with the growing weight of these costs, and by “freeing” people from familial, community, and public support systems, we forced people to pay the full price of any accident or mistake they might run into. <br> <br>In doing so, we eliminated the choices people could make. How many of us have been unable to search for a better job, move to a new state, or open a new business because we and our families simply cannot afford the risk? Our living costs are rising, and there is nothing left to catch us if we fall.<br> <br>We have spent too long trying to balance the entirety of our vibrant and complex society on top of a narrow and crumbling foundation. It is time for us to widen our frame of thinking and design a society built using a broader set of values that will be resilient to the growing tremors facing the world. <br> <br>We need values like the dignity of having one’s worth measured by one’s contribution to one’s community, and not one’s wage; like the security and stability that comes from knowing that, even if the worst were to happen — unemployment, sickness, injury, natural disaster, or even a pandemic — you would still be able to keep your family in your home, put food on the table, and receive needed care; like the justice of seeing past harm accounted for, and future harm averted; like the sustainability of a society that can prosper in perpetuity.</p><blockquote>Our definition of success must be more than just a subset of economic indicators. True success is achieved when our families are safe and healthy, when our communities are welcoming and full of opportunity, when our use of our planet’s resources are not unsustainably destructive…and, yes, when our businesses, small and large, can thrive and support our society’s wellbeing.</blockquote><p>Omidyar Network supports a number of organizations that are pushing to expand the range of values and ideas used to understand the economy. Our goal is not to advance any one solution, but rather to generate a multitude of proposals for moving us from a society that prioritizes only profits to a reimagined capitalism which prioritizes human flourishing in all its&nbsp;forms.</p><p>Our search for new ideas led us (unsurprisingly) to think tanks. This is why we are supporting a range of organizations that are elevating human centered perspectives on the social role of our economy and proposing innovative solutions to our collective challenges.<br> <br>The <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/">Roosevelt Institute</a>, for example, advocates for structural economic change through progressive policies. Their fellows are key voices in promoting the pursuit of economic security, more dignity, and, ultimately, more human thriving for more people. As its President and CEO Felicia Wong <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RI_EmergingWorldview_report-202001-1.pdf">notes</a>, “The move to values beyond ‘freedom to participate in a capital-focused marketplace’ is the central pillar of post-neoliberal thinking. If the new progressivism is to thrive, making plain the values inherent in our economic choices will be essential.” One of their recent reports, <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/new-rules-for-the-21st-century-corporate-power-public-power-future-american-economy/">New Rules for the 21st Century</a>, discusses the need to strengthen our democracy by thinking differently about the respective social roles of markets and government; last summer, they released a <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RI-TrueNewDealReport_202008.pdf">True New Deal</a> promoting essential reforms for the COVID-19 era. <br> <br>Meanwhile, <a href="https://americancompass.org/about/">American Compass </a>is working to create a coalition of thinkers drawing on conservative values for family, community, industry, and strong social and political institutions to advance economic ideas that ensure markets are serving people and their communities. Launched in May 2020, they have published and hosted discussions with thinkers from across the conservative and broader political spectrum. In September, they released a <a href="https://americancompass.org/essays/conservatives-should-ensure-workers-a-seat-at-the-table/">joint-statement calling for a renewed conservative labor movement</a> that elevates worker voices in economic and market discussions, which was signed by a number of prominent conservative figures, including Senator Marco Rubio and former attorney general Jeff Sessions.<br> <br>Our second focus is in strengthening the coalition of organizations working to disseminate these new economic ideas and incorporate them into strategic and policy discussions. <br> <br>Although the academic field of economics has developed <a href="http://www.oecd.org/governance/beyond-growth-33a25ba3-en.htm">an array of new branches of research</a> — from behavioral to ecological economics — that deepen our appreciation for the complexity of markets and their impact on society, this new thinking is not reflected in the ways that economics is taught in schools and universities, especially at the introductory level. We are therefore supporting the dissemination of <a href="https://www.core-econ.org/">CORE</a>, a new open-source economic curriculum developed with the collaboration of top economists, which incorporates recent advances in economic thinking. This curriculum is being adopted by schools and universities around the world.<br> <br>To help coordinate and align this growing global field of organizations that are developing and implementing new economic ideas, we are also supporting the <a href="https://www.econchange.org/">Economic Change Unit</a>, which both amplifies new ideas and works to strengthen the groups working around the world to transition us to a more equitable, sustainable, and democratic socio-economic paradigm.<br> <br>We have also turned to the media, given its power to shape how we all understand the economic forces impacting our lives, to help disseminate these ideas and reframe how we think about our economy. To that end, we have supported compelling reporting on the structural economic inequities that have been laid bare by the pandemic by journalists and photographers from new outlets such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/21362321/economy-american-policy-coronavirus-covid-recovery-fix-solutions-mobilization-great-rebuild">Vox</a>, and <a href="https://covid19-biggerpicture.trust.org/">Thomson Reuters</a>. <br> <br>Finally, we know that good ideas do not come from experts alone, and that real change is impossible without a broader cultural shift in how we, as a society, understand and discuss the economy.<br> <br>In addition to supporting a range of local and national organizations that are working to formulate and disseminate new ideas at the grassroots level, we are also working to cultivate the next generation of economic leaders and thinkers. Last year, we collaborated with The <a href="https://prospect.org/essaycontest">American Prospect </a>in a high school essay contest inviting students to read and reflect on one of four books highlighting the interlinking economic and racial justice challenges facing our country. We also partnered with <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/sponsored/story/tell-us-your-plan-to-reimagine-capitalism">Teen Vogue </a>to solicit ideas from young people about how they would redefine economic success in our society. Amongst hundreds of submissions, we heard ideas ranging from educating people to move money in support of racial justice to a worker-owned coffee shop on a mission to end wage theft and democratize the workplace.<br> <br>The ground below our feet is shifting, as it did all those decades ago. It is our mission to ensure that we have a solid foundation of values on which to build, and as many design ideas as possible at our disposal. With these, we can embark on the collective task of making American society as resilient and inclusive as possible.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-grounding-our-economy-in-a-new-ideas-and-values-99596c8dabe8">Reimagining Capitalism Series: Grounding Our Economy in a New Ideas and Values</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Tell us what you do and what it is about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I have been managing the World Bank’s (WBG) Identification for Development Initiative (ID4D) for the last 5 years alongside a sister initiative – G2Px – which we launched end of 2019.&nbsp; Through ID4D, we are helping countries realize the transformational potential of digital identity in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. G2Px focuses on supporting countries on digitizing payments from government to individuals, but in a more holistic way so that it can pave the way for broader outcomes of financial inclusion and women’s economic empowerment. It’s why we have the tagline of “payments that empower”.</p>
<p>These two WBG-wide initiatives are aimed squarely at helping governments and policy makers to reimagine and build the digital rails that underpin the way they transact with individuals. It also can transform the way people engage with their governments and with each other.&nbsp; A digital stack of ID, together with digital payments and trusted data exchange, has the ability to really empower individuals and change the way services are delivered – faster, more transparently and more conveniently.&nbsp; This past year, under the COVID pandemic, we have seen the need for all of this come to light with countries ramping up service delivery digitally, including social assistance to those most in need.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I joined the World Bank Group 20 years ago. &nbsp;I was passionate about international development and eager to contribute.&nbsp; The same passion sustains and energizes me to this day. When I joined, I didn’t imagine I would stay this long, but it’s hard to leave when the Bank provides the opportunity to work both in support of countries and on global public goods around on key development issues.</p>
<p>My earliest support system was generated at home. Growing up, my mother and father always encouraged my sisters and I and set the expectations to try our best and make a difference in any way we could.&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents came to the US in the mid ‘60s from Sri Lanka. At the time, it wasn’t always the norm for parents to push their daughters academically. &nbsp;But my parents certainly did (much to my annoyance at that same time) and that support helped me tremendously. And of course, now, that support system has expanded to include my husband who shares equally with the kids and at home.</p>
<p>The other thing that has helped me tremendously is my wonderful set of colleagues, team members and mentors – both within the Bank and in our wider group of external partners who have been with us since the beginning of these initiatives.&nbsp; We could not have achieved the multi-sector approach we have taken to digital public platforms without a really strong ecosystem of senior management support and hard-working teams who are passionate about this agenda across the Bank and externally.</p>
<blockquote>
 The COVID-19 crisis has shone a spotlight not just on ID, but Good ID, ID that is a gateway to inclusion and the development of digital societies. 
</blockquote>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>One of my favorite quotes is from anthropologist and women’s rights campaigner, Margaret Meade: “”Never doubt&nbsp;that a small group of thoughtful committed individuals can change the world. In fact, it’s the only thing that ever has.”</p>
<p>It’s been a guiding principle for me and I’ve adopted it in the advice I give to all our new team members. &nbsp;“Don’t wait until a system or an individual tells you to do something. Change comes from a group of individuals, not a “system”.</p>
<p>People often think reforms come from “policy” or “a system”. But what I have realized is that behind any policy or any system or organization are people – individuals and groups of human beings just like us!&nbsp;&nbsp; At work, we often will work with senior levels of governments and of course a high-level vision is key. But behind the vision you’ll always find a group of individuals who are shaping that vision and a group of individuals that need to work together to make the vision a reality.</p>
<p>So the advice I give to young professionals joining the Bank or newer team members is to know that you have the capability to be a shaper.&nbsp; An organization like the World Bank may appear to the outside as large and bureaucratic. But you can be quite entrepreneurial. You can shape the agenda – as long as you work hard to bring together different teams and different ideas as part of it. And don’t surprise anyone!</p>
<p>Collaboration is also part of what I do today. I know, for instance, that we couldn’t have agreed the updated Principles for Identification for Sustainable Development we have just published without a strong team of partners and collaborators working together on a shared vision.</p>
<p>It’s summed up in the words of an African proverb, printed on the walls of Gates Foundation HQ. “If you want to go fast, go alone.&nbsp; If you want to go far, go together.”</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>We have been working with governments to shift the identity agenda away from the way it has traditionally been viewed it.&nbsp; Identity is a core element for countries to transform service delivery to people, particularly in the digital age.&nbsp; The COVID-19 crisis has shone a spotlight not just on ID, but Good ID, ID that is a gateway to inclusion and the development of digital societies.</p>
<p>So, to CEOs I would say: “Build greater innovation on top of foundational ID systems, including new applications that will help people transact more seamlessly.&nbsp; There are increasingly ambitious countries all wanting to do digital ID the right way.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the combination of different ways of thinking, different cultures and ethnicities, gender that leads to whole being greater than the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>As a woman in identity, I am proud that about 80% of our team is female!&nbsp; Given the dearth of women in technology and identity space, I feel like we’re making a real contribution towards shaping the next generation of identity and digital development experts.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
Vyjayanti Desai
<p>Amanda Gorman’s poem at the inauguration of Joe Biden, “The Hill We Climb” Not only was it great to have a young woman captivate the entire world but it was hopeful and unifying, while also surfacing some of the very real issues that we face today.&nbsp; And her delivery of it was so inspiring.</p>
<p>I also have grown to really enjoy podcasts this past year. It was one of the things that kept me sane while taking my daily walks during the pandemic. Two podcasts: “It Was Said” and “Hope through History” by Jon Meacham are among my favorites.&nbsp; Each episode centers around a powerful, impactful public speech including Franklin D Roosevelt during the Great Depression, Hillary Clinton’s speech on ‘Women’s Rights are Human Rights’, Robert F Kennedy’s eulogy for Martin Luther King and Ronald Reagan’s farewell address.&nbsp; &nbsp;I’d love to see him expand this podcast and bring in speeches from across the globe.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>I have teenage twin boys, so I get plenty of practice giving unsolicited advice to teenagers!  But the advice I would give to the teenage me is: “Live in the moment; cherish everyone and everything around you because you never know when it may change.” My mother passed away from cancer when I was in high school and that definitely made me change my perspective. I try to ground myself by not worrying about the little things and try to live with a perspective of a glass half full.</p>
<p>And .. “be that change maker!”</p>

<p>Debates on whether or not E-ID Law is a good thing or a disappointment have been growing in intensity and have taken a decidedly political turn.<br>
Our Association is politically neutral and so we tried to stay away from these debates. We’ve been asked recently however about our opinion on the matter as independent experts that strive to bring and establish privacy friendly Self-Sovereign Identity technology to Swtizerland. We’ve decide not to pass that opportunity and shared our view points on the Law and DIDAS.</p>

 Thriving or Surviving? A Conversation on the Black Informal Economy with Equity and Transformation <p>By Nicole Allred, Strategic Communications, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Richard Wallace- Founder and Director of Equity and Transformation<p>For years, politicians have talked about the need to create economic opportunities that support and expand the middle class in America. On one extreme, the political dynamics and systems of power place the greatest attention on the well-heeled and the well off. However, at the other extreme are those everyday people struggling simply to survive day-to-day within the same system. In this economic system, individuals and families are either thriving or just surviving.</p><p>Richard Wallace, founder of Equity and Transformation [EAT] in Chicago, is an advocate for those working in the Black informal economy — people who are excluded from mainstream sanctioned opportunities to earn a livable wage, and instead, use creativity and community networks to make enough money to piece together a&nbsp;living.</p><p>As we continue our <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">blog series focused on racial justice</a>, we’re speaking with leaders in the field to highlight their perspectives and life journeys that led to their work. EAT [an Omidyar Network grantee] calls out the hypocrisy of our economic system by asking some direct questions: Who has economic privilege in our society, even at more disadvantaged levels, and why? How and why does the state determine which forms of work are sanctioned while others are illegal? In January, EAT issued the <a href="https://www.survivaleconomies.report/">Survival Economies Report</a> which examines each of these dynamics and more as part of the organization’s mission to support those in the informal&nbsp;economy.</p><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-team/nicole-allred/">Nicole Allred</a> conducted this interview with Richard Wallace. A transcript of our conversation is below, edited for length and&nbsp;clarity.</p> Nicole Allred: Richard I want to go back to the beginning to hear about your childhood, your mother’s transition into the ministry, and how that shaped your worldview from the&nbsp;start. <p>Richard Wallace: It was an interesting journey. I grew up in a single-parent household raised by my mother, who often worked two jobs most of her life. I remember when she came home one day and said she was quitting her job for the ministry. We were already poor, but in my mind, it was about to get worse! So, she left her job and began her work in the ministry starting in the church. She wanted to preach, but the male dominated system wouldn’t allow her, so she found solace preaching where no one else was, and that was behind prison walls. This is really where I get introduced to the practice of being accountable to the people you want to help and, in the inverse, who are helping you, and this is how I approach the work&nbsp;today.</p> NA: And you were about six or seven when your mom started the ministry, right? <p>RW: Yeah, she would take me behind the prison walls without a pause. I would go through the searches and be back there with most of the folks we consider “heavies.” They would tell me stories about what they would do in the ’90s in Chicago if they were&nbsp;free.</p><blockquote>“These were genuinely great humans behind bars, and I knew that when I left, they couldn’t&nbsp;leave.”</blockquote> NA: So, what happened next, and talk a bit about your own experience with the system and incarceration. <p>RW: My mom and my family planted seeds, but no matter how deep the seeds are planted, there are still things you have to go through and experience as a young&nbsp;person.</p><blockquote>“My mom moved us into a townhouse in the suburbs, and I was like an ink drop in a glass of&nbsp;milk.”</blockquote><p>I was the only Black person on my block. It was exciting to have a townhouse, but we were poor. Middle class integration has always been the goal for Black families, but the truth is there was a contradiction that exists there. Things that other kids did in our community I would get arrested for. So, what was really a maladjusted reaction to that lifestyle turned into a two and a half year bid at the [Illinois Youth Center] state&nbsp;prison.</p><p>So, I was going to visit these places when I was six and seven years old, and now I’m in this place in my teens. It was a rude awakening for me. It became one of the core experiences that transformed my life. My service to the people began there. Incarceration was horrible, but the lived experience after incarceration was much&nbsp;worse.</p> NA: How was your current work with Equity and Transformation and its mission born out of your experience being incarcerated? <p>RW: There are thousands of collateral consequences to being incarcerated when you come home. Your citizenship has thousands of doors that are no longer open to you. You don’t have access to employment nor college because of your background. What that meant for me is that I had to hustle to&nbsp;survive.</p><blockquote>“Unemployed people are barred from the system on which they depend for subsistence. If you don’t stay in the system, then they dare you to find a means of subsistence for yourself.”</blockquote><p>In my work organizing the temp labor sector around issues of discrimination and exploitation, many of the immigrant workers faced higher rates of exploitation because of their undocumented status. Employers were able to extract higher value labor out of immigrant workers than Black workers. Meanwhile, Black workers would sit for hours before being chosen to go to the jobsite because the immigrant workers were always chosen first. So, there was a lot of tension between Black and Latino workers because of this notion of “privilege.” That said, immigrant exploitive wages of $4-$5 per hour would never have been accepted by Black workers, and that is why these groups need to be in solidarity.</p><blockquote>“Our folks are literally out here working and dying to survive.“</blockquote><p>They are standing in a temp line and often being passed over. Ironically, I can work for a Fortune 500 company in prison making 89 cents a day, but I come home, and I can’t work for that same Fortune 500 company. It’s the same in the temp labor sector. I can’t work for this institution for full pay and a union, but they can garnish my wages and charge me for transportation to and from&nbsp;work.</p> NA: EAT is the only organization working to support the Black informal economy and recently published the <a href="https://www.survivaleconomies.report/">Survival Economies Report</a>. You reveal that policymakers are light years behind in the development of alternatives to formal employment. What do you mean by that? What are people doing to&nbsp;survive? <p>RW: When we started EAT, I definitely thought there was a range of things we could do including building informal workers associations built out by trade. The reality is our people are doing a multitude of activities. They’re hair braiding, scrap metal trade people, and street vending, which is a wide range of activities from selling DVDs to clothes. They’re ride sharing. There’s just a host of activities our people are engaged&nbsp;in.</p><blockquote>“One of the patterns we discovered is that occupations that exist in the informal sector aren’t fixed. They don’t stay there for perpetuity. They migrate from informal to formal, and in that process of migration there is a lack of retention of Black&nbsp;bodies.”</blockquote><p>Let me break that down. Bootlegging alcohol had a high rate of Black activity. People could enter it and leave it at their leisure. Then it is legalized, and it becomes hard to find a Black alcohol manufacturer. People point to celebrities like 50 Cent and P-Diddy, but they own the label. They put the label on the bottle. We’re talking about manufacturing the actual&nbsp;product.</p><p>When you think about ride sharing, you get Uber, but you don’t think about the people who are already doing ride sharing in our communities. It supported people who didn’t have the money to take a cab or to own their own care. So, it was really about shared resources. Then it becomes formalized and makes billions for the owner but very little for the drivers using their own cars. Once again, the pioneers are left out of ownership.</p><p>So, I believe there are innovations galore. This is a pattern when I say our folks are innovative.</p><blockquote>“When you really begin to see informality, you get some of the strongest expressions of Black culture.”</blockquote> NA: There is also a certain level of organization, planning, hustle, and work that goes into these informal activities. The report reveals what goes into someone selling loose cigarettes, for example. You have to be at a certain place at a certain time or you’re going to miss your main morning rush. Come rain or shine you still need to be there. Even buying those cigarettes at the cost that you need so that you can then sell them at the right markup. There is so much that the report broke down that I hadn’t even considered. We then start thinking about COVID and how these activities require people to be close by. How have these activities been impacted by&nbsp;COVID? <p>RW: In mid-March it dawned on us that COVID was here to stay. We immediately took a look at the CARES Act, and there are two provisions that boxed out informal workers from receiving any aid — the child support clause and paying taxes. If they hadn’t paid taxes in the past five years, they were ineligible, and if they owed child support, they were ineligible. So, nine out of 10 Black folks who were informal workers were ineligible when in fact these were the people who needed the resources the&nbsp;most.</p><blockquote>“There is a consistent bifurcation of resources so that these people are said to be deserving and other people are not. What does it mean to self-quarantine when you are homeless? What does it mean to tell someone to self-quarantine in a home that may be more violent than the streets&nbsp;are?”</blockquote><p>We developed COVID 19 life kits to educate people about COVID because we were battling the ghost of Tuskegee and also the digital divide. A lot of our folks don’t have IDs nor smart phones. So, while the average person is watching the news, where are homeless people getting the information that is alarming the rest of the world? So, we developed the kit to myth bust and also provide mutual&nbsp;aid.</p> NA: Thinking about philanthropy and systems of power, what role do you think philanthropy should&nbsp;play? <p>RW: We need philanthropy to get behind us and invest in our experimentations of alternatives. It’s one thing to dismantle the system but invest in us to rebuild. Rebuilding requires experimentation. It requires us sitting in a room with the community, freedom dreaming and then coming out and testing&nbsp;it.</p><p>My experience has evolved from direct action to electoral politics to policy to research and has come full circle. So, the investment around alternatives needs to be deepened. We don’t want to just dismantle. We also want to rebuild, and the resources need to be there so we can do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Learn more about Equity and Transformation via their <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/survival-economy-report">latest report</a>, <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/">website</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ChicagoEat">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/thriving-or-surviving-a-conversation-on-the-black-informal-economy-with-equity-and-transformation-f4225e52651b">Thriving or Surviving?

<p>DCMS Trust Framework - UK Govt.<br>
The UK government has published its draft rules of the road for governing the future use of digital identities.  The new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">trust framework</a> lays out the draft rules of the road organisations should follow. It includes the principles, policies, procedures and standards governing the use of digital identity to allow for the sharing of information to check people’s identities or personal details, such as a user’s address or age, in a trusted and consistent way. This will enable interoperability and increase public confidence.  The framework, once finalised, is expected to be brought into law.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport">DCMS</a> are seeking feedback on the trust framework until 11 March, through a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">survey</a> that is available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>The community effort to bridge DID methods with a new data model</p> <p>The world of digital identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) is evolving quickly, giving much cause for optimism. Standards are starting to connect and move towards functional interoperability, regulated by testable protocols. Most of this work is happening on the level of VCs. However, DIDs and their infrastructure are also starting to converge and mature as an extensible-yet-interoperable technology.</p><p>Adoption by markets, standards bodies and regulators is largely contingent upon provable security and provable interoperability, so these promising developments cannot come soon enough.</p><p>The Digital Identity Foundation (DIF) is very proud to be hosting one particular research and development project that could prove pivotal in this process. It is currently a work item of DIF’s <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>. However, a charter for an autonomous working group will be available for review at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">#IIW31</a> this week (20–22 October 2020) to facilitate broader participation. The project is called KERI and it is a project that could only be developed in the open, for the public good and for the widest, quickest adoption.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pucelano">Fernando Santander</a> But first, what is&nbsp;KERI? <p>KERI stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. A “key event” is a discrete event in time that involves public/private keypairs, often called blockchain identities or cryptographic identities. These events can be generalized as inceptions (creations), rotations, and signing events: the three kinds of events for which KERI generates and handles receipts. In other words, key events are cryptographic events in the history of an identifier.</p><p>Importantly, everything else a decentralized identifier says, does, or refers to is not a key event. As KERI is deliberately laser-focused on key events only, we can call these other events non-KERI events. The real world consequences of a signature or rotation are out of scope and method-specific to boot. KERI is only interested in the most universal aspect of interactions between keys and cryptographic systems, i.e. the cryptography that allows drastically different DID systems to trust each other’s security guarantees.</p><blockquote>“DID Methods exist to solve a trust issue. This does it in a different way.”<br>Charles Cunningham (Jolocom GmbH, Rust development lead for KERI)</blockquote><p>Each key event produces a receipt containing only checkable signatures of key event information. Nothing more. Receipts are threaded into logs tracking the history of each identifier, which is similar to a traceable audit trail of hashes — useful for confirming but not for deducing the underlying key material. These threads are compiled into logs that are shared and replicated according to a consensus algorithm and a logic of trust thresholds that creates a fabric of shared history between nodes.</p> Is KERI a blockchain or a DLT? No. Does it replace blockchains? Also&nbsp;no. <p>The trust fabric created when KERI nodes share and propagate key material records might</p><p>sound redundant to the blockchains where all of today’s DID methods store their key material chronologically. To a degree, this is true: each log containing the history of one key is a “microledger,” like a blockchain with only one participant. Inception and rotation events in all of today’s DID methods are stored in a chronological distributed ledger which can be crawled to create a log of these key events by DID. So, why the redundancy? Why replicate a subset of the blockchain’s capabilities and features in a distinct blockchain-like infrastructure just for key material?</p><p>The answer is simple and manifold: blockchains enable many features outside the scope of KERI. These features bring with them complexity, diversity, scale costs, and trust issues. Within KERI’s scope, however, only some of a blockchain or distributed ledger technology’s (DLT’s) features are necessary. Total ordering and double-spend protection, for instance, are hallmarks of distributed ledgers, but hardly justify the added complexity here.</p>Subset of blockchain/DLT capabilities required by KERI (<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/KERI2_Overview.web.pdf">Dr Sam Smith</a>, 2019)<p>Working backwards from a short list of security features, KERI infrastructure can be a much more performant, minimalist distributed ledger system. It is still in the family tree of blockchain, DLTs and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), but it is closer to a sidechain or a trans-blockchain interoperability mechanism. In use cases where all that is needed is a self-certifying, widely-portable identifier, KERI can stand alone as a lightweight DID method. In combination with a traditional DID Method, KERI can increase key management options and strengthen security guarantees by raising a red flag at the first discrepancy between the two parallel and redundant systems.</p><p>As a scaling mechanism, KERI can also take away some of the traffic and complexity from the underlying blockchain. In implementations where key management and state maintenance (record keeping about keys that rotate over time) are entrusted directly to the KERI mechanism, these functions can be operated much closer to the edge and replicate after a slight delay. This might be a totally acceptable trade-off of efficiency for latency in many use cases. For example, a roundtrip write-and-wait-for-finality transaction on a global blockchain makes no sense in a low-connectivity Internet of things (IoT) use case, where double-spend is a non-issue.</p> KERI is both an interoperability mechanism and a standardization incentive <p>More importantly for the DIF, however, is another major feature of KERI: it could become the foundation of massive interoperability and portability at the infrastructure layer. What’s more, if adopted by enough major players, it could even speed up the standardization process of DIDs themselves. By offering a minimum level of security guarantees shared across all participating methods, it would simplify the security review process for both individual DID methods and for interoperable DIDs as a whole.</p><p>By abstracting out the universal, minimal set of key functions, a KERI log that spans multiple ledgers or methods is just as verifiable as one that does not. This means that anywhere</p><p>self-certifying KERI identifiers are accepted, an identifier’s history can stretch back further than the existence of KERI. Plus, that history can include so-called “portability events”, where an identifier is deactivated on one ledger and re-activated on another. Method-specific features or records might still need to be exported and imported. The core proof of control function of a DID, however, would be universalized in a way that enabled massive portability.</p><p>This same universalizing effect of sharing a security vocabulary across all participating DID methods has the added benefit of being able to guarantee certain security features in any KERI-compliant system. Since KERI also lends itself to simple compliance tests, and since KERI logs give a benchmark against which to test method-specific and blockchain-specific security, this is a small leap for each DID method and a giant leap for standardization and security engineering.</p> KERI’s history: from whitepaper to community incubation <p>So far we have been highly technical in our explanation of the project. A careful reader, however, may already have caught the community commitment implicit in phrases such as “KERI-compliant” and “participating DID methods.” KERI is only useful if the major DID methods incorporate it, or if the set of participating DID methods becomes congruous over time with the set of major DID methods.</p><p>It is, in a nutshell, a community project of alignment as much as a technological innovation: an agreement on the security model for the common core functionality shared across all DID methods, allowing much variety and extensibility to be preserved by the participating DID methods. Decentralized identifiers have been very decentralized in their design and governance from the beginning, with a high degree of extensibility and flexibility within the fiefdom of each DID method and its governance. KERI has been gathering steam for over a year as a countervailing force, potentially making all DIDs function in an end-verifiable and thus universal way.</p><blockquote>“Investing in KERI is investing in interoperability, standardization, and cross-community security guarantees.”<br><br>Dr. Sam Smith, author of the KERI whitepaper and project lead</blockquote><p>In large part, the roots of KERI lie in debates within the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a>. For years it has been discussing the “shalls” and “mays” that define a W3C-compliant DID method (and thus a DID system). In practical terms, this process specifies what each DID method can and must assume about other DID methods for such a decentralized and open system to make appropriate security guarantees.</p><p>KERI’s creator and the author of its whitepaper is Samuel M Smith PhD., a pioneering technologist in multiple fields, including automated reasoning, distributed systems, autonomous vehicles and blockchain protocol design. Dr. Smith has been refining and experimenting with such a cross-method mechanism since 2019, presenting at every meeting of the biannual Internet Identity Workshop. First came some core principles and requirements of a key infrastructure at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/OffChain_%28PKI%29_Key_Management_%E2%80%93_Revocation_Rotation">IIW28</a>, then at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI:_1_Universal_DKMI_Root%28s%29_of_Trust_Decentralized_Systems_Primitires_%26_DKMI_Last_Mile_of_Trust">IIW29</a> a series of sessions about different aspects of a hypothetical system of witnesses that could replicate logs. For <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_%28C%29_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">IIW30</a>, Dr Smith brought more concrete sessions on finer points and even the roadmapping session that became the DIF working group. Along the way, he has iterated an ever-growing <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">whitepaper</a> describing and explaining all of this.</p><p>Now, however, Dr Smith has moved the project into the DIF under the auspices of its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a> where he sits as co-chair. Asked about the decision, Dr Smith said, “DIF was a natural choice because I wanted the work to happen quickly but in the open, with participation from the greatest number of companies and innovators across various communities.”</p> KERI’s contributors: join&nbsp;us! <p>Foremost among DIF contributors is, of course, Dr Smith, who brings to his KERI design work more than a decade of engineering experience with scale and high-performance systems. Much of this work, focusing largely on AI and streaming/scaling projects, was done through his Python-centric consulting company <a href="http://prosapien.com">Prosapien.com</a>. He has also worked with Consensys, contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/reputage/seedQuest">Seed Quest</a> project among others, soon to be donated to DIF.</p><p>Berlin-based <a href="https://jolocom.io/">Jolocom GmbH</a> has been a major interlocutor in the early development of KERI, since before the creation of the working group at DIF. Jolocom’s Charles Cunningham is the working group’s lead Rust developer, who has written a highly interesting post about mental models of <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/how-keri-tackles-the-problem-of-trust/">How KERI tackles the problem of trust</a> from a developer’s point of view for the Jolocom logbook.</p><p>Representing <a href="https://www.spherity.com">Spherity GmbH are the working group’s lead </a>JavaScript developer and note-taker. Spherity’s founder, Carsten Stöcker, has written a detailed piece for his company’s blog which called KERI “<a href="https://medium.com/spherity/introducing-keri-8f50ed1d8ed7">a more performant ledger for trusted identities</a>.”</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit, has been co-developing on the Rust side as well, working in parallel and providing input on the design considerations. The Human Colossus Foundation has also put substantial energy into promoting and socializing KERI in the Trust-over-IP Foundation, the MyData community and in the Sovrin community, including featuring an hour-long KERI <a href="https://vimeo.com/459348260">session</a> prominently in a half-day <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">mini-conference</a> it organized.</p><p>At IIW31, the KERI developers will be demonstrating their initial work to date while there is still the opportunity to get involved and determine the course of KERI as the project moves from direct mode (two-party) to witness mode (multi-party, distributed consensus). Many sessions are planned for IIW, ranging from introductions to technical discussions to use-case and requirements gathering for KERI-based ideas. Additionally there will be a live demo of the working direct-mode prototype.</p><p>Introductory reading and video materials are collected at the main DIF <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">repository</a>, but even if you don’t watch them in advance (or fully understand them if you do), there are many ways to get involved and make this community project stronger and more diverse.

<p>The Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has approved <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> as the latest of Hyperledger’s projects to graduate from incubation to active status.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Aries provides reusable, interoperable tool kits designed for initiatives and solutions focused on creating, transmitting and storing verifiable digital credentials. The Aries project grew out of the need for protocols, open source tools and interoperability test suites that leverage networks enabling verifiable credentials, such as those supported by <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy.</a></p>



<p>This major milestone shows that Hyperledger’s technical leadership recognizes the maturity of the Aries community and project. The TSC applies rigorous standards to active projects including code quality, security best practices, open source governance, and a diverse pool of contributors. Becoming an active Hyperledger project is a sign that Aries has grown in both community and code and is a big step forward for the decentralized digital identity community.</p>



<p>“This approval is further evidence that Hyperledger Aries is a breakout success for the Hyperledger community,” said Brian Behlendorf, General Manager for Blockchain, Healthcare and Identity at the Linux Foundation. “Convergence on common libraries for the exchange of credentials will help speed the development of urgently-needed solutions and systems, ranging from education to finance to the fight against the pandemic. Aries is key to that convergence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The TSC’s endorsement of Hyperledger Aries as out of incubation and into active project status is particularly important as the world grapples with finding trusted ways for people to prove their COVID-19 vaccination or test results. Aries’ maturity and protocol-driven approach to issuing verifiable credentials and presenting verified proofs has meant that Aries is a part of every technical discussion in that domain, and a core component of many of the technical stacks being deployed.<br><br>Key components of an Aries solution are:</p>



  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md">Agent</a> Frameworks: In the digital world, humans, organizations and things need a way to store, manage and exchange verifiable data, including the crypto that decentralized identity demands. Agents do this work in a decentralized environment, and Aries Frameworks make it easy for anyone to build agents tied to specific business needs.  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0005-didcomm/README.md">DID communications</a> (DIDComm): Agent-like things have to interact with one another to get work done. How they talk in general is DIDComm. DIDComm was born in the Aries project, and work on the next version continues within a working group at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/README.md">Protocols</a>: The Aries protocols run on top of DIDComm and enable peer-to-peer application-level interactions among&nbsp;agents, and shows how they should be designed and documented. The Aries community has developed an approach called <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/305">Aries Interop Profiles</a> (AIP) that formalizes specific sets of protocols that any agent-maker must use to be interoperable across the community, and a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">test harness</a> that verifies interoperability across disparate implementations using the protocols that make up an AIP.  



<p>A Wallet is a common term for a mobile agent used by a person. Wallets are the important link that enables people to manage their connections, credentials, and other aspects of involvement in the decentralized identity ecosystem. This important area of work has just recently received another boost with the community organization of work around creating an open source mobile agent using the Aries Framework Javascript and React Native.</p>



<p>Aries also has close community ties with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust Over IP (ToIP)</a> project, which is also housed at the Linux Foundation. Both projects are working on the issuing, holding, and presenting of cryptographically-verifiable digital credentials without the necessity of intermediaries. While Aries is focused on the tools required for verifiable credential exchange, the Trust over IP Foundation is a project working to define a complete architecture, or stack, that combines both cryptographic trust and human trust relating to decentralized identity.</p>



<p>The TSC commended the Aries project during the meeting for the project’s highly diverse contributors. Achieving a high number of organizations contributing to a project at Hyperledger is often a challenge. Congratulations are due to those participating in and supporting the Aries Project.</p>

<p></p>
<p>New Zealand Women in Identity members Tamara Al’ Salim and Andrew Weaver were featured on a panel discussing Contact Tracing and Data Ownership. They spoke to the members of the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS), a nonprofit based in Washington, DC, whose members are vital records professionals across the U.S. as well as other countries. Tamara and Andrew discussed their view of New Zealand’s response to the pandemic and the impact it had on the community’s behavior when it came to contact tracing.</p>
<p>Andrew described how New Zealand took a pragmatic and expert led approach to the pandemic, driven by medical recommendations and based on statistics and scientific data modeling, wrapped up with the message of kindness. With the continuing change in the pandemic’s landscape, and quoting Maya Angelou, New Zealand took the approach of “Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tamara walked the audience through graphs that told a story about the New Zealand COVID-19 Tracer App including how its early inception didn’t have much uptake as New Zealand left lockdown with no community cases. The perception was , no community cases meant no need to keep track of our movements. As travel increased into the country, cases at the border increased as well, still yet, people didn’t feel the pressure to keep track of their movements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara went on to describe how the trend shifted dramatically when a community case linked to a ship at the ports got into the community, with a household of four people testing positive, the whole country had restriction levels changes, and the city the cases were in went into even high restrictions. This saw a significant uptake and a consistent trend of use of the app since then. New Zealand continues to report daily to its community on the number of border and community cases with none in the community since November 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara observed that complacency is natural and will continue to happen as people feel safe and not have the need to keep track of their movements. If there is any trend that is guaranteed, it would be the one when cases are discovered in the community people become more vigilant and keep track of their movements. That is possible the new normal in New Zealand. In the meantime, the message, is that is a collective responsibility, we all want to safe and be able to celebrate holidays safely, act like you have the virus, wear your mask on public transport and stay home if you are unwell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara is one of the Ambassadors for New Zealand and Andrew as an active member and supporter of Women in Identity encouraged the NAPHSIS members and especially many of the men to join the organization and support our work.</p>
<p>In addition, Kay Chopard spoke in the closing plenary about the Women in Identity organization and encouraged the NAPHSIS membership to become part of the organization and the mission. The conference took place virtually on November 30 to December 2, 2020.</p>
