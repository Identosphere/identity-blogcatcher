  American multinational financial services giant Visa believes that the investors still want to spend their holdings and as a result has partnered with popular crypto exchange FTX.  The goal of the partnership is to offer debit cards across 40 nations, with the primary focus on Latin America, Europe, and Asia.  The cards, which are already available to the United States residents, will instantly connect to a user’s FTX cryptocurrency investment account.  



 



<p>Despite the ongoing crypto market which has resulted in a massive drop in cryptocurrency prices leading to “Buy the Dip” campaign, American multinational financial services giant Visa believes that the investors still want to spend their holdings.</p>



<p>According to the latest development, the company has partnered with the global exchange platform FTX to offer debit cards across 40 nations, with the primary focus on Latin America, Europe, and Asia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cards, which are already available to the United States residents, will instantly connect to a user’s FTX cryptocurrency investment account. Notably, the change enables customers to spend digital currencies without transferring them off from an exchange.</p>



<p>During an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/07/visa-partners-with-ftx-in-a-bet-that-shoppers-still-want-to-spend-cryptocurrencies-in-a-bear-market.html">interview</a> with CNBC, Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu noted the plummeting values of cryptocurrencies. However, he believes that there is still steady interest in crypto and stated:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“We don’t have a position as a company on what the value of cryptocurrency should be, or whether it’s a good thing in the long run — as long as people have things they want to buy, we want to facilitate it.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The new partnership between FTX and Visa comes at a time when the price of Bitcoin and other digital tokens have gone down by more than half from their all-time highs in November. The largest cryptocurrency, which was trading at around $69,000 last year, is currently sitting near the $20,000 zone, <a href="https://bitcoinwisdom.io/markets/bitfinex/btcusd">according</a> to BitcoinWisdom. </p>



<p>Commenting on the new collaboration, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried stated:</p>



<blockquote><p>“There’s a decision you have to make as a traditional payments company: do you want to lean into this or do you want to fight against it? I respect the fact that many of them are leaning into it.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Enabling card payments, according to SBF, is essential for the market to develop beyond its image as a speculative asset or, to some, a store of value. Because of the Visa collaboration, companies can now take cryptocurrency without developing their own proprietary technology. It is converted on the back end by Visa and FTX. “Everything is done behind the scenes,” Prabhu said.</p>



<p>The biggest opportunity, according to both Chief executives, is in emerging nations, where access to digital assets is more alluring than it could be in the United States because of inflation and currency volatility.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we started a new <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/">project to examine and strengthen our digital resilience</a>. Through this work we hope to further integrate social justice principles into our tech choices and practices and deepen our capacity to support our partners&nbsp;</p>



<p>After conducting a deeper needs assessment within the team, the first set of changes we made focused on our video conferencing infrastructure. In this blog post, we’re sharing some reflections about the new tools our team is testing out and how our experience has been so far.</p>



<p>We are using the term “digital resilience” to refer to a set of practices that support the ability of an organisation to protect itself from — and respond to — digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its members/individuals, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to the ever-changing needs and contexts of the organisation and its members. </p>



 Deciding which video conferencing tools fit our needs and values 



<p>At The Engine Room, we aim for a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/technology-in-the-service-of-justice/">justice-based approach to our technical choices</a>. This means we prioritise choosing technology solutions that intentionally weave anti-oppression strategies into all stages of their creation, maintenance and uptake. As a remote organisation, video conferencing is integral to our day-to-day operations. After conducting a deeper needs assessment within the team, it became clear that adopting tools that are privacy-respecting and strengthen our organisational security was a priority for us. For this reason, we decided to set up our own instances of <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/">BigBlueButton</a> (BBB) and <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">Jitsi Meet</a>. Both tools are encrypted, open source, and incorporate privacy by design.&nbsp;</p>



BigBlueButton (BBB)Jitsi MeetBigBlueButton is an open source online learning and video conferencing platform.All traffic from the users’ web browsers to the server goes over standard security protocols when audio, video or screens are being shared.<br><br>BBB is<a href="https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/#designed-for-online-learning"> designed specifically for educational applications</a>, with features like whiteboards, break-out rooms, and polling. It also <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/integrations/">integrates</a> with various learning management systems (e.g. Canvas, Moodle). Everything happens in users’ web browsers, so there’s no need for any additional software.BigBlueButton users don’t need to create an account to join a call: all they need is the meeting link, which can be opened with a browser. Access to <a href="https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/greenlight/gl-overview.html#manage-access">meetings can be limited through a code</a> and joining the room can be dependent on moderator approval.<br><br>To use <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/teachers/features/">all the functionalities of the tool</a> it is necessary to have a server to install it on. BBB’s website offers the possibility of <a href="https://demo.bigbluebutton.org/gl/signup">creating an account to access a “demo” version of the tool.</a> Using this version you can make calls of up to 60 minutes.Jitsi Meet (also referred to as meet.jit.si) is a free and open source video conference service maintained by parent company <a href="https://www.8x8.com/">8×8</a>. By default, Jitsi Meet provides transport-layer encryption between the browser and the Jitsi Meet server of your choice; an end-to-end encryption feature is also available.<br><br>Jitsi Meet users don’t need to create an account to join a call: all they need is the meeting link, which can be opened with a browser or through Jitsi’s mobile app.<br><br>Meetings can also be password-protected.<br><br>Jitsi Meet offers the option of self-hosting and there is a <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">public version</a> of the tool for free use.



<p></p>



<p>Some of the factors that we took into account while selecting video conferencing tools are included in the list below (which takes inspiration from many resources, such as this “<a href="https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/resource-publication/guide-secure-group-chat-and-conferencing-tools">Guide to Secure Group Chat and Conferencing Tools</a>”):&nbsp;</p>



  Maturity and maintenance: We took into account how mature the platforms are, including the amount of time they’ve been running for and whether or not they are still being actively developed. We also considered the existence of active communities of developers and users for both tools.  Privacy: A variety of factors went into consideration: whether or not user data is shared or sold to third parties, if the tools provide encryption (and what type of encryption: end-to-end or to-server), if it’s possible to self-host, what data is stored on platforms’ servers and what data platforms’ owners have access to, if users need to install a dedicated app or software and what data this app or software would have access to.  Reputation: We prioritised tools that are used and respected by social justice organisations and peers we work with, as well as recommended by security experts.&nbsp;  Ownership: We considered whether tools were open source and if the companies provided the source code openly, as well as the history of development and ownership of the platform and potential security challenges (including how owners and developers reacted to those challenges).  Features and affordances: We mapped the platforms according to how well their features would respond to our needs: easiness to connect to these platforms, usage of tools for internal and external calls and more.&nbsp;  Associated costs: We also considered the costs related to each of the tools, including potential subscription fees, learning and implementing, possible IT support needed and hosting costs  



 A brief overview of our experience so far 



  
<p>Hosting and infrastructure details<br>– For BigBlueButton, we hired <a href="https://maadix.net/">Maadix</a>‘s hosting service, who are maintaining both the tool and the servers where it’s hosted. We use a <a href="https://maadix.net/en/big-blue-button-privacy-security-optimizations">version customised by Maadix with performance and privacy improvements.</a><br>– For Jitsi Meet, we are using the <a href="https://open.greenhost.net/greenhost/cloud-init/-/tree/main/jitsimeet">pre-installed stable version</a> that <a href="https://greenhost.net/">Greenhost</a> – with whom we have been already working – offers to their clients.</p>
  



<p>After implementation, we asked our team to use BigBlueButton and Jitsi Meet as much as possible. After two months of piloting the tools, we conducted an internal survey and received mostly positive feedback—overall the team appreciated using tools that are aligned with our organisational values. We also identified areas for improvement, which we will work on over the next few months, including user friendliness and video instability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to note that while we try to default to using our own internal platforms, there are occasions where we have a need for features that these platforms do not yet have. For example, we often use webinar registration pages and waiting rooms to ensure that our community calls are safe for participants; however, BigBlueButton and Jitsi Meet do not currently possess these features. Additionally, although both platforms aim to be low resource, they often struggle in low bandwidth situations. Lastly, there’s the learning curve of the team for adapting new tools. We often crave for the familiar when it’s not immediately clear how to perform a certain task. We recognize that adapting to the workflow of these tools will take time as is the case with most technological changes.</p>



<p>Here is a summary of some of the benefits and challenges of installing and maintaining these tools on our own servers.&nbsp;</p>



AdvantagesChallengesAuthonomy: More control over the tools we use, since we are responsible for the installation and can check all code that runs in the application.<br><br>Values: Tools that are aligned with our values and principles.<br><br>Transparency: Transparency of the open software code—we can inspect every line of code used to build the tools.<br><br>Security:&nbsp; With open source tools, more people are inspecting the code, which enables more issues to be found – and fixed. Vulnerabilities are fixed much faster and updates are more frequent.&nbsp;<br><br>Cost: Open-source software is very often free or cheaper than proprietary software. Therefore, we save on licensing and maintenance fees.&nbsp;<br><br>Open source ecosystem: We are contributing to a community of developers committed to making the internet a fairer place.<br><br>Customisation and Flexibility: Using services customised for our use and having exclusive domains.Resources: Self-hosted tools require more maintenance time and investment in servers.<br><br>Tech expertise: Self-hosted tools require knowledge and availability (internal or external) to troubleshoot issues the team or our partners experience.<br><br>Documentation: Using tools that are less widespread or familiar demands an effort to produce technical and user-facing documentation. For example, we developed internal user guides for both platforms containing FAQs, and we also created an external guide that explains our decisions behind specific platform use in community calls.<br><br>Adapting to new tools: Functionality is not always the same between tools and even when it is, the user experience may differ. Adopting new tools can take time (as we wrote in <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/adopting-new-tech-how-to-give-your-team-the-best-chances-of-success/">this blog post</a>) and can impact the day-to-day work of the organisation.<br><br>Stability and availability: Ensuring that self-hosted tools are stable and have high availability (or the ability of a system to operate continuously without failing) is a challenge. Constant monitoring,&nbsp; maintenance, and server redundancy (storing information in more than one server) are steps required to make sure information can be restored in case of problems.



<p>This overview represents a snapshot of where we currently are in our journey with these tools: these observations will likely evolve and change over time, as we work on this project and mature our own digital resilience practices.</p>



 Next steps 



<p>During this process, we were reminded of how adopting free and open-source software tools (and self-hosting them!) is a process that takes quite some time and planning, but that ultimately contributes greatly to our digital resilience. Over the next months, we will continue to work on our video conferencing tools, including improving on the tools’ overall performance and stability, refining user documentation and addressing connectivity issues.</p>



<p>If your organisation is interested in going through a similar process, we’d be happy to support you (even if your end result is different!). <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Schedule a call with us</a>!</p>

  With a population of approximately 38 million, Vingoe implies that over 11.4 million Canadians intend to purchase crypto assets next year.  



  Vingoe noted that the regulatory body is keen to oversee the crypto market without picking winners or losers.  



  The OSC views the failure of QuadrigaCX in 2019 as an old-fashioned Ponzi scheme wrapped in the jargon of innovation.&nbsp;  
 



<p>Speaking at the Economic Club of Canada, Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) Chief Executive Officer Grant Vingoe highlighted the regulations needed. Crypto market to ensure future prosperity. Vingoe noted that the view that crypto assets need different treatment from other financial instruments is ‘completely misguided’. The OSC CEO noted that their previous research indicates that over 30 per cent of Canadians plan to purchase digital assets as a speculative instrument in the coming years.</p>



<p>With a population of approximately 38 million, Vingoe implies that over 11.4 million Canadians intend to purchase crypto assets next year.</p>



<p>As such, Vingoe noted that the regulatory body is keen to oversee the crypto market without picking winners or losers.</p>



 
<blockquote><p>“We are not here to pick winners and losers…We take a careful and technology neutral approach to all new products that come into our market” – OSC CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/GrantVingoe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GrantVingoe</a> on the approach to bringing the crypto industry into the OSC's regulatory regime <a href="https://t.co/eSlAH0QomR">pic.twitter.com/eSlAH0QomR</a></p>— OSC News (@OSC_News) <a href="https://twitter.com/OSC_News/status/1578061526472196100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>Nonetheless, the Canadian government has arguably shown great interest in <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/bitcoin-price-prediction/">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/ethereum-price-prediction/">Ethererum</a> digital assets. While most digital assets are regulated in a grey area, the OSC has classified Bitcoin and Ethererum as commodities.</p>



 Canada and the Crypto Market&nbsp; 



<p>The OSC Chairman noted that most of the crypto market significantly lies within its jurisdictions. Furthermore, Vingoe noted that Canadian investors had placed massive responsibility on them to secure their investment funds.</p>



<blockquote><p>“The OSC’s activities are governed by our multi-pronged mandate, which requires us to act when something falls within our jurisdiction – and the vast majority of crypto-based entities clearly do. Bitcoin and Ether, for example, are generally considered commodities, given their scale and lack of centralised management,” Vingoe <a href="https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2022-10/20221006_grant-vingoe-keynote.pdf">said</a> during the summit on Thursday.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Canadian regulators fear a repeat of 2019 when over $100 million was wiped out through the QuadrigaCX scandal. Notably, the OSC views the failure of QuadrigaCX in 2019 as an old-fashioned Ponzi scheme wrapped in the jargon of innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The country has made tremendous progress in regulating the fast-growing cryptocurrency market. Back in early 2019, the CSA and IIROC proposed a regulatory framework for crypto asset trading platforms and engaged closely with the industry on what that should look like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By August 2020, the country’s regulators had approved the first platform to offer services in Ontario. In March last year, the CSA published guidance to improve the quality of disclosures provided by crypto asset reporting issuers.</p>



<p>Canada has one of the world’s leading economies and is, therefore, key to future technology adoption. Furthermore, the country has both institutional and retail investors ready to put funds in disruptive technology markets. As such, Vingoe noted that investors need to be assured of safety while trading in speculative assets.</p>



<blockquote><p>“It is important that efforts to protect the public interest are not dragged into non-regulatory debates, the likes of which we are seeing more often in relation to crypto assets, ESG, and other areas. We must always be grounded in our mandates and urge others to evaluate our work in that light,” Vingoe said.</p></blockquote>

  Do Kwon recently dismissed claims that his wealth was frozen by Korean authorities.  Terraform labs believe the Do Kwon situation has been politicized and accused prosecutors of giving in to public pressure.  



 



<p>The South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs has <a href="https://www.passport.go.kr/new/board/notice.php?idx=7753&amp;sel=1">released </a>an order for embattled Terra CEO, Do Kwon to return his passport to authorities within 14 days of the order. Failure to surrender his passport would lead to an eventual cancellation and a future refusal to reissue.</p>



<p>The Terra boss has become a person of concern following allegations of his involvement in Terra’s collapse in May. Local sources reported that the surrender notice was issued to Kwon alongside other Terraforms employees.</p>



<p>Law enforcement agents in South Korea have stepped up efforts to bring Do Kwon to book. An arrest order was issued for the 31-year-old on September 14, and Interpol issued a red notice on September 26. However, his exact location is unknown, but he was last reported to have taken refuge in Singapore.</p>



<p>At the height of his fame, Kwon was known as the brain behind the Terra ecosystem, which became one of the biggest stablecoins in the crypto market. However, his fortune soon faded after Terra collapsed, wiping off more than $40 billion in investors’ funds. Terra’s struggles also affected other platforms like Three Arrows Capital and Vauld.</p>



<p>Last month, local media <a href="https://bitnation.co/south-korean-government-reportedly-freezes-do-kwons-related-digital-assets/">claimed </a>that Korean officials had demanded to have $67 million worth of Bitcoin purportedly linked to the disgraced Terra boss&nbsp;frozen. This development gave the Do Kwon drama a new twist. Kwon, however,&nbsp;publicly denied ownership of the money and accused the government of deliberately making false accusations. </p>



<p>Individuals linked to Kwon believe&nbsp;the situation has been politicized as LUNA was not legally a security to be covered by the country’s capital markets law.&nbsp;Terraform labs said, </p>



<blockquote><p>We believe that this case has become highly politicized, and that the actions of the Korean prosecutors demonstrate unfairness and a failure to uphold basic rights guaranteed under Korean law.</p></blockquote>



<p>In another Terra-related news, a South Korean judge has dismissed the request for a warrant for Yoo Mo, the head of the business team of Terraform Labs. Judge Hong Jin-Pyo of the Seoul Southern District Court  dismissed the warrant less than 48 hours after it was issued, noting that there was no significance in arresting Yoo.</p>



<p>According to reports, the judge took into account Yoo’s South Korean residence, family ties, and existing travel restrictions while making his decision. He also questioned if the LUNA token met the requirements of the Korea Capital Market Act to be considered an&nbsp;“investment contract security.”</p>

  Nexo is not insolvent, claim the co-founders of the firm, adding that the platform has no ties or exposure to bankrupt crypto hedge fund 3AC or the Terra ecosystem (now Terra Classic).  Co-founders of Nexo, Antoni Trenchev and Kalin Metodiev, confirmed that the firm has plans of expansion and is not insolvent, adding that “we work very hard.”  Eight US state regulators recently issued cease and desist orders against Nexo for exposing its consumers to its unregistered crypto interest account program.  



 



<p>Popular crypto lending platform Nexo is not insolvent, claim the co-founders of the firm, adding that the platform has no ties or exposure to bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) or the Terra Classic (LUNC) project, which was responsible for the largest wipeout in the crypto space, draining $40 billion of investors’ money. </p>



<p>Crypto lending platforms that are operating in the US are currently facing bankruptcy proceedings in the courts. Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, and Vauld, three platforms that are currently in trouble over lack of funds and owe millions to their creditors, have all filed for protection under Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Voyager has already <a href="https://bitnation.co/ftx-acquires-voyager-digitals-assets-after-auction/">auctioned off its assets to crypto exchange FTX</a>. </p>



<p>Voyager stated that it had “received multiple bids contemplating sale and reorganization alternatives, held an auction and, based on the results of the auction, has determined that the sale transaction with FTX is the best alternative for Voyager stakeholders.”</p>



<p>Nexo has around $4 billion in assets under management (AUM) and the crypto community is targeting the crypto lending platform as rumors of bankruptcy are floating in the air. </p>



<p>In a YouTube Q&amp;A on Tuesday, the co-founders of Nexo, Antoni Trenchev and Kalin Metodiev, denied the rumors of insolvency and confirmed that the firm had no exposure to Terra or 3AC. Trenchev and Metodiev&nbsp;were asked by an anonymous user if Nexo is on the route to become the next Celsius Network or Voyager Digital.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Insolvency and bankruptcy are nowhere in Nexo’s reality…We work very hard … we deliver a very strong and sustainable future for our users for many years to come, enriched with a number of additional services and products through integration of technology and disruption of existing services,”</p>Metodiev said.</blockquote>



<p>The executives further added that they have plans to expand their services and will debut into crypto trading and traditional capital markets with wealth and asset management solutions in the near future, thereby increasing its consumer base. </p>



<p>In the light of similar events, Nexo has been facing heavy scrunity from eight US regulators after the firm was issued cease and desist orders from the watchdogs for its unregistered crypto interest account program. The 8 US states include California, <a href="https://dfr.vermont.gov/reg-bul-ord/nexo-inc-ex-parte-order-cease-and-desist">Vermont</a>, <a href="https://dfi.wa.gov/news/press/nexo">Washington</a>, &nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities.ok.gov/Enforcement/Orders/PDF/Cease&amp;Desist-NoticeOppForHrng_22-032.pdf">Maryland</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities.ok.gov/Enforcement/Orders/PDF/Cease&amp;Desist-NoticeOppForHrng_22-032.pdf">Oklahoma</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scag.gov/about-the-office/news/attorney-general-alan-wilson-brings-action-against-another-crypto-interest-account-provider/">South Carolina</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://kfi.ky.gov/Documents/SECU%202022-AH-0020%20Nexo%20Inc_.pdf">Kentucky</a>. </p>



<p>The Commissioner of California’s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) Clothilde Hewlett stated that “these crypto interest accounts are securities and are subject to investor protections under the law, including adequate disclosure of the risk involved.” </p>



<p>Similar orders were issued by other state regulators and it seems that the US market might be out of league for the crypto lending platform now. The interest bearing accounts that the regulators call unregistered securities provide investors high rates of interests to their customers.</p>

<p>Background:</p>



<p>From the beginning we have asked that you consider electing a diverse group of members who reflect the diversity of the community we seek to support. We ask that you do so again this year.  The power of that diversity continues to shine through in the new working groups this year, especially as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti, equity and inclusion in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.</p>



<p>The Council has identified a number of areas where diversity, as well as expertise in the digital identity space, might help us better serve the community. Nominations from those organisations involved in kaupapa Māori, civil liberties and business and service sectors are especially encouraged. We also encourage suggestions from young people within your organisations, as the viewpoint of young people is extremely essential and relevant to the work we perform. As an NZTech Association, Digital Identity NZ adopts its Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy which you can read <a href="https://nztech.org.nz/about/board-diversity-inclusion-policy/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Once elected in December, one of the first responsibilities of the new Council will be to elect a new chair for the EC Council or consider re-electing the current chair. The current chair is Paul Platen (SSS – Security Specialists), supported by deputy chair (and past-chair) Ben Tairea (Āhau). Both are excellent kaiārahi (guides/counsellors/leaders) currently and serving their terms on the Executive Council through to the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2023 is set to be another pivotal year for digital identity with the delayed introduction of the Digital Identity Bill and further development of the ecosystem. We look forward to stellar nominations to identify, explore and pursue the best opportunities for Digital Identity NZ to make a positive difference for people in 2023 and beyond.</p>

  In his defence, Kwon has claimed that the Terra Luna and UST collapse case has been heavily politicised.  The South Korean government is keen to formulate and administrate cryptocurrency and blockchain policies to avoid predatory economic situations.  Do Kwon reportedly sent over 3k units of Bitcoin to crypto exchanges during the time of an arrest warrant by the South Korean government.  
 



<p>The South Korean government has reiterated that Do Kwon wronged its people through the Terra Luna and UST crypto project, which collapsed earlier this year. According to a South Korean media outlet, News1, the country’s prosecutors have frozen 56.2 billion won, approximately $39.4 million, in virtual assets owned by Kwon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, Kwon is on Interpol’s watch list after the South Korean government initiated a global arrest warrant with Interpol.</p>



<p>The South Korean media outlet announced that Kwon had lost access to almost 95 billion Won digital assets. However, Kwon has once again publicly denied the allegations of frozen cash.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Once again, I don’t even use Kucoin and OkEx, have no time to trade, and no funds have been frozen.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>I don’t know whose funds they’ve frozen, but good for them, hope they use it for good,” Kwon responded to the allegations via Twitter.</p></blockquote>



<p>In his defence, Kwon has claimed that the Terra Luna and UST collapse case has been heavily politicised.</p>



 
<blockquote><p>Hope they don't use it on attempting to prosecute the opposition candidate for the presidential election, or to put half the country's living former presidents in jail. <br><br>Oh wait, too late: <a href="https://t.co/fenlFj5sRl">https://t.co/fenlFj5sRl</a></p>— Do Kwon  (@stablekwon) <a href="https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1577644770859491328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



 South Korean Government Leads the Way in Cryptocurrency Regulations&nbsp; 



<p>The cryptocurrency market has been embraced by global investors who seek hefty returns on investment (ROI). The South Korean government is keen to formulate and administrate cryptocurrency and blockchain policies to avoid predatory economic situations.</p>



<p>The Terra Luna and UST collapse has angered multiple heads of government worldwide. Furthermore, Terra Luna and UST investors lost over $40 billion earlier this year following the sudden network collapse.</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, the White House detailed a crypto regulatory framework to reduce scams. Moreover, billions of dollars have been either laundered or stolen through the immutability of blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A recent research paper from Stanford university extensively talked about the possibility and effects of enabling <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/ethereum-price-prediction/">Ethererum</a> transaction reversal. Per the research by the Stanford report, having the possibility of Ethererum reversal could reduce cases of scams and kill sophisticated hacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mind you; stolen cash could easily be reversed by the good actors in the crypto community. Nonetheless, having reversal capabilities in the Ethererum network has significantly divided the community. Remember, the crypto market has partially gained global recognition due to its immutability.</p>



<p>The new proposal for Ethereum transaction reversals provides the ability for Ethereum token holders with another digital asset to contest malicious attacks and regain their funds is a huge step toward achieving blockchain efficiency.</p>



<p>However, the proposal may end up dividing the cryptocurrency industry into a possible hard fork like in the past with ETC.</p>



<p><a href="https://m.news1.kr/articles/?4823515">Do Kwon</a> reportedly sent over 3k units of Bitcoin to crypto exchanges during the time of an arrest warrant by the South Korean. Think of it from this perspective, could the <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/bitcoin-price-prediction/">Bitcoin</a> network be supporting reversal transactions, then people could reverse their transactions while the Terra Luna network collapsed.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the total cryptocurrency market cap has stabilized around $1 trillion, following the ongoing bear outlook.</p>

 Firm Foundations 

<p>Much of our work in Q3 has been forward-thinking, focused on creating the next generation of specifications for blockchain interoperability.</p>

<p>Hello to the Identity Community. Being able to create the next generation of specifications depends on having a wide-spanning community, and we’ve been thrilled to see the Blockchain Commons community continue to grow. That includes not just cryptocurrency nowadays, but also digital identity thanks to sustaining sponsor Proxy. We also reached out to more digital-identity companies at this year’s Rebooting the Web of Trust event, and hope to see that pay out in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVzTRsqcyMU"></a></p>

<p>Gordian Envelope. Our specification work is intended to build firm foundations. Our newest foundational work of this sort has been on Gordian Envelope, a new sort of “Smart Container” that can be used to hold secrets and metadata of an arbitrary size and that can be opened by a variety of “permits”, including SSKR shares and public-key cryptography keypairs. Extensive <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/tree/master/Docs">docs</a> are now available as part of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents">BCSwiftSecureCompanents package</a>. Also see our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVzTRsqcyMU">Gordian Envelope videos</a> on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPQ9LtDWZAkfItMF4B5tztw">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>MVA Algorithm Suite. The appendix of the Gordian Envelope docs contains our first <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/blob/master/Docs/09-A-ALGORITHMS.md">MVA ALgorithm Suite</a>. This refers to the algorithmic suite we’ve decided to use in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0deyIHXukk&amp;t=7s">Minimal Viable Architecture</a>: effectively a future-proofed Minimal Viable Product. It overviews current cryptographic algorithms and discusses our decisions about which to use. Gordian Envelope uses BLAKE3, IETF ChaChaPoly, the secp256k1 curve, and more. Our Appendix talks about why we think they’re the best practices for this project.</p>

<p>Collaborative Seed Recovery. This new foundational work is largely in service to Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR): we intend it to add independence, resilience, and openness to seed storage by allowing digital-asset holders to shard their seed and then store it with a variety of different steward services, making recovery painless and resilient. We are currently working with a companies such as Bitmark, Foundation, and Proxy in regular biweekly meetings to make CSR a reality this fall. For more, please see our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md">CSR Overview</a>. Our Gordian Envelope videos also lay out the whole foundation, so take a look at the combined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aciTNh402Co&amp;list=PLCkrqxOY1Fbp-P1Yv-7gmu75i2QS2Z6vk">CSR playlist</a>.</p>

<p>CSR Use Cases. Why is CSR needed? We’ve written several sequences of <a href="https://hackmd.io/ZbRiwvUfQSy-1RKM15bM8Q#CSR-Focused-Use-Cases">progressive use cases</a> in a preliminary document that discusses options both for CSR and its 2023 successor, Collaborative Key Management (CKM). It covers everything from simple protection of keys to future possibilities where no one actually holds a complete seed, despite its keys being in active use.</p>

 Community Events 

<p>Preventing vendor lock-in via interoperability has been a Blockchain Commons goal from the beginning, but that requires bringing together multiple parties to buy into interoperable specifications. The growth of Blockchain Commons’ community of developers, sponsors, and other interested parties in 2022 has truly made that possible, with those parties coming together in community events such as the biweekly CSR meetings and others.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/"></a></p>

<p>Silicon Salon 2. Our other ongoing get-together this year has been the <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salon</a>, where we’ve facilitated wallet makers and semiconductor makers talking about the creation of the next generation of silicon design that is specialized for cryptography. Our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/">second Silicon Salon</a> was held on September 14th. Presenters included Bunnie Studios, Cramium Labs, Proxy Labs, Foundation, and the VLS team.</p>

<p>RWOT11. Blockchain Commons got its start with <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, where Christopher Allen first brought community members together to support the future of decentralized and self-sovereign technologies. Unfortunately, Rebooting the Web of Trust went on hiatus shortly after the foundation of Blockchain Commons, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it was back <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague">this September</a>.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons submitted two papers for RWOT11, to bring some of our topics into the conversation in the Netherlands: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/collaborative-seed-recovery-csr.md">an introduction to CSR</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/elision-redaction-correlation-smart-documents.md">Elision, Redaction, and Non-Correlation in Smart Documents</a>. The elision topic paper led to a discussion of <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/selective-correlation.md">Selection Disclosure</a> that we’re looking forward to finishing in the coming months. We also participated in an article on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/identity-threats.md">Identity Threats</a>, which returns to some of our early identity work in the field!</p>

<p>Congrats to DIDs. We can’t talk about RWOT without congratulating everyone who worked on turning <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/specifications/DIDs-Ratified/">DIDs into a standard</a>. This has been a long-running goal for both RWOT and Blockchain Commons, so we were thrilled to see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> become a W3C Recommendation this July.</p>

 New &amp; Updated Projects 

<p>We have also continued work on some of our smaller projects:</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit/master/static/images/spotbit-screen.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Beancount. Beancount is a <a href="https://github.com/beancount/beancount">simple program</a> that allows double-entry accounting from text files. Because of its textual foundation, it’s very convenient to use in conjunction with command-line Bitcoin tools. As it happens, this type of tool is also crucial to Bitcoin because of regulatory decisions in the US treating Bitcoin as property, not currency, meaning that capital gains need to be calculated for every transaction(!). This requires careful accounting of your Bitcoin, and to support that, we’ve updated our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit">SpotBit server</a> to also include a script called <code>beancounter.py</code> that will take a descriptor, look up historical prices via SpotBit, and thus provide all of the data an accountant will need to properly report Bitcoin purchases, sales, and usages. We’ve iterated the software a few times during the quarter, and think we might have a final version; watch for some documentation on the process in the coming quarter.</p>

<p>SpotBit. We’ve actually had a few recent updates to SpotBit, primarily to improve the look, feel, and design of its <a href="https://spotbit.info/spotbit/">webpages</a>. Thanks to 2022 interns who supported in this upgrade.</p>

 Advocacy 

<p>The work that Blockchain Commons does on specifications, leading to libraries and reference apps, is bottom-up: we work with developers to incorporate specifications that meet our vision of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. However, we also do top-down work, where we advocate for this vision to lawmakers, agencies, and other organizations.</p>

<p>Law &amp; Advocacy Repo. To better highlight this work, which was also well-supported by our 2022 interns, we’ve added a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/law-and-advocacy">Law &amp; Advocacy repo</a> to GitHub, to report out much of our work. It includes a list of <a href="https://hackmd.io/Eat2gnYqT56HQStI63JCNg">Terminology &amp; Definitions</a> produced by this year’s interns, and links to other work.</p>

<p>Private Key Disclosure. That work includes our new article advocating for <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Private-Key-Disclosure/">protection for private keys in courts</a>, which was published by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/saving-bitcoin-private-keys-from-courts">Bitcoin Magazine</a>. In recent years, courts have begun to request private keys as part of pre-trial discovery motions. It’s dangerous and unnecessary and it needs to end, as is now being considered in Wyoming, where Christopher Allen continues to give regular testimony. Fortunately, the proposed law in Wyoming to protect private keys from disclosure has recently passed a select committee and moved on to others. It still has a ways to go though!</p>

 Web Site Updates 

<p>Blockchain Commons’ third birthday passed without mention this Spring. But, that span of time since our foundation is probably why we’ve been doing a bit of work cleaning up our web presence, to make sure it accurately reflects where we are today!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com"></a></p>

<p>About Page. Didn’t even know that Blockchain Commons had a birthday? It’s referenced on our brand-new <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/about.html">About Page</a> which also highlights our three principals: Founder &amp; Executive Director Christopher Allen; Lead Researcher Wolf McNally; and Lead Tech Writer Shannon Appelcline.</p>

<p>Vision Page. We’ve long known the goal of Blockchain Commons: to make it possible for people to control their own assets and information on the internet, using the decentralized power of blockchain technology. We slightly revised how we write about that vision this quarter. Our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html">newest statement</a> combines two previous statements to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Blockchain Commons advocates for the creation of open, interoperable, secure &amp; compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Projects Page. You may also want to take a look at our updated <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/projects.html">Projects Page</a>. We’ve done a lot of different work over the last three and a half years. Our updated projects page now highlights what we consider most important to our vision, beginning with the Gordian System.</p>

<p>Airgapped Community. Though we continue to believe strongly in partitioning services to encourage the Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness, that’s today much bigger than the airgaps that we were considering several years ago. As a result, we’ve transformed the Airgapped Wallet Community into the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community">Gordian Developer Community</a>. We choose the name “Gordian Developer Community” for this update because the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian">Gordian System</a> today incorporates all of our developer-focused work, from Principles and Architecture to Specifications and Libraries, plus the Apps that demonstrate them. We look forward to talking with airgapped-wallet developers and those working on other partitioning techniques alike!</p>

 Doc Updates 

<p>As part of our web updating, we’ve also done some work on our docs.</p>

<p>Revised Gordian Page. How does the whole Gordian system fit together, from our air-gap and tor-gap overview to specifications such as Gordian Envelope? Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#readme">updated Gordian page</a> walks through the whole system from top to bottom, including new pages on topics such as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md">Gordian Architecture</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Roles.md">Gordian Architecture Roles</a></p>

<p>New Test Vectors. We’ve also produced some new test vectors, to help people who are implementing our specifications. These include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-test-vector.md#256-bit-seed">SSKR test vectors based on 256-bit seeds</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-seed-test-vectors.md">crypto-seed test vectors for both 128-bit and 256-bit seeds</a>.</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>Thank you as always for your support for Blockchain Commons. In 2022, we have truly become the commons that we imagined. Moving forward, we will continue to build firm foundations with our big focus on the architectural and reference work needed to release CSR by the end of the year.</p>

<p>If you’re not already a sponsor of our work, you can become one through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">GitHub</a>. Now that we’re back from RWOT11 in the Netherlands, we’re looking forward to continuing to advance our work!</p>

  The FBI has advised members of the public to verify investment claims and apps before making deposits.  A recent study showed that top Silicon Valley executives have also fallen victim to pig butchering.  Many of these scammers encouraged their victims to make deposits through crypto ATMs or other traditional methods such as wire transfers.  



<p>Crypto fraudsters often find <a href="https://bitnation.co/beeple-discord-url-has-been-hijacked-details/">new ways</a> to carry out their attacks against unsuspecting users. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI, revealed that fraudsters are using crypto ATMs as a new method of receiving funds obtained from their victims.</p>



<p>The agency made this known in a <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221003">public warning </a>it shared on its site, noting that a new form of fraud known as “pig butchering” was growing significantly. According to the FBI, some fraudsters use social media sites to trick their victims into believing they are long-lost friends or potential romantic partners. The scammers spend time winning their victim’s trust through frequent communication. These fraudsters proceed to introduce “genuine” investment schemes to their unsuspecting victims.</p>



<p>The scammers then tutor the victims into making frequent deposits on fake websites that allow them to track their investments and believe they are making significant progress. However, individuals involved in these schemes are never able to cash out their funds. </p>



<p>The FBI noted that the victims are told to pay income tax when they demand to withdraw their investments. In partnership with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), the FBI Miami Field Office noted that victims of such scams hardly recover their funds.</p>



<p>The victims lose contact with the fraudsters when the fake website is shut down, or the scammer cuts off communication links. The FBI noticed that the fraudsters directed their victims to make transfers through crypto ATMs, prepaid cards, or wire transfers, adding that,</p>



<blockquote><p>Many victims report being directed to make wire transfers to overseas accounts or purchase large amounts of prepaid cards. The use of cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency ATMs is also an emerging method of payment. Individual losses related to these schemes ranged from tens of thousands to millions of dollars.</p></blockquote>



<p>The FBI advised users to be wary of domain names masquerading as genuine exchanges and misspelled URLs, to double-check the legitimacy of any investment opportunity promoted by these types of people, and to avoid downloading any apps if the legitimacy could not be confirmed.</p>



<p>Scammers who masquerade as public officials, law enforcement personnel, or representatives of local utility companies have long used cryptocurrency ATMs to trick victims into sending money under the pretense of paying off debts or overdue taxes in order to avoid additional fines.</p>



<p>According to information from Coin ATM Radar, there are nearly 33,500 cryptocurrency ATMs in the United States, making up 87.4% of the world’s distribution.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a warning regarding cryptocurrency ATM fraud, stressing that the con artists occasionally pose as potential love partners.</p>



<p>Other&nbsp;law enforcement organizations in the United States have raised concerns about the surge of romance scams. Although it is often&nbsp;assumed that victims lack financial or technological knowledge, recent studies have disproved such claims. Research carried out in&nbsp;June showed that&nbsp;tech-savvy Silicon Valley executives in San Francisco had also lost millions to romance scams.&nbsp;</p>

 OIDF Session at Authenticate 2022 — Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
<p>1:45 – 2:40pm PT — <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/session/the-openid-foundation-strategy-a-deep-dive-on-fapi-and-the-global-open-banking-open-data-movement/">The OpenID Foundation Strategy &amp; a Deep Dive on FAPI and the Global Open Banking, Open Data Movement</a><br>
Presenters: Gail Hodges, OpenID Foundation Executive Director and Anoop Saxena, OIDF Member (Intuit) &amp; FAPI Working Group Co-Chair</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation standards are used today for consumer and enterprise login, open banking, open health, digital identity issuance and acceptance, and other federated identity use cases. We will give a brief overview of the OpenID Foundation’s strategy to serve the global community with its standards and certification capabilities. Then we will do a deep dive on the FAPI security profile in the context of Open Banking and Open Data implementations that are cascading around the world. The FAPI Security profile has been selected by public and private networks in the US, UK, Brazil, Australia, Norway and beyond. They are also a leading contender to enable cross border use cases. Background on FAPI and the global Open Banking, Open Data movement can be found in two OIDF whitepapers published this year:</p>

 OIDF Sessions at FIDO Member Plenary — Wednesday, October 19, 2022 
<p>9:00-9:10 am — Welcome &amp; Opening Remarks<br>
Presenter: Gail Hodges – OpenID Foundation Executive Director</p>
<p>9:10-9:45 am — Shared Signals &amp; Events: A Secure Webhooks Framework<br>
Presenter:&nbsp; Atul Tulshibagwale – SGNL</p>
<p>Lack of interoperability between products from different vendors hampers customer adoption and results in poorer security outcomes. Interoperable standards such as the Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP) of the Shared Signals and Events (SSE) Framework provide a great way to communicate session assurance changes and other ways in which account and session related information can be conveyed interoperably and asynchronously between parties that share users. Featured by Gartner as an innovation trigger in their 2022 Digital Identity Hype Cycle, CAEP and the SSE framework it relies on is growing in adoption. Learn more about the standard and how to adopt it in your environments in this talk.</p>
<p>9:45-10:20 am — OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC): Addressing Self-Sovereign Identity, Decentralized Identity, or User-Centric Identity<br>
Presenter: Kristina Yasuda – Microsoft</p>
<p>The OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC) protocol family is facilitating significant adoption of Verifiable Credentials, empowering individuals to take control of their own identity. By using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, a cornerstone of modern Identity systems as the foundation, OpenID4VC ensures that Verifiable Credentials applications are trusted, secure, interoperable, and easy to deploy. For that reason, OpenID4VC specifications are already being adopted and deployed in a number of implementations, rapidly becoming the foundation of many Verifiable Credentials solutions. OpenID4VC consists of three specifications: Self-Issued OpenID Provider v2 (SIOP v2), OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VP), and OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OIDC4VCI). They enable existing OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect Relying Parties to receive Verifiable Presentations and existing OAuth 2.0 Authorization Servers/OpenID Connect OpenID Providers to issue Verifiable Credentials in any credential format including W3C Verifiable Credentials and ISO/IEC 18013-5 mdocs. In this session, we will discuss use cases motivating the work, how these protocols solve the problems, what challenges remain, and how they have come together to weave a web of trust.</p>
<p>10:20-10:55 am — “A Review of the Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN): One Year On”<br>
Presenter:&nbsp; Elizabeth Garber – Co-Chair GAIN Proof of Concept</p>
<p>This session will provide a one-year update on the Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN) initiative including what’s next including seeking your input and contributions as GAIN transitions to focusing on how interoperability in enabled globally.</p>

<p>10:55-11:30 am — OIDF Government Whitepaper Listening Session: “Citizen-Centric Identity Systems”<br>
Presenter: Elizabeth Garber – Whitepaper Co-Author</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is developing a whitepaper for governments and their associated stakeholders with the goal of supporting them in making good decisions when implementing citizen-centric digital identity systems – and to help them understand where OIDC and its extensions fit in. This session will be a facilitated discussion about the key concerns of government when thinking about digital identity:</p>
 
 The Role of Government 
 Key Stakeholders 
 Adoption 
 Balancing privacy/security/trust 
 Resilience 
 Economic Benefits 
 Technology and Interoperability 
 How existing standards fit in 
 
<p>11:30 am-12:05 pm — OIDF Privacy Whitepaper Listening Session: “Help Design a Scalable Future for Personal Privacy”<br>
Presenter: Heather Flanagan – Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting</p>
<p>Government-issued digital IDs have the potential for amazing societal impact but getting there from here means bridging the gaps in identity validation, verification, privacy, and control. In this session, we offer an open conversation to gather different perspectives on how policies and protocols need to evolve to help government-issued IDs fill their role in a global privacy-preserving infrastructure. Come join us to be a part of thinking outside the box of today so we can achieve tomorrow’s promise of government-issued IDs as a benefit to all.</p>
<p>12:05-12:30 pm — Closing Remarks, Open Q&amp;A and Networking<br>

  1Inch has recently announced a new partnership with non-fungible token (NFT) domain name and digital identity provider Unstoppable Domains.  The new agreement would enable 1inch Wallet users to conduct transactions in a more customized manner by substituting complicated addresses with web-friendly domain names.  The partnership is an attempt to compete with Ethereum-based Ethereum Name Service (ENS) which is a major industry player for domain names.  



 



<p>Renowned distributed network <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/1inch-price-prediction/">1Inch</a> has recently announced a new partnership with non-fungible token (NFT) domain name and digital identity provider Unstoppable Domains, signaling a massive entry into the decentralized domain space.</p>



<p>According to the October 4 <a href="https://blog.1inch.io/1inch-partners-with-unstoppabledomains-b87c00e87f59?gi=32d4f75ac3d8">announcement</a>, the new agreement would enable <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/1inch-price-prediction/">1inch</a> Wallet users to conduct transactions in a more customized manner by substituting complicated addresses with web-friendly domain names. This is similar to what the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), the company that currently dominates the decentralized domain space.</p>



 
<blockquote><p>1/  Meet the most unstoppable announcement of this week!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/1inch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#1inch</a> is excited to announce a partnership with  <a href="https://twitter.com/unstoppableweb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@unstoppableweb</a>, an <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NFT</a> domain name provider and digital identity platform.<br><br> Read more: <a href="https://t.co/ooGROWT9XR">https://t.co/ooGROWT9XR</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DeFi</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#crypto</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Web3</a></p>— 1inch Network (@1inch) <a href="https://twitter.com/1inch/status/1577298090834419715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 4, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>The announcement reads 1inch Wallet users will be able to “appreciate a new feature enabling them to enter human-readable domain names when buying or sending crypto assets, just so they can perform transactions more easily,” thanks to the new partnership. By the new feature, 1inch is also aiming to increase transaction security by “thorough address checking and preventing sending errors.”</p>



<p>1inch, which claims to always strive to improve the user’s transaction experience, has been increasing its market presence with the recent collaborations with DeFi projects in recent times. In line with its expansion strategy, the company is aiming to enhance the utility of sending or receiving cryptocurrency within the 1inch Wallet by employing domain resolution.</p>



<p>1inch co-founder Sergej Kunz believes that Web3 mainstream adoption is still hindered by many issues of user experience, security and identity. </p>



<blockquote><p>“The partnership with Unstoppable opens up opportunities for overcoming these barriers by making Web3 onboarding more fun and attractive, while users will also benefit from a user-friendlier way of transacting,”</p>He add.</blockquote>



<p>2018-founded Unstoppable Domains is expected to rank among America’s Best Startup Employers in 2022. Its goal is to make Web3 surfing easier by handling digital identities and generating comprehensible crypto domain names. Moreover, the platform provides a variety of usernames for cryptocurrencies that can have endings. These include NFT, Wallet, Crypto, Bitcoin, Blockchain, 888, and DAO. </p>



<blockquote><p>“The 1inch Wallet is a DeFi lover’s dream, and Unstoppable is helping make it even easier for DeFi enthusiasts to manage their finances and own their identity on Web3. We’re thrilled to partner with 1inch to make transacting with, accessing and buying crypto simpler and more intuitive than ever,”</p>SVP and Channel Chief at the company, Sandy Carter commented.</blockquote>



<p>1INCH, the native token of the DeFi aggregator platform, is currently trading at $0.57 after falling 2.2% on the day. It has essentially remained constant over the past few months, like the majority of DeFi tokens. Similar to other major altcoins, its current price has greatly decreased if one compares it with the all-time high price. 1INCH has fallen down by 93% from its Oct. 2021’s ATH at $8.65.</p>



<p>On the other hand, ENS token is in a comparable situation after suffering a steep 81% decline from its all-time high in November. According to recent market data, ENS was trading up 1.2% on the day at $15.86 at the time of writing.</p>

<p>Antes de comenzar, ¿a qué nos referimos cuando hablamos de datos? ¿Y de tecnología? ¡Lo más probable es que estés trabajando con ambos!&nbsp;<br><br>Definimos datos como información que en aras de su usabilidad necesita ser procesada, organizada y estructurada. En otras palabras, por datos nos referimos a la información que posees, como detalles sobre las comunidades con las que trabajas, hallazgos de la investigación que has realizado, resultados de encuestas, direcciones de correo electrónico e información de contacto de personas que apoyan tu trabajo, etc.<br><br>Entendemos tecnología como las herramientas, sistemas, métodos y procesos que aprovechan el poder computacional para administrar, analizar y comunicar información. Para este recurso, cuando hablamos de tecnología, nos referimos a herramientas digitales, en general. Incluye desde plataformas de correo electrónico y aplicaciones de mensajería hasta servidores de sitios web, plataformas de boletines por correo electrónico, CRM, bases de datos, procesos algorítmicos, y más.</p>

 Exploraciones iniciales – pantallazo inicial del panorama tecnológico y de datos 



 P1: Nuestros pares parecen estar usando más tecnología/datos, ¿deberíamos considerar incrementar su uso también en nuestro trabajo? 



<p>La respuesta aquí realmente dependerá del contexto. La tecnología puede ayudarte a organizar el trabajo y las tareas diarias, permitir una comunicación más segura, recopilar y administrar información, y reducir costos y liberar recursos, entre otras cosas. Pero si la tecnología se usa de manera ineficaz o no estratégica, también puede comprometer tu capacidad para hacer el trabajo de manera segura y efectiva.</p>



<p>Por ejemplo, si tu organización está recopilando relatos de primera mano sobre violaciones de derechos humanos en áreas con poca conectividad a Internet/móvil, la adopción de una herramienta de recopilación de datos que requiera una conexión a Internet dificultará tu trabajo y afectará negativamente la capacidad para cumplir tu misión.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Usada de manera no estratégica, la tecnología también puede exponerte a ti y a tus colegas, a nuevas vulnerabilidades y riesgos. Por ejemplo, si te encuentras en un contexto donde la vigilancia gubernamental de la sociedad civil es común, y estás utilizando herramientas que no protegen adecuadamente tus comunicaciones, eso puede comprometer tu trabajo y seguridad.</p>



<p>Para asegurarte de usar la tecnología de manera estratégica y responsable, tómate un tiempo para pensar sobre el modo en que adoptar nuevas tecnologías o recopilar más datos podría fortalecer o debilitar tu trabajo. Antes de adoptar cualquier herramienta o plataforma nueva, intenta desarrollar tu capacidad interna, ponte en contacto con colegas u otras organizaciones que respetes.</p>

 P2: ¿Cómo podemos mi equipo y yo aprender más sobre tecnología y cómo ese aprendizaje es relevante para nuestro trabajo?  



<p>Las tecnologías digitales evolucionan rápidamente, al igual que los debates y las conversaciones sobre los posibles beneficios y efectos nocivos del uso de herramientas y plataformas específicas. Cuando tratamos de aprender más sobre tecnología, encontramos que es más útil enfocarse en dos aspectos:&nbsp;</p>



  Trabajar para <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">desarrollar la intuición técnica del personal de manera paulatina y progresiva</a> (inglés), y convertir ese objetivo en una prioridad de todo el equipo tanto como sea posible (a diferencia de un trabajo de una sola persona).  En lugar de buscar <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/">herramientas da moda</a> (inglés), primero tratar de identificar cómo la tecnología y los datos podría <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/">fortalecer tu trabajo principal</a> (inglés).  



<p>Cuando se trata de nuevas herramientas y aplicaciones, hay mucha información en línea que puede ser atractiva, pero puede ser difícil identificar qué es relevante para ti y qué no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Para entender más fácilmente la información relacionada con la tecnología, comienza primero con el problema que estás tratando de comprender o abordar. Además, si puedes, comunícate con profesionales de ideas afines que puedan tener contextos o misiones similares a los tuyos y aprende más sobre las herramientas que están usando (¡y cuáles han sido sus éxitos y fracasos!).</p>



<p>Preguntas relacionadas:<br>– <a title="Nuestros pares parecen estar usando más tecnología/datos, ¿deberíamos considerar incrementar su uso también en nuestro trabajo?">Nuestros pares parecen estar usando más tecnología/datos, ¿deberíamos considerar incrementar su uso también en nuestro trabajo?</a><br>– <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-admin/post.php?post=17008&amp;action=edit#aioseo-p3-mi-organizacion-cree-que-es-hora-de-comenzar-a-usar-mas-tecnologia-y-datos-en-nuestro-trabajo-donde-empezamos">Mi organización cree que es hora de comenzar a usar más tecnología y datos en nuestro trabajo. ¿Dónde empezamos?</a><br>– <a title="">¿Cómo tomamos decisiones sobre la adopción de nuevas herramientas y/o la recopilación de datos?</a></p>

<p></p>



 P3: Mi organización cree que es hora de comenzar a usar más tecnología y datos en nuestro trabajo. ¿Dónde empezamos?  



<p>¡Primero consigue una perspectiva general clara de lo que ya estás usando! La mayoría de las organizaciones ya están utilizando al menos algo de tecnología y datos para respaldar su trabajo, desde herramientas cotidianas como el correo electrónico o la mensajería instantánea, hasta herramientas y bases de datos de CRM. A continuación, encontrarás una breve lista de preguntas que pueden servir como ejercicio inicial para mapear las formas en que estás utilizando la tecnología y los datos en tu trabajo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nota: parte de la información recopilada mediante este ejercicio de mapeo puede ser confidencial: antes de comenzar, asegúrate de guardar tus notas en un lugar seguro y de compartirlas solo con las personas que necesitan acceso a ellas.</p>



  ¿Qué herramientas utilizas actualmente para tu trabajo?  ¿Qué plataformas/herramientas usan tú y tu equipo en sus comunicaciones? Estas podrían incluir correo electrónico, mensajería instantánea, redes sociales, SMS y sitios web, por nombrar algunos.  ¿Cómo almacenas y administras tus archivos y documentos? ¿Qué plataformas usas? ¿Todo el&nbsp; equipo usa las mismas plataformas?  ¿Estás trabajando en campañas públicas o trabajas en equipo con otras organizaciones? En caso afirmativo, ¿qué herramientas utilizas para el activismo, la organización y la construcción de la comunidad?  ¿Estás trabajando con alguna base de datos o plataforma de investigación?    



<p></p>



  ¿Cómo estás usando los datos?&nbsp;  ¿Qué tipo de datos/información recopilas o generas día a día? Piensa en tus flujos de trabajo individuales y colectivos y enumera los momentos en los que recopilas o generas datos. Por ejemplo, recopilar información de contacto de las personas que ha entrevistado, tener conversaciones por correo electrónico o Whatsapp, tomar notas de entrevistas o reuniones, o realizar encuestas con las comunidades.  ¿Dónde almacenas los datos? Considera los datos que tienes actualmente y enumera todos los lugares en los que están (asegúrate de incluir todas sus ubicaciones remotas: correos electrónicos, documentos compartidos, etc.).  ¿Cuándo y cómo compartes los datos? Piensa en los momentos en los que necesitas compartir datos: ¿cuándo suele suceder, con quién los comparte y qué herramientas utilizas? Por ejemplo, puedes enviar hojas de cálculo o archivos PDF por correo electrónico, compartir documentos y actas de reuniones a través de Google Docs o compartir contraseñas a través de una aplicación de mensajería.&nbsp;    



<p>Estas son preguntas exploratorias iniciales.

<p>Finalmente, adoptar nuevas herramientas requiere tiempo y recursos. Asegúrate de reservar para tu equipo y para ti espacios dedicados para aprender herramientas desconocidas, practicar comportamientos y ponerse al día con los nuevos datos utilizados.</p>

 P4: ¿Cómo puedo asegurarme de que las herramientas tecnológicas y los datos que usamos sean realmente útiles para nuestro trabajo?  



<p>En nuestro trabajo de apoyo a las organizaciones de la sociedad civil, a menudo nos enfrentamos a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">presunciones acerca de lo digital siempre es mejor</a> (inglés), y que cualquier solución tecnológica conducirá a una mayor eficiencia, efectividad e impacto.</p>



<p>Pero este no es siempre el caso. Cuando trabajamos con un socio de manera más cercana, a menudo comenzamos a evaluar cómo su uso de datos y tecnología actualmente se relacionan con su trabajo y contexto. Esto puede ayudarnos a descubrir cómo, o incluso si, la forma en que usan la tecnología está fortaleciendo su trabajo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Después de mapear qué herramientas está utilizando la organización y qué datos recopila, almacena y comparte, pasamos a una segunda capa de preguntas: ¿Qué tan útil es todo esto (o qué tan útil podría ser) en el contexto de tu trabajo?:&nbsp;</p>



  ¿Cuál es el problema social o político central en el que estás trabajando?&nbsp;&nbsp;  ¿El uso de tecnología y datos te permite abordar mejor ese problema? Si es así, ¿cómo? Si no, ¿por qué crees que eso podría estar sucediendo?  ¿El uso diario de tecnología y datos te ayudan a conectarte con personas u organizaciones importantes para tu trabajo?  ¿La forma en que usas la tecnología y los datos está afectando tu carga de trabajo? ¿Está facilitando tu trabajo o la carga de trabajo está siendo insostenible para el equipo? ¿Te gusta usar tus herramientas de organización?  



<p>Preguntas relacionadas: <a title="">¿Cómo tomamos decisiones sobre la adopción de nuevas herramientas y/o la recopilación de datos?</a> </p>

 Tomar decisiones – asegurándote de que los datos y la tecnología que usas coincidan con tus valores y misión 



 P5. ¿Cómo tomamos decisiones sobre la adopción de nuevas herramientas y/o la recopilación de datos?  



<p>Hay muchos aspectos a considerar al seleccionar una herramienta, y existen diversas opciones, incluso varias que quizás aún no conozcas. Entonces, ¿cómo empezar a reducir (o ampliar) tus opciones?</p>



<p>En el 2017, en base a nuestra investigación sobre la selección de herramientas en organizaciones de la sociedad civil, elaboramos un <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/alidade-interactive-guide-for-finding-technology-tools/">guía interactiva de selección de herramientas llamada Alidade</a> (Inglés), que por medio de preguntas puede ayudar a las organizaciones a decidir qué tipo de herramienta tecnológica mejor se adapta a sus necesidades. ¡Recomendamos probarla!.</p>



<p>En general, cuando las organizaciones buscan nuevas herramientas tecnológicas, hemos constatado que las siguientes pautas resultan beneficiosas:</p>



  Investigar a las personas, el problema y luego la tecnología. Analiza el problema general donde piensas que una herramienta tecnológica podría ser útil. Piensa en tu público objetivo. Investiga y examina las diferentes alternativas tecnológicas disponibles.&nbsp;  Pensar dos veces antes de construir. Busca herramientas ya existentes acordes a tus necesidades. Construir una herramienta completamente nueva puede ser complejo y arriesgado.  Conseguir una segunda opinión. Probablemente alguien más haya intentado un enfoque similar previamente. Encuentra a esa persona y pídele consejos.  Siempre hay que probar. Antes de elegir una prueba al menos dos herramientas, con las personas con las que quieres usarlas. Ponerlas a prueba permite detectar problemas. También te permite plantearte preguntas que no se te habían ocurrido.  Planificar por si falla. La primera vez puede que no salga bien. Prepara un plan y un presupuesto que te permita ir haciendo ajustes regulares a la herramienta a lo largo del proyecto.  Reflexionar sobre lo que estás haciendo. Sigue pensando en lo que funciona y lo que no funciona. Aplica ese aprendizaje al trabajo de tu organización y compártelo con otras organizaciones.  



<p>Asegúrate de que las herramientas que elijas también se adapten a tus necesidades de seguridad. Al evaluar la seguridad de una herramienta, considera lo siguiente:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  ¿Cuál es la política de privacidad de datos de la herramienta? ¿Qué tipo de datos recopila la herramienta y con quién se comparten esos datos? ¿Quién tiene acceso a los datos almacenados dentro de la herramienta?  ¿Está bien documentado el enfoque de privacidad y seguridad de la herramienta? ¿Qué puedes averiguar sobre el historial de privacidad y seguridad de la herramienta?  



<p>Documenta tus hallazgos y coméntalos con tus colegas antes de tomar una decisión final sobre una herramienta.</p>



<p>Preguntas relacionadas:<br>– <a title="Nuestros pares parecen estar usando más tecnología/datos, ¿deberíamos considerar incrementar su uso también en nuestro trabajo?">Nuestros pares parecen estar usando más tecnología/datos, ¿deberíamos considerar incrementar su uso también en nuestro trabajo?</a><br>– <a title="¿Cómo podemos mi equipo y yo aprender más sobre tecnología y cómo ese aprendizaje es relevante para nuestro trabajo?

 P6: Mi organización quiere integrar nuevas tecnologías, pero no hemos encontrado la herramienta adecuada. ¿Deberíamos construir una nueva herramienta? 



<p>Si estás familiarizado con nuestro trabajo, probablemente sepas que a menudo estamos a favor de adaptar las herramientas existentes a tus necesidades siempre que sea posible (llamamos a esto “reutilización de herramientas”).</p>



<p>Nuestra investigación en esta área en los últimos años ha demostrado que la reutilización y la adaptación de las herramientas existentes puede tener una serie de ventajas, como el uso más eficiente de los recursos financieros y el aumento del acceso al apoyo en la implementación y el mantenimiento.</p>



<p>Desarrollar una herramienta desde cero, por otro lado, este puede ser un proceso prolongado y costoso, con resultados decepcionantes: hemos visto cómo las herramientas pueden terminar siendo ineficaces o poco utilizadas, resultar inesperadamente onerosas o requerir para su mantenimiento y actualización del empleo intensivo de recursos.</p>



<p>Pero si la funcionalidad que tu organización está buscando no está disponible y, estás considerando construir una nueva herramienta, aquí hay algunas preguntas para reflexionar al respecto:</p>



  ¿Existe una necesidad real e identificable de esta herramienta? ¿Esto te acercará más a tus objetivos a largo plazo? ¿La construcción de una herramienta respondería a una fuerte necesidad que ha surgido durante tu trabajo, o la idea tuvo otro origen?  ¿Cuentas con los recursos necesarios para construir la herramienta, mantenerla a largo plazo y brindar apoyo continuo a quienes la utilizarán?  ¿Cuál es tu visión para la herramienta a largo plazo? ¿Podrían las necesidades o problemas que se está construyendo la herramienta para abordar potencialmente evolucionar con el tiempo?

 P7. ¿Cómo puedo usar tecnología/datos si mi acceso a Internet o a la electricidad no es confiable?  



<p>Si tienes problemas de acceso intermitente a Internet, considera la adopción de herramientas que te posibiliten trabajar tanto en línea como sin conexión. En Google Docs, por ejemplo, puedes <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6388102?hl=es">habilitar el acceso offline a los documentos</a> . Esto te permitirá continuar trabajando sin conexión y luego sincronizar los documentos una vez que se restablezca la conectividad. Algunas herramientas de recopilación y gestión de datos, como <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo ToolBox</a>, te permite recopilar datos en dispositivos cuando no tienes conexión, y luego cargar datos al servidor una vez que la red esté disponible. Para reuniones en línea en entornos de baja conectividad, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> es una opción gratuita, de código abierto y liviana para llamadas de solo audio.</p>



<p>Si el presupuesto de tu organización lo permite, también recomendamos invertir en una conexión de respaldo: por ejemplo, una conexión de red móvil para conectar sus dispositivos cuando su conexión de banda ancha no esté disponible.</p>



<p>Hay dos formas de hacerlo: usando un módem de Internet móvil o un teléfono inteligente para crear un punto de acceso móvil donde otros dispositivos pueden conectarse y compartir la conectividad móvil. Aquí hay un breve tutorial sobre <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915">Cómo crear un punto de acceso móvil en un teléfono inteligente Android</a> (Inglés). Puedes reducir el consumo de datos compartiendo la contraseña de acceso solo con dispositivos y personas imprescindibles.</p>



<p>En los casos en que la conexión a Internet y/o la electricidad sean intermitentes y estés trabajando en línea, asegúrate de guardar tu trabajo con la mayor frecuencia posible para minimizar el riesgo de perderlo.</p>



<p>Si con frecuencia sufres cortes de electricidad, adquirir un generador de respaldo puede ser una opción útil, siempre que tu organización cuente con los recursos para hacerlo.</p>

 P8. ¿Cómo trabajar con personas desarrolladoras y/o expertas en temas de tecnología? 



<p>Hay muchos tipos diferentes de profesionales con los que puedes trabajar. Entre las profesiones que interactúan con mayor frecuencia con tecnología y datos se encuentran:</p>



  Diseño de experiencia de usuario (UX): Trabaja tanto con clientes (¡en este caso, contigo!) como con usuarios para diseñar un producto que satisfaga múltiples necesidades y sea fácil de entender y operar.&nbsp;  Diseño visual o gráfico: Supervisa los elementos gráficos que utilizará un sitio web, una herramienta, una aplicación o una publicación, y es responsable de diseñar la identidad visual (o la marca). A menudo trabajan con la persona encargada de diseño de UX para asegurarse de que la identidad visual también funcione bien para las personas usuarias.  Ilustración: Crea ilustraciones, íconos, infografías, etc., que vivirán dentro de la estructura más grande que han creado el diseñador visual y el diseñador UX.  Desarrollo Frontend: Implementa el diseño en un sitio web, herramienta o aplicación. En particular, es capaz de codificar los aspectos que los usuarios verán y con los que interactuarán.  Desarrollo Backend: Desarrolla y conecta una base de datos al frontend (las partes del sitio web, la aplicación o la herramienta que un usuario puede ver) y realiza todas las tareas no visibles que llenarán el frontend con contenido dinámico.  Análisis de datos: Extrae patrones de grandes volúmenes de datos. También pueden estar equipados con las herramientas y el conocimiento para crear visualizaciones de datos para comunicar patrones importantes.  Sysadmin/DevOps: Mantiene los servidores donde vive el sitio web, la herramienta o la aplicación. A menudo son responsables de coordinar el procedimiento necesario para resolver problemas cuando los usuarios detectan errores o fallos.  



<p>A veces, los roles pueden superponerse: por ejemplo, puedes contratar a una persona que lidere el diseño y desarrollo de un sitio web, o una persona desarrolladora que sea capaz de trabajar tanto en el frontend como en el backend.</p>



<p>Antes de contratar personas desarrolladoras y tecnólogas externas, es útil que:&nbsp;</p>



  Seas claro acerca de por qué deseas crear o adoptar nuevas herramientas.  Identifiques los recursos que tienes y los que necesitarás.  Te acuerdes de planificar el mantenimiento a largo plazo.  



<p>Cuando comiencen a trabajar juntos es importante establecer puntos de coincidencia y una terminología compartida acerca de las necesidades y expectativas. Recomendamos redactar los TdR (Términos de Referencia) para documentar y compartir las necesidades y requisitos del proyecto. Los TdR deben cubrir como mínimo:</p>



  El presupuesto disponible del proyecto.  La línea de tiempo necesaria  Tus objetivos  Tus expectativas para el socio externo  Cualquier información adicional  



<p>También deben ponerse de acuerdo en lo referido a herramientas, canales de comunicación, roles y responsabilidades.</p>



<p>Todo esto puede contribuir en gran medida al éxito del proyecto desde el principio. Algunos items de la lista de tareas del trabajo con consultores una vez que el proceso está en marcha son:</p>



  Concéntrate en la claridad de los objetivos organizacionales, los grandes procesos y los hitos para apoyar mejor al equipo/proyecto.  Brinda retroalimentación relevante y oportuna.  Proporciona espacio y muestra respeto por la experiencia del consultor.  Trata de mantener una comunicación frecuente.

 P9. Mi organización hace mucho de nuestro trabajo en línea, pero nuestra colaboración no siempre funciona tan bien. ¿Cómo podemos hacer que la colaboración en línea funcione mejor? 



<p>Sabemos de primera mano que cuando se trata de colaborar en línea, encontrar la forma correcta de comunicarse es esencial, tanto para trabajar sin problemas como para el bienestar general.</p>



<p>Idealmente, tu equipo tendrá una selección de herramientas o canales para usar (por ejemplo, una combinación de aplicaciones de chat seguras, correo electrónico y herramientas de gestión de proyectos), pero es importante que cada uno de estos tenga una función clara.</p>



<p>A menudo, nuestros socios usan tantas herramientas diferentes que se sienten abrumados cada vez que necesitan compartir un documento, una idea o un mensaje. Si este es el caso de tu organización, destina un tiempo para anotar rápidamente todas las diversas herramientas que usan para comunicarse; la lista podría incluir aplicaciones como Signal y Whatsapp, plataformas de mensajería como Slack y Mattermost, CRM en línea como Salesforce, herramientas de VOIP como Skype, Zoom o Jitsi Meet, y herramientas de colaboración como Trello, Airtable, Asana y otras. Quizás también usan mensajes SMS y llamadas telefónicas.</p>



<p>Una vez que tengas esta lista, te sugerimos que te reúnas con tus colegas, o con las personas con las que colaboras más a menudo, para de manera consensuada intentar usar menos herramientas. Asigna a cada herramienta un propósito específico: por ejemplo, tal vez el correo electrónico sea para mensajes más largos que no sean sensibles al tiempo o para compartir documentos, mientras que los programas de mensajería son solo para preguntas urgentes o conversaciones amistosas.</p>



<p>Una vez que hayas identificado algunas cosas que funcionan, ¡documenta los aprendizajes! La documentación asegurará que todos estén en la misma página y que sea una gran referencia para cualquier persona nueva que se una al equipo o para permanecer consciente de los procesos/proyectos.</p>

 Centrar esfuerzos en torno a la seguridad y el cuidado 



 P10: ¿Cómo puedo asegurarme de que todo mi equipo esté utilizando las herramientas (o procesos de datos) que hemos elegido? 



<p>Incluso cuando estamos entusiasmados con una nueva herramienta tecnológica o un proceso para el uso de datos, es difícil adoptar nuevas formas de trabajar. Al mismo tiempo, asegurarnos de que estamos utilizando las herramientas que acordamos usar (y sus protocolos de seguridad o protección relevantes) es una manera importante de poner en práctica el cuidado mutuo en las organizaciones.</p>



<p>Una medida para ayudarnos mutuamente en la adopción de una nueva forma de trabajar es asegurarnos de que la nueva herramienta o protocolo responda a una necesidad concreta y que todos sepan cuál es esa necesidad. Esto significa que todos saben que el esfuerzo que realizan para aprender a usar la nueva herramienta, los acercará a encontrar una solución a un problema que venían enfrentando.</p>



<p>Al mismo tiempo, es importante gestionar las expectativas: los cambios posiblemente se empiecen a notar poco a poco, con el tiempo, a medida que más personas usan una herramienta o protocolo y se familiarizan con él. Eso es parte del proceso.</p>



<p>Y, como es un proceso, es bueno dejar espacio y tiempo para el aprendizaje, la adaptación y el debate cuando se implementa una nueva herramienta. Dependiendo de qué más esté pasando, las capacidades para aprender algo nuevo pueden variar entre los equipos, y dar espacio puede ser la mejor manera de reconocer esto.</p>



<p>Finalmente, escuchar las experiencias de aquellas personas que usan la nueva herramienta pueden ayudarte a detectar eventuales ajustes que quieras hacer en la herramienta como tal o en el modo en que se utiliza.&nbsp;</p>

 P11: ¿Qué podemos hacer para mantener a las personas más seguras cuando comenzamos a usar diferentes herramientas tecnológicas y prácticas de datos? 



<p>Muchas de las personas con las que hablamos tienen curiosidad sobre cómo incorporar la seguridad y el cuidado en todo el trabajo que realizan, especialmente cuando se trata de nuevas iniciativas de tecnología y datos. Cuando en las noticias, en nuestras comunidades y por experiencias personales nos enteramos de casos de fugas de datos y de hackeos a herramientas,&nbsp; incorporar de manera segura herramientas o procesos tecnológicos puede resultar una tarea ardua.</p>



<p>Un enfoque que puede contribuir a la construcción de una base adecuada es el de Datos Responsables (Responsible Data): la idea de que compartimos un “deber colectivo de dar cuenta de las consecuencias no deseadas de trabajar con datos.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Algunas áreas para explorar que caen bajo el paraguas de Datos Responsables son:</p>



  Prácticas como la minimización de datos (solo recopilar los datos necesarios).  Conceptos como el consentimiento (asegurando que las personas puedan aceptar cómo se utilizarán sus datos de una manera libremente dada, específica, informada y revocable).  Espacios relacionados como la <a href="https://wiki.orgsec.community/">seguridad organizacional</a> (un área rica de práctica en torno al establecimiento de protocolos que pueden ayudar a construir seguridad de datos/información y bienestar físico y seguridad).  



<p>Si no estás familiarizado con este tipo de prácticas, existen recursos que pueden ayudarte, desde guías en línea hasta apoyo para profesionales.</p>



<p>Seleccionar herramientas que prioricen tu seguridad puede ser otro paso a seguir. A menudo, estas herramientas no se usan tanto como sus contrapartes menos seguras, por lo que esta podría ser una oportunidad para consultar con colegas de ideas afines o para contactar a una consultoría tecnológica externa de tu confianza. Algunas de estas herramientas podrían incluir:</p>



  Gestores de contraseñas: Crear contraseñas fuertes y únicas es una parte fundamental del uso de la tecnología de manera más segura. Los administradores de contraseñas pueden realizar un seguimiento de tus contraseñas y ayudarte a crear buenas contraseñas.&nbsp; <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords">Aprende más aquí</a> (Inglés).  Herramientas de comunicación más seguras: Muchos mensajes que enviamos digitalmente no están encriptados, lo que significa que si alguien los interceptara, podría leer el contenido. Las herramientas de comunicaciones más seguras ofrecen cifrado, lo que dificulta que las personas lean el contenido de tus mensajes. Puedes&nbsp; <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures">aprender más aquí</a> (Inglés), o puedes <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">comunicarte con The Engine Room</a> para obtener ayuda sobre la adopción de nuevas herramientas.  Redes privadas virtuales: Una VPN (red virtual privada) es una herramienta que puede ayudar a proteger tu actividad web de la vigilancia en la red de Internet que estás utilizando. Elegir la VPN correcta, y conocer sus limitaciones, es crucial y depende del contexto en el que te encuentres (en qué país estés, qué VPN elijas, etc.). Al mismo tiempo, elegir la VPN adecuada para tu situación puede ser complejo, así que puedes <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you">conseguir información aquí</a> y no dudes en <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">comunicarte con The Engine Room</a> para obtener apoyo.&nbsp;  



<p>Siempre ten en cuenta que la seguridad es una combinación de herramientas y prácticas. Así como contar con las herramientas adecuadas es importante, usarlas de la manera correcta y desarrollar prácticas internas sólidas en torno a la seguridad en general, teniendo en cuenta la seguridad física y psicológica también lo es.</p>

  Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July, days after halting withdrawals.  The crypto lender was affected by the collapse of the TerraUSD and Luna tokens and other factors that tested its business model.  The company’s employees claim Celsius’s decline was caused by several high-profile errors by the firm’s leadership.  



 



<p>Daniel Leon, co-founder and chief strategy officer of Celsius Network, has reportedly&nbsp;announced his resignation, joining a string of executives who have left&nbsp;troubled digital asset companies. Leon’s resignation comes a week after Celsius&nbsp;CEO Alex Mashinsky <a href="https://bitnation.co/alex-mashinsky-announces-his-resignation-from-celsius/">announced </a>his decision to step down from his role. Celsius confirmed Leon’s departure in a message to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-04/celsius-says-co-founder-daniel-leon-resigned-from-crypto-lender?sref=323RPL5z">Bloomberg</a>. They wrote,</p>



<blockquote><p>We confirm that Daniel Leon resigned from his position at Celsius and is no longer part of the organization.</p></blockquote>



<p>Leon and Mashinsky founded Celsius in 2017 and together built one of the biggest crypto lending firms. However, Celsius has been under investigation by several American states since it filed for bankruptcy in July. At the time, the lending company was said to be $1.9 billion in debt.</p>



<p>According to reports, the bankruptcy judge recently ordered an examiner to investigate claims of misconduct and mismanagement on the part of the company’s executives. Several employees have previously pointed fingers at Mashinsky for his “careless” actions and poor decisions, which are believed to have put the crypto lender in a bad spot.</p>



<p>At the height of its power, Celsius was seen as a main rival to traditional banks. The platform hoped to compete with established financial institutions by&nbsp;allowing users&nbsp;to invest their coins and earn interest on them. The company often dismissed concerns associated with such an investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a filing made on Monday, Celsius is presently taking bids for its assets and may decide to hold an auction on October 20. The date of the sale hearing is scheduled for&nbsp;November 1. Notably, cryptocurrency entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried is reportedly&nbsp;considering acquiring the assets.</p>



<p>The crypto industry is not only suffering from one of its most intense bear markets but also an unprecedented change in leadership. Leon’s departure from Celsius follows the recent stories of other top executives leaving their roles since July. </p>



<p>Some executives, including the former CEO of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, the CEO of Kraken, Jesse Powell, the president of FTX US, Brett Harrison, the CEO of Genesis, Michael Moro, and managing director Matthew Ballensweig, have migrated into less prominent advisory roles. </p>



<p>Some, like former Alameda Research co-CEO Sam Trabucco, Ignite CEO Peng Zhong, and bankrupt Voyager Digital CFO Ashwin Prithipaul, have completely altered course.</p>

		<p>Founded in 2011, Zoom quickly became a household name during the pandemic as many remote workers, teachers, and students needed an online solution for learning and collaborating. Last year, Zoom was named a leader in the Gartner 2021 Magic Quadrant for Unified Communications as a service (UCaaS) Worldwide and rated as a top vendor by TrustRadius for excellence in customer satisfaction. Along with continuing to offer exceptional meeting room solutions, Zoom provides a cloud phone service that allows users to make phone calls with the same ease and familiarity as Zoom video meetings. Zoom Phone enables secure voice calls across all supported devices and offers a simple and straightforward way for Zoom users to set up quick calls without video. “As a single communications stack, Zoom Phone seamlessly allows people to connect into Zoom Cloud from a desktop, mobile device, hardware phone, or room system,” explains Glenn Grieshaber, Account Executive of Higher Education, Zoom Video Communications. “Zoom is a cloud-native infrastructure that gives our customers a single platform solution that is optimized for modern communications. From an educational organization perspective, the single unified client of Zoom Phone makes deploying, scaling, managing, and maintaining the technology much easier for IT managers.”</p>
<p>Designed to drive team collaboration, Zoom’s solutions look to enrich teaching and learning and expand traditional classroom settings with a true unified solution. “We are trying to meet the growing needs of schools and the requirements of their modern learners and teachers,” shares Grieshaber. “Zoom aims to help organizations improve their learning outcomes, make their meetings easier and more efficient, and increase student retention and engagement. From the organization’s viewpoint, we also want to maximize current resources. The single client of Zoom Phone makes using and scaling university and college resources much easier. Plus, this solution can seamlessly integrate with an institution’s learning management system (LMS).”</p>
<p>Migrating to the Cloud<br>
Many institutions in higher education are beginning to make the transition from conventional phone services, like private branch exchange (PBX), to cloud technology solutions. “This migration is being driven by the need to move away from legacy analog technology to a digital cloud solution for several reasons,” explains Michelle Ferraro, Member Account Manager, Edge. “PBX services are primarily supported by on premise hardware and software, and we are seeing many of these solutions become obsolete due to their lack of flexibility and high support cost models. Colleges and universities that are still running on legacy PBX systems have begun to migrate and explore the advantages of cloud-based technology for their communications offerings.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>With these PBX solutions becoming outdated, Grieshaber has also noted a rise in organizations exploring the advantages of cloud-based technology. “Fortunately, new solutions like Zoom Phone will easily integrate into other third-party solutions and allow institutions to move more of their support model into the Cloud through professional services or reduced administrative touchpoints, freeing up staff to focus on other tasks. We have also seen many of these legacy solutions being discontinued, so some institutions with very specific use cases demanded an enterprise-quality solution in the Cloud. Zoom Phone was built from the ground up to solve these types of use cases and administrative challenges and provide a streamlined end-user experience by leveraging data to that single client for all their video and phone needs.”</p>
<p>Cloud-based solutions offer flexible end user-based solutions that move most of the support model into the Cloud for easier management. “This transition is happening for several reasons,” explains Ferraro. “One is the need to consolidate and manage communication requirements from a single all-in-one solution for an UCaaS environment. Organizations also want to drive team collaboration on intelligent platforms, while supporting and managing off-site employees securely. Cloud solutions can also help organizations reduce IT expenditures, better manage the year-over-year forecasted budget, and effectively confront rising security concerns.”</p>
<p>In addition, Zoom helps enable our customers’ HIPAA compliance programs and is E911 compliant, addressing regulated Enhanced Emergency Services, such as Kari’s Law and Ray Baums Act, at no additional cost to the end user. This new federal law requires businesses to comply with three phases of compliance regulations that took final effect in January 2022. These requirements include: 1) A phone system must allow a user to dial 911 without any prefix or access code; 2) Notification must be sent when 911 is called; 3) A valid callback number (not the main company phone number) must be provided when 911 is called.</p>

Specifically, in the education space, many institutions have developed solutions over a long period of time and have combined multiple platforms together over the years, often resulting in a subpar end-user experience. “With platforms that have been bridged together, you have multiple touchpoints from the administrative side and this setup poses a very challenging support model in the end; raising the overall cost of the solution and complexity of the network,” says Grieshaber. “We’re seeing from most of our colleges and universities a desire to replace these multiple platforms and technologies with a simple single application. So far, the feedback from New Jersey institutions that have deployed Zoom Phone has been positive. Being architected on a single client, organizations have been able to scale very simply, securely support off-site employees and students, and train their staff easily, especially since many people are already familiar with the Zoom app and interface.”</p>
<p>Being a robust cloud PBX built on a single application, Zoom Phone allows a seamless workflow from a phone call to Zoom Meeting, Zoom Chat, and Zoom Room. “From the team management side, you have a centralized management tool or a single point of administration to conduct detailed reporting, meeting analysis, monitoring service, and scale Zoom phone users,” explains Grieshaber. “Zoom Phone provides a secure and reliable HD voice experience in the Cloud across globally distributed data centers. We have hundreds of features and continue to add more, like closed captioning, contact center capability, electronic transcription, keyboard shortcuts, and the ability to participate equitably across our client. We also give an institution’s users and administrators of that account the ability to access features, and either turn them on or off based on their preferences and needs. The Cloud gives you that flexibility and control to tailor your communication experience to your specific organization.”</p>
<p>Team of Experts<br>
Zoom is committed to making the transition to cloud-based communications as easy as possible and helping customers upgrade or scale their existing environment efficiently. “We partner closely with organizations and work to certify many of the leading manufacturers’ solutions in our ecosystem,” says Grieshaber. “This means we support a robust ecosystem of hardware from manufacturers like Poly, Yealink, Neat, ePen- Dten, AudioCode, Cisco, Ribbon, Spectralink, and many others. We offer certified headsets, classroom and conference room devices, USB cameras and speakerphones for video and audio capability, all-in-one room systems, and paging and intercom hardware to completely build out a robust phone system.”</p>
<p>Edge and Zoom have partnered to share their combined experience and expertise with member institutions, and Zoom video and web conferencing solutions can currently be procured through EdgeMarket. “We really value and appreciate our Edge relationship and are very proud of what we’re accomplishing together,” shares Grieshaber. “Our customers, like Edge members Georgian Court University (GCU) and Brookdale Community College, are benefiting from the Zoom and Edge partnership and how we work closely together in every customer engagement. As a collective team, we provide consistent technical information to ensure the best solution is being provided to meet an organization’s individual needs. From an administrative and contractual perspective, the Edge/Zoom partnership allows our customers like GCU, Brookdale, and others the flexibility to meet all of their procurement requirements. Each of these schools had legacy technology that was outdated, with equipment that was going to be discontinued soon. This can cause a great deal of pressure from a technical and feature perspective.”</p>
<p>Grieshaber continues, “Zoom and Edge were able to suggest a model that answered the growing demand for team collaboration and delivered an intelligent platform that provided a flexible and customizable solution. Both GCU and Brookdale were able to lower their overall yearly IT investment and were upgraded to a true cloud unified communications (UC) phone solution. Each institution was able to address any security concerns and compliance requirements with Zoom Professional Services. For customers who invest in Zoom solutions, the new features and functionalities that continue to be released will be added automatically. We will be adding more enhancements soon, and we think colleges and universities will be extremely excited about these new features and the collaboration opportunities they will provide for their organization.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				      
 
	 
		<p> GCU’s Successful Transition to Zoom Phone<br>
Edge member, Georgian Court University (GCU), recently made the transition to Zoom Phone from an Avaya PBX system that included a combination of old analog phones and IP phones. Along with deteriorating copper lines causing connection issues, GCU had been notified by the vendor that the PRI lines connected to the PBX were no longer going to be supported. The University began exploring solutions for updating their phone systems and after reviewing several options, GCU chose Zoom Phone to upgrade their communication capabilities.</p>
<p>GCU obtained Zoom Phone through EdgeMarket, allowing for a seamless procurement process and great pricing of a vetted phone system. Since GCU already uses Zoom for meetings, the transition to the new cloud-based phone system was fairly straightforward. To help all users get up to speed quickly, Zoom provided two training sessions and links to their extensive library of information on using their system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The new zoom phone system has provided many new features on an easy-to-use, familiar platform,” says Matthew R. Manfra, Vice President for Institutional Advancement, GCU. “Being able to seamlessly make or take calls anywhere using mobile, computers, and phones has increased our ability to engage with our constituents.”</p>
<p>By transitioning to Zoom Phone immediately following graduation, disruption to day-to-day operations was minimal and the University did not receive any complaints during implementation. Users say migrating to the Cloud was an easy process and they are excited to be able to use all the new features and enhanced flexibility the Zoom system offers.</p>

		<p>Over the past two decades, classrooms have gone through a massive shift, integrating technology and digital devices into everyday learning. The pandemic further expedited these changes, where the traditional learning space is becoming even further transformed. Classrooms are now requiring more built-in flexibility and technology capabilities to meet the evolving needs of teachers and students. “While we’re not turning every face-to-face classroom into a hybrid online learning space, institutions must be able to adapt to changing conditions, like a global health crisis or weather emergency,” says Josh Gaul, AVP &amp; Chief Digital Learning Officer, Edge. “Schools that have pedagogical practices in place are better prepared for such events and can keep classes going despite where and when learning is taking place. Learning spaces will need to advance to better serve the requirements of both traditional and non-traditional students and provide a greater reach to a larger student population. For instance, a classroom with digitally enhanced capabilities could give students living in regionally desperate areas access to high-level instructors.”</p>
<p>Chris Markham, Vice President for Information Technology &amp; Economic Advancement, Edge, says, “The pandemic also revealed the need for a unity in message within e-learning and educational technology, as well as unity in technology design. The last few years forced a fusion in thought leadership and in the approach to design of technology systems and ecosystems.” Many institutions were not prepared to meet the challenges of distance learning and struggled to maintain the educational effectiveness and quality. “Unfortunately when one side of an institution is leading without the point of view of the other, gaps can arise,” explains Gaul. “If the learning spaces are too IT focused without academic input, this creates user issues. And if they’re too academic focused without IT input, student issues can arise because their classrooms lack any technology at all. We need to find a way to balance both sides and help them work together strategically.”</p>
<p>Marrying Academic Goals with Technology<br>
Whether a classroom is teaching English or AP Physics, each learning space needs to be equipped to offer video-enhanced hybrid or hyflex learning capabilities with a quality Wi-Fi connection and video conferencing system. “Students are learning just as much connecting with their classmates outside of class via the Learning Management System (LMS) or other collaboration software,” says Gaul. “They are watching videos that are assigned to supplement course instruction, so classrooms nowadays have to be built to support that need, especially in smaller institutions where the same discipline doesn’t always use the same classroom. A chemistry class can be taught in the same room as a drama class or a business class, so these rooms must be multifaceted and flexible enough that they can meet the needs of each of these disciplines. Especially for smaller schools or community colleges, they must find ways to make their classrooms refurbishable, reusable, and innovative through the use of technology in order to create engaging learning experiences.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  

	 
		    
			 
				
 
	 
		 SPACE DESIGN INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY (SDIT)<br>
EVALUATION SNAPSHOT<br>
SPOTLIGHT 
<p>Edge recently partnered with member institution, Felician University, to digitally enhance a newly-built extension to their wellness and recreation center. To effectively and efficiently create these technology-infused spaces, Felician requested a space design integrated technology evaluation (SDIT) from Edge. “With Chris via Zoom, I visited campus in person to receive a tour of the entire building and the spaces they planned on upgrading,” shares Gaul. “I gathered the needs and goals of facilities, academics, and IT, and determined the risks, rewards, opportunities, and potential threats to the endeavor. Following subsequent interviews and meetings, we provided a report with suggestions for successfully achieving their objectives for the new spaces. We included a scale of pricing suggestions, from low range to higher, and created a holistic approach to upgrading the entire building system. There must be standardization and interconnectedness across rooms and a strategy that accounts for all aspects, including management, terms of usage, security, and future goals.”</p>
<p>Upon reviewing the report, Felician decided to move forward with all the suggestions provided in the SDIT. Edge partnered with AVA Technology, the IT team, and facilities to help organize installation and ensure questions were answered throughout the process. “Along with providing expertise in thought leadership and learning space design and technology, Edge can help with supply chain management, analysis of technology infrastructure, and project management of the technology ecosystem,” says Markham. “Not only do we offer a blueprint to follow, we can help outline the specs, materials, quantities, price, and timeline for delivery. Between the members of our team, we have over four decades of experience in space design integrated technologies and we are always excited to share with member institutions the insight and knowledge we’ve gained through the years.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>In addition to working closely with Felician University (see inset Space Design Integrated Technology (SDIT) Evaluation Snapshot), Edge has also performed SDIT evaluations for William Jewel College and Hudson County Community College (HCCC) to help update their learning spaces. “We recently evaluated one of the spaces at Hudson County where they wish to install a video studio for faculty members to deliver and record lectures,” says Gaul. “I worked with Matthew LaBrake, Executive Director of the HCCC Center for Online Learning (COL), to help inform the evaluation and outline recommendations for tools and solutions. I then met with our EdgeMarket team and partners at SHI to provide a proposal. The HCCC team then reviewed the recommendations to select the best way forward. Subsequently, in mid-August 2022, final implementation and installation took place .”</p>

		<p>The role of learning space design is to connect IT and academic affairs, as well as successfully pulling in a 21st century learning approach to instructional design and teaching. When designing academic programs and curriculum, institutions must incorporate IT needs and initiatives—and vice versa—when IT is evaluating technology and designing solutions, they must include the academic mindset and the pedagogical needs of the instructors and students. To create a successful technology roadmap, the academic vision and the infrastructure of an institution must be closely connected and interwoven.</p>

		<p>Uniting Thought Leadership <br>
Within the past few years, online learning has proved to be a viable solution for instruction and bringing new and innovative learning experiences to more students. “If done correctly, digital learning and remote education can provide countless opportunities for institutions,” says Gaul. “More and more students prefer these options and we must avoid silos being formed between in-person and remote learning without anything connecting the two. The role of learning space design is to connect IT and academic affairs, as well as successfully pulling in a 21st century learning approach to instructional design and teaching. When designing academic programs and curriculum, institutions must incorporate IT needs and initiatives—and vice versa—when IT is evaluating technology and designing solutions, they must include the academic mindset and the pedagogical needs of the instructors and students. To create a successful technology roadmap, the academic vision and the infrastructure of an institution must be closely connected and interwoven.”</p>
<p>“Edge can partner with institutions to not only help put the puzzle pieces in place for creating a learning environment that meets the needs and expectations of today’s learners, but can also give you a view around the corner,” shares Markham. “We could have never predicted the pandemic or the impact such an event had on our lives, but it certainly has shown us that anything can happen and that we must be united in how we approach transforming the industry to meet this changing tide.

		<p>Faced with a number of barriers to data access and use, Villanova University knew that change was required in order to meet the data and analytics goals included in their updated strategic plan. Villanova had multiple source systems and tools, siloed data, no university-wide data warehouse, and a focus on operational reporting. With the goal of developing a foundation for an improved data infrastructure, data governance and creating a culture of data-informed decision making, Villanova needed a plan and a partner. However, even once key issues were identified and a plan was in place, COVID would upend and delay progress on their initiative.</p>
<p>Several triggers led to the launch of Villanova’s data journey, including frustration among business users, college deans, senior administrators, and the provost in getting accurate data and information in a timely manner for decision making. “Data stewards who were working with the data and pulling information from other source systems were dissatisfied with the tools that were available to generate reports,” explains Dr. Trina Das, Assistant Vice Provost, Office of Decision Support and Data Integrity, Villanova University. “Some were old, decommissioned tools that were not well supported. The newer tools lacked training resources and support, and none of them gained traction in usability for the data stewards. More recently, there was heightened concern among our leadership around data accuracy, especially in relation to the external agencies, including iPads, accreditation bodies, and ranking agencies, and providing vetted, peer-reviewed data.”</p>
<p>Prior to COVID, Villanova was completing their strategic plan and moving on to the next phase of planning. During these discussions, the main focus was the enhanced use of technology, data, and analytics to support decision making. “There was awareness and push from many directions to address these issues and these conversations led to a five-phased Villanova strategy,” shares Das. “The strategy begins with a planning and discovery phase, which allows for an assessment of our current data landscape, including identifying our challenges and what is working and what is not in the process. From this, we created a roadmap which outlined the most relevant and immediate need for the University. This led to the discussion for our data platform and governance initiative and then ultimately, the concept of change management, which we are embarking upon this year.”</p>
<p>Gathering Insight<br>
In the spring of 2019, the Office of the Provost reached out to Das, asking her to participate in a 6-month exploratory project, partnered with one of her colleagues in enrollment management. The project conducted an internal scoping of the data landscape at Villanova, specifically exploring the challenges, risks, opportunities, and recommended next steps for the process. “The goal was to provide recommendations for developing the foundation for improved data infrastructure and governance, a culture of data-informed decision making, and an operational framework that would be best suited for the University,” says Das. “We had two paths of exploration. One was our internal constituents, where we spoke to data people within every business area and college at Villanova to better understand the key issues they face. We also looked at our peer institution and other institutions to create a list of fifteen organizations that were ahead of us in this data journey and could provide a positive example for how we could move toward the future.”</p>
<p>Through this investigation, Villanova was able to gather several useful insights and identify the key issues that need to be addressed. “At the time, data operations was extremely decentralized,” explains Das. “We have so many source systems feeding data and have multiple reporting tools, which creates challenges for choosing which one to use, what’s the training, and who to ask. Plus, we faced data access and sharing challenges. Due to the decentralized nature of our operations, every business area handled their own data, and without interconnectedness, the crosspollination of data was not exactly happening. This setup leaves room for operational inefficiencies and inconsistencies and we had challenges replicating information. For example, looking at the whole student’s societal life cycle, the person starts as an applicant, then graduates and becomes an alumnus. We want to know if they’re donating; what is the profile of those donors? All of this information was in different systems. We wished to create a process that would make this exercise more efficient and seamless, so that we spend more time analyzing the data, instead of collecting and merging that information.”</p>
<p>Like Villanova, many institutions across the industry struggle with the lack of proper documentation and data definitions and lineage. “We are trying to improve process documentation and ensure that if someone leaves the University or changes roles, their knowledge does not depart with them,” explains Das. “Lastly, we looked to create a single source of truth, or a place where there are data snapshots and you can replicate information. All of these key issues led to the main pillars of our data strategy and how we can better recognize and maximize the use of institutional data as a strategic University asset.”</p>
<p>Creating a Strategy<br>
Upon reviewing the key issues and data challenges facing the institution, Villanova recognized the importance of a data strategy that would help them overcome the hurdles and make more informed decisions for the entire university. “We knew we must lay the foundation for creating an improved and sustainable data infrastructure,” says Das. “A central data environment would help reduce our vulnerabilities, improve our operational efficiencies, and ensure accuracy and accountability for data for internal and external reporting. The platform would bring together data from disparate sources for consistency, transparency, and accessibility. We look to foster a culture of data sharing and data-informed decision making, and Villanova continues to make great progress in this area.”</p>
<p>On the operational side, one of Villanova’s goals includes improving data management and the reporting and analytics platform for University data stewards. “What we are building must not only serve one purpose, but multiple purposes,” explains Das. “The infrastructure must not only meet analytical needs, but allow for some operational needs as well. We also look to create an environment that promotes succession planning for business units and includes training documentation and data definitions.”</p>

		<p>Identifying Key Initiatives<br>
At the end of the exploratory project, Villanova identified three institutional initiatives that would drive their data journey.&nbsp; The first was deciding upon a comprehensive data management and analytics platform that would include a data warehouse/lake, ETL (extract, transform and load) layer, and data visualization tools. Secondly, the institution wished to establish a university-wide data governance framework. Thirdly, Villanova decided to create a new organization under the Office of the Provost to manage the first two initiatives and implement a more centralized data management process. “The Office was charged with advancing a culture of data sharing, data stewardship, and data-informed decision making,” says Das. “A team member from our registrar’s office and I created this new department and we began by putting together a request for proposal (RFP) for a comprehensive data management analytic solution. This RFP was sent out to five vendors in December 2019 and we had a team of eight to evaluate the proposals and we brought in colleagues from different areas of the University to review the platforms with us.”</p>
<p>The evaluation was completed in May 2020, but the pandemic caused Villanova to direct their focus on other immediate needs. “Everything came to a stop,” recalls Das. “You have a plan and then suddenly COVID happened. Our provost said we had to press pause on the platform project but tasked me with finding a way to keep moving the mission of the University forward. We began by converting our factbooks and other relevant reports, which are a very rich source of data, into interactive dashboards. I felt this could give our internal constituents in the University community a glimpse into the future and how easily we can make data available to them to interact with and compare information. I believe we stayed true to helping advance the culture of data sharing and I’ve heard from many areas how much they leverage and enjoy these dashboards.”</p>
<p>Despite timing being later than anticipated due to the pandemic, Villanova moved forward and awarded the contract in July 2021 to HelioCampus. “We decided to partner with HelioCampus for a variety of reasons, first being their expertise and experience in higher education,” shares Das. “They understand the terminology and project goals of this industry and offer a comprehensive approach and technology solution. They could set up the whole environment with an entire suite of student information, including data from admissions, financial aid, course registrations, and student outcome—giving us a tremendous jumpstart. To do this internally would have taken us years and many institutions do not understand the scale of this work and how complicated this undertaking can be for an organization. HelioCampus also provides continued analytics and consulting support beyond the implementation phase.”</p>
<p>While Villanova is not an Edge member or EdgeMarket participant, they kindly joined the Edge team and a robust roster of Edge member attendees for a special webinar session titled Villanova University’s Data Journey: From Challenges Identified to Implementation. By sharing their story, Villanova served as a model for institutions thinking about how to approach a data analytics program from scratch, including selecting a partner like HelioCampus.</p>
<p>Takeaways and Lessons Learned<br>
To further help implement the data strategy, Villanova also established Data Governance committees, the first in November 2020 and the second in spring 2022. “Since the fall of 2020, we have met every month to discuss the policies, and we have three draft policies being sent to the President’s cabinet for approval. Throughout this process, we have gained valuable insight into the elements that lead to a successful data strategy. First is executive sponsorship and support. Without this piece, moving the needle becomes very challenging, especially without critical funding decisions and buy-ins from leadership. I would also encourage institutions to engage key campus leaders, even if they are not in the immediate scope of the platform. Representation from non-academic areas like human resources and finance prevent potential future bottlenecks and involving them for the very start allows you to create a universal central data repository.”</p>
<p>In addition to buy-in from key players throughout the organization who can champion your overall vision and the importance of the initiative, Das says the institution and vendor need to be flexible and maintain open communication. “As you encounter a misalignment of expectations as you go through the project goals, you must find a middle ground to ensure success. The key is to communicate and have a mutual understanding. We have been very fortunate with HelioCampus, who are extremely flexible and have navigated this process with us. By partnering with a vendor who could propel the initiative forward, we prevent the chance of becoming sidetracked by other priorities. We were able to hook people into the value proposition and the potential of a platform like this and show the value add it brings to the university’s decision-making process. We will continue to build beyond the scope of our initial implementation scope and successfully address these additions gradually with internal training and resources. Thankfully, the initial jumpstart was completed quickly, successfully, and without any derailments—moving us forward in this exciting data journey.”</p>

		<p>As technology and connectivity continue to diffuse into all areas of our lives, especially within the education community, having a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy will be of the utmost importance. In the K-12 space, students are accessing the Internet on a daily basis and using digital devices both inside and outside of the classroom. Unfortunately, without proper protection in place, the safety of the students and institution are at risk. “During the pandemic, we saw a 3,000-percent increase in cybersecurity attacks within the state of New Jersey alone,” says Christopher Markham, Vice President for Information Technology &amp; Economic Advancement, Edge.</p>
<p>To help organizations become better informed about cybersecurity and how to mitigate risk within an educational institution, Edge is presenting Tech Talk sessions at tech events around the state. “Increasing cybersecurity awareness and shifting security cultures from reactive to proactive are fundamentally important to our K-12 members,” explains Michelle Ferraro, Member Account Manager, Edge. “Each county has an IT Tech group that meets every couple of months depending on which county you are in. Edge has been offering free Zoom or in-person meetings with one of our chief information security officers (CISO) to discuss cybersecurity concerns, answer questions, and share advice on how to reduce expensive insurance policies.”</p>
<p>The hour-long Tech Talk sessions welcome IT directors, business administrators, and superintendents; ensuring all areas of an organization are able to become better informed with the insight and guidance they need to drive cybersecurity initiatives. “The technology curve is very dramatic and changes quickly,” says Markham. “As thought leaders, Edge is ahead of that curve and is dedicated to helping member institutions keep pace with technology and the changes happening in this digital era.”</p>

		<p>Assessing and Improving Security Measures<br>
Following a Tech Talk session, the CISO will share how to reduce insurance costs and ways to address various needs, including filling specific gaps in staffing and security domain expertise required to strengthen the district’s security posture. “Depending on the organization’s needs and current security profile, we may recommend a security assessment at nonprofit rates,” says Ferraro. “The Security Program Assessment draws on our collective expertise to deliver tailored, actionable recommendations to improve your security posture, reduce risk, and mitigate the impact of security incidents. Our virtual CISO (vCISO) will take the time to interview staff, review policies and procedures, determine risk appetite, identify weaknesses, and provide detailed, actionable recommendations to improve your security program.” Depending on an organization’s needs and current security profile, Edge may recommend one or more solutions to assist in addressing vulnerabilities. A vCISO can also augment an organization’s internal team to help identify and implement viable information security strategies and policies to improve security effectiveness and ensure regulatory and compliance requirements are being followed.</p>
<p>Edge’s Security Program Assessment evaluates the maturity of an organization’s security program based on National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), identifies gaps, and provides an incremental roadmap to improve the overall security posture of the organization. “We also offer Cybersecurity Health Check Programs that deliver monthly assessments, based on NIST standards, to identify possible vulnerabilities before they become a threat,” explains Ferraro. “In addition, our CISO offers consultant services to create incident response plans (IRP) and disaster recovery (DR) plans with testing to make sure our K-12 members have these protections in place.”</p>

		<p>Addressing Vulnerabilities<br>
A CISO plays an essential role in IT leadership, balancing information security, risk, and general business challenges, but not every organization has the ability to hire a CISO full time. “If a district realizes that formalizing and implementing&nbsp; a cybersecurity program is essential, but has challenges staffing the leadership position—whether it be budgetary issues or identifying and attracting talent—Edge is here to help fill that role and offer the guidance needed to be successful,” says Ferraro.</p>
<p>Keeping education districts’ budgets in mind, Edge offers vCISO services at a cost-effective rate where organizations can utilize expert guidance for a few hours, on a per-project basis, or as a full-time staff augmentation. “Edge looks to provide an executive-level information security resource to our K-12 members in a convenient and affordable way,” says Ferraro. “By proactively evaluating current IT processes, programs, and infrastructure for security integrity, institutions will be better positioned to remediate vulnerabilities and confidently protect the integrity of their students and organization.”</p>

  Elon Musk has proposed to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share, with the social media giant having approximately 765 million outstanding shares.  Most Web3 platforms use Twitter to make official announcements and keep their communities well-informed.  Speculations are that Musk will make Dogecoin a form of payment on the Twitter platform.  
 



<p>After months of court cases, Elon Musk has reportedly drafted a proposal to acquire Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) at the original price of $44 billion. According to a report by media outlet Bloomberg, Musk and his legal team filed a purchase proposal after ongoing court cases showed no signs of favouring them in the end. Moreover, an acquisition proposal will end the ongoing court battle cases in less than a month.</p>



<p>Notably, Musk previously halted Twitter acquisitions following reports of more than reported bots. Nevertheless, the tech billionaire has shown great interest in purchasing Twitter and making it a Web3 space.</p>



<p>Following the announcement by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-04/musk-proposes-to-proceed-with-twitter-deal-at-54-20-a-share?sref=3REHEaVI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, Twitter shares gained as much as 22 per cent on Tuesday to trade at around $47.93 at publication time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Musk has reportedly proposed purchasing Twitter at $54.20 per share, with the social media giant having approximately 765 million outstanding shares.</p>



 Twitter and the Web3 Development&nbsp; 



<p>According to market data from <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/twtr?mod=search_symbol">MarketWatch</a>, Twitter has a market capitalisation of approximately $32.55 billion. Despite the stock market and crypto industry shrinking in the past year, Twitter shares have gained approximately 10 and 24 per cent YTD and one month, respectively.</p>



<p>Most Web3 platforms use Twitter to make official announcements and keep their communities well-informed. Furthermore, the social media giant has a global reach and is now likely to be purchased by one of the most wealthy tech entrepreneurs.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Twitter is probably going to say, ‘look, we definitely want to engage you on this … But we’ve still got a trial on Oct 17 and until this is signed, sealed and delivered, we’ve got to get ready for trial,” noted Columbia Law School professor Eric Talley.</p></blockquote>



<p>Speculations are that Musk will make Dogecoin a form of payment on the Twitter platform. Furthermore, the social media giant company has many customers using Web3 and blockchain technology. Hereby giving hopes to the Meme coin leader, Dogecoin, of possible future global utility.</p>



<p>Twitter and blockchain technology have intertwined in the past following a receptive leadership by Jack Dorsey. Late last year, the company launched a cryptocurrency team to explore the use cases of blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Last year, Dorsey sold his first tweet as a non-fungible token (NFT) worth approximately $2.9 million.</p>



 Side Notes&nbsp; 



<p>The decentralised blockchain technology has been a significant development in the last decade. Post-Covid pandemic, most global businesses are scaling using blockchain technology in conjunction with the cryptocurrency market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Musk, who founded <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> before selling it to start his current businesses, has shown significant interest in Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market through the support of <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/dogecoin-price-prediction/">Dogecoin</a>.</p>



<p>Returning Twitter to a privately held company has been described as the best way to save the platform from global government influence. Nonetheless, the deal may head south due to Musk’s unpredictable moves.</p>

		<p>Digital transformation efforts generally begin with a view of the business processes, workflows, and systems that enable an institution to more efficiently conduct business. “Oftentimes, institutions are approaching the concept of digital transformation backwards and look for the software to solve a business problem, when in fact, the approach should be the other way around,” explains Samuel Conn, Ph.D, President and Chief Executive Officer, Edge. “When you talk about the concept of enterprise information systems architecture, you first align and optimize your business processes, and then once those are documented, that documentation of your business processes is used to select and configure the appropriate software to enable those processes.”</p>
<p>One potential approach to lowering an institution’s operating expenses is to implement business process management practices—strategies which for-profit businesses have successfully used to lower operational expenses for decades. “Higher education lags behind traditional for-profit businesses in deploying business process management,” says Mark Meara, Ed.D., Vice President of Technical Operations and Chief Information Officer. “The practice of business process management seeks to improve or change these processes to enhance an organization’s products, services, effectiveness, and efficiency,”</p>
<p>“In the digital economy,” Meara continues, “Organizations experienced significant pressures from both economic and competition perspectives. These challenges are forcing organizations that wish to not only survive, but also thrive, to evaluate and improve their business processes. Historically, there was less pressure on institutions of higher education to be profitable; therefore, they only began evaluating the performance and improvement of their business processes around the year 2000, much after the business sector. Higher education institutions may not have business process modeling and notation skill sets readily available on staff, but they can leverage organizations such as Edge to provide such resources.”</p>
<p>Assessing Current and Future State Processes<br>
Edge has recently enhanced their EdgeDx Professional Services to better help member institutions optimize their business processes and achieve operational efficiency at every level of the student lifecycle. “EdgeDx has shifted toward a stronger focus on digital transformation and reengineering topologies that have better integration and interoperability with cloud services,” explains Conn. “EdgeDx combines four of our services: professional, security, digital learning, and cloud services, and we have experts available who are well versed in business process modeling. We can help model how things are being done currently and present this in a visual format on an engineering diagram. By thoroughly mapping out processes, we can see where the opportunities exist to eliminate redundancy, increase efficiency, and optimize the process so that it’s working smoothly and at the lowest level of friction within the organization.”</p>
<p>Meara adds, “Edge can also assist CIOs to be strategic within their institutions and transform themselves as business experts who specialize in IT, not as IT experts who position themselves as business experts. Edge can partner with its member CIOs to expedite and manage change by conducting various assessments (e.g., E360, Cloud readiness, cybersecurity, Business Process Improvement, etc.), but it doesn’t end there. We can also provide the resources necessary to leverage the assessments and fuel the necessary changes to achieve true digital transformation on the institutional level.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				       
	 
		 
		 
			
 
	 
		<p>“Assistance from an experienced cloud architecture team is vital in ensuring that the proposed cloud solution meets the institution’s immediate and future needs, and that the migration goes smoothly. While all cloud platforms offer services which aim to replicate on-prem services in a more scalable way, the creation and management of resources within these services always involves cloud-specific nuances the navigation of which an experienced cloud architect is a huge value add in.”</p>

		<p>Reviewing Complex Business Processes<br>
Edge recently partnered with the New Jersey President’s Council (NJPC) Academic Issues Committee (AIC) to review and optimize their business processes to improve operational efficiency. The Committee helps address educational, research, and administrative issues within the education community and reviews proposals for new academic programs that could be beneficial to colleges and universities within the State. They ensure a proposed program is not redundant or conflicting with other programs and that the features and functions meet the demands of the marketplace. Throughout the articulated workflow and complex business process, the NJPC shares the collected data across the Council to determine if the program can advance to the next steps in the process.</p>
<p>Like any procedure with many moving parts that evolve over time, inefficiencies arose and the need for a more coordinated approach was necessary. The NJPC/AIC chair reached out to Edge to discuss their important review process and how they could improve the overall efficiency, while addressing current pain points. “The NJPC/AIC was aware of Edge’s expertise in business process redesign and reengineering efforts and was interested in fully documenting the process as it is today, and then creating a suggested future state process,” explains recently-retired Ed Chapel, Ph.D., Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Operating Officer, Edge. “The goal would be to re-document and create a more streamlined and efficient process that was more time and cost effective.”</p>
<p>Redesigning Business Processes<br>
Since the NJPC business process had some disconnects and there was no automation, institutions were submitting program proposals to the AIC via email. Without a consistent contact list, managing the process was very difficult and time consuming, there was no consistency in how programs were submitted, and not all institutions were getting notified when a new program was announced. The NJPC wanted to organize and standardize a process where all institutions were submitting forms and getting notified in a systematic way. To assist the AIC, Edge convened a committee that consisted of Dr. Chapel, Donna Rogalski, Ed.D., Assistant Director for Academic Programs: Office of the Secretary of Higher Education, and Allison Samay, Executive Director at New Jersey Presidents’ Council. “Donna and Allison provided important input on all the moving parts of the process and would reach into their organizations to clarify the finer points,” says Chapel. “A consultant for Edge, Stephanie Thomas, is also part of the committee and leads the business process redesign efforts. She documented the current state process and then added components where areas could be improved. She is second to none and has been an outstanding member of the team.”</p>
<p>To gain all the necessary, in-depth details of an institution’s process, Stephanie met with the stakeholders to map out every single step in as much detail as possible. “I get to meet with the people who are in the trenches doing the day-to-day work,” says Thomas. “We create a workflow diagram providing all details and technology notation in a universal language. Over multiple meetings, we then map out each individual task with all the different stakeholders. This helps us visually document all of the pieces and allows us to see the different perspectives and where they’re connected. I always tell an institution that they’re the brains and I’m just the hands. I facilitate and guide them through the process while they tell the story. This is an extremely visual process and you will be able to see it take shape and create an end product that delivers the automation and technology needed to serve your needs.”</p>
<p>Thomas continues, “In the end, we have a beautiful blueprint schematic diagram that shows the entire process including where technical intervention is required. For example, where a form is introduced in the process, what elements are included on that form, any communication that follows up on that form, and the kind of response that is sent to the user once the form is submitted. Edge can then take the blueprint diagram to a vendor showing the current and future state process with every step documented. On this project, after just a one-hour meeting with the vendor, they were able to create an in-depth demo based on the diagram and were able to start programming.”</p>

		<p>Selecting Software Solutions<br>
The streamlined process was shared with all of the NJPC stakeholders who affirmed that the new method met all their goals and objectives. They also used the insights to revise the user’s manual for generating an academic program proposal. During the business process redesign, several of the issues that were identified could be remedied with a software-based workflow automation solution. “The two-tiered effort of the AIC was to revise the process and then select a software solution that everyone could use to complete the process, while maintaining a proper communications protocol and providing access to managed lists stored in a common repository,” explains Chapel. “This ensures no missed steps in the collection of information, whether it is uploaded, downloaded, printed, or distributed.”</p>
<p>A current software partner of Edge, GRM Information Management, is a leading provider of information management systems and their solution, VisualVault® content services platform, is a cloud-based configurable workflow automation tool. VisualVault solutions automate inefficient manual processes and transform data and document-intensive processes to deliver dramatic increases in efficiency and valuable data-based insights via an advanced analytics suite. “Edge on behalf of the AIC is currently working with GRM to clarify the non-recurring costs of the implementation, as well as the recurring cost of the subscriptions for this program as it rolls out to the broader community of users,” says Chapel. “Through this process, the NJPC project team received a crash course in business process reengineering and quickly came to appreciate the value of reviewing every minute detail and identifying all of the places that were illogical, inefficient, or ineffective. This gives the opportunity to take a step back and look at the process that has been conducted for many years and find ways to make valuable improvements.”</p>
<p>Since Edge understands the process involved in digital transformation and the business process re-engineering, the cultural aspects of change management, and the role of business process modeling and notation in doing so, member institutions can tap into this expertise to make changes at their own organizations. “I believe seeing the end result of an automated improved workflow will resonate with organizations and make very clear the value of a business process redesign informed digital transformation,” shares Chapel. “In particular, this business process redesign can be very impactful when examining the prospect to enrolled student process for new full-time students and transfers and can help improve the overall student experience of this process.”</p>
<p>Successfully Migrating to the Cloud<br>
An important EdgeDx service that helps organizations improve operational efficiency includes cloud assessments and creating an effective cloud migration strategy. These assessments can help an institution simplify cloud migration and management by evaluating existing infrastructure and developing a strategy for migrating workloads and applications to the public and private clouds, as well as software as a service (SaaS) solutions. “Edge has the ability to help institutions digitally transform through the business reengineering process into seamless cloud technology that is multi-cloud and has interoperability between those clouds,” says Conn. “The world is changing quickly and the technology that allows institutions to run virtualized servers on campus is moving to the Cloud, and since it is a SaaS, will be a service model and will require a subscription. There is a sense of urgency where every institution should be evaluating if they are ready to successfully move to the Cloud and determining if they have all the elements in place.”</p>
<p>“Cloud Architecture involves using on-demand cloud components in lieu of traditional IT paradigms,” adds Polina Smirnova, Network Engineer, Edge. “The benefits to a consumer include very low upfront cost, on-demand scalability, and a potential for IT topology simplification. Creating an effective cloud migration plan involves assessing current IT topology (i.e. compute and storage needs). Assistance from an experienced cloud architecture team is vital in ensuring that the proposed cloud solution meets the institution’s immediate and future needs, and that the migration goes smoothly. While all cloud platforms offer services which aim to replicate on-prem services in a more scalable way, the creation and management of resources within these services always involves cloud-specific nuances the navigation of which an experienced cloud architect is a huge value add in.”</p>
<p>To determine the state of readiness and to create a cloud migration strategy, Conn says organizations must evaluate several elements. “You must review your data governance, information systems architecture, the level of virtualization you have with your servers and data, the location of your identity and access management and system, and the architecture needs to be re-architected into multi-cloud topology. In addition, it’s important to note that an organization’s disaster recovery strategy will be replaced because data protection will now occur in the Cloud. Edge provides all of these services, as well as having certified web architects, solution engineers, project planning experts, and vendor relationships that can help streamline the entire process.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				       
	 
		 
		 
			
 
	 
		<p>“Organizations experienced significant pressures from both economic and competition perspectives. These challenges are forcing organizations that wish to not only survive, but also thrive, to evaluate and improve their business processes. Historically, there was less pressure on institutions of higher education to be profitable; therefore, they only began evaluating the performance and improvement of their business processes around the year 2000, much after the business sector. Higher education institutions may not have business process modeling and notation skill sets readily available on staff, but they can leverage organizations such as Edge to provide&nbsp; such resources.”</p>

		<p>Helping Drive Cultural Change<br>
Moving to the Cloud and updating business processes is a cultural change that is required across an entire institution; leading to a new way of thinking and doing business. “Taking this journey leads to fundamental changes in the planning process, so how an institution budgets, how they plan their time, and how they organize support will all evolve,” says Conn. “These changes can occur rapidly too, so we encourage organizations to take advantage of our cloud migration readiness assessment. Over three to four days, we meet with key stakeholders and collect data, and come back with a report on the state of readiness for cloud migration and can offer recommendations for improvements. Even if an institution does not have a plan in place, Edge can help create a strategy that will get them successfully to the Cloud within one to two years.”</p>
<p>EdgeDx assessments employ a results-driven methodology designed to maximize efficiency and enable digital transformation within an institution. The E360 assessment provides a 360-degree view of an institution’s current-state technology program and will map how the IT strategy should evolve to accomplish the mission and vision of the organization. “The Edge team will support your organization’s digital transformation, enabling you to optimize processes and create positive student and staff experiences,” says Conn. “By augmenting your team with a variety of resources, we can help you drive cultural change within your organization, boost cloud migration readiness, and help your institution remain competitive well into the future.”</p>

		 Achieving Harmony In Your Technology Ecosystem 
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Creating a successful roadmap for digital transformation often begins with an in-depth look at an institution’s current technology and cyber infrastructure. Through this analysis, an organization can determine how best to modernize their IT strategy to help achieve an institutional mission and business initiatives. To aid member institutions in this complex endeavor, Edge performs a valuable service called an Enterprise 360 (E360) Assessment. The evaluation provides a holistic, 360-degree view of an institution’s current-state technology program and digital footprint and reviews all aspects of technology operations; investment and costs; service, software and hardware; cybersecurity; and educational technology.</p>
<p>While Edge has been assisting member institutions in the development of their technology strategies for years, the need for a comprehensive service like E360 became evident. By taking a 360-degree inventory and assessment of an organization’s technology investments, Edge can help determine whether these investments in equipment, staff, and software are optimal for achieving organizational goals and objectives. Oftentimes, the types of technology investments that have been made are mismatched with an institution’s own size, capabilities, mission, and objectives. With Edge’s thought leadership and breadth of consultative expertise across technology domains, member institutions can gain valuable insight into the operational integrity and appropriateness of their current technology ecosystem. Several Edge member institutions have already benefited from E360 assessments including, but not limited to, Bloomfield College, Felician University, Georgian Court University (GCU), and William Jewell College.</p>
<p>Assessing Digital Transformation Readiness<br>
The big picture view provided by the E360 Assessment allows an organization to see their institutional organism in its entirety and all the interactions between tech capability and whether their business needs and strategies can be successfully executed. When conducting an E360 analysis, the EdgePro team will focus on a variety of technology-related domains that impact digital transformation readiness, including current managerial finance and economic approaches within IT, cybersecurity capacity and capability, and an institution’s entire technology stack. Similarly to the importance of a doctor performing bloodwork in order to make a diagnosis, the E360 allows data to be collected and tested against the industry standards and best practices of business and technology science for IT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most important goals of the E360 is ensuring strategic technology plans, including contracts and terms for services, are creating a technology operating environment with the best possible return on investment. To begin an assessment, the Edge team typically reviews all documentation and contractual terms of an institution’s technology investments, as well as monitoring and performing a traffic analysis. This is followed by a two-day onsite visit to meet with stakeholders and representatives from each functional and academic area during standard business hours. This approach allows for a broad and deep exploration of an institution’s technology program, as well as viewing the aspects that relate not just to technology, but to the functional knowledge, skill, and efforts of the organization and whether they are effectively being facilitated by technology.</p>
<p>Balancing the Technology Ecosystem<br>
Many higher education organizations commonly have clusters of technology activity and investments can become disjointed to fulfill these focused needs. As part of the assessment, the E360 service reviews technology needs and capabilities across campus and ensures that an IT strategy allows all areas to work in harmony in the most optimal and streamlined process possible. Upon completion of the assessment, the organization will receive a diagnostic and prescriptive report, including an executive summary that outlines which aspects of an institution’s current technology and cyber infrastructure need immediate attention and the recommendations for accelerating the organization’s ability to drive business goals.</p>

		<p>In addition, the assessment can conduct a knowledge and skills matrix, where an organization can identify any gaps of where they may need to backfill existing vacancies or places where they are overloading personnel with responsibilities of mission critical importance. By taking inventory and properly aligning their personnel to the highest priority and best-fit items, an organization can efficiently synchronize their workforce with their IT needs. Institutions can also identify operational efficiencies through the E360 that allow them to migrate workloads to cloud services and adopt virtualization strategies to help unburden their staff. Edge aims to assist organizations in identifying investments that will modernize their technology solutions and implementations, while achieving operating efficiency in the process.</p>
<p>The actionable items provided from an E360 focus on remediation, acceleration, and transformation, and creating a roadmap for technology that moves in concert with the organization’s strategic plan. Most importantly, the solutions suggested in the assessment to achieve this mission are all encompassing as well. Through EdgeMarket, organizations can find the solutions and consortium-based pricing needed to help address the issues uncovered through the E360. Edge procures and curates the solutions and services that are available on the open market on behalf of its member institutions—helping organizations gain access to current technologies at an affordable price.</p>

		 Not sure about your institution’s cloud migration strategy? 
<p>Cloud Computing Development Models&nbsp;<br>
Four cloud computing development models are currently acknowledged: (i) public cloud, (ii) private cloud, (iii) community cloud, and (iv) hybrid/multi cloud. Accordingly, public cloud computing can result in security risks not associated with private cloud computing. Public clouds involve a public service provider who offers free or pay-per-service fee structures. Using the Internet for connectivity, public cloud providers operate and maintain the infrastructure. Private clouds normally involve hosting by a single provider to deliver one or more service models to the organization. Community cloud models involve shared infrastructure among communities with similar interests (e.g., information security) such that cost sharing is possible. Hybrid/multi clouds can be hosted by a combination of public, private, and community cloud models where end-users can enjoy the benefits of all three.</p>
<p>If an academic institution operates only one production network with access to existing cloud computing resources, testing and experimentation, instruction, and prototype development of online program information technologies and systems are difficult. The academic institution requires clear separation of development, test, and production environments from which to operate stable online program administrative and academic application environments, yet accommodate the instructional, research, and development needs of faculty and students involved in online computing and information sciences.</p>
<p>What network topology best facilitates use of a cloud computing paradigm in support of online research and education? Cloud resources can exist and reside in an academic institution’s central data center, managed host facility, or co-located computing center. Students and faculty in each aforementioned area require distinct technological environments to accommodate online course computing, experiential learning, action research, and applied instruction.</p>
<p>The Evolution of Cloud Computing&nbsp;<br>
The term cloud computing represents a continuation of past computing paradigms and has evolved progressively over the past 19 years since the term was introduced by Ramnath Chellappa, Associate Professor of Management Information Systems at Emory University. In 1997, building on seminal concepts of computation as a “public service” or “public utility” put forth by John McCarthy, Chellappa joined an existing telecommunications industry term (cloud) used to describe large Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks with the notion of ubiquitous computing. Thus, the term is used to describe older concepts in new ways.</p>
<p>Moreover, technology thought-leaders note the emergence of a meta-university concept that works in concert with a cloud computing paradigm. The term meta-university describes the future concept of higher education as a transcendent, accessible, empowering, dynamic, communally constructed framework of open materials and platforms on which much of higher education worldwide can be constructed or enhanced. Cloud computing works in concert with the sharing of knowledge and resources, a millennium-refined value of academia.</p>
<p>As a computing model, cloud computing follows traditional topological norms such as mainframe, client-server, distributed, multi-processing, n-tier, and grid computing, yet yields potential to support next generation computing paradigms. Accordingly, cloud computing represents the most significant advancement in information technology since the elevation of the global Internet network. Following mainframe computing, personal computing, client-server computing, and the World Wide Web, cloud computing is considered by many to be the fifth major paradigm shift in computing. Academic institutions continue to embrace the paradigm as a means of: (a) improving return-on-investment for technology infrastructure, (b) improving resource sharing, (c) enabling interactivity, collaboration and innovation among stakeholders of Web content and resources in online programs, (d) supporting mobile computing and e-learning, and (e) delivering virtual online environments.</p>
<p>Cloud Computing Architecture<br>
Cloud computing architecture involves three service model abstractions: (a) infrastructure as a service (IaaS), (b) platform as a Service (PaaS), and (c) Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS layers servers, storage, and network infrastructure into a pool of computing, storage, and connectivity capabilities that are delivered via the network as services that provide a flexible, standard, and virtualized operating environment. IaaS can be used to establish a foundation for PaaS and SaaS.</p>
<p>Normally, IaaS provides a standardized virtual machine hosted on a server cluster. IaaS consumers have responsibility for configuration and operations of the Operating System (OS), software, and Database (DB). Network delivered services (such as performance, bandwidth, and storage access) also can be maintained via service management strategies that cover the performance and availability of the virtualized infrastructure.</p>
<p>PaaS provides executable environments such application runtimes, storage, and application integration. Moreover, PaaS provides an efficient and agile method to instantiate scale-out applications in a predictable and cost-efficient manner. Information Technology service levels and operational risks are mutual as a result of the consumer taking responsibility for the stability, architectural compliance, and overall operations of the application while the provider delivers the platform capability.</p>
<p>SaaS provides business processes and applications (e.g., Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, Student Information System (SIS) systems, e-mail, groupware, and/or collaboration tools) as services where the provider assumes all operational risks. Significant delivery and cost efficiencies are possible as all infrastructure and information technologies are abstracted away from the consumer.</p>
<p>Cloud infrastructure is typically supported by block storage in the form of direct attached storage (DAS), network attached storage (NAS), or a storage area network (SAN). Additionally, server clusters to support virtual machines (VMs), and in some cases high-end computing devices, are all considered part of cloud infrastructure. Centers hosting cloud infrastructure (e.g., computing centers or data centers) can have managed host capability as a provider option. Secure and available network and internetworking components provide access to the cloud. Internetworking architecture can support cloud partners such as affiliated computing and data centers.</p>
<p>Cloud Computing in the Academic Environment&nbsp;<br>
Use of cloud computing within online higher education initiatives is proliferating. Prototype initiatives, such as seen at Okanagan College and the University of British Columbia Okanagan, King’s University College, University of California, Washington State University’s School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and North Carolina State University, reflect academic use and success with cloud computing paradigms. Accordingly, over the last few years higher education institutions have begun to transition to more research and ongoing updates of information technology infrastructure as a foundation for online education activities and science research.</p>
<p>Moreover, academic institutions are finding compatibility between cloud computing and other major academic initiatives. For example, note the use of cloud computing in support of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL); cloud computing in support of convergent models of instruction; cloud computing used in experiential and project-based learning; and cloud computing coupled with strategies to reduce the cost of education.</p>
<p>Cloud architecture is also associated with higher education institution challenges. Common challenges include technology limitations, interoperability issues, network capacity, end-user perceptions, and adoption of cloud computing concepts. Additionally, policy and control issues, demand for services, and legacy constraints represent challenges when moving to a cloud computing paradigm. Of similar concern, note that migration to cloud computing requires a well-defined strategy. Successful cloud computing initiatives are dependent on alignment of cloud computing capabilities with higher education research and education needs, as well as clearly stating the architectural vision for infrastructure, platform, and software service delivery.</p>

		<p>Edge’s new Chief Information Officer and Vice President for Technical Operations, Mark Meara, began his career over 35 years ago, after receiving an associate’s degree in architecture from Mercer County Community College. “I started my first professional job after graduation, working for a large architectural engineering firm in Princeton, New Jersey,” says Meara. “The firm was one of the first adopters of computer aided design and drafting (CADD) technology and I was assigned to be a CADD draftsperson. I took to this role like a fish to water and this led to me pursuing my bachelor’s degree in computer science and later, a doctorate degree in education. Instead of becoming an architect, I changed my career path and moved into a programer, network manager, and manager of IT roles. Interestingly, there are many similarities between architecture and IT. For example, both types of projects include requirements analysis, designing, building, and maintaining. I was able to apply basic principles from architecture into IT and they have served me well throughout my entire career.”</p>
<p>Looking at his professional experience as a whole, Meara says the first half was spent in various architectural, environmental, and IT consulting firms, and the second half was spent as a CIO with two New Jersey institutions in higher education. “This career path is why I feel the opportunity with Edge was a perfect fit. I’m able to bring a unique combination of consulting and higher education experience to the role and aid in Edge’s mission to inspire personal, professional, organizational, and social growth and development with technology transformation in the digital era. Edge is vital to the education community because these institutions will absolutely need to transform in these evolving times to stay viable and successful.”</p>
<p>Improving Efficiency and Effectiveness<br>
When pursuing his doctorate degree, Meara’s dissertation focused on critical success factors for business process management in New Jersey Community Colleges and he has applied this knowledge and experience throughout his career. “I believe the transformation needed within the higher education industry involves learning, growing, and transforming into being more efficient and effective business operations. Edge is the ideal preferred partner for education institutions and other member institutions because it enables organizations to be small at their core and large at their network. This network includes the digital network, but also an organization’s network of partners and resources. With enrollment at many institutions seeing a downward trend and funding being cut or lowered, organizations must keep their internal resources small, including their staff and network. Partnering with an organization like Edge allows institutions to create a larger presence and operation while keeping costs in check.”</p>
<p>As institutions continue to be asked to do more with less and face these challenges of decreasing enrollment and funding, Meara says looking to the Cloud can provide significant savings. “One primary reason why institutions should be considering cloud solutions is the economics of scale and expense savings that can be achieved. With moving systems from being on premise to the Cloud, there’s significant savings to be gained, both in staffing costs, as well as maintenance of equipment costs. These expense savings can be critical to an institution who is trying to maintain or lower their tuition and fees for students. In addition, students and faculty of today’s world require distinct technology environments and online course computing capabilities, especially at research institutions.”</p>
<p>Along with the academic benefits of cloud technology, the operational side of an institution can benefit from cloud computing as well. “Many systems can be cloud enabled and offer significant efficiencies to an institution,” explains Meara. “The enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that an institution’s operations are based upon, telephone systems, and building automation systems are just a few examples. Edge is here to assist in developing those strategies and adapting the Edge network to meet the institution’s specific cloud environment and needs.”</p>
<p>Cloud Migration Strategies<br>
Following mainframe computing, personal computing, client-server computing, and the World Wide Web, cloud computing is considered by many to be the fifth major paradigm shift in computing. Through cloud solutions, academic institutions are tackling tough challenges and propelling important initiatives forward. Cloud technology can offer many benefits to an organization, including improving return-on-investment for technology infrastructure; enabling interactivity, collaboration, and innovation among stakeholders; improving resource sharing; supporting mobile computing and e-learning; and delivering virtual online environments. Migrating to cloud computing takes a well-defined strategy, where successful initiatives are dependent on alignment of cloud computing capabilities with research and education needs. Additionally, institutions must have a clear architectural vision for infrastructure, platform, and software service delivery.</p>
<p>As organizations migrate to the Cloud, there are many different models and approaches to meet the unique set of requirements of each institution. “Just like in architecture, two people may have two unique visions for building a 4-bedroom house, where they are designed differently,” explained Meara. “Or one person wants a house, while another wants a condo. I use this analogy when discussing an institution’s approach to moving to the Cloud. For example, the cloud needs for a community college may be significantly different than a research institution. Edge can play the “architect” role and provide an organization with expertise and options. We can help its members adopt a cloud model and cloud implementation strategy that works best for them and meets their individual requirements.”</p>

The world was just becoming aware of and trying to understand the Internet and the World Wide Web. This was such an exciting time for us and our organization grew and won many awards. We were able to assist many organizations adopt new technologies and associated business strategies. During this transition, we saw entire business sectors dramatically transform, including the music industry, travel industry, and the world of real estate.

		<p>Leading the Charge<br>
The demands of today’s CIOs are vast and ever-changing, as the reliance on technology is pervasive across the entire enterprise. For up-and-coming CIOs who want to be successful in their respective careers, Meara says being business leaders within their institutions is essential to creating the most valuable impact. “CIOs need to drive transformation starting with the institution’s business process improvements and modernization, and into the strategy and innovation of the entire organization. The CIO needs to be the change agent for not only their institution, but for the entire education sector. Going into the future with the transformation that is happening in education, I can’t see a more important role than that of the CIO.”</p>
<p>Meara continues, “Even prior to the pandemic, the landscape in higher education was starting to change significantly. Ten years ago, disruptive technology was being introduced and that began to alter the education sector. COVID certainly accelerated this change; where some institutions were prepared to adapt, while others were not. Learning management systems and online learning models were adopted at many institutions decades ago, but weren’t fully embraced until the pandemic hit and everyone had to go online. As we ease back from a pandemic-focused world, we are starting to introduce higher-level, hybrid courses where students are learning in the classroom and from home. I don’t see us going back to pre-pandemic teaching and learning; I believe education has been changed permanently.”</p>
<p>Moving forward, there may be many institutions who fail to keep in stride with digital transformation and gain the network and technology capabilities necessary to support the new organization of higher education. “We will likely see more mergers and acquisitions of institutions, and as this occurs, they will transform their entire business model to be built upon cloud and network technology and their IT organization,” says Meara. “I reflect back to the mid 1990’s when I was an entrepreneur and had started a web consulting firm in Princeton with a few partners. The world was just becoming aware of and trying to understand the Internet and the World Wide Web. This was such an exciting time for us and our organization grew and won many awards. We were able to assist many organizations adopt new technologies and associated business strategies. During this transition, we saw entire business sectors dramatically transform, including the music industry, travel industry, and the world of real estate. I believe that we are on the cusp of this upheaval with the education community and I’m very excited to be part of another dramatic digital transformation.”</p>
<p>Meara says the traditional manner of compiling credentials and getting a degree has changed and will continue to evolve based on students’ needs and preferences. “I see more of the norm being hybrid learning with a slant towards more online courses than in-person classes. There is so much potential and change on the horizon and this is certainly going to be a challenging, but rewarding, time. In my new role at Edge, I’m looking forward to embracing these changes and leveraging my experience to be a value partner to all Edge members and helping them succeed in their digital transformation. I’m eager to step back into a consultative role and help tackle a diverse set of challenges, goals, and requirements, and help us all move into this new technological era together.”</p>

		<p>The unprecedented growth and need for digital learning has been seen across the education community, with many institutions seeking solutions and support that could address the changing needs of their students and staff. To help members accelerate their online learning capabilities and integrate instructional design best practices as their organizations move forward, Edge has expanded their Digital Learning and Collaboration solution, EdgeLearn. “At the beginning of the pandemic, many institutions were seeking assistance with remote learning and faculty and student development, and needed to move online quickly at an unexpected time,” explains Josh Gaul, Edge’s Associate Vice President and Chief Digital Learning Officer. “To help ease this transition, we expanded our suite of technology solutions, and now have integrated these professional services into our EdgeLearn solution. Institutions can partner with our seasoned experts to gain guidance on instructional design, course evaluation, learning space design, or creating a plan to achieve their digital transformation goals.”</p>
<p>Helping to Advance Online Learning<br>
By incorporating more instructional design and educational technology aspects into EdgeLearn, Edge aims to help member institutions create more innovative learning experiences for students and powerful teaching opportunities for educators. One way of accomplishing this goal is through course evaluation, included in the Edge Online Learning and Instructional Technology Acceleration (OLITA) program. OLITA is designed to deliver instructional design services and provide online learning experts who assist with course development, evaluation, and faculty development and training. Edge reviewers help evaluate courses based upon learning design and quality, while integrating best practices for infrastructure support, EdTech, student privacy, and cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Reviewing existing courses can be very time consuming and many organizations do not have the resources to devote to this process. Our advisors have their Applying the Quality Matters Rubric (APPQMR) certification and have a deep understanding of industry standard rubrics, like Quality Matters (QM) and the Online Course Quality Review Rubric (OSCQR),” explains Gaul. “We can provide useful recommendations for course improvement, help an institution adopt a quality assurance process, and guide faculty and staff as they navigate the world of online learning.” In addition, Edge can collaborate with campus leadership to develop and implement evaluation and revision cycles for online programs.</p>
<p>Through course evaluation, Edge helped Thomas Edison University evaluate barrier courses, which are courses with a high dropout or fail rate. By evaluating these courses against their rubric, reviewers can gain insight into why these trends are happening and determine how these classes can be improved. Edge is also helping institutions to build online learning objects (LO), or digital educational resources that can be used and re-used to support learning activities. “Learning objects can offer smaller, more concentrated learning experiences that are engaging and interesting for students,” says Gaul. “We are currently working with Rutgers University to build a choose-your-own-adventure style learning object. Students go through interactive activities, where based upon the choices they make, they are led on different pathways. Instead of strictly reading lecture notes or watching an online video, this component adds an engaging element to the online course.”</p>
<p>Bringing new programs online or enhancing existing ones can be challenging, but with the right plan in place and best practices to follow, the transition can be successful. Edge provides project management for instructional technology implementations and offers expert guidance on navigating a seamless program launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our instructional designers have their Master’s degrees in this field and can augment an organization’s existing team in a valuable and cost-effective way, eliminating the need to hire a full-time staff member,” says Gaul. “Our instructional design services are not just project-based, but people-based, and with diverse skills and experience, our team can expand the reach of an institution and help bring their digital learning initiatives to life.” Organizations can also receive assistance with training program development and delivery on enterprise instructional technology solutions. Additionally, as faculty and students learn new educational technologies, Edge offers help desk incident management to ensure all users are getting the assistance they need to be successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supporting Faculty and Student Development<br>
Through the process of helping organizations move to an online platform, Edge has gained valuable insight into what makes a successful digital learning and teaching experience and looks to share this knowledge with students and faculty. Edge can help develop and deliver custom training programs for an institution, along with designing custom badges and certificates for trainees. “We’ve created a series of modules—one for online instructors, and another for online learners,” says Gaul. “When the modules are completed, we offer three live sessions where students, faculty members, and the institutions can share their experiences on the topic. For instance, through these live discussions, the group shared what they thought was working and what wasn’t working from an instruction standpoint.”</p>

		<p>“Another session discussed how to build learning activities that are more fun and engaging, and the third delved into academic integrity, including cheating and plagiarism,” Gaul continues. “Edge is also currently building another series of self-paced workshops based upon the feedback from the first live session and will include more focused guidance on building interactive courses where learning is accurately measured.”</p>
<p>As digital and hybrid learning becomes more prominent at institutions, many organizations are determining how to redesign course spaces that are both flexible and functional as needs change. For organizations looking for AV classroom systems, Edge can also install 21st century video technology that will fit the class objectives and deliver a superior student learning experience. “Edge is helping institutions digitally enhance their learning spaces, while ensuring these changes are aligned with the overall strategic planning for space design across campus,” shares Gaul. Through Edge’s space design assessments, organizations will learn how to effectively prepare for innovations and updates that minimize disruptions and provide a smooth transition.</p>
<p>Developing Digital Learning Strategies<br>
Through the Virtual Chief Digital Learning Officer (vCDLO) solution, Edge can help institutions to unite their educational mission across all online and traditional programs. “An Edge vCDLO acts as a bridge between technology infrastructure and academics,” shares Gaul. “By partnering with leadership, a vCDLO helps create a digital learning strategy that supports your institutional mission, drives student success, and creates a roadmap for future growth. Investing in the digital space does not need to come at the expense of traditional learning.” Institutions can also receive assessments of existing online programs and departments to determine areas of improvement and opportunity. “We provide intelligent ways to use financial and human resources to advance online learning and expand a school’s reach and expertise, while maintaining the quality of face-to-face education,” says Gaul. “Overall, our goal is to help organizations think strategically about how practices, procedures, pedagogy, and psychology can all work together to build an ecosystem of learning and instruction.”</p>
<p>As online and hybrid learning transforms, EdgeLearn will continue to evolve to help institutions meet the needs and expectations of their students and faculty. A core piece of effectively meeting these changing needs is by building a collaborative community of experts who can share their unique experiences and skill sets with others. “When an instructional designer in Hudson County connects with an instructional designer in Seattle, they can bring their own perspective and insight to the table,” says Gaul. “By building an ecosystem of innovators who want to pool resources and offer solutions that can benefit the greater community; we advance the digital learning journey for all.”</p>

		 New Jersey Equity in Commercialization Collective (NJECC) 
<p>The number of women pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields continues to grow, yet men still dominate the STEM workforce, with women representing only 28% of those employed in STEM occupations.1 Facing obstacles and stereotypes as early as elementary school, girls often feel discouraged by social and environmental factors and become less likely to pursue these disciplines. When looking at scientific research and innovation, women in STEM fields file proportionately fewer invention disclosures and patents than their counterparts: female inventors account for just under 13% of patent applications globally.2 To help address these equity issues and identify and eliminate systemic institutional and entrepreneurial ecosystem barriers, a team of successful innovators have joined forces to form the New Jersey Equity in Commercialization Collective (NJECC), funded by a 3-year National Science Foundation (NSF) ADVANCE Partnership grant (HRD-2121941). The NJECC will be partnering with universities and organizations throughout New Jersey and will focus on two program areas: Gatekeeper Training &amp; Support and Inclusive Ecosystem Network Development.</p>
<p>The NSF ADVANCE program provides grants to enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and to mitigate the systemic factors that create inequities in the academic profession and workplace. Since 2001, the NSF has invested over $270M to support ADVANCE projects at more than one-hundred institutions of higher education and STEM-related not-for-profit organizations.3 This program aims to facilitate a broader adoption of gender equity and systemic change strategies and drive a regional and national transformation of the STEM academic workplace. NJECC Co-Principal Investigators currently include Treena Livingston Arinzeh, Ph.D. (PI), Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT); Nancy Steffen-Fluhr, Ph.D., Director of the Murray Center for Women in Technology at NJIT; Judith Sheft, Executive Director of the New Jersey Commission of Science, Innovation and Technology; Forough Ghahramani, Ed.D., Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, Edge; and Jeffrey A. Robinson, Ph.D., Professor and Prudential Chair in Business, Rutgers Business School.</p>
<p>Eliminating Systemic Barriers<br>
Before joining NJIT, Dr. Arinzeh began her career at a stem cell therapeutics company after receiving her bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and masters and Ph.D. in biomedical engineering. “I was one of the founding faculty members in the department of biomedical engineering at NJIT, and I’m coming up on my 20th year in the program,” shares Arinzeh. “Over the years, I’ve seen STEM programs change, and there are substantially more opportunities now that introduce students at a very young age to engineering and other STEM-related fields. There is much more awareness and effort toward exposing the next generation to scientific career paths. I’m part of a larger center at the University of Pennsylvania, where we provide summer activities for high school students where they gain hands-on lab experience and learn how to pursue an advanced degree in a STEM field.”</p>
<p>By starting out a biotech company, Arinzeh says she gained a valuable understanding of the importance of patenting inventions and discoveries and carried this idea with her when she entered academia. “At a fairly early stage in my career, I was able to file invention disclosures and patents, which gave me a closer look at seed funding programs and the whole commercialization process. I’ve been able to participate in various activities that are involved in translating your technology out of the lab, licensing technology, and creating a startup company, and I understand the process of patenting an invention. The challenges that can arise as you develop these technologies include not fully understanding the market and the level of competition that exists today. You must be well versed in the level of players you’re up against and how to navigate the whole commercialization process. University technology transfer offices (TTOs) can provide general guidance, but some of the specific details of the technology may require more of a time commitment and deeper understanding of the environment, the market, and developing effective strategies for further development. A TTO can help identify key business partners and mentors with necessary expertise and match you with entrepreneurs who are looking to help you develop technology.”</p>
<p>To help a greater number of researchers to achieve their innovation goals, NJECC looks to broaden participation of academic faculty in research at their respective institutions and pair these individuals with the investors, TTOs, and organizations that can provide supportive funding and guidance on their commercialization journeys. “The NJECC fosters a partnership across the State to address equity issues and propel academic technology commercialization,” explains Arinzeh. “We aim to eliminate systemic barriers that may prevent women and underrepresented minority faculty members from developing their technology. We are putting a number of programs in place to address equity issues in patent, licensing, and startup creation. Through benchmark research, NJECC is identifying hurdles and creating strategies for overcoming these obstacles and increasing the diversity of faculty research at an institution.”</p>
<p>“We have engaged an external Advisory Board for the NJECC, that is comprised of a distinguished experts with strong backgrounds in research and development, technology commercialization and entrepreneurship, coupled with deep expertise and commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion. The NJECC advisory board members provide input and feedback on the strategic direction and progress of the project initiatives. The NJECC Advisory Board will also serve as ambassadors for the NJECC project in the community connecting the NJECC to a greater constituency at the state, regional, and national level.” says Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs for Edge.</p>

		<p>Engaging the Experts<br>
NJECC’s Gatekeeper Training &amp; Support initiative will engage academic departments, tech transfer offices, venture/entrepreneurship centers, and angel and venture capital groups to address obstacles to inclusive entrepreneurship. Institutions will be able to work with these gatekeeper groups to cultivate culture changes, including curriculum design and implementation and evidence-based decision making across the organization. “We also have Inclusive Network Development programs which will connect women faculty and gatekeepers at events and conferences to help them build relationships and support each other’s initiatives and goals,” says Arinzeh. “Co-PI Nancy Steffen-Fluhr, Ph.D., is the Director of the Murray Center for Women in Technology at NJIT and brings a breadth of knowledge in diversity, equity, and inclusion and general guidance on how to support activities and programming. Judith Sheft is the Executive Director of the New Jersey Commission of Science, Innovation and Technology and has gained extensive expertise in commercialization and understands the New Jersey landscape and the various participants involved in this area.” Notes Dr. Steffen-Fluhr, “One of the challenges is overcoming implicit biases, such as assumptions about whom we should encourage and who the top inventors are likely to be. Women have absorbed these biases, and, in some cases, feel their project has to be 100% perfect before they even pursue a patent.”</p>
<p>Further, elaborates Sheft, “NJECC is trying to address the equity issues in academic, technology, and commercialization, including patenting, licensing, and start-up creation.” She continues, “We will focus on identifying and eliminating systemic, organizational barriers, including stereotypes and cultural perceptions, and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to commercialize their innovations and introduce new products and services that can benefit society. The Commission on Science Innovation and Technology is focused on providing technical assistance and funding to early stage innovation intensive startups. Increasing participation by women and underrepresented minorities is a strategic imperative that will improve economic development outcomes for the state. Involvement with NJECC’s initiatives particularly intentional outreach to innovators, gatekeeper awareness training and robust statewide innovation participation metrics will further drive desired results.”</p>
<p>Also aiding NJECC’s mission is the New Jersey Innovation Institute (NJII), which looks to drive innovation by helping more institutions gain access to NJIT’s resources and industry and government relationships. “NJII has extensive knowledge of technology development and commercialization and offers a large variety of training and activities, including hosting some of NJECC’s Gatekeeper Training &amp; Support sessions,” explains Arinzeh. “Our University and Organizational Partners will also be instrumental in the strategic direction of NJECC by helping gather institutional benchmark data, speaking at events, and participating in training and inclusive network development programs. These institutions are providing valuable insight into demographic data, including who is submitting invention disclosures and commercialization activities. With this information, we can identify any weaknesses and gaps and develop the programming needed to increase the number of researchers involved in New Jersey’s entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem.”</p>
<p>“Increasing efforts to diversify the STEM fields, particularly by improving access for women and people of color to enter STEM careers and thrive, is key to economic competitiveness,” shared Ghahramani, whose research focuses on the intersection of women, STEM fields, innovation, and the important role of institutions of higher education in promoting pathways for women innovators. “Women, whether in academia or the corporate world, are not participating in patenting at the same rate as their male colleagues. Having researched this topic for many years, I realize that it is not enough just to do research and study this area, advocacy is also important for impacting change. I have had the opportunity to work with peers across the nation through the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) Women Inventor SIG (AUTM WISIG) community to identify actions we could take to alter the statistics. We have been successful in helping to move the needle by raising awareness on the importance of collecting and reporting data by gender for patent applications and invention disclosures. We need to track and measure to motivate what is important. If we don’t measure, we don’t see. Accurate and consistent data is going to be incredibly important to tracking progress over time and evaluating the effectiveness of the different initiatives. It is encouraging to see a greater focus and attention at the national and international level in increasing participation of women and people of color in innovation activity. However, we still have a long way to go. According to a US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) report, women are 51% of the population, yet only 13% of inventors listed on patents are women. At the current rate of progress, women won’t reach parity in patenting until 2092. NJECC aims to address systemic obstacles throughout the innovation and patenting process resulting in creating positive impact, raising economic competitiveness, and increasing talent and contribution to the STEM innovation enterprise.”</p>
<p>Turning Challenges into Opportunities<br>
As a consultant bringing in-depth knowledge in diversity programming, Heather Metcalf, Ph.D., Director of Research and Constituent Relations for the Women in Engineering ProActive Network (WEPAN) will help to inform the direction and focus of the NJECC. Through her own experience and challenges as an undergraduate and grad school student, Metcalf was inspired to help others and create a cultural change that would empower the next generation of women and minorities. “I began my undergraduate studies in applied mathematics and computer science, and through the mentoring and support I received from a faculty member, I pursued my master’s in computer science,” shares Metcalf. “While in the master’s program, I experienced many very difficult situations, both based on class and gender. Moving from a teaching-focused undergraduate institution to a large R1 institution was a bit of a culture shock and I was assumed to be an administrative assistant most of the time. At that time, the population of women in the program for graduate school and undergraduate school combined was only around 6 percent.”</p>
<p>“The harassment I experienced and the scarcity of women pursuing this degree made me wonder what I could do to make the program more inclusive and welcoming to a greater diversity of students,” continues Metcalf. “I became involved with an existing program at the University that created outreach and awareness at K-12 levels to encourage more girls to explore computing, but I noticed there weren’t parallel efforts happening in the department to make the culture a healthy space for these students to enter into as undergraduates. Instead of taking a job in the industry upon graduation, I decided to pursue a second master’s in gender and women’s studies and a culture study of the computing department became the focus of my master’s thesis. We focused on the issues that foster a sense of inclusion and belonging and explored the issues that led to exclusion and isolation in the department. The University actually instituted some of our recommendations for improving the experiences of women and people of color among their students.”</p>
<p>Later after receiving her Ph.D. in higher education from the University of Arizona with a focus on science and technology policy studies, Metcalf joined the Association for Women in Science as a director of research. “Throughout the six years in that role, I found that my work was able to have a larger impact. My goal was always to make STEM fields a more welcoming, inclusive space, where people would not have to experience what I went through early in my education. I have been able to testify before the Office of Civil Rights around issues related to harassment in STEM. Being able to see that my voice can have a larger scale impact ultimately led me to working for Women in Engineering ProActive Network (WEPAN) as director of research and constituent relations. I’m involved in conducting research that focuses on systemic change that creates a culture where people feel included and valued. WEPAN as an organization is committed both externally and internally to engaging in positive, healthy, and cultural practices that foster inclusion, diversity, equity, and social justice.”</p>
<p>Through their engagement with policy work, WEPAN partners with allies and advocates across the engineering and STEM industry to equip members with research and evidence-based recommended practices that can create positive change in their environment. “My current work is applied research focusing on intersectional gender equity in STEM workspaces,” says Metcalf. “I explore what systemic factors influence women’s experiences, including when they’re getting hired, receiving recognition or awards for their work or contributions, or in terms of salary and pay equity. We look at the patterns in careers where women are trying to commercialize their work or start up a company related to their research. We aim to identify the systemic opportunities and barriers that women are encountering on their STEM career pathways.”</p>

We are currently at a huge turning point and as more organizations create inclusive cultures and encourage their inventors to engage in these initiatives, we can further tip the scale; giving women and people of color an equitable opportunity to pursue their passion and thrive in New Jersey’s entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem.”</p>

		<p>Engaging the Greater Community<br>
Recently, WEPAN became the new organizational home for the ADVANCE Resource and Coordination (ARC) Network. Funded by an NSF grant, the ARC Network seeks to achieve intersectional gender equity for faculty in higher education STEM disciplines. “We look to broaden the community beyond the NSF ADVANCE-funded organizations and foster connections between different stakeholders who are conducting research or creating interventions in the space,” explains Metcalf. “Through this collaboration, we can push research initiatives forward, reduce the duplication of efforts, and further build upon the work that has already been done. WEPAN has a resource library that serves as a knowledge base for researchers, practitioners, and change agents. We also have research and practice dissemination activities through webinars and newsletters, and different curation activities to connect researchers and change makers with the resources that they need.”</p>
<p>WEPAN hosts several workshops that bring together key stakeholders to give presentations, engage in roundtable discussions, and share insights and experiences with each other. “By engaging leaders and innovators from around the industry, we can explore the state of knowledge, identify gaps in that knowledge, and pinpoint several critical research areas and implications for practice moving forward,” says Metcalf. “The NJECC program also looks closely at the region’s commercialization space and ways we can infuse this industry with equity and inclusion. Through partnerships with TTOs, stakeholders, and other gatekeepers in New Jersey, we can discover how they’re working on diversity, equity, and inclusion-related initiatives and then create custom workshops for these stakeholders to help them successfully achieve their goals.”</p>
<p>Accelerating Time to Market<br>
While at the Association for Women in Science (AWIS), Metcalf created the STEM to Market initiative, which combined the scientific expertise with the mentorship and community needed to help navigate the world of commercialization. “The initiative was based on existing research on entrepreneurship experiences around gender and race in STEM,” explains Metcalf. “We found there were three unmet needs. This included that existing entrepreneurship support programs weren’t meeting the needs of a diversity of women in STEM. There may have been gender-based accelerator incubator programs, but they weren’t STEM focused, or you might have STEM-focused accelerator-type programs, but they didn’t have intersectional equity as a component. The second gap identified by the group was that critical gatekeepers, like investors and TTOs, were not engaging in important conversations around diversity and inclusion, and lastly, many networks occupied by gatekeepers lacked STEM trained women altogether.”</p>
<p>Metcalf continues, “We created accelerator programs to address these issues and bridge the gaps between the networks and the entrepreneurs and gatekeepers. I believe this is the first initiative of its kind—with around 67-percent of our participating entrepreneurs identifying as women of color, about a third who identified as LGBTQ, a quarter who identified as women with disabilities, and about a quarter who are first-generation college graduates. I’m really proud of this initiative and how successful the programs have been in creating changes and supporting these women in their entrepreneurial efforts. The lessons we learned from STEM to Market and the research that we conducted as part of the project, play a huge role in how we are thinking about the gatekeeper training initiative for the NJECC project.”</p>
<p>While Dr. Ghahramani was doing her dissertation research, she reached out to Metcalf to discuss equity and inclusion issues in the entrepreneurship and commercialization space. “Dr. Ghahramani has a wealth of knowledge, experience, and practice in this area and has been a strong advocate for women in STEM and innovation,” says Metcalf. “We both are part of a group called Invent Together, which is a policy coalition that addresses these diversity issues. She does a lot of work putting her rich knowledge to practice on the advocacy side and this support and experience is incredibly valuable to the NJECC effort.”</p>
<p>Also instrumental in the STEM to Market initiative, Erin Kelley, Co-Founder, Hexalign, is a consultant specializing in inclusive STEM commercialization and entrepreneurship. Currently, Kelley leads an NSF-funded project to develop a platform for equity, diversity, and inclusion audits, education, and guided best practice implementation. “With a background in curriculum development, Erin’s experience was invaluable in developing the curriculum for the STEM to Market accelerator program, and now in the gatekeeper training side of NJECC,” shares Metcalf. “We first met when she was working on the National Women’s Business Council and the SBA’s office of Advocacy had just put out a report that explored the gender disparities in patenting, inventorship, and startup activities. We ended up working together on a panel at an SBIR/STTR conference and having roundtable discussions to engage people in more systemic change activities based upon the findings of that report. She’s been doing work in this space for quite some time and I’m grateful for the knowledge and expertise that she brings to the NJECC program.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				       
	 
		 
		 
			
 
	 
		<p>“One of the challenges is overcoming implicit biases, such as assumptions about whom we should encourage and who the top inventors are likely to be. Women have absorbed these biases, and, in some cases, feel their project has to be 100% perfect before they even pursue a patent.”&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Creating a Roadmap for Change<br>
Joining in a similar mission as NJECC to help researchers gain valuable insight into entrepreneurship and starting a business, the NSF’s Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program looks to help innovators reduce the time to translate a promising idea from the laboratory to the marketplace. “I-Corps will be very helpful in addressing some of the gaps that we know exist in the participation of entrepreneurial activities,” says Metcalf. “I’m currently part of an initiative with I-Corps that reviews an institution’s program through a diversity, equity, and inclusion lens. For example, we examine the outreach and recruitment materials and processes and the data being collected around people’s experiences while they’re in the program. We see if there are any disparities in those experiences along gender and race-related lines. We also explore inclusive examples used in the curriculum and identify any exclusionary activities. With all this data, we can help create a roadmap for change specific to the institution.”</p>
<p>“Working alongside my fellow NJECC team members and other advocates in the diversity and inclusion space makes me very hopeful that we’re making big strides in the right direction,” continues Metcalf. “We are seeing many people eager to engage in change-related work and who are open to critical reflection and taking accountability for the barriers that exist. We are currently at a huge turning point and as more organizations create inclusive cultures and encourage their inventors to engage in these initiatives, we can further tip the scale; giving women and people of color an equitable opportunity to pursue their passion and thrive in New Jersey’s entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem.”</p>
<p>NJECC co-PI, Jeffrey Robinson, an associate professor at Rutgers Business School and academic director of The Center for Urban Entrepreneurship &amp; Economic Development, also serves as the Research Lead for the NSF I-Corps Hub: Northeast Region and spearheads entrepreneurship research on both deep tech and inclusive innovation as co-investigator on the grant.</p>
<p>“Inclusive innovation is the idea that the visionaries, entrepreneurs, and gatekeepers of technology innovation should be as diverse as our nation. This diversity leads to brilliant ideas, new companies, and international leadership in innovation,” said Robinson. “The I-Corps Hub: Northeast Region offers us a unique opportunity to study how the diversity of our area can be harnessed for regional development and national competitiveness.”</p>

NJECC is working with institutional partners focusing on identifying and eliminating systemic institutional and entrepreneurial ecosystem barriers and increasing the diversity of STEM faculty researchers who participate in New Jersey’s entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem. Accurate and consistent data is going to be incredibly important to tracking progress over time and evaluating the effectiveness of the different initiatives.

		<p>Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) with a multi-university $15-million, five-year grant, the Hub will be led by Princeton University with Rutgers University and University of Delaware as partner institutions. The new NSF I-Corps Hub: Northeast Region will strengthen a growing regional and national technology commercialization ecosystem while connecting diverse resources and networks available within a consortium of universities. The Hub will also include five initial affiliates in the network: New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Rowan University, Lehigh University, Temple University, and Delaware State University. More affiliates are expected to be added each year to broaden opportunities for university researchers by creating new ventures and entrepreneurial endeavors in sectors such as healthcare, robotics, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, clean energy, and the environment.</p>
<p>“Innovation is a hallmark of American culture, fostering societal growth and development while also stimulating the economy,” says Ghahramani. “Diversity is a key driver of innovation and a critical component of success. In the innovation process, women and people of color are woefully underrepresented as inventors. Creating more equitable opportunities will require inclusive and proactive policies and programs to address the barriers that women and people of color face at every stage of innovation and patenting. Without education about and exposure to innovation and patenting, many inventors do not have basic knowledge about the patenting process. Working through patent drafts, developing relationships with intellectual property attorneys, and responding to feedback from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are all necessary steps for success, but can be intimidating for a new inventor. In addition to formal education on the process, engaging with a mentor and expanding one’s network are key steps in gaining valuable feedback, advice, and support for years to come. The pillars of NJECC address educating the gatekeepers, as well as developing professional networks. NJECC is working with institutional partners across New Jersey focusing on identifying and eliminating systemic institutional and entrepreneurial ecosystem barriers and increasing the diversity of STEM faculty researchers who participate in New Jersey’s entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem. The community we build will be an important part of the process as we band together for collective action, contributing to systemic change initiatives leading to equitable academic technology commercialization in NJ and beyond.”</p>

<p>The TRAC token is the utility token of the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph that is getting deployed on Polkadot through the OriginTrail dedicated Parachain. Becoming a token spanning both Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems has enormous potential, particularly in the benefits offered by the latest generation of blockchain features in Polkadot, such as native cross-chain interoperability and extensibility beyond the VM&nbsp;level.</p><p>The aim of this RFC is to outline the details of different approaches to technical deployment of the TRAC token on the OriginTrail Parachain and collect feedback from the OriginTrail community.</p> TRAC as a multi-chain token <p>Since its inception in January 2018, the TRAC token has been deployed as an ERC20 standardized token on the Ethereum mainnet blockchain as a limited supply, non-inflationary utility token fueling the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). Exactly 500 million TRAC have been created at the token generation event. Since then, the TRAC token has become crucial in enabling a variety of solutions used by notable global organizations as their data footprint constantly increases on the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>As a two layer system, OriginTrail has always been based on two tokens — the TRAC token as the utility token of the OriginTrail DKG (Layer 2), and the gas token of the underlying blockchain used such as ETH, Matic and xDAI (Layer&nbsp;1).</p><p>Earlier this year the OriginTrail community provided strong support for the launch of <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/">OriginTrail specific blockchain on Polkadot — the OriginTrail Parachain</a>, with its native OriginTrail Parachain token (OTP) providing blockchain utility on layer 1. Additionally, apart from OTP providing “gas” utility, its tokenomics are designed to directly incentivize network activity in the OriginTrail ecosystem. More information on the interplay between OriginTrail DKG and blockchain layers <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper">can be found in the whitepaper</a>, while detailed OTP tokenomics will be the subject of a separate&nbsp;RFC.</p> TRAC token deployment on&nbsp;Polkadot <p>With the launch of the OriginTrail Parachain, a highly scalable layer 1 blockchain tailored to the DKG has been successfully added to the OriginTrail ecosystem. This comes with the added benefit of native interoperability with the entire Polkadot ecosystem and any network adopting Polkadot’s communication standards.</p><p>Since the TRAC token is an Ethereum ERC20 token with significant adoption, it’s important to carefully consider its implementation in the new Polkadot ecosystem. In the previous request for comments <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges%20(v2).pdf">OT-RFC-12 OriginTrail Parachain Bridges</a>, the use of a third party bridge was deemed unsafe and a final decision alongside the community was made to teleport TRAC using the pre-audited SFC smart contract.</p><p>Polkadot enables advanced blockchain functionalities and customizability, and with the launch of OriginTrail Parachain the OriginTrail ecosystem became a direct beneficiary of features such&nbsp;as:</p>  Cross-chain message passing via XCM enabling Parachains to send arbitrary messages between each other in a trustless manner using the Polkadot Relay chain. This not only enables easy token transfers, but also execution of any arbitrary logic between chains. This opens up room for many integrations across the ecosystem, e.g. a transaction on the OriginTrail Parachain could execute a token swap on the Acala parachain or extend assets available on Moonbeam. More information on XCM <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm">can be found&nbsp;here</a>.  Secure bridging between Parachains via the Relay chain, as well as strong, trustless bridges to other ecosystems built as parachains rather than multi-sig driven implementations, which have seen numerous hacks in the previous year. The OT-RFC-12 focuses specifically on this issue and the transitioning TRAC safely to the OriginTrail Parachain.  Extensibility through “pallets”, enabling forkless upgrades directly on chain level (as opposed to being confined to the EVM environment and needing to fork the entire chain), allowing customizations and advanced features tailored to the use case of every parachain. Many pallets already exist for features such as governance, staking,&nbsp;etc.  <p>More information on Polkadot features and implementation details can be found <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/getting-started">here</a>. With this RFC we present two distinct approaches of TRAC token implementation on the OriginTrail Parachain (and therefore, Polkadot).</p> OriginTrail Parachain TRAC Deployment requirements <p>The end goal of TRAC token deployment on the OriginTrail Parachain is to achieve the following requirements:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach: appropriate measures and planning has to be undertaken to maximize the ease of use and create a simple user experience of TRAC in order to not hinder the value propositions of the OriginTrail ecosystem.  R2 — Maximized security: special care must be taken to remove any unnecessary complexities and potential points of failure to ensure the TRAC token economy is robust and remains decentralized. This includes both the technical decisions and implementations, as well as decision making in an open, public discourse (such as through the OriginTrail RFCs).  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability: ability to utilize TRAC token across the universe of Polkadot parachains and ecosystem tools (such as wallets), leveraging the innovations and value generated by the Polkadot ecosystem. This requires native Substrate integration through relevant pallets (such as the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-integrate-assets">Assets&nbsp;pallet</a>).  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility: TRAC on the OriginTrail Parachain should remain compatible with existing Ethereum infrastructure and tooling, retaining its standard ERC20 form. To achieve this in the context of the Substrate runtime, a set of precompile contracts need to be deployed on the OriginTrail Parachain (to reach the EVM2.0 deployment).  R5 — Effective time of deployment: The time resources required for TRAC implementation to provide utility (in the context of achieving above requirements) should be reasonably low (and thus effective).  <p>In both proposed approaches, each of the above requirements will be graded with NOT SATISFIED, EVENTUALLY SATISFIED, PARTIALLY SATISFIED or FULLY SATISFIED.</p> Approach #1: Evolutionary deployment (from EVM1.0 to&nbsp;EVM2.0) <p>This approach would entail a transition from TRAC initially getting deployed as ERC20 token on the OriginTrail Parachain (indicated in scheme below as “Temp TRAC”), to reaching a Polkadot native TRAC deployment (“Full TRAC”) in the next step. This initial TRAC token would operate as a standard ERC20 token in the current EVM 1.0 environment on the OriginTrail Parachain (satisfying R4). However in such an environment, the token would not benefit from the additional features available from Polkadot technology (R3), and therefore would require a future token migration to a fully implemented TRAC in the EVM 2.0 environment on the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>The main advantage of such an approach would be the immediate availability of TRAC on OriginTrail Parachain as no updates to the current Parachain codebase are necessary (OriginTrail Parachain 1.0.x codebase versions). The main disadvantage of the approach is the need to perform a token migration once all features necessary for the Parachain native implementation have been put in place (1.1.x codebase versions). There are two general approaches to such token migration, both introducing a new set of challenges:</p>  User-performed migration (open ended): token holders would “swap” between the initial and fully fledged TRAC token versions through a “one-way bridge” contract, which would be responsible for minting “full TRAC” tokens. While satisfying criterion R4, this approach most likely leads to an “open ended migration” (both token implementations “living” on the OriginTrail Parachain for an undetermined period of time) as users could decide not to migrate for whatever reason, which is problematic in terms of Polkadot compatibility requirement (R3). Additionally, this approach requires significant adaptations to the implementation of OriginTrail DKG nodes which will have to manage working with both tokens simultaneously. The core developers assess this as the least favorable option with regards to time resource expenditure (criterion R5). Finally, the existence of two implementations for the same token would likely cause user experience hurdles for less tech-savvy users (e.g. asset publishers), creating problems in terms of requirement R1 and likely R2 due to additional complexity.  Developer-performed migration (close ended): in this option the core developers would retain the capability of “freezing” the “Temp TRAC” token contract implementation for a small amount of time in order to perform a “snapshot migration” from one contract to another (temp TRAC to full TRAC). This option removes some of the downsides of having two simultaneously living TRAC token implementations on the OriginTrail Parachain, however for the cost of necessarily pausing the operations of the entire TRAC economy on the OriginTrail Parachain for the amount of time needed for migration. This particular approach would still require careful planning and execution from the entire ecosystem involved in the TRAC economy on the OriginTrail Parachain. It is estimated that this migration approach would require significant time expenditure from all actors in the community and is negatively assessed in the context of criterion R5, based on the experience in previous token staking and teleporting activities. Moreover, the pausing capability introduces a problematic component into the token implementation due to enabling additional powerful token control capability on the smart contract level (potential single point of failure), problematic in context of requirement R2 for the period of time until the migration to a native Polkadot implementation (full TRAC). Finally, even with developer lead initiative in this approach, it would still require effort and caution from the TRAC community which is not favorable in the context of requirement R1.  Approach #1: TRAC token migration path from EVM1.0 to EVM2.0 (1a involving the “Bridge” contract, 1b performing a snapshot transition)<p>Approach #1 in terms of defined criteria then can be assessed in the following way:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — as both approach #1a and #1b introduce the need to manage two implementations of the same token and require additional activity from all end users of the OriginTrail Parachain, especially in approach #1a which doesn’t have a time constraint on the token migration. Given that OriginTrail Parachain is a new environment (with new tools, such as wallets) the community is slowly getting accustomed to, having any additional friction is seen as problematic.  R2 — Maximized security — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — While significant measures need to be taken to ensure safe transition between two token implementations, the approach does satisfy the security requirements as the process can be entirely based on smart contracts. However, additional steps and complexity inherently do add an additional risk component in the&nbsp;process.  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability — grade: EVENTUALLY SATISFIED — with the evolutionary approach TRAC would start as a “non-native” Polkadot asset. The additional features provided by Polkadot would only be available post-migration.  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — in both approach #1a and #1b TRAC starts as an ERC20-compatible token.  R5 — Effective time of deployment — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — in order to reach the fully deployed state of TRAC on Polkadot, a significant time investment would be required to plan and execute the migration activities in detail, both by the core developers as well as by the OriginTrail community (estimated at several months). The partially satisfied grading of the requirements stems from the fact that it allows immediate deployment of the (non-Polkadot) version of TRAC tokens as no additional updates to the OriginTrail Parachain are&nbsp;needed.   Approach #2: Direct Polkadot-native deployment (EVM 2.0&nbsp;only) <p>The second approach would be to avoid the deployment of the TRAC token contract in the EVM1.0 environment (Parachain version 1.0.x) entirely, and proceed to direct Polkadot native deployment of TRAC tokens. With such an approach, the TRAC token would from the get-go have all of the benefits offered by Polkadot (as listed above) and would minimize the necessary coordination required by the migration activities detailed in approach #1, all of which would benefit from a better user experience and less friction.</p>Approach #2: TRAC token immediate deployment to EVM2.0 Parachain environment<p>This approach is favorable with regards to all requirements presented above:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — since only one TRAC token deployment would ever exist on the OriginTrail Parachain there would be no migrations or potentially difficult operations the TRAC community would need to&nbsp;perform.  R2 — Maximized security — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — higher security is achieved through minimizing complexity and need of coordination (compared to approach&nbsp;#1).  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — advanced Polkadot features will be available immediately from the moment of token deployment, as the token will be deployed as a Polkadot&nbsp;asset.  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — the TRAC token implementation will be performed in such a way that, apart from being a Polkadot asset from the Substrate perspective, it will remain an ERC20 standardized token from the EVM perspective.  R5 — Effective time of deployment — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — even though approach 2 is not entailing the immediate deployment of TRAC on the OriginTrail Parachain, we estimate that significantly lower amount of resources are required for a fully fledged TRAC implementation in approach #2 (compared to approach #1), from both the development team and the TRAC community, due to no migration activities and code adaptations required from the DKG node side. The estimated deployment time is under 1&nbsp;month.  <p>Due to the dynamics presented above, approach #2 is the preferred option of the core development team.</p> Bridging TRAC to other ecosystems <p>Due to Polkadot’s native interoperability features, once implemented, the TRAC token will be available to the entirety of Polkadot and its parachains, as the Relay chain acts as a de facto bridge between Polkadot parachains. This will open up new opportunities for both the token holders as well as builders in the ecosystem to deploy OriginTrail in ways previously not&nbsp;seen.</p><p>The implementation of trustless bridges to other blockchain ecosystems is an ongoing effort of multiple teams and has been discussed in the previous OT-RFC-12. The necessary preparation and discussions with ecosystem developers and Parity have been ongoing in anticipation of the bridge deployment between Ethereum and Polkadot, as indicated in the scheme&nbsp;above.</p> Conclusion <p>This RFC presents the requirements and approaches to implementing the TRAC token on the OriginTrail Parachain, including the details of their execution according to the requirements. As core developers we invite the wider OriginTrail community to provide feedback and comments in the dedicated discussion on the OriginTrail RFC repository.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">OriginTrail Twitter</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain">OriginTrail Parachain Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-13-trac-token-deployment-on-polkadot-c709347583cc">OT-RFC-13 TRAC Token deployment on Polkadot</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 How crypto savings account works 



<p>As the name implies, crypto savings accounts function like traditional accounts applicable to fiat currency.</p>



<p>Crypto savings accounts were created to allow cryptocurrency holders receive interest on their crypto assets. These accounts let users transfer their assets to the crypto saving platform with the promise of safe keeping and the receipt of interests.</p>



<p>Notably, the savings accounts platform lends the saved crypto assets to other users on the platform and charges fees to borrowers, contributing to interests distributed to savings accounts.</p>



<p>Crypto savings accounts are currency-specific, meaning that if one saves Bitcoin, one can only withdraw and receive interest on the same cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>When comparing the profitability of crypto savings accounts versus idle storage in personal wallets, crypto savings accounts seem the best option for growth and multiplication.</p>



<p>To use crypto savings accounts, like the traditional banking process where users create accounts and transfer their money to their savings accounts, crypto holders have to create accounts with the crypto savings account providers and transfer the specific assets they wish to save to the wallet address provided by the provider.</p>



<p>Crypto users can purchase crypto assets on these provider platforms and commit them to their savings accounts.</p>



<p>It is also important to note that the range of cryptocurrencies supported by the savings account provider determines the currencies the crypto user can save.</p>



<p>Crypto interest accounts take users’ deposits and offer them as loans for which it charges service fees and requires specific collateral. They invest these assets and share the profits with investors through daily or weekly interests.</p>



<p>The user can, however, compare platforms to select the one which allows savings of their currency of interest. In addition, interest rates earned on crypto savings vary depending on the particular cryptocurrency and the flexibility of access.</p>



<p>The idea of flexibility brings us to the types of crypto savings accounts. Crypto savings or interest accounts can be flexible or fixed.</p>



 Types of crypto interest accounts 



 Flexible cryptocurrency savings accounts 



<p>Flexible crypto savings accounts work like traditional savings accounts. They allow the user to withdraw and add funds to their account.</p>



<p>Interest rates are usually low for this kind of cryptocurrency savings account.</p>



<p>However, interest rates are calculated, and proceeds are added daily or weekly. Some flexible savings accounts may charge withdrawal fees and set no limit on withdrawals for the users.</p>



 Fixed cryptocurrency savings account 



<p>The fixed savings accounts work like fixed deposit accounts. This savings account locks up users’ assets for a specific period. It pays better interest rates compared to its flexible counterpart.</p>



<p>For instance, a user could decide to save (lock up) their assets, i.e., Ethereum, for 150 days, and at the end of the lock-up period, withdraw their funds or reinvest their funds and interests for new lock-up cycles and more interests.</p>



 Essential factors to consider when choosing a crypto savings accounts 



<p>Certain features combine to make crypto savings accounts stand out from the herd. Knowing these features and looking out for them when choosing your crypto savings account is essential. Some of the most critical factors to look out for include:</p>



  Interest rate: The number one motivation for using a crypto savings account is the interest rate. It is best to compare the rates of different platforms to help the user maximize profit on their investments. It is also essential to stay off platforms that promise very unrealistic profits. This is often the number one tell sign of fraudulent schemes.  Security: While interest rate provides the most critical factor, security requires the same level of importance as interest rates. What difference would high-interest rates make when users’ funds are lost? Users must ensure that the platform is secure via best practices like log-in authentications, cold storage custodian services, and insurance coverages.  Flexibility and Simplicity: Users, especially beginners, must understand their savings account provider’s workings, terms and conditions. A flexible and straightforward platform helps baby-step the new investor into the complex world of crypto investments.  Fees: The last on our list is fees. Users must compare platforms to enable them to choose one with fair fees.  



 Advantages of crypto savings account 



  Crypto savings accounts enable crypto users to profit from their cryptocurrency assets by simply depositing and holding them with savings account providers rather than having their assets sit idly in their personal wallets.  Crypto savings accounts may provide the best option for portfolio diversification.  A Crypto savings account provides higher returns on investment with minimal risks.  Although largely scarce, some of the best crypto savings accounts offer users security of their investment. For instance, YouHodler, Bit.com, Crypto.com, and AAX provide insurance coverage for users’ assets.  A Crypto savings account requires no investment expertise. Users just need to deposit their funds and receive interest. It is easy, flexible, and profitable.  



 Disadvantages of Crypto savings account 



  Unlike traditional savings accounts, most crypto savings accounts do not provide FDIC insurance coverage for user assets.  Crypto savings could lose value while held in the savings account.  In contrast to traditional savings accounts, crypto accounts are mainly unregulated. They lack the trust and credibility that traditional savings accounts enjoy.  Crypto savings account users may suffer several restrictions with withdrawing their funds based on the terms and conditions of their service provider.

 💼 + 🤗 =&nbsp;🚀 <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed-use-cases/">the draft</a> Verifiable Credentials for Education, Employment, and Achievement Use Cases report was published. It’s worth a read for anyone interested in Open Badges, microcredentials, or certification. The next version of the Open Badges specification (v3.0) will be compatible with Verifiable Credentials (VCs). One thing to note about VCs is that they don’t have to have a visual representation in the form of an&nbsp;image.</p><p>The use cases provided in the report are interesting, and Verifiable Credentials promise to solve many seemingly-intractable problems around how individual people can prove claims in privacy-respecting ways. What we noted, however, especially given our work around <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>, is that there are some use cases that are likely to be transformational to learners and workers in the future of work. Both groups need control over the way that they are recognised to unlock future opportunities.</p><p>For example, the report talks about the recognition of prior learning, something which is an equity issue for those who haven’t had the same access to resources than&nbsp;others:</p><blockquote>Josephina decided to return to college to finish her bachelors degree. The college she attended evaluated her work experience and determined that skills and knowledge that she attained while working qualified to replace several of the courses required for the&nbsp;degree.</blockquote><p>There are countries and systems where recognising prior learning is a normal part of the learning landscape. Even in these cases, however, the aim of the activity is to assess whether an individual has met the criteria for admission to a course or institution. What VCs allow is for recognition to be turned into a credential, and therefore used as ‘currency’ not just to be ‘spent’ at that institution, but potentially anywhere.</p><p>The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">original vision</a> for Open Badges was to create an “open and decentralized [ecosystem] to allow for badges from any contexts where learners are learning, to support any and all types of learning occurring, to provide portable and sustainable value and to give each learner complete control”.</p><a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/issuing-open-badges/">Issuing Open Badges</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a><p>The key word here is control. Although a lot of learning happens in formal education institutions, a lot of learning happens on the job through informal and non-formal learning. So how can VCs work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_career">portfolio careers</a>, in a world where people change jobs relatively often and need to take proof of their learning with&nbsp;them?</p><p>We suggest that there are the following three examples where VCs can play an important role in Open Workplace Recognition (i.e. Open Recognition in the workplace):</p>  Recognition of prior learning — as discussed above, this is a way to translate knowledge, skills, and experience gained on the job into credentials that can be used more widely. This depends on an authority (the ‘Issuer’) assessing a portfolio of evidence about a person (the ‘Subject’), who will then also be able to use the VC as proof of their claim (i.e. also be the ‘Holder’).  Defining your own path — no two careers are ever the same, yet the way we present them can often be far too similar. VCs issued for the recognition of niche (or even unique!) things such as knowledge, skills, experience, and dispositions allows individuals to better tell their own story. One way of doing this would be to self-issue a VC (the ‘Subject’ and ‘Holder’ is also the ‘Issuer’) and then have someone else, or an organisation, endorse that&nbsp;claim.  Making recognition portable — combining the other two points, an individual may want to memorialise a particular important form of recognition they have received. This could be a tweet, a comment in an email, or anything that they want to be able to refer to in future. By self-issuing a VC (again, the ‘Subject’ and ‘Holder’ is also the ‘Issuer’) they can ask the person who gave the recognition to endorse their&nbsp;claim.  <p>The purpose of standards, and the working groups which create them, is necessarily to focus on the technical elements and most common use cases. With this post, we want to widen the conversation to consider what VCs make possible that is entirely new, and that which was perhaps always latent in Open&nbsp;Badges.</p><p>Using a lens of Open Workplace Recognition allows us to focus about the norms, behaviours, and expectations within the world of work. We can then go a step further to think about who controls what is recognised, by whom, and how that recognition can be shared more&nbsp;widely.</p><p>What other examples for Open Workplace Recognition using VCs can we come up with together?</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-workplace-recognition-using-verifiable-credentials-fc0134fad7ec">Open Workplace Recognition using Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We asked our Executive Director, Kay Chopard, for her thoughts and learnings from working through the first phase of the UK Digital Identity &amp; Attributes Framework (DIATF):</p>



<p>“It is just over 6 months since<a href="https://www.ukas.com/resources/latest-news/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-pilot/"> UKAS announced the 5 organisations</a> that would certify Identity Service Providers (IDSPs) against the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> under an initial assessment program.</p>



<p>Digital identity and the provision of trusted credentials will be a vital component in the delivery of future public – and private – services. Through our global identity certification work, we observe first-hand just how quickly the digital identity market is growing. We have been certifying an increasing number of IDSPs against global standards as opportunities for digital identity expand and I’ve noticed, especially, the drive from sectors where identity verification is NOT mandated by regulation – for instance in healthcare.  At Kantara Initiative, we have been running identity assessment programs across the world for nearly 15 years.&nbsp; In the UK, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-identity-certification-for-right-to-work-right-to-rent-and-criminal-record-checks/digital-identity-certification-for-right-to-work-right-to-rent-and-criminal-record-checks#list-of-certified-idsps">11 identity proofing organisations have now been certified to provide services within the Framework</a>. To support this growth, I believe we should consider the following points:</p>



<p>Future-proofing the identity ecosystem</p>



<p>We have been proud to work with the Department of Culture, Media and Sports (DCMS), UKAS and our certification clients over the past 6 months as the DIATF has moved from the Alpha to Beta phase. Organisations that were certified in the first few months were assessed against the Alpha version of the framework. Our certification clients, however, are assessed against the Beta version of the DIATF as this is already much more robust and includes more fully defined assessment criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the program continues to evolve we will identify further assessment criteria that will be vital to roll out robust, trusted, identity solutions that will work for future use cases. Our auditors are dedicated identity specialists with experience across multiple sectors. They have shared with me that the DIATF will continue to benefit from the experiences of other programs across the world – what has worked and what hasn’t.&nbsp; This is vital, especially if we are to support those identity organisations that are planning for international expansion. The UK’s DIATF cannot exist in geographic isolation; individual customers and citizens will eventually require a digital identity that is portable. The DIATF should support organisations in providing this.</p>



<p>One size doesn’t fit all</p>



<p>This first wave of assessments has shown very quickly that each certification client operates quite differently and so a simple “tick box” approach to assessment will not work. We are often asked for a fixed price for our certification services, but I would argue that a fixed price indicates a fixed approach – and a fixed mindset. The underlying assessment criteria must, of course, be met consistently. But each organisation operates differently, and the Kantara ‘modular’ approach ensures each element of the process can be audited in line with requirements AND the business’ operating model. This also supports DCMS’ current model of having separate use cases. As new cases come online, we will continue to add in new assessments that support growth.</p>



<p>Challenge through collaboration</p>



<p>We are a not-for-profit organisation. While commerciality is an important focus, it is more significant that we continue to develop our understanding of emerging trends and issues across all markets. We have been encouraged by the response of parliamentarians, digital identity industry leaders, influencers and media to the Kantara approach and we have appointed a number of key assessors who bring with them experiences of specific sectors, territories and regulatory environments.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Most recently, the appointment of Emma Lindley MBE, Alison McDowell and Andrew Hindle to our UK Advisory Board was a deliberate move to ensure we continue to be challenged and stay abreast of the issues our clients face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our role on the Kantara UK Advisory Board is to provide independent thinking and guidance to Kantara’s UK team. As a UK citizen who has worked in the identity sector for over 20 years, I believe we can help ensure the customer is constantly “in the room” and at the heart of any discussions around the future of the digital identity framework.”  (Andrew Hindle, Kantara UK Advisor, Content Chair at Identiverse and Founding Board Member at IDPro.)</p>



<p>Going forward, we believe it is vital that certification bodies continue to work with DCMS and UKAS in a spirit of partnership – bringing together the cumulative value of dozens of great minds! To this end, we have&nbsp; been encouraged by the proactive approach of DCMS in creating forums where the 5 certification bodies can discuss ideas and feedback on the program in action. </p>



<p>“There is now a clear vision for a digital identity market that is both open and competitive. The DIATF is intended to create choice, improve quality and increase innovation – ultimately improving customer experiences for the UK citizen and reducing the cost for UK PLC. Kantara Initiative has a vital role to play in delivering this vision.” (Emma Lindley MBE, Co-Founder of Women in Identity and MD, International Expansion, at CAF) </p>

<p>Verifying identities and information in a digital world is critical for establishing trust. But there are issues of privacy as well as efficiency, scale and accuracy in models that rely on centralized data collectors and databases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The adoption of a new generation of digital identity solutions that leverage decentralized technologies such as distributed ledgers and verifiable credentials is accelerating. And Hyperledger technologies are playing a major role in this transformation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on for a cross section of the many Hyperledger-powered solutions that are in production now. For other examples, check out these past #HyperledgerIdentity round-ups:</p>

<p>IBM Digital Health Pass</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/digital-health-pass">IBM Digital Health Pass</a>, built on<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric"> Hyperledger Fabric</a>, offers a multi-credential verifier that organizations can use to manage and execute their verification policies for COVID-19 and vaccination status in a way that balances the privacy of the individual with the requirements set by the organization and local health authorities. With IBM Digital Health Pass, organizations can verify multiple types of health credentials, such as Good Health Pass, IBM Digital Health Pass, Smart Health Card and EU Digital COVID Certificate. Privacy is central to the solution, where the verifier application minimizes the personal data that is ever displayed to the user through the execution of business rules and it never lets any personal data leave, or be stored in, the verifier app.</p>



<p>Indicio Network&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-networks/">Indicio Network</a> is a collection of four professionally-staffed, enterprise-grade public-permissioned ledgers that provide a neutral, independent, and reliable network for the exchange of verifiable credentials. <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">MainNet</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-demonet/">DemoNet</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">TestNet</a>, and <a href="https://indicio.tech/deploy-your-own-private-network-for-critical-performance-testing/">TempNet</a> are all Hyperledger Indy-based networks with nodes operating on five continents—and a growing number of node operators. The Indicio Network is one of the networks that can support <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a>, a complete suite of decentralized identity components for authenticating and sharing high value data in a privacy-preserving way using verifiable digital credentials. Built on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a>, as well as AnonCreds and DIDComm, Proven is designed to make implementing and using these open source codebases simple, providing users with a fully-owned solution that’s easy to integrate with existing systems, to innovate on, and to scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDUnion&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://idunion.org/?lang=en">IDUnion</a>, the European identity verification network created as part of the “Secure Digital Identities Showcase” funding project, brings together public institutions, government agencies, private organizations, associations, educational institutions and other stakeholders from various fields to enable a fundamentally new, secure digital infrastructure for the verification of identity information. In August, 2022, IDUnion spun off Sociedad Cooperativa Europea (SCE) to operate the production network for credential verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IDUnion network, which is built on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>, enables the clear verification of individuals, companies and institutions while allowing people and organizations to manage their identity information by themselves and to decide when they want to share this information and with whom. It has a decentralized structure and stores no personal data – not even as a hash. In order to protect privacy right from the start, all personal data is stored on the user’s end device. Users have a choice of wallets for storing and presenting credentials to third parties as required. Credentials are issued, verified and stored using open standards to ensure interoperability. Hyperledger Aries is the framework for managing the credentials.</p>



<p>NHS Covid-19 Digital Staff Passport</p>



<p>In 2019, the NHS was preparing to pilot a digital passport project that would allow staff to carry their HR and other records as credentials on their phones as a long-term plan to make it easier to transfer from one facility to another. When the pandemic hit, this went from a pilot to a production deployment quickly. The <a href="https://beta.staffpassports.nhs.uk/">NHS Covid-19 Digital Staff Passport</a> rolled out in summer to support swift and efficient staff movement between NHS organizations in response to the response health emergency. The COVID-19 Digital Staff Passport provided a solid legal framework for staff to be temporarily deployed into other NHS organizations with evidence available that checks have been completed before staff move. As laid out in the pilot, the information was transferred securely by the staff member as verified credentials stored on their own smartphone, putting them in control.</p>



<p>This staff passport used the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sorvin Network</a>, which is built on Hyperledger Indy, to verify the digital credentials, and the Evernym (now Avast) <a href="https://connect.me/">Connect.me</a> digital wallet app, which is powered by Hyperledger Aries, Indy and Ursa, to enable staff to store and share their credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NHS is now gearing up to roll out the <a href="https://beta.staffpassports.nhs.uk/whats-next.htm">next generation</a> of its Digital Staff Passport, which will streamline transfers and staff movements through the NHS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBook BC&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca/search">OrgBook BC</a> is a searchable public directory of organizations registered in British Columbia, Canada, provided by the BC Government’s Ministry of Citizens’ Services. OrgBook BC provides verified data, including legal names and DBA names, business numbers, BC registration status and select licensee and permits, for more than 1.4 million organizations. All of the information in the OrgBookBC is received, stored, verified and displayed using the latest digital trust technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBookBC uses verifiable credentials to ensure that information about organizations are digitally signed by the entity that issues it. Issuers are public sector organizations that hold information about businesses, issue licenses or permits or certify processes. That electronic signature stays with the data throughout its life in OrgBook and is validated before its is display on the website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBookBC is part of an overall commitment to digital trust technologies by the Government of British Columbia. In addition to deploying Hyperledger Aries, Indy and Ursa, the team there is leading much of the open source development for those projects. Read more on the Government of BC’s investment in verifiable credentials and digital wallet technologies <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2022/08/23/investing-in-verifiable-credentials-technical-interoperability-and-open-source">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This update provides additional insights on the results of the “snapshot” mechanism currently being used to track the consistency of staked Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in the Consortia staking pool. Patrons staking EWT can use the tools provided at <a href="https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/">https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/</a> to check the status of their wallets and snapshots if applicable.</p> Snapshots and Variable EWT&nbsp;rewards <p>We published <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-token-ewt-consortia-relay-staking-snapshots-insights-32675cdd20db">this blog post</a> that includes a detailed technical analysis of the previous 2 snapshots, together with an explanation of the snapshots mechanism and variable staking rewards. To summarize the mechanics, the Energy Web Consortia staking pool tracks the consistency of staking by taking snapshots of staking balances at random points in&nbsp;time.</p><p>Users who stake consistently, based on the snapshot date, will earn additional rewards from the staking pool. The additional rewards are designed to incentivize consistent staking, as EWT staking will be a major contributor to the cybersecurity of upcoming Energy Web solutions for enterprises.</p> Snapshot 3 Balance&nbsp;Analysis <p>Snapshot 3 was taken on block #<a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/block/19190154/transactions">19190154</a> generated on July 29th at 09:24:50 PM +2 UTC. At this block, there were 6,822 wallets staking, which is 181 more wallets compared to Snapshot 2 and 414 more compared to Snapshot 1. The total balance of all EWT staked in the pool was equal to 6,047,363 EWT, an increase of 316,401 EWT compared to Snapshot 2 and 506,775 EWT more than at Snapshot&nbsp;1.</p><p>Here are the balances of Snapshot 3 (in green), 2 (in orange), and 1 (in blue). Wallets on the bottom, balance on the vertical&nbsp;axis:</p><p>The green spikes are wallets adding more EWT between snapshots 1 and 3. The dips are wallets withdrawing EWT. On the far right of the chart, there are green lines and no blue lines: these are the completely new wallets that didn’t participate in snapshots 1 or&nbsp;2.</p><p>During Snapshot 3, there were 181 more wallets staking EWT compared to Snapshot 2, and 414 more wallets compared to snapshot 1. Interestingly, there are 5 wallets that were staking EWT during Snapshot 1, withdrew their stake during snapshot 2, and are now staking during snapshot&nbsp;3.</p><p>Here’s the balance distribution comparison between snapshot 1, 2, and 3 balances. Bounds on the bottom, number of wallets in each category on the vertical&nbsp;scale:</p><p>We can see a slight increase in each category, except for the &lt;1,500–2,500) bound. The highest increase in staking occurred in the highest, &lt;2,500–3000&gt; bound: 84 new wallets staked between 2,500 and 3,000 ETW. For comparison, there were only 42 additional wallets staking under 500&nbsp;EWT.</p> Snapshot 3&nbsp;insights <p>EWT staking in the Consortia pool continues to be consistent, which is exactly the intention behind the design of the snapshot mechanism. This is evidenced by the balance distribution of all snapshots and <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/address/0x181A8b2a5AEb25941F6A79b4aE43dBb1968c417A/coin-balances#address-tabs">EWT balances in the staking contract</a>:</p><p>Such consistent staking will provide a high degree of economic cybersecurity to all enterprise-grade Energy Web solutions (for more information on the connection between consistent staking, cybersecurity, and Energy Web solutions, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">please review our announcement on the upcoming Consortia chain</a>).</p><p>Before the end of the year, there will be 3 more Snapshots taken at random blocks. Patrons who receive at least 1 Snapshot will qualify for additional rewards. The rewards will be calculated and distributed after the Consortia staking pool ends. Again, since variable rewards are impossible to predict, the best strategy for all patrons is to stake as high a balance as possible and do so consistently.</p><p>Also read: <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-token-ewt-consortia-relay-staking-snapshots-insights-32675cdd20db">Energy Web Token (EWT) Consortia Relay Staking Snapshots Insights part&nbsp;1</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcholod/">Michael Cholod,</a> Executive Director at the <a href="https://peer.social/">Peer Social Foundation</a>. Additional contributions made by members of DIACC’s Outreach Expert Committee.<br></p>



<p>Imagine being lost in the woods or walking down a dusty road with only the clothes on your back. What would you do? Thankfully, most of us have never had to ask this question and we should consider ourselves lucky. Unfortunately, this is the plight facing over 100 million people on Earth right now, including 13 million Ukrainians who have been forced to run for their lives to escape the horrible atrocities of war.</p>



<p>As well, millions have fled their communities to find refuge in more stable parts of their country. These people are called Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). And of course, millions of others have left their countries entirely and have become Refugees.</p>



<p>Convenience for us, Lifesaving for others</p>



<p>Most Refugees and IDPs did not have the time to properly prepare by gathering all their important documents such as passports, identity cards, driver’s licenses, and land titles or rental agreements. Fleeing your home may save your life, but fleeing without identity documents can lead to a very long wait – sometimes a decade or more – before your life is stable again. Imagine desperately trying to assert your identity to an overwhelmed volunteer who may not speak your language, hoping to convince them you actually exist.Your have lost your idenitty and you have to beg to be found.</p>



<p>Let’s say the conflict is over, you manage to convince an official who you are, and it’s finally time to go home. Upon return, you find that your house or rental flat has been destroyed, or some stranger is living there with a shiny new land title or rental agreement proclaiming they are the rightful owner.</p>



<p>It has taken ten years to re-establish your identity only to come home and find yourself homeless once again. The futility of living without an identity or without evidence of ownership or occupancy of your home, land, or property (HLP), has become a serious, global problem. UNHCR, IOM, NGOs like the Norwegian Refugee Council and western donor agencies like the World Bank and New America exist to help people in such need.Groups like the <a href="https://www.globalprotectioncluster.org/themes/housing-land-and-property/">Global Protection Cluster</a> have formed special entities to study the HLP problem. It turns out that Digital Identity is fundamental to the solution.</p>



<p>Digital Identity is essential</p>



<p>In Ukraine for example, there are 10 million citizens registered with the national digital identity program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diia">Diia</a>. Diia, which translates to ‘Action’ in English, is a mobile application that allows any Ukrainian citizen with a bank account to create, store, and register their identity and property ownership documents with the government. Since the Russian invasion of February 24, 2022, Diia even allows people to report war crimes and the movement of Russian troops from their mobile phone or computer.</p>



<p>Creating a digital record of your identity and property ownership or occupancy (HLP) makes you easier to find if you become undocumented since a digital copy of your life is safe with the government. Even if you must flee with only your smartphone or a set of credentials you’ve memorized, you can reclaim your identity and quickly file for compensation for damaged or destroyed HLP, and return home far sooner than those without digital credentials.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, digital identity platforms like Diia are not a panacea. Not everyone is registered for Diia. Not everyone has a bank account, a computer, a smartphone, or Internet access, nor the skills to use them. Russia is occupying not just physical territory in Ukraine, they are also occupying Ukrainian cyberspace so it is important that digital identity solutions like Diia are secured against malicious actors bent on stealing people’s identity.</p>



<p>For most people, embracing digital identity might be the difference between being lost and found. That is reason enough for everyone to embrace digital identity as soon as possible.You never know when an explosion, hurricane, forest fire or rising water might wash you and all your possessions away leaving your family homeless. A digital lifeline can be far more than just convenient.</p>

 Collective imaginings of what is possible (or desirable!) <p>In a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">previous post</a>, we looked at a typology of Open Source communities. This got us thinking about other indicators that could be plotted against one another on 2x2 grids. Tools like this are useful when deciding as a community how you want to interact.</p><p>The idea here is not to precisely define reality, but rather paint a broad-brushstroke picture of the kind of community that you want to create. Then you can think about kind of platforms, tools, and processes that might enable&nbsp;that.</p><p>Let’s start with an&nbsp;example:</p>CC BY&nbsp;WAO<p>In the above diagram, we’re plotting how formal the community is (or will be) against how private it is. LinkedIn, in the top-right quadrant, is an example of a ‘formal’ space that is based on reputation. It’s widely accepted as a ‘professional’ platform, and users are associated with their ‘real’ work identities.</p><p>So if you are creating a community that fits with this way of understanding the world, LinkedIn might be a great platform. However, if you’re creating a community where people prefer to remain anonymous and have an informal chat, you might use something in the bottom-left quadrant such as&nbsp;Reddit.</p><p>So let’s take another example. If we plot ‘Scale’ (as in how large you want the community to potentially get) with ‘Intentionality’ (i.e. deciding in advance what it’s for) then you might get something like&nbsp;this:</p><p>This is similar in some ways to the 2x2 grid from our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">previous post</a>, except it’s focused on social relationships rather than audience. Its value comes in being explicit about the goals of the community, all the while bearing in mind that groups can morph from one into&nbsp;another.</p><p>The reason this is important as it helps current and potential community members have a mental model of what’s going on, helping them be on the same page as their peers. Someone joining a ‘Club’ when they thought they were joining a ‘Movement’ is likely to be disappointed, and vice-versa.</p><p>During our brainstorming sessions around this, we came up with plenty of examples of X and Y axes you could use to plot 2x2 grids. We’re still thinking about this, but so far have three buckets around Interaction, Identity, and Intention.</p> Interaction   Infrequent posting vs Frequent&nbsp;posting  Maintaining existing relationships vs Building new relationships  Low support requirements vs High support requirements  Asynchronous vs Synchronous   Identity   Informal vs&nbsp;Formal  Anonymous vs Reputational  Social vs Professional  Single group identity vs Multiple groups /&nbsp;factions   Intention   Thematic vs Goal-oriented  Receiving updates vs&nbsp;Learning  Small scale vs Large&nbsp;scale  Place-based vs Non-geographical  <p>As ever when it comes to community work, it’s the conversations around these grids that are the most interesting. These are all different lenses you can use to imagine a new community or look at an existing one. At the end of the day, they do not describe ‘objective reality’ but rather collective imaginings of what is possible (or desirable!)</p><p>What other labels could you come up with? What other lenses can you produce to help you conceptualise your community? 🤔</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/using-2x2-grids-for-open-source-community-development-b3a3824b1682">Using 2x2 grids for Open Source community development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Towards a new typology of projects based on user and contributor growth <p>I’ve just finished reading <a href="https://literal.club/dajbelshaw/book/working-in-public-d4nqv">Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</a> by Nadia Eghbal (now <a href="https://nadia.xyz/">Nadia Asparouhova</a>). I discovered it via an a16z podcast episode entitled <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/open-source-communities-creators-rerun-_j2VDSSF">Learning from Open Source Communities</a>.</p><p>People often use the term ‘Open Source’ in a way that downplays the extremely heterogenous landscape:</p><blockquote>The term “open source” refers only to how code is distributed and consumed. It says nothing about how code is produced. “Open source” projects have nothing more in common with one another than “companies” do. All companies, by definition, produce something of value that is exchanged for money, but we don’t assume that every company has the same business model.&nbsp;(p.54)</blockquote><p>So if we can’t easily refer to ‘Open Source communities’ in general, how are we to understand them?</p><p>There are many different scenarios for Open Source projects and the communities around them. One of the most useful parts of Working in Public is a typology based around comparing user growth with contributor growth.</p>Original image from ‘Working in&nbsp;Public’<p>The version of this typology below is WAO’s interpretation, which flips the columns in the original to make the high contributor growth and high user growth appear in the top-right quadrant. This is to make it easier to read. We also rename ‘toy’ projects as ‘side’ projects to avoid being dismissive of some types of Open Source projects.</p>Image CC BY WAO, based on ‘Working in Public’ by Nadia&nbsp;Eghbal<p>Taking each in&nbsp;turn:</p>  🛹 Side projects — low contributor growth and low user growth. These kind of projects serve to scratch an itch or made just for fun. This is not to say that they can’t be used for more serious activities, but that the original intention wasn’t to scale. Usually, there’s only a single ‘project lead’ (although even that term seems a bit too formal) and it’s unlikely anyone else really uses the product. As a result, there doesn’t really need to be much governance.  👥️ Clubs — high contributor growth but low user growth. These kind of projects tend to be a group of people working on something that may be potentially niche but personally or professionally relevant. Most users in this scenario will also be contributors and they are collectively scratching an itch. There is likely to be more governance and collective decision-making necessary around this kind of&nbsp;project.  🏟️ Stadiums — low contributor growth but high user growth. These kind of projects tend to be either super-niche projects which nevertheless are relied on as infrastructure or popular projects because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction">parasocial</a> (i.e. one-sided) relationship between ‘creator’ and ‘audience’. Although there will be many ideas and suggestions as part of this community, in terms of governance it’s likely that a very small number of people, make the decisions.  🔱 Federations — high contributor growth and high user growth. These kind of projects tend to be larger and more mature projects which may be backed by an incorporated organisation. As a result, they are more likely to have a governance model which includes established procedures such as decision-making workflows.  <p>This quadrant-based approach is a broad-brushstroke attempt to roughly define how a project sits relative to others. The boundaries are&nbsp;fuzzy:</p><blockquote>The difference between these project models is not precisely defined. At either extreme, we can see clear differences. We can say that Linux, a project with multiple subprojects and working groups, does not look like tslib, a small helper library for the programming language TypeScript. But the middle is a little murky. There are some projects with four or five maintainers, and other projects with many contributors who are not deeply involved. (p.77)</blockquote><p>Eghbal’s focus is mainly on technical projects which are hosted on GitHub, but I think this is much more widely applicable to some of our client and community work. I’m looking forward to applying this as I think it helps clarify thinking around governance in particular.</p><p>For example, presenting the four different types of community around a project makes it easier to ask whether the project lead conceptualises the community as more of a club or a&nbsp;stadium?</p><p>If you need some help with your community, get in touch! WAO are specialists in the Venn diagram overlap between learning, technology, and community 🙂</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">How Open Source communities are evolving</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The DIACC’s mandate is to collaboratively develop and deliver resources to help Canadian’s to digitally transact with security, privacy, and convenience. The PCTF is one such resource and guides digital identity ecosystem interoperability by putting policy, standards, and technology into practice aligning with defined levels of assurance. The DIACC is a not-for-profit coalition of members from the public and private sector who are making a significant and sustained investment in accelerating<a href="https://diacc.ca/2019/02/26/canadas-digital-identity-ecosystem/"> </a><a href="https://diacc.ca/2019/02/26/canadas-digital-identity-ecosystem/">Canada’s Identity Ecosystem</a>.</p>



<p>Context:</p>



<p>The purpose of this review is to ensure transparency in the development and diversity of a truly Pan-Canadian, and international, input. In alignment with our<a href="https://diacc.ca/principles/"> </a><a href="https://diacc.ca/principles/">Principles for an Identity Ecosystem</a>, processes to respect and enhance privacy are being prioritized through every step of the PCTF development process.</p>



<p>DIACC expects to modify and improve these Final Recommendations based upon public comments. Comments made during the review will be considered for incorporation into the next iteration and DIACC will prepare a Disposition of Comments to provide transparency with regard to how each comment was handled.</p>

<p>Part of our work at The Engine Room includes helping partners and peers with questions they have around tech and data. Since a lot of organisations come to us with similar concerns, we have compiled some of the key questions we get asked in the following FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions).&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we won’t go into deep detail in each answer, we will try and point you in a direction to take next. Check out our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Light-Touch Support</a> programme if you have more questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This work was made possible by <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/supporting-organisations-to-navigate-digital-transitions/">support from the Sigrid Rausing Trust</a>.</p>



  
<p>Before we get started, what do we mean by data? And technology? Odds are, you’re working with both!&nbsp;<br><br>We define data as information that needs to be processed, organised and structured for the sake of usability. In other words, by data we mean the information that you hold, such as details about the communities you work with, findings from research you have done, results from surveys, email addresses and contact information for supporters, and so on. <br><br>We understand technology as the tools, systems, methods and processes that capitalise on the computational power to manage, analyse and communicate information. For this resource, when we talk about technology, we mean digital tools, broadly. Anything from email platforms and messenger apps to website hosts, email newsletter platforms, CRMs, databases, algorithmic processes and more.</p>
  



  
 
 
   
 
 
  



  
 



 Frequently Asked Questions about Tech &amp; Data 
  



  
 Initial explorations – getting a feel for your own tech &amp; data landscape 



  Q1: <a>Our peers seem to be using more tech/data. Should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well?</a>  Q2: <a>How can my team and I learn more about tech and how it’s relevant to our work?</a>  Q3: <a>My organisation thinks it’s time to start using more tech and data in our work. Where do we start?</a>  Q4: <a>How can I make sure that the tech tools and data we’re using are actually useful for our work?</a>  



 Making decisions – making sure the data &amp; tech you use matches your values and mission 



  Q5: <a>How do we make decisions around adopting new tools and/or collecting data?</a>  Q6: <a>My organisation wants to integrate new tech but we haven’t found the right tool. Should we build a new tool ourselves?</a>  Q7: <a>How can I use tech/data if my access to the internet or to electricity is unreliable?</a>  Q8: <a>How do I work with external developers and/or technologists?</a>  Q9: <a>How can my organisation make online collaboration work better for us?</a>  



 Centering safety and care 



  Q10: <a>How can I make sure my whole team is using the tools (or data processes) that we’ve picked?</a>  Q11: <a>What can we do to keep people safer when we start using different tech tools and data practices?</a>  
  



 



 Initial explorations – getting a feel for your own tech &amp; data landscape 



 Q1: Our peers seem to be using more tech/data. Should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well? 



<p>The answer here will really depend on context. Tech can support you to organise daily work and operations, enable safer and more secure communication, collect and manage information, and cut costs and free up resources, among other things. But if used ineffectively or non-strategically, tech can also compromise your ability to do your work safely and effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if your organisation is collecting first-hand accounts of human rights violations in areas with low internet/mobile connectivity, adopting a data collection tool that requires an internet connection will make your work difficult and negatively impact your ability to carry out your mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Used non-strategically, tech can also expose you, and those you work with, to new vulnerabilities and risks. For instance, if you’re in a context where government surveillance of civil society is common and you’re using tools that don’t adequately protect your communications, that may compromise your work and safety.</p>



<p>To make sure that you use tech strategically and responsibly, take some time to think about how adopting new tech or collecting more data could strengthen or weaken your work. Before adopting any new tools or platform, try to build up your internal capacity, connect with peers or other organisations you respect.</p>

 Q2: How can my team and I learn more about tech and how it’s relevant to our work?&nbsp; 



<p>Digital technologies evolve quickly, as do debates and conversations about the potential benefits and harms of using specific tools and platforms. When trying to learn more about tech, we find it’s most useful to focus on two things:&nbsp;</p>



  Work to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">slowly and incrementally build up staff technical intuition</a>, making it a team-wide priority as much as possible (as opposed to a one-person job).  Instead of looking for <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/">shiny new tools</a>, try to identify how tech and data could <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/">strengthen your core work</a> first.  



<p>When it comes to new tools and applications, there is a lot of information online that can be enticing — but it can be hard to identify what is relevant to you, and what isn’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To more easily make sense of tech-related information, start with the challenge you’re trying to understand or address first. Additionally, if you can, reach out to like-minded practitioners who might have similar contexts or missions to yours and learn more about what tools they’re using (and what their successes and challenges have been!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Related questions: <br>– <a title="Q1">Our peers seem to be using more tech/data, should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well?</a><br>– <a title="Q3">My organisation thinks it’s time to start using more tech and data in our work. Where do we start?</a><br>– <a>How do we make decisions around adopting new tools and/or collecting data?</a></p>

 <a>Back to the top</a> 
 



<p></p>



 Q3: My organisation thinks it’s time to start using more tech and data in our work. Where do we start?&nbsp; 



<p>First get a clear overview of what you’re already using! Most organisations are already using at least some tech and data to support their work – from day-to-day tools such as email or instant messaging, to CRM tools and databases. Below, is a short list of questions that can serve as an initial exercise to map the ways you’re using tech and data for your work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note: Some of the information you gather as part of this mapping exercise may be sensitive: before you start, make sure your notes are stored in a safe place and only shared with people who need access.</p>



  What tools are you currently using for your work?&nbsp;  What platforms/tools do you and your team communicate with? These could include email, instant messaging, social media, SMS, and websites, to name a few.  How do you store and manage your files and documents? Which platforms do you use? Does everyone on your team use the same platforms?  Are you working on public campaigns or a part of collective efforts with other organisations? If yes, what tools do you use for activism, organising and community building?  Are you working with any databases or research platforms?    



  How are you using data?&nbsp;  What type of data/information do you collect or generate day-to-day? Think about your individual and collective workflows and list the moments at which you collect or generate data. For example, collecting contact information for people you have interviewed, having discussions over email or Whatsapp, taking interview or meeting notes, or conducting surveys with communities.  Where do you store data? Consider the data you currently have and list all the places it lives (make sure to include all your remote locations – &nbsp;emails, shared documents, and so on).&nbsp;  When and how do you share data? Think about times when you need to share data: when does it usually happen, who do you share this with and what tools do you use? For example, you might be sending spreadsheets or PDFs over email, sharing documents and meeting minutes via Google Docs, or sharing passwords via a messaging app.&nbsp;    



<p>These are initial exploratory questions.&nbsp; For a complete version of this mapping exercise, see <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/">Becoming RAD!</a> (published in 2021), or <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">reach out to our team</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, adopting new tools takes time and resources. Make sure to give yourself and your team dedicated spaces to learn unfamiliar tools, practice behaviours and get up to speed with new data being used.</p>



<p>Related questions: <br>– <a title="Q1">Our peers seem to be using more tech/data, should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well?</a><br>– <a>How can my team and I learn more about tech and how it’s relevant to our work?</a></p>

<p></p>



 Q4: How can I make sure that the tech tools and data we’re using are actually useful for our work? 



<p>In our work supporting civil society organisations, we are often faced with <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">assumptions that digital means better</a>, and that any tech solution will lead to increased efficiency, effectiveness and impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this isn’t always the case. When we’re working with a partner more intensively, we often start with an assessment of how their tech and data use currently maps on to their work and context.&nbsp; This can help us figure out how, or even if, the way they’re using tech is strengthening their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After mapping out what tools the organisation is using and what data is collected, stored and shared, we go through a second layer of questions: How useful is all of this (or how useful could it be ) in the context of your work:&nbsp;</p>



  What is the core social or political problem you are working on?&nbsp;&nbsp;  Is your use of tech and data supporting you in addressing that problem? If yes, how? If not, why do you think that could be happening?&nbsp;  Is your day-to-day use of tech and data helping you connect with individuals or organisations important to your work?  Is the way you use tech and data impacting your workload? Is it making your work easier or is it creating unsustainable amounts of work for the team? Do you enjoy using your organisational tools?&nbsp;

 Q5. How do we make decisions around adopting new tools and/or collecting data?&nbsp; 



<p>There’s a lot to think about when selecting a tool, and there are many options out there – including many that you may not know about yet. So how do you start narrowing down (or expanding) your options?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2017, based on research we did on tool selection in civil society organisations, we created an <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/alidade-interactive-guide-for-finding-technology-tools/">interactive tool-selection guide called Alidade</a>, which takes organisations through questions that can help them decide what kind of technology tool would fit with their project or organisational needs. We recommend trying it out!.</p>



<p>In general, when organisations are looking for new tech tools, we have found the following guidelines to be beneficial:</p>



  Research the people, the problem, and then the technology. Look into the overall problem where you think a technology tool could help. Think about your intended audience. Do research and look at different options for what technology options are available.&nbsp;  Think twice before you build. Look for existing tools that can do what you need. Building a completely new tool can be complex and risky.  Get a second opinion. Someone else has probably tried a similar approach before you. Find them, and ask for advice.  Always take it for a test drive. Try out at least two tools, with the people you want to use it, before choosing. Trialling highlights problems at the start. It also raises questions you never knew you had.  Plan for failure. You will not get it right the first time. Budget and plan to make regular adjustments to the tool throughout the project.  Reflect on what you’re doing. Keep thinking about what is and isn’t working. Apply what you learn to your organisation’s work, and share with other organisations.  



<p>Make sure that the tools you choose also fit your security needs. When evaluating a tool’s security, consider the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  What is the tool’s data privacy policy? What kind of data does the tool collect and who is that data shared with? Who has access to any data stored within the tool?&nbsp;  Is the tool’s approach to privacy and security well-documented? What can you find out about the tool’s privacy and security record?&nbsp;  



<p>Document and discuss your findings with your colleagues before making a final decision on a tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Related questions: <br>– <a>Our peers seem to be using more tech/data, should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well?</a><br>– <a>How can my team and I learn more about tech and how it’s relevant to our work?&nbsp;</a></p>

 Q6: My organisation wants to integrate new tech but we haven’t found the right tool. Should we build a new tool ourselves? 



<p>If you are familiar with our work, you probably know we often advocate for adapting existing tools for your own needs where possible (we call this ‘tool re-use’).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research in this area over the last few years has shown that re-using and adapting existing tools can have a number of advantages, like more efficient use of financial resources and increasing access to support in implementation and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building a tool from scratch, on the other hand, can be a resource-consuming, lengthy process that can lead to disappointment: We’ve seen how tools can end up being ineffective or under-used, be unexpectedly costly, or demand intensive resources to be maintained or updated.</p>



<p>But if the functionality your organisation is looking for just can’t be found, and you are considering building a new tool, here are a few questions to reflect on:</p>



  Is there a real, identifiable need for this tool? Will this get you closer to your long-term goals? Would building a tool respond to a strong need that has come up in your work, or has the idea come about in other ways?  Do you have the resources needed to build the tool, maintain it over the long term and provide continued support to those who will be using it?  What is your vision for the tool over the long term? Could the needs or problems that the tool is being built to address potentially evolve over time?&nbsp;

 Q7. How can I use tech/data if my access to the internet or to electricity is unreliable? 



<p>If you are struggling with intermittent internet access, consider adopting tools that allow you to work both online and offline. In Google Docs, for example, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6388102?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">enable offline access to documents.</a> This will allow you to continue with your work offline, and then sync documents once connectivity is restored. Some data collection and management tools, such as <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo ToolBox</a>, also allow you to collect data on devices when you have no connectivity and then upload data to the server once the network is available. For online meetings in low connectivity settings, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> is a free, open source and lightweight option for audio-only calls.</p>



<p>If your organisation’s budget allows for it, we also recommend investing in a backup connection: for example, a mobile network connection to connect your devices to when your broadband connection is not available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two ways to do this:&nbsp; Use a mobile internet modem, or use a dedicated smartphone to create a mobile hotspot where other devices can connect and share the mobile connectivity. Here is a brief tutorial on <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915">how to create a mobile hotspot on an Android smartphone</a>. You can limit the amount of data used by sharing the access password with only critical devices or users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In cases when the internet connection and/or electricity are intermittent and you are working online, make sure to save your work as frequently as possible, to minimise the risk of losing work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you experience electricity shortages often, acquiring a backup generator can be a useful option, as long as you have organisational resources to do so.</p>

 Q8. How do I work with external developers and/or technologists?&nbsp; 



<p>There are many different types of external experts you can work with. Common types of external consultants/experts who interact with technology or data include:</p>



  User experience (UX) designer: Works with both clients (in this case, that’s you!) and users to design a product that satisfies multiple needs and is easy to understand and operate.&nbsp;  Visual or Graphic Designer: Oversees the graphic elements that a website, tool, app or publication will use, and is responsible for designing the visual identity (or branding). They often work with the UX designer to make sure that the visual identity works well for users, too.  Illustrator: Creates illustrations, icons, infographics and more, which will live within the larger structure that the Visual Designer and UX Designer have created.  Frontend Developer: Implements the design on a website, tool or app. In particular, is able to code the aspects that users will see and interact with.&nbsp;  Backend Developer: Develops and connects a database to the frontend (the parts of the website, app or tool that a user can see) and does all the non-visible tasks that will fill the frontend with dynamic content.&nbsp;  Data Analyst/Scientist: Extracts patterns from large volumes of data. They may also be equipped with the tools and knowledge to create visualisations of data in order to communicate important patterns.  Sysadmin/DevOps: Maintains the servers where the website, tool or app lives. They’re often responsible for coordinating the troubleshooting necessary if users encounter bugs or errors.  



<p>Sometimes roles can overlap: for example, you could hire a consultant who leads the design and development of a website, or a developer who is capable of working on both the frontend and backend.</p>



<p>Before hiring external developers and technologists, it’s helpful to:&nbsp;</p>



  Be clear about why you want to build or adopt new tools.  Identify the resources you have and those you will need.  Remember to plan for long-term maintenance.&nbsp;  



<p>At the beginning of your work together, it’s important to establish common ground and a shared terminology about needs and expectations. We recommend developing a ToR (Terms of Reference) in order to document and share project needs and requirements. The ToR should cover at minimum:</p>



  &nbsp;The available project budget  &nbsp;The necessary timeline  &nbsp;Your goals  &nbsp;Your expectations for the external partner  Any additional information  



<p>You should also agree on tools, channels for communication, and roles and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this can greatly contribute to project success early on. Some “do’s” when working with consultants once the work is underway are:&nbsp;</p>



  Focus on clarity of organisational goals, big processes and milestones in order to better support the team/project.  Provide relevant and timely feedback.  Provide space and respect for the consultant’s expertise.  Try to be responsive with communications.

 Q9. My organisation does a lot of our work online, but our collaboration doesn’t always work so smoothly.&nbsp; How can we make online collaboration work better for us? 



<p>We know first hand that when it comes to collaborating online, finding the right way to communicate is essential – both to working smoothly and to overall well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, your team will have a selection of tools or channels to use (for example, a mix of secure chat apps, email and project management tools), but it’s important that each of these has a clear role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often, our partners are using so many different tools that they feel overwhelmed any time they need to share a document, idea or message. If this is the case for your organisation, take some time to quickly write down all the different tools people communicate through – it could include apps like Signal and Whatsapp, messaging platforms like Slack and Mattermost, online CRMs like Salesforce, VOIP tools like Skype, Zoom or Jitsi Meet, and collaboration tools like Trello, Airtable, Asana and others. Perhaps you also use SMS messages and phone calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you have this list, we suggest getting together with your colleagues, or the people you collaborate with most often, to agree to trying to use fewer tools. Assign each tool with a specific purpose: for example, perhaps email is for longer messages that aren’t time sensitive, or for sharing documents, whereas messaging programmes are only for urgent questions or friendly conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you’ve identified a few things that work, document it! Documentation will make sure that everyone is on the same page and will be a great reference for anyone new joining the team or for just remaining aware of processes/projects.</p>

 Centering safety and care&nbsp; 



 Q10: How can I make sure my whole team is using the tools (or data processes) that we’ve picked? 



<p>Even when we’re excited about a new tech tool or process for using data, actually adopting new ways of working is difficult. At the same time, making sure that we’re using the agreed-on tools (and their relevant safety or security protocols) is an important way in which we can practise care towards one another in organisations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One step to take to help each other adopt a new way of working is to make sure the new tool or protocol responds to a concrete need and that everyone knows what that need is. This means everyone knows that by putting in the work to learn the new tool, they will be closer to a solution to an issue they’ve been facing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, it’s important to manage expectations – changes might be felt little-by-little, over time, as more people use a tool or protocol and get familiar with it. That’s part of the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, because it’s a process, it’s good to leave space and time for learning, adaptation and discussion when a new tool is rolled out. Depending on what else is going on, capacities for learning something new can vary across teams, and giving space can be the best way to recognise this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, listening to the experiences of those using the new tool can help you spot ways you might want to tweak the tool itself if you can, or tweak how it’s being applied.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



 Q11: What can we do to keep people safer when we start using different tech tools and data practices? 



<p>Many of the people we speak with are curious about how to incorporate safety and care in all the work they do – especially when it comes to new tech and data initiatives. As we see things like data leaks and hacked tools in the news, in our communities, and in our own experiences, safely adopting tools or tech processes can feel daunting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One approach that can help provide grounding is that of Responsible Data (RD): the idea that we share a “collective duty to account for unintended consequences of working with data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some areas to explore that fall under the RD umbrella are:&nbsp;</p>



  Practices like data minimisation (only collecting the data you need).  Concepts like consent (ensuring that people are able to agree to how their data will be used in a freely-given, specific, informed and revocable way).&nbsp;  Related spaces like organisational security (a rich area of practice around setting protocols that can help build data/information security and physical well-being and security).  



<p>If you’re not familiar with these kinds of practices, there are resources that can help – from online guides to practitioner support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Selecting tools that prioritise your security can be another step to take. Often, these tools aren’t as widely used as their less-secure counterparts, so this could be an opportunity to consult with like-minded peers, or to contact an external technologist who you trust. Some of these tools could include:</p>



  Password managers: Creating strong, unique passwords is a fundamental part of using technology more safely. Password managers can both keep track of your passwords and help you create good passwords.&nbsp; <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords">Learn more here</a>.  Safer communications tools: Many messages that we send digitally are not encrypted, meaning that if someone were to intercept them, they could read the contents. Safer communications tools offer encryption, making it harder for people to read the contents of your messages. You can <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures">learn more here</a>, or reach out to us for support on adopting new tools.  Virtual private networks: A VPN (virtual private network) is a tool that can help protect your web activity from surveillance on the internet network you’re using. Picking the right VPN – and knowing its limitations – is crucial, and depends on the context you’re within (what country you’re in, what VPN you choose, etc.). At the same time, choosing the right VPN for your situation can be complex, so <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you">gather some information here</a> and don’t hesitate to reach out to us for support.&nbsp;  



<p>Always keep in mind that security is a mix of both tools and practices. It’s important to have the right tools, but it’s just as important to use these tools in the right way, and to build strong internal practices around security in general, taking into account physical and psychological safety as well.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>When I first started this site a few years back Scotland’s Blockchain industry was non-existent. 
 Given it’s critical role as a foundation technology for a digital society this was disappointing and concerning. 
<p>On <a href="https://podcasts.scot/episode/scotland-europes-blockchain-capital/">a podcast</a> in 2021 Zumopay stated the lofty ambition for Scotland to become Europe’s Blockchain capital, and this would have seemed like nothing more than a pipe dream.</p>
<p>However when you consider the evolution of the sector over just the last year or two, you can see that the roots have formed such that this is actually now an achievable goal.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
 
 Zumopay themselves are of course a keynote exemplar. Just one year on from their £1.3m seed round <a href="https://zumo.money/press_releases/zumo-reports-100x-user-growth/">they reported</a> a 100x year on year user growth, are pioneering the <a href="https://zumo.money/press_releases/zumo-receives-government-funding-to-continue-crypto-decarbonisation-push/">decarbonization of crypto</a>, and <a href="https://zumo.money/press_releases/zumo-launches-first-full-stack-b2b-crypto-as-a-service-platform/">have launched</a>&nbsp;a B2b ‘Crypto-as-a-Service’ platform. 
 CD Corp is making the very smart move to specialize in helping small businesses integrate NFT’s into their business model. Following on from their <a href="https://digitalscot.net/whisky-on-the-blockchain/">Whisky Barrel client win</a> they just <a href="https://twitter.com/cdcorp__/status/1573000432317878272">announced a new project</a> with Aberfam. 
 In Nov 2020 <a href="https://siccar.net/siccar-connects-with-par-equity-to-secure-a-1-3m-investment-round/">Siccar raised</a> a £1.3m funding round, and in July 2021 Blockchain Technology Partners <a href="https://medium.com/blockchaintp/blockchain-technology-partners-raises-2-million-seed-round-led-by-force-over-mass-and-signature-865e346ece10">raised £2m</a>. Both specialize in the massive enterprise Blockchain market, addressing requirements such as secure data sharing and distributed ledger, smart contract, provenance, and cloud technologies. 
 Nov 2021 – Carbon Based Lifeforms <a href="https://scottishgames.net/2021/11/16/project-gateway-returns-with-1-7m-funding-for-blockchain-based-mmo/">launched</a> as a new game studio with $1.7m funding, announcing Project Gateway, a MMO/RPG underpinned by a Bitcoin and NFT asset-based play-to-earn, player-owned market economy. 
 Executives from one of Scotland’s giant tech successes Fanduel have also expanded into the sector, launching <a href="https://vault.fan/">Vault</a> and <a href="https://www.betdex.com/">BetDEX</a>. Both are innovating atop the Solana Blockchain platform, building a creator platform where fans unlock access to exclusive content by owning the key to a creator’s vault and a decentralized sports betting exchange. 
 
<p>A relatively short list but the breadth and depth of these ventures is considerable, each market they serve alone is very large, from enterprise technologies through global betting.&nbsp;BetDEX in particular is the heavyweight player, raising a massive <a href="https://www.betdex.com/post/former-fanduel-executives-launch-betdex">$21m seed round</a> from world-class investors and leading the development of the <a href="https://beststartup.scot/monaco-protocol-provides-foundation-for-web3-sports-betting-applications/">Monaco sports betting protocol</a>.</p>
 What more can we do? 
<p>Given this leap from nothing to a very significant industry footprint it begs the question what more can we do? If this is ‘first gear’ for Scotland’s Blockchain industry, what would it look like to step up through gears two, three and beyond, what benefits would that bring and how can we make it happen?</p>
<p>Naturally each is focused on their individual business success, but what could be achieved if we consolidated our efforts to grow their collective success and further expand the industry as a whole?</p>

 The single most important project relative to the goals of the Scottish Blockchain Network has been pioneered by <a href="https://www.thewhiskybarrel.com/">The Whisky Barrel</a> and their tech experts <a href="https://cdcorp.co.uk/">CD Corp</a>. 
<p>It’s so important because the primary challenge the industry faces is that it can be an extremely confusing, jargon-filled sector, to the extent it’s perceived as a very cliquey community populated only by hard-core techies and is thus inaccessible, and critically, irrelevant to others especially businesses.</p>
<p>Therefore’s it’s essential to showcase case studies that explain in plain english how businesses are adopting the technology, what use case it has been employed for and what benefits this has brought the company.</p>
<p>The Whisky Barrel project demonstrates i) how they have integrated it into and enhanced their e-commerce strategy, and ii) the technology field is still so young that it’s possible to achieve world firsts, and thus significant competitive advantage and associated PR potential.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/scotch-whisky-bottler-releases-one-26433299">Insider reported</a> they have released one of the world’s first single-cask Scotch whiskies with a digital provenance certificate, using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to digitally certify its whisky, which securely transmits essential product information on a public ledger, helping collectors and connoisseurs alleviate the risk of investing in counterfeit whisky.</p>
<p>Each of the 152 individually-numbered bottles feature a unique QR code that links to its corresponding digital certificate.

<p>In July, we published our report exploring the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-report-at-the-confluence-of-digital-rights-climate-justice/">intersections of digital rights, tech, and climate justice</a>. It’s been wonderful to hear from readers on what findings from our research you’ve found useful for your own work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’d like to keep the exchange going with an interactive discussion sharing our main findings and collaboratively plotting a course for further future work in this urgent area, so we’re hosting a community call October 18, at 5-6pm CET. Whether you’re working primarily in the climate justice space or the digital rights space, or are just interested in the topic, we’d love to see you there!&nbsp;</p>



 What will we discuss? 



<p>In our research, we focused on a number of intersections of digital rights and climate justice, and identified priority areas for further digital rights engagement and collaboration. In the call, we want to hone in on two 2 specific issue areas with you:</p>



  Climate intelligence: From long-standing environmental data initiatives to newer ‘AI for climate’ and ‘AI for planet’ efforts, governments, corporations and communities seek to harness digital data to monitor biodiversity and forecast future climate events with greater accuracy. How do you think the digital rights community can best support existing community-driven efforts and deepen its engagement on AI and sustainability issues? How might <a href="https://responsibledata.io/2018/01/24/rd-101-responsible-data-principles/" title="responsible data principles">responsible data principles</a> contribute to data governance discussions in this space?  Decarbonizing tech: In recent years, a number of tech companies have pledged carbon neutrality and greater sustainability. Yet, meaningfully measuring and mitigating the climate and environmental impacts of tech remains a challenge. What do you think are the main priorities for digital rights community engagement to ensure tech sustainability efforts are supporting climate justice?&nbsp;  



<p>To register for this session, please <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZElcu6rqTsiE9z0boxWoZPyIMeMZTb0l21D">sign up here</a>. The call will happen on October 18, at 5-6pm CET and it will be held in English.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This article explains how verifiable credentials can be used to benefit event organizers and visitors alike based on a practical usage of the Lissi&nbsp;team.</p> Introduction <p>Currently, the majority of event tickets are issued in paper form or as&nbsp;.pdf files, which contain the relevant information about the event as well as the visitor. However, since these files can be easily transferred to another person, a personalisation of the ticket in combination with a verification of an identity document at the entrance is required to ensure that the buyer and visitor are the same person. This creates unnecessary overhead and complications for both the visitor and organizer. Therefore, we propose using verifiable credentials to avoid ticket scalping and provide direct access to online resources with the&nbsp;ticket.</p> Benefits of using verifiable credentials for&nbsp;tickets   Ownership binding and verifiability — tickets are bound to a specific owner and are not transferable  Prevention of ticket fraud — tickets are digitally signed by an&nbsp;issuer  Usage of the ticket for authentication (e.g. to access a digital stream, online presentations etc.) — Your ticket is your username and password!  Avoiding ticket scalping and ticket bots and therefore retain control over the secondary market — tickets are bound to a specific person and are not transferable  Directly communicate with a user in a messenger like way — a peer-to-peer connection between the event organizer or ticketing provider is being established and can be used for the exchange of further information  Cheap and convenient user identification and the possibility to verify multiple credentials at the same time (e.g. ticket, covid test, studentID, etc.)   How it&nbsp;works: <p>The user registers for an event via a website. For our pilot integration we used an established ticketing provider for the registration process. However, this process can also be fully executed based on decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. We sent an e-mail containing the required steps to derive the ticket into a wallet, which supports verifiable credentials. The following screens illustrate the process of receiving the ticket and presenting it to a verifier such as an access control authority at a physical&nbsp;event.</p>Illustration of the user flow of using the event ticket with&nbsp;Lissi. The verification process <p>As illustrated in the flow the access authority presents an QR-code, which is scanned by the visitor. Once scanned with the wallet, the visitor is requested to share his or her ticket (as well as additional information if required). Given the visitor agrees to share the information the verification status (valid / invalid) is presented as well as the attributes of the ticket. The access authority can use any device, which supports a web application (such as an laptop, mobile phone etc.) to verify the tickets of the&nbsp;visitor.</p> Our experience with verifiable tickets <p>We used verifiable tickets as part of our monthly <a href="https://neosfer.de/events">Between the Towers</a> event series. It was visited by around 70 people. While the download of the Lissi Wallet and derivation of the verifiable ticket was optional, more than 90 percent of visitors got the verifiable ticket in advance. While there were minor user experience issues (mainly due to work profiles on the phone) the vast majority of visitors were very satisfied with the user experience.</p><p>During the verification process most of the users started to show the verifiable credential within the wallet instead of directly scanning the QR-code presented, because the concept of scanning a QR-code to present a credential isn’t intuitive to users yet. However, once users present a credential with the wallet they understand how the process&nbsp;works.</p> Possible expansion for future&nbsp;events:   Identification of the visitor in advance of the ticket purchase.  Issuance of a picture of the visitor as part of the&nbsp;ticket.  Usage of the ticket for the authentication (login) to an online platform.  Communication with the&nbsp;visitor  Provision of further information to the visitor via direct communication channel  Usage of the ticket for discounted access (e.g. 10 % discount for the ticket next&nbsp;year)  <p>If you are interested in diving deeper into the topic, the research paper “<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12525-022-00573-9.pdf">Exploring the use of self‑sovereign identity for event ticketing systems</a>” by Simon Feulner, Johannes Sedlmeir, Vincent Schlatt and Nils Urbach will provide a great overview.</p><p>We would be delighted to hear your ideas about the usage of verifiable tickets in your next events.

<p>The digital and physical world are merging more than ever before. As the supply chain becomes more ‘phygital,’ innovative ways of sharing data – like using verifiable credentials – are helping to build more trust with data along the supply chain. Join us as we chat with Senior VP of Innovation &amp; Partnerships at GS1 US, Melanie Nuce, as we explore what’s around the corner and how standards play a crucial part in the phygital supply chain.</p>

<p>It’s a great pleasure to share with you&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/09/DINZ-Reflections-on-Select-Committee-Report-DISTF-1.pdf">DINZ Reflections Report</a>, a seminal piece of work that DINZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/dinz-distf-working-group/">Digital Identity Trust Framework working group</a>&nbsp;has developed over several months. While Trust Frameworks are not a novel concept, their application to the digital identity space is much more recent, and new to Aotearoa.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/09/DINZ-Reflections-on-Select-Committee-Report-DISTF-1.pdf">DINZ’s Reflections Report</a>&nbsp;is industry’s response to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/reports/document/SCR_122616/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">Final Report</a>&nbsp;published in April by the Select Committee members of the Economic Development, Science and Innovation Committee that responds to and makes recommendations based on the submissions made on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/LMS459583.html?src=qs">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Bil</a>l at the end of last year. The Select Committee is not expert in the subject matter of Digital Identity Trust Frameworks. However DINZ does have essential subject matter and operational expertise with an inherent obligation to share its experience for better outcomes in Aotearoa. DINZ welcomes the continued passage of the bill through Parliament recognising that the opportunity to change it substantially during this period is small. It is more likely that the detail contained in the DINZ Reflections Report will be considered once the regulatory operation of the Act is underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a classic example of the demonstrable value of DINZ – Aotearoa’s own digital identity industry association – and for that matter all associations operating under the&nbsp;<a href="https://techalliance.nz/">NZ Tech Alliance</a>&nbsp;banner. DINZ’s members comprise both local and international digital identity service providers, providers of identity and eligibility attributes, relying parties and individual subject matter experts. Many have first-hand overseas experience of Trust Framework operations in digital identity and in other domains that can inform the future of Trust Framework operations and conversations around&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2022/07/15/leading-the-digital-trust-conversation/">Digital Trust</a>&nbsp;more broadly in Aotearoa.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Be it submissions, responses to consultation papers, or reports like this&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/09/DINZ-Reflections-on-Select-Committee-Report_DISTF.pdf">Reflections Report</a>, each participating member leaves their vested interest at the door to voluntarily pool their skills and knowledge in pursuit of better outcomes for all New Zealanders.</p>

<p>New Leadership to Prioritize Innovation to Advance Open Collaboration Initiatives</p> 


<p>20 September 2022 – OASIS Open, the global open source and standards consortium, announced Francis Beland as its Executive Director. A business builder and advisor, Beland brings more than 25 years of experience helping companies identify breakthroughs and elevate technical agendas, products, and achievements. He will utilize his open innovation background to drive new partnerships, ideas, and expertise to the wide range of open collaboration projects at OASIS.</p>



<p>“We welcome Francis Beland’s leadership, vision, and relationship-building experience,” said Gershon Janssen, chair of the OASIS Board of Directors. “His in-depth knowledge from different perspectives as an open innovation entrepreneur will be invaluable to the OASIS community.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout his career, Francis has served as partner at Global Accelerated Ventures and Oceans.Studio, E-TRON Technologies, and Deloitte/Monitor Group focusing on research, development, and commercialization of breakthrough technologies. In addition, he was vice president at the XPRIZE Foundation, where he led numerous innovation projects. Francis has helped organizations engineer Open Innovation practices into their ecosystem that bolstered innovation, transformed mindsets, and unlocked possibilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s an exciting time to step into this role, and I’m grateful to have the opportunity to expand the OASIS community,” Beland said. “As Executive Director, my goals are to leverage OASIS Open’s systems to help governmental organizations and Fortune 500s alike change their thinking, enhance their strategic initiatives, and envision a world of possibility that hasn’t existed before. Working closely with OASIS members to continue advancing the organization’s goals while focusing on growing the membership base, will ultimately lead to a stronger and more collaborative OASIS community.”</p>



<p>In addition to his background developing large-scale innovation programs in healthcare, automotive, biotech, medical devices, governments, oil &amp; gas and energy industries, Francis was an innovation advisor to Facebook, the United Nations, and the European Commission, and served as an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at the White House for the Food and Drug Administration.</p>



<p>As Executive Director, Beland leads an international staff that supports the collaboration of its members in more than 100 countries who are committed to advancing work across a broad technical agenda.</p>

<p>Nearly one billion people on earth lack any form of widely recognized identity.</p><p>Let me say that again…a billion people! Looked at another way, that is one person in eight alive today living without any official record of their existence.</p><p>These individuals are mostly women and children, the majority are poor, and many are refugees or displaced persons. Their status — or rather, lack of official status — represents a constant barrier to participation in modern social, economic, and political life.</p><p>Many of us are lucky enough to live in countries where we have multiple forms of ID; a driver’s license or transit pass, which enables us to get where we need to go, a work ID to access our place of employment, credit or debit cards to make purchases, health ID cards to receive medical care, logins to access our work, financial, and social media accounts, and more. We use them without thinking about it and generally take them for&nbsp;granted.</p><p>But, if you want to get a sense of what life is like without a formal identity, try leaving all your forms of ID at home for one day. It will open your&nbsp;eyes.</p><p>If you are lucky, you will make it to work without being pulled over by a police officer (caution: your day is likely to get much worse if you do). Without carrying a driver's license, you will probably be looking over your shoulder and driving more slowly and carefully, experiencing — though to a lesser degree — the fear and uncertainty that those without ID experience on a daily basis, across all of their activities. You may return home hungry because you were unable to pay for lunch, or do any of the other activities that require a credit card. And, hopefully, the security guard in the lobby recognizes you — or can call someone to admit you — otherwise, you might be heading home early to “work remotely.”</p><p>Seriously… try a day of not using any form ID to recognize just how much you depend on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Digital ID can be a powerful tool that both empowers individuals and protects their basic human rights and civil liberties.</p><p>Those who lack an official identity find it difficult or impossible to access basic services, such as education, employment, health care, and financial services. They are unable to exercise their rights as citizens and voters and participate in the modern economy. Giving these individuals an official identity unlocks countless opportunities.</p><p>Article Six of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.” Adopted in 1948, the Declaration defines a variety of rights to which we are all entitled; equal treatment before the law, dignity, nationality, privacy, education, mobility, and more. Being able to prove one’s identity is fundamental to the full exercise of these&nbsp;rights.</p><p>In 2015, the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDG 16.9) established a target of providing legal identity for all, including birth registration, by 2030. The UN, World Bank, and nations around the world have made admirable progress toward closing the “identity gap.” In a recent <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202208/un-expects-350m-more-people-worldwide-to-get-legal-identity-by-2025">Biometric Update 16.9 Podcast</a>, UNDP’s Niall McCann predicted that, by 2025, 350 million more people will have a recognized form of identity. This would be a remarkable accomplishment. But, from our perspective, closing the identity gap is necessary, but, ultimately, insufficient.</p><p>The world would be a simpler place if having an ID guaranteed these rights. Of course, it doesn’t. For some individuals who do have an ID — religious and ethnic minorities, political dissidents, for example — relying on a national ID system can have the opposite effect, making them more susceptible to exclusion, oppression, and persecution. For these individuals, alternative forms of ID are necessary to ensure that their rights — and, in some cases, their lives — are protected.</p><p>Done properly, “good ID” can help address both challenges, offering the promise of both empowerment and protection. And yet, all ID systems — digital or paper-based — come with attendant risks, which must be understood and intentionally mitigated through technology, design, policy, and enforcement choices by public and private sector decision-makers.</p><p>At ID2020, we often say that “good ID = good technology + good policy + good governance.”</p><p>There is a dangerous tendency to think that we can “tech our way out of any problem.”</p><p>The reality is that technology alone cannot adequately prevent exclusion, oppression, surveillance, and a variety of other undesirable outcomes. Building ID systems — especially digital ID systems — in an ethical manner requires governance frameworks and robust policy and regulatory safeguards that add an extra layer of protection. This is why collaboration between governments, multilateral and bilateral funders, civil society, and the private sector is so essential.</p><p>We are encouraged by the progress being made. At the same time, we are humbled by the task ahead of us and know that we must do&nbsp;more.</p><p>Living up to the intent of SDG 16.9 and the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights </a>will require not only expanding access to ID, but also ensuring that these systems are designed, built, and implemented in ways that protect fundamental human rights, enhance equity, and promote social and financial inclusion.</p><p>We hope that you will join us today in celebrating Identity Day by taking a moment to reflect on how our community — and, indeed, each of us individually — can help enhance equity, inclusion, and social and economic justice through our&nbsp;work.</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>This contributed byline from Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of FIDO Alliance, details cybersecurity blind spots generated by growing IoT technology adoption. To address these issues, the FIDO Alliance launched FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) in 2021 to tackle two main problems: deployment efficiency and security at the point of onboarding. The main feature of FDO is fully automated device onboarding, which considerably speeds up the previously manual process. FDO also replaces generic password credentials with highly secure cryptographic keys, making the devices considerably more robust against attack.</p>

<p>The end of forgotten or stolen passwords? Apple is launching “passkeys” today, a new identification system that should make the use of cryptic passwords to guarantee the security of one’s accounts a thing of the past. In practice, logging in anywhere will be as easy as unlocking your screen: every site that offers to use passkeys will ask the user if they want to use them to authenticate. It will then be necessary to use the usual method of unlocking the phone (PIN code, pattern, fingerprint or facial recognition) to validate the connection, explains the Fast Identity Online Alliance (FIDO Alliance), which is behind this process.</p>

 Some recommendations for the LocalGov Drupal community​​ <p>Over the last few months, we’ve been working with the <a href="https://localgovdrupal.org">LocalGov Drupal</a> team to shore up support for the project and help the community scale. We’ve been looking at the ways the project can help more people to get involved in a way that is sustainable for the existing community. In <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">Quick wins to improve your Open Source community’s Architecture of Participation</a>, we talk about some tactics any project can implement quite&nbsp;quickly.</p><p>In this post, we continue using our Architecture of Participation, and present some strategies that will help this successful project. In one way or another, they all deal with developing empathy.</p> Clear mission <p>LocalGov Drupal has a fantastic mission. As the project grows, it’s important to ensure that the community stay on course with that&nbsp;mission:</p><blockquote>The publishing platform created by councils, for councils.</blockquote><p>This is expanded to explain&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>LocalGov Drupal is a publicly owned asset that delivers a better digital experience for citizens, improves service outcomes, and saves&nbsp;money.</blockquote><p>In order for councils to continue creating the platform, there needs to be clarity around how it is publicly owned and operated. What mechanisms exist for the community to influence the direction of the&nbsp;project?</p>Diagram via <a href="http://sociocracyforall.org/sociocracy/">Sociocracy for&nbsp;All</a> Recommendations   Involve the community in decision making through defined workflows and&nbsp;roles.  Share information and be transparent about financials (e.g. shortfalls in funding, investment opportunities) by creating a ‘funding’ circle that members can&nbsp;join.  Use consent-based decision making within relevant Sociocratic circles to guide relationship establishment with partner organisations.   Invitation to participate <p>The advice in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">our blog</a> post to take the time to personally invite people stands true, this is a game changer for participation. Another helpful way to ensure that you are inviting a diverse group of people is to establish some repeatable norms for the community.</p><p>At the beginning of meetings, invite people to check in by saying how they are arriving at that meeting. This gives people an opportunity to say how they are feeling, what might be bothering them or what they hope to get out of their participation.</p><p>In addition, create repeatable norms by inviting people to check out places they can get involved. Ask for feedback early and often, model pro-social behaviours around invitations that extend across the&nbsp;project.</p><a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/?s=participation">Participatory Culture</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a> Recommendations   Get in the habit of using check–ins / checkouts in ALL meetings to make people feel welcome, bring their ‘full selves’, and be ready for participation. Sign-ins and written check-ins are&nbsp;great!  Feed the #showyourwork channel by encouraging people to share what they’ve done, however&nbsp;small.  Share v0.1 of your work for feedback (rather than v1.0) to get feedback around direction as well and not just the ‘final&nbsp;polish’.   Easy onboarding + modular&nbsp;approach <p>A successful open source project like LocalGov Drupal has A LOT of information to wrap your head around. There are a lot of ways into the project, different places communication is taking place and a variety of technical and social skills required to participate.</p><p>In order to make onboarding to a project or community easy for anyone, it can help to present information in several different ways. Thinking about (and documenting!) pathways people might be using to come into a project can help the community see where information could be tidier. This in turn can help the community identify places where a different view of the information might be&nbsp;helpful.</p><a href="https://whimsical.com/contribution-pathways-8sy99ptgRoxG4DTtJAsQeW">Visualised contribution pathways for&nbsp;LGD</a> Recommendations   Create a step-by-step checklist of onboarding and interview new community members regularly to help improve&nbsp;it.  Develop and promote the documentation system (aka the wiki) to ensure that contribution guidelines are up-to-date.  Ensure the full context of the LGD project isn’t just held in the heads of core team members by creating standing agenda&nbsp;items.  Help prevent confusion for new community members by using (and updating) <a href="https://whimsical.com/contribution-pathways-8sy99ptgRoxG4DTtJAsQeW">contribution pathways</a>.  Identify the “most used” resources and make sure they are accessible in multiple ways (e.g. record a screencast of the most popular slidedeck or write a blogpost about the most popular&nbsp;graphic)   Strong leadership + celebration of milestones <p>There are many different types of leadership. Strong leadership in an open source project is both distributed and diverse, marked by empathy, fair processes, and the establishment/encouragement of positive relationships.</p><p>The approach being experimented with by LocalGov Drupal, and which we have seen work extremely well within the co-operative movement is Sociocracy. LGD already has a product group, steering group, and technical group, however consent-based decision-making is not necessarily the norm within these groups’ meetings.</p><p>Governance is a work in progress and so we should celebrate both milestones in the project (e.g. technical development) but also milestones in the maturity of the organisation. Those with more mature governance are able to devolve decision-making to relevant circles, encouraging democratic processes and removing bottlenecks.</p> Recommendations   Arrange a Sociocracy refresher workshop and invite everyone in the community. Document the content of the workshop and include it in the LGD knowledge base.  Ensure that each circle has an established “lead” and ask that person to participate in creating standing agenda items together with the other&nbsp;leads.  Celebrate milestones by issuing badges for everything from onboarding, to pro-social behaviours the LGD community wants to encourage, through to membership of groups/circles.  Plan for a specific role around governance and operations to allow ‘business as usual’ to flourish as well as innovation work.  Share progress around governance issues as well as technical development on the blog, newsletter, and in presentations about the&nbsp;project.   Ways of working open + backchannels <p>There are bits of information that need to be kept confidential for the good of the project, but as an open source community, you should default to the highest level of openness you&nbsp;can.</p><p>As you work openly, try not to make judgements about what’s “relevant” to the community. Community members will decide for themselves what is relevant and what isn’t. Just remember to add an appropriate license (e.g. Creative Commons) to help people know in what ways they can share and contribute.</p><p>In order for people to bring their full selves to the project and contribute in diverse ways, they need to be able to talk about things which may be slightly off-topic. These are opportunities to strengthen relationships between community members, much as people who work in the same office bond by sharing stories around the watercooler.</p><p>Positive, pro-social behaviours need to be modelled by those in leadership positions. This is why the habits of those leading meetings, giving presentations, and otherwise having responsibility within the LGD community are so important.</p>CC-BY-ND Bryan&nbsp;Mathers Recommendations   Establish at least one #backchannel in Slack to enable community members to get to know one another without being disruptive in a work-related channel.  Provide guidance on licences which relate to documentation of the project, over and above the code. For example, Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC&nbsp;BY-SA</a>.  Make decisions about technology used for community interaction based on established processes and criteria.  Revisit the Code of Conduct on at least an annual basis to ensure that nothing is standing in the way of diverse community contribution.  Issue badges based on regular (monthly/quarterly) mini-workshops on what it means to work openly and model/encourage open behaviours.   Onwards! <p>Open source is about collaboration, not just code. Finding ways to help people feel welcome and seen is a good way to help your open source project be sustainable.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-architecture-of-participation-for-community-growth-ed9d964ec360">An Architecture of Participation for Community growth</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Department of Homeland Security Signs on as First Premier Sponsor of New Public/Private Partnership</p> 


<p>14 September 2022 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, today announced that NIEM (formerly known as National Information Exchange Model), will transition to NIEM Open, an OASIS Open Project, in October 2022. A collaborative partnership between private industry and all levels of governmental agencies, the NIEM framework enables the effective and efficient sharing of critical data as currently demonstrated in the justice,&nbsp;public safety,&nbsp;emergency and disaster management,&nbsp;intelligence, and&nbsp;homeland security&nbsp;sectors. NIEM is designed to facilitate the creation of automated enterprise-wide information exchanges. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology">Science and Technology Directorate</a> (S&amp;T) has committed to support NIEM Open at the Premier Sponsor level to advance the critical work of the project.</p>



<p>This October, when NIEM transitions from the U.S. Department of Defense to OASIS, an ANSI-accredited and ISO-recognized standards development organization, NIEM’s expansion into global markets will provide access to a larger pool of stakeholders and developers to contribute to the project, creating a path for NIEM to become an official standard in national and international policy and procurement. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Transitioning to an OASIS Open Project allows NIEM to become more readily available to international communities and organizations that want to adopt NIEM,” said Stuart Whitehead of the U.S. Department of Defense. “We look forward to working with new alliances in the private sector to assist in the integration of NIEM into even broader user communities, allowing NIEM to become the gold standard for public-private partnerships. This is an exciting time to continue to advance the NIEM model technically as it transforms into an open, international standard.”</p>



<p>“At OASIS, there’s an extensive set of processes for collaborative development of standards. This is the type of environment that technology companies and government agencies need to accelerate interoperability initiatives across boundaries,” said Katherine Escobar, Deputy Division Chief for the Joint Staff’s J6 Data and Services Division. “We will continue to look for ways to simplify use, embrace emerging technologies, and welcome new communities. We look forward to expanding the NIEM footprint and seeing NIEM Open help organizations exchange information to improve decision making, increase efficiency, and advance their missions.”</p>



<p>“DHS S&amp;T is excited to see the evolution of NIEM to an OASIS Open Project,” said Philip Mattson, Standards Executive and Senior Standards Advisor at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;“This will strengthen NIEM’s overall development, raising the level of collaboration in diverse communities.”</p>



<p>NIEM Open’s Sponsors will provide strategic vision, governance, and technical guidance for future efforts and have the option to serve on the Project Governing Board, where they approve work produced by the community as well as proposals for new open source projects. To learn more about becoming a Sponsor and joining the Project’s Governing Board, please contact <a>join@oasis-open.org</a>.</p>



<p>Additional Information:</p>



<p>About NIEM:</p>



<p>Established in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, NIEM is a community-driven, standards-based approach to facilitate information sharing. U.S. and International organizations across Federal, State, Local, Tribal, Territorial, Public, Private and Commercial sectors use NIEM as a common base data model and methodology to promote interoperability of data and software, reduce design and development time for information exchange applications, and allow the reuse of intellectual capital and skills across multiple projects.</p>



<p>About OASIS:</p>



<p>One of the most respected, nonprofit open source and open standards bodies in the world, OASIS advances the fair, transparent development of open source software and standards through the power of global collaboration and community. OASIS is the home for worldwide standards in IoT, cybersecurity, blockchain, privacy, cryptography, cloud computing, urban mobility, emergency management, and other content technologies. Many OASIS standards go on to be ratified by de jure bodies and referenced in international policies and government procurement.

<p>As the world works towards climate goals, a government project from Canada is using digital trust technology to make it easier and more secure for natural resource companies to share sustainability data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) was established by the Government of British Columbia in recognition that we must do more to facilitate the transition to a clean, resilient economy. British Columbia (B.C.), Canada’s western-most province, was the first province in Canada to implement greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and mandatory sustainability reporting for major sectors of the provincial economy. As leaders in climate change legislation, B.C. is well positioned to explore cutting-edge technology in the journey towards a low-carbon economy. To improve trust, accuracy, and efficiency when sharing sustainability data, EMDT is coordinating a digital ecosystem – a network of organizations including environmental auditors, government bodies, mining and energy companies, and non-government organizations.</p>



<p>Improved Sustainability Reporting&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, reporting sustainability data can be challenging. Data is difficult to exchange internationally, and consumers cannot always access, or trust, reported data, not to mention the administrative burden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>EMDT’s digital ecosystem makes it possible to exchange sustainability information simply and securely, using digital credentials.</p>



<p>Digital credentials:&nbsp;</p>



  Can be shared quickly and are tamper-proof.&nbsp;  Allow companies to control their data.&nbsp;  Guarantee the integrity of the information.&nbsp;  Preserve privacy in business-to-business interactions.&nbsp;  



<p>Digital Trust Ecosystem: EMDT Pilot&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>EMDT has been testing and refining their technology and governance through multiple pilot projects to demonstrate how sustainability reporting can be made more efficient and trustworthy. Two pilot projects explore greenhouse gas emissions reporting in the mining sector and the natural gas sector. These pilots allow participants to test sharing and receiving digital credentials that include verified GHG emissions data for a specific mine site or natural gas facility.</p>







<p>*Because this is a pilot, the process depicted in this diagram does not satisfy or replace existing regulatory reporting obligations.</p>



<p>The greenhouse gas (GHG) mining pilot builds upon the existing regulatory emissions reporting process in British Columbia. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), an environmental auditor, issues a digital credential to Copper Mountain Mining Company containing verified GHG data. Copper Mountain can then use the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Report Verification Credential as part of their GHG emissions report to British Columbia’s Climate Action Secretariat. Copper Mountain can use the same digital credential to complete voluntary reporting to organizations such as the <a href="https://openclimate.org/">Open Earth Foundation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increased Connections&nbsp;</p>



<p>To facilitate the broad exchange of sustainability data, EMDT used Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries to create a highly interoperable tool, called Traction. Traction is an API accelerator built on top of Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-PY). Traction streamlines the process of sending and receiving digital credentials for governments and organizations.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Aries makes Traction highly interoperable with the technological solutions of companies and organizations around the world. “While two wallets might be different implementations or might be written in different code, they can still exchange data because both wallets use Aries,” explains Kyle Robinson, EMDT’s Senior Strategic Advisor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traction makes it easier to integrate digital trust technology into existing lines of business:&nbsp;</p>



  API-first Architecture: Traction is designed with an API-first architecture. This RESTful API allows for integration into existing line-of-business applications already being used by organizations. The Tenant user interface is built on this API to enable adoption prior to integration and for low-use functions.  Multitenancy: ACA-Py is implemented on a cloud-based server so multiple wallets can be managed with one Traction instance.&nbsp;  Higher Scalability: Traction is open-source technology, encouraging collaborative refinement, faster release, and higher scalability of the technology.  



<p>Collaborative Climate Change Progress</p>



<p>With an increasing emphasis on responsibly sourced products, simplified methods for exchanging sustainability data ensures that B.C. natural resource providers can compete in a global market. Digital trust technology streamlines access to trustworthy sustainability data, allowing businesses, governments, and non-government organizations to work towards climate change goals more efficiently and effectively. <a href="http://digital.gov.bc.ca/emdt">Visit our website</a> to learn more about Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust.</p>

<p>Until now, integrating with the Commercio blockchain required an IT framework and in-depth technical knowledge.</p>
<p>The two options available to date were:</p>
 
 develop a native integration (in case using the sdk),<br>
develop an integration in Rest Api (using the Commercio.app). 
 
<p>Both options require a large number of tasks that added together really take up a lot of time and energy.</p>
<p>This is where automation comes in.&nbsp;It gives you back this valuable time and makes a complex concept, such as blockchain, accessible to anyone who needs to use it.</p>
<p>Starting today, thanks to the invaluable work of the brilliant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ncontin/">Nicola Contin</a> of We Can Consulting SpA, you can use Zapier to connect your Commercio app to 5000+ other services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to get started with Zapier 
<p>Zapier is a tool you can use to automate different tasks, connect different Apps, and integrate them. It then allows you to tell Zapier what you want to achieve, without having to write a single line of code.</p>
<p>For example, whenever you get a new lead, Zapier can ask Dropbox to tell it what files you have uploaded, and in real time notarize them on Commercio.network.<br>
With more than 5,000 integrations, you can integrate any storage system or any action produced by one of these integrations with Commercio.network.</p>
<p>To use Zapier, you must first <a href="https://zapier.com/app/billing/plans">create an account.&nbsp;</a> There are different plans, including a free plan that includes 5 single-step zaps and 100 activities.</p>
<p>But before we begin, here are some terms you need to know:</p>
<p>Zap<br>
A Zap is an automated workflow between your Apps.&nbsp;They are a set of instructions you define in Zapier to perform predefined tasks.&nbsp;A zap is triggered when a certain event (a trigger) occurs in an app.</p>
<p>Trigger<br>
Triggers are basically events within software that initiate a workflow.&nbsp;The trigger sends a set of information to Zapier that can be used in zaps to perform actions in other online services, which are also connected to Zapier.</p>
<p>Action<br>
The action is any step taken by zap.&nbsp;For example, each time a row is added to a Google sheet, a zap updates the stock of a product.</p>
<p>Task<br>
A task is how Zapier keeps track of your actions.&nbsp;This is important when you choose your plans.&nbsp;Each time a zap performs one of its “Action” steps, Zapier considers it to be a task.&nbsp;For example, your zap updates the product stock twice a day, Zapier considers this as two tasks.</p>
<p>Remember this when you select your rate plan.</p>
 Commercio Network + Zapier 
<p>Grazie al nuovo Add-On Zapier, ora puoi connettere la blockchain di Commercio ad altri servizi online e impostare l’automazione, sempre senza scrivere una sola riga di codice.</p>
<p>Prima di tutto ti devi collegare a https://commercio.app/ , creare un account, confermarlo e acquistare una membership.</p>
<p>A quel punto, colleghi l’account tramite l’estensione Zapier inserendo username e password dell’account di Commercio.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now your connection is complete, and you can start configuring triggers and ready-to-use actions.</p>
<p>Your App automatically notifies Zapier whenever one of these two triggers occurs:</p>
 
 List of share doc processes initiated 
 Wallet amount 
 
<p>For example, you can create a zap that checks your wallet funds in real time, or that checks whether a new document has moved from the process queue to actual notarization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can automate the following actions in your Commercio.app using the information collected in Zapier:</p>
 
 Creating a new share doc 
 Searching for a specific process id to check the status of a transaction 
 
<p></p>
 Killer APP: Dropbox integration 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of a Killer APP might be the Dropbox integration:</p>
<p>connect your Dropbox account, and with each file upload start a new share doc and notice it in real time.</p>
<p></p>

  💡  Read the <a href="https://threebox.notion.site/ComposeDB-on-Ceramic-Developer-Preview-c0032b37a007451683eb3d7a1091db53">Getting Started Guide</a> to start building with ComposeDB&nbsp;   What is ComposeDB on Ceramic? <p>ComposeDB on Ceramic is a decentralized, composable graph database. It provides different configurations (building blocks) that allow developers to quickly build applications on Ceramic—including the ability to discover, create, share and reuse composable data models using GraphQL. </p><p>ComposeDB provides a complete data solution that supports multi-player use cases—like those demanded by social and DAO applications. Popular <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/highlighted-projects/">use cases</a> include projects around user profiles, reputation (publicly verifiable attestations for skills, credentials, and contribution scores), and user-generated content (portable social graphs, social media apps, networking, messaging, and blogs). </p><p>Today, Ceramic applies to a wide variety of use cases across different markets and segments. Its many examples include:</p>  Storing user-generated content as Ceramic streams for app interoperability  Storing contributor credentials for DAOs  Issuing and storing verifiable credentials  Creating unified conversation layers that can work across applications  Enabling fully encrypted wallet-to-wallet messaging  Storing user profile data  Storing dynamic NFT content and metadata attached to user identities  Dynamically appending metadata to NFTs over time<br>  <p>Following the production-ready release of ComposeDB, we expect to see applications that offer extremely rich end-user experiences—all built by developers who contributed to the community-driven data ecosystem on Ceramic. </p><p>Ceramic’s core team will present a production-ready version of ComposeDB in early 2023, one that will:</p>  Enable developers to define and query complex graph database schemas that feature many different forms of relations between accounts (e.g. a user) and their content (e.g. a social post)  Make indexing and querying possible on Ceramic  Make data models and data more easily reusable on Ceramic  Support advanced permissioning   Overview of ComposeDB on Ceramic <p>This section outlines the five features and components that make ComposeDB on Ceramic possible. Click <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.2.x/guides/concepts-overview">here</a> for a full overview of concepts.</p> Composites &amp; Data Models <p>Composites are composable building blocks used by developers. They are groups of data models (e.g. profiles, blog posts, and comments) that together define the graph database schema for an application. Content streams in Ceramic have metadata that automatically associates them to a data model, which defines the shape and schema of that data, as well as to accounts and other content (e.g. User X liked a post by User Y). Composites aggregate these lower-level data models into higher-level groups for application development. Composites are created by developers in the community and all feed into Ceramic’s ecosystem, making it easy for different applications to reuse and share data.</p><p>As we shift toward Composites, we’ll be sunsetting the previous data models module and discouraging using TileDocument streams.</p> Database <p>There are a few important changes required when running a JS Ceramic node after the ComposeDB release. Every node must now be backed by a SQL database, SQLite or Postgres, that will be used to index the data and construct the database for the data models in your Composite. Each node decides what to index and store in the database based on the models contained in its Composite, which must be passed to the node during development time.</p><p>Ceramic acts as a syncing protocol that maintains your local database state against a global network of documents and interoperable data models, maintained via the same verifiable event streams that have always been at the core of Ceramic—allowing you to trust the integrity of your index.</p> GraphQL <p>Developers only need to use one library, the ComposeDB Client, which provides a GraphQL interface to Ceramic. This client needs to be passed a Composite in order to saturate its own APIs and know which data models you’re using. Once your ComposeDB Client is loaded with your Composite, you can make GraphQL queries and mutations against your Ceramic node. Using ComposeDB will be much easier and more streamlined than building directly with previous developer packages on Ceramic—such as IDX or DID DataStore.</p> Data Model Reusability and Marketplace <p>Composites and their underlying data models are designed to be reusable, making it simple to build complementary and interoperable apps. Apps that reuse each other's Composites create instant interoperability, without any integrations needed. To date, developers have had to manually submit data models to the Registry on Github. Data models are now automatically indexed, enabling easier discovery and reuse. In the first release milestone, getting existing models happens through commands in the ComposeDB CLI, but we’ll follow closely with a UI.</p> Object Capabilities <p>One of the biggest challenges in Web3 is offering the ease of use of Web2—one-click sign-in and user sessions—while also preserving the user’s control of their data. To enable this, we have a new library called “did-sessions” built with CACAO (Chain Agnostic Capability Object), offering a permissions model called<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/capability-based-data-security-on-ceramic/"> capability-based access control</a>. CACAO will integrate with ComposeDB to grant granular permissions to specific models. Permissions open up a range of new use cases, sign in flows, and data access patterns on Ceramic. This includes capability-based permission scoping, which allows a developer to specify which Composites or data models they’re asking permission for.</p><p>The first major use case we’re enabling with CACAO is Sessions. We’ve paired CACAO and did-sessions library with a new DID method, called did:pkh, and the Sign-In With Ethereum specification (with more chains to come). This will allow users to seamlessly sign-in with their wallet and delegate actions (e.g. “liking”) and storage permissions to the developer for time-bound periods.</p> Ceramic Today vs. ComposeDB on Ceramic <br><p>Ceramic Today</p><p>ComposeDB on Ceramic</p><p>DB Type</p><p>Key-Value Store</p><p>Graph Database</p><p>Models</p><p>Account to single JSON object (Data Models)</p><p>Property graph supporting one-to-many relationships (Composites)</p><p>Storage</p><p>TileDocument streams</p><p>Model streams, MID streams</p><p>Indexing</p><p>None</p><p>Indexing by each Ceramic node</p><p>Queries</p><p>Many JS Library Method Calls</p><p>GraphQL Queries</p><p>Clients</p><p>HTTP Client, ModelManager, DID DataStore, Self.ID SDK</p><p>HTTP Client, GraphQL Client</p><p>Accounts</p><p>3ID as default</p><p>did:PKH as default</p><p>Authentication</p><p>All-or-nothing permissions</p><p>Granular permissions per model</p><p>Composability</p><p>GitHub Data Models Registry</p><p>Marketplace for models</p><p>DX</p><p>Patchwork of client libraries</p><p>Streamlined flow and tooling</p><p>UX</p><p>Specific Ceramic sign-in popups</p><p>Familiar, Web3 wallet-native</p><p></p> Milestones for ComposeDB on Ceramic <p>The following milestones represent different releases of ComposeDB on Ceramic. The dates are targets, not commitments. Please join our mailing list or Discord Server to find out when new releases go live.</p> Developer Preview <p>The <a href="https://threebox.notion.site/ComposeDB-on-Ceramic-Developer-Preview-c0032b37a007451683eb3d7a1091db53">Developer Preview</a> will be available for developers who want to familiarize themselves with the new ComposeDB stack. Over the coming months the Ceramic core team will release new versions with improved functionality and documentation.</p><p>Available Early September </p><p>The earliest Developer Preview will offer the CLI and GraphQL Client, Composites, Sign-In With Ethereum, DID-Sessions, and the ability to explore models in the CLI. The core team will provide a Getting Started Guide, high level docs and js-ComposeDB API documentation. </p><p>Limitations: Currently, ComposeDB only supports defining relations between an account and the documents created by this account. Relations between documents and accounts are under development. In addition, there will be no scalability guarantees, no access to historical third-party data, it will not be available on mainnet and there will be no retroactive data availability.<br></p><p>Available Early October at Devcon in Bogota, Colombia</p><p>This release milestone provides simple relations between documents and accounts, enabling developers to test graph models so they can build richer and more engaging applications on Ceramic. </p><p>This version of the preview will offer simple (as compared to the following release) model relations, an improved docs portal with updated API documentation (js-compose, js-did, js-ceramic), Sign-In With Solana functionality and an updated way to index models that doesn’t require developers to restart their nodes. </p><p>Limitations include no access to historical third-party data, no optimization for deeply-nested queries with many relations and, at this time, ComposeDB will allow duplicate relations (e.g. liking the same post twice); therefore, developers will need to build preventative logic.</p><p>Available Late December </p><p>This release enables support for interfaces, allowing developers to evolve their application through extending existing data models, and unifying queries across different data models. This will also make it easier for developers to build shared interfaces with other applications (e.g. an interface for comments) as well as extend models for their app (e.g. adding more fields to a model).</p><p>For example, there could be a generic verifiable credential interface, this interface could be implemented by an education credential and a job employment credential. An application could make a union of these two credentials and seamlessly query across both of them. Verifiable credential MID streams won’t belong to the generic VC interface, but they will belong to more specific data models that implement the verifiable credential interface (e.g. education credential, job employment credential, DAO contribution credential, etc.).</p><p>Developers can expect support for sets, and indexable anchors that enable historical data sync retroactively. Historical data sync will enable a node to connect to the network and sync previous data (before the point in time that the particular node started indexing the data model). Historical data sync also means that if Node B goes down it will still be able to index the data via Node A, allowing historical data to sync between applications that share the same data model.</p><p>Available January 2023</p><p>This release enables developers to build on an open data ecosystem and define the data standards for their app (and others to come) to interoperate. </p><p>At this stage, queries will be executed more efficiently than before (server-side query execution), improvements will come to the dev portal, and easy-to-use node metrics will be available—in addition to self-serve mainnet access. </p><p>Limitations at this stage include multi-node deployments and a lack of hosted node options. </p> Production<br> <p>Available Early 2023</p><p>Developers can build quickly on ComposeDB to offer rich end-to-end user experiences on their apps—providing data models and interoperable data within the Ceramic ecosystem. </p><p>At this point, Ceramic will handle a standard deployment of millions of writes and reads per day, in addition to a UI for searching Composites (data models) and improved Getting Started documentation. A UI for searching data models and Composites will make building with ComposeDB on Ceramic faster than before. Templates for scaled deployments and a hosted infrastructure option will also become available.</p>  💡  Read the <a href="https://threebox.notion.site/ComposeDB-on-Ceramic-Developer-Preview-c0032b37a007451683eb3d7a1091db53">Getting Started Guide</a> to build with ComposeDB and let us know what you think via this <a href="https://m6mc0n6phdp.typeform.com/to/c9XafeHl">2-minute survey</a>

<p>When Apple releases iOS 16 in September, it will debut the highly anticipated Passkey, a new form of security authorization that will allow users to sign into accounts without having to use a password. This effort was announced in May as part of a joint press release by Google, Apple, and Microsoft promoting a “passwordless future” based on new support for FIDO credentials. FIDO credentials are built on a digital standard that uses public-key cryptography to communicate secure authorizations to a user’s account.</p>

<p>While some experts continue to stress the use of password managers to solve the password problem, other developments might quash it entirely by killing the password altogether. This effort gained momentum when Apple, Google, and Microsoft committed to expanding their support for the FIDO standard to accelerate the availability of passwordless sign-ins. Users will soon be able to use two new capabilities for passwordless sign-ins. The first will let users automatically access their FIDO sign-in credentials on devices without re-enrolling their accounts. The second will let users enable FIDO authentication on their mobile devices to sign into an application or website on a nearby device, regardless of the operating system platform or browser they are using.</p>

<p>This contributed byline from Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of FIDO Alliance, details cybersecurity blind spots generated by growing IoT technology adoption. To address these issues, the FIDO Alliance launched FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) in 2021 to tackle two main problems: deployment efficiency and security at the point of onboarding. The main feature of FDO is fully automated device onboarding, which considerably speeds up the previously manual process. FDO also replaces generic password credentials with highly secure cryptographic keys, making the devices considerably more robust against attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Passwords can be replaced. With the tools here, they are still in play, but fade into the background. Truly password-free web services are those that allow logging in via a special USB security key – keyword FIDO2 (Fast IDentity Online 2). The range of compatible web services is still rather thin. It is possible that FIDO replaces passwords or functions as a second factor (2FA, two-factor authentication).</p>

<p>The Indian Payments ecosystem is going through rapid change and advancement. The Reserve Bank of India (Digital Payment Security Controls) Directions 2020 were issued for regulated entities to set up a robust governance structure for such systems and implement common minimum standards of security controls for channels like internet, mobile banking, and card payments, among others. In this paper, we demonstrate how FIDO Authentication represents the best way for organizations to implement simpler, stronger authentication that meets Reserve Bank of India’s Master Direction on Digital Payment Control requirements, while also enhancing the user experience.</p>

 How to take steps to recognise and encourage pro-social behaviours Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>Anyone can create a badging system, if by ‘badging system’ we mean ‘lots of badges for discrete things’. Too often, though, these badges focus on credentialing rather than recognition.</p><blockquote>Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.”</blockquote><blockquote>(<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">What is Open Recognition anyway?</a>)</blockquote><p>We’re so conditioned into getting certificates and trophies for achievement (aka ‘credentials’) that sometimes we have to remind ourselves what we mean by recognition.</p><p>So instead of talking about this in an abstract way, let’s talk about it in the context of the <a href="https://badges.community/">Keep Badges Weird (KBW) community</a>, which currently has over 300&nbsp;members.</p> Identifying pro-social behaviours <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosocial_behavior">Pro-social behaviours</a> are those intended to benefit others, or society as a whole — for example, helping, sharing, donating, co-operating, and volunteering. Within a community, they’re the behaviours that make it an attractive space to belong to, and which encourage its growth and/or development. It’s a central part of the value cycles that underpin the Communities of Practice&nbsp;model.</p>Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>Within the KBW community, we already have a series of fine badges including those shown above. These also happen to be<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wtf-are-stealth-badges-41130a75a1a9"> ‘stealth’ badges</a>, awarded to community members without them actively seeking&nbsp;them.</p><p>The particular pro-social behaviours we have identified with these badges&nbsp;are:</p>  Coming to someone’s rescue — is someone stuck with a problem, or in an awkward situation?  Kicking off a discussion — has someone gone out of their way to prompt discussion or debate on an&nbsp;issue?  Keeping it positive — is there someone who’s done a good job of keeping the community focused on solutions rather than endlessly talking about problems?  <p>People don’t have to reach a high bar of have done something out of the ordinary to earn a badge that recognises a pro-social behaviour. For example, the first badge that most people in the KBW community earn is the ‘Keep Badges Weird’ badge, issued to those who <a href="https://app.participate.com/discussions/introductions/9e0fa7d1-f307-4839-b1c8-5d95472c61a2">introduce themselves</a> in a dedicated thread.</p> Encouraging participation <p>The best badging systems evolve over time with communities. A great example of this is the <a href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/explore/badges">Fedora Linux community</a>, which has a badging system which at this point is around eight years old and contains hundreds of badges. These range from commonplace badges such as making a single contribution to the codebase, through to ultra-rare badges such as overall project&nbsp;leader.</p>Screenshot of Fedora&nbsp;badges<p>It’s interesting to note the different types of badges that are issued within this community:</p>  Content  Development  Community  Quality  Event  Miscellaneous  <p>These categories can emerge over time, and may not even be necessary at all. It’s important to understand that these emergent badge systems are built with community members, not for&nbsp;them.</p> A worked&nbsp;example <p>One of the resources that the KBW community helps maintain is <a href="https://badge.wiki">Badge Wiki</a>, a knowledge base for the entire Open Badges community. While it’s true that anyone with an account can edit the wiki, not so many&nbsp;do.</p><p>So the first thing we did was to create a time for us all to come together and work on it. We call this <a href="https://lu.ma/barn-raising">Badge Wiki barn raising</a>, and we do it monthly. Ideally, there are always new people on this call, as well as those who have been to at least one previous&nbsp;session.</p>Screenshot of Barn Raiser badge, description and&nbsp;criteria<p>The badge that those who come to a session can earn is shown above. This serves several purposes, from validating attendance (for those who need it) through to recognising the contribution they have&nbsp;made.</p><p>But where do we go next? How do we go from a single badge to start building out a badge system around stewardship of this particular resource?</p>Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>Perhaps the easiest place to start is to recognise people turning up on multiple occasions. They don’t have to be consecutive, and it doesn’t need to be the organiser of the session that keeps track. Instead, this could be a claimed badge based on pointing to evidence.</p><p>This kind of approach can be repeated ad infinitum. There’s value in doing so — the Fedora badges system has a badge for people who have performed 10,000 builds! But what else can we recognise and encourage? After all, people contribute to communities (including Open Source communities) in many and varied&nbsp;ways.</p>Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>People also have different interests and talents, so why not recognise those? We chose three types of people from <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiAgent">this helpful list</a> as a way of helping people identifying roles for themselves, and to help people understand that there are lots of different ways to contribute and create value. Every Badge Wiki barn raising call starts with this, as a ritual and routine and a way for people to feel&nbsp;welcome.</p>Image CC BY&nbsp;WAO<p>Even this small demarcation of roles helps in a number of&nbsp;ways:</p>  People can start small and work their way onto bigger&nbsp;tasks  Contributors arrive with varying energy levels, so may be in the mood for different tasks on different days  People can follow their interests as well as their talents for contributing to the&nbsp;project.  <p>Inevitably, even in the first session, those who turned up as contributors to the Badge Wiki barn raising started identifying themselves as ‘FairyGardeners’&nbsp;. That is to say they felt like doing a couple of different things, or mashing up those roles. This is absolutely to be encouraged!</p> Conclusion <p>This has been a brief guide with worked examples of how to create a culture of recognition, taking steps to recognise and encourage pro-social behaviours. WAO don’t have all of the answers, so we’d love to hear from you! Please do comment below if you’ve got examples (or questions)</p><p>Recognition within a community of practice is best as a varied and emergent system, and so our next task is to create badges from these reflections for the <a href="https://lu.ma/barn-raising">Badge Wiki barn raising sessions</a>. If you would like to come along, please <a href="https://badges.community">join the KBW community</a> and turn up for the monthly sessions!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/creating-a-culture-of-recognition-39ffdb6cf943">Creating a culture of recognition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A roundup of previous seasons and a sneak peak into Season 5&nbsp;planning <p>After summer holidays, sunshine and lollipops, we’re getting back into the groove. This includes some thinking and planning around Tao of WAO Season&nbsp;5.</p><p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/">The Tao of WAO is a podcast</a> about the intersection of technology, society, and internet culture — with a dash of philosophy and art for good measure. We <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/announcing-our-new-podcast-e38aaba57066">announced the podcast in May 2021</a>, and since then we’ve been pumping out season after season. We haven’t summed up the previous seasons, ever, so this is a quick post to do that and talk about what we’re planning for Season 5. Don’t want to read about it? <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/">Then just go give it a&nbsp;listen</a>!</p>Our <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tao-of-wao">Soundcloud</a> header Season 1 <p>When we started the Tao of WAO, we weren’t sure what kind of format we wanted to have. We kicked off the podcast talking about cooperatism because, well, we’re a co-op. Over the course of the season we talked about being geriatric millennials, doing digital detoxes and had our first guest, John Evans from <a href="https://code-operative.co.uk">Code Operative</a>.</p> Season 2 <p>We started to hit our stride in Season 2. We kicked off the season with a trailer, and then had great conversations with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamjessklein/">Jess Klein</a> on Ethical Design and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kudzayingwerume/">Kudzayi Ngwerume</a> on Creativity and Movement Building. We also chatted about working remotely, unframeworks and keeping badges&nbsp;weird.</p> Season 3 <p>Our first episode of Season 3 had all the <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-o</a>p folks on. We talked about some of our internal policies around dormancy in the co-op. This was also the season we talked to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerrilemoie/">Kerri Lemoie</a> about Verifiable Credentials, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexworradandrews/">Alex Worrad Andrews</a> about Networks of Networks, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/procter/">Adam Procter</a> about Social Impact Games. When we weren’t interviewing these amazing people, we recorded an episode on Misinformation and used our final episode of the season a somewhat random conversation about stuff we’d been working on and newsletters we like to&nbsp;read.</p> Season 4 <p>Again in Season 4, we managed to have amazing guests. We talked to <a href="https://outlandish.com/person/kayleigh-walsh/">Kayleigh Walsh</a> about Restorative Justice, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heatherleson/">Heather Leson</a> about Opening Up Social Impact Organisations and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryannalexander/">Bryan Alexander</a> about Futurism. In between our guest focused episodes, Doug and I talked about participation in Civic Society, Self-hosting IT and Reentering Events after&nbsp;Covid.</p> Season 5 (coming&nbsp;soon!) <p>You can probably tell from this short summary that we cover a wide variety of social, cultural and techie issues. In the new season, we’re planning to talk about edtech, communities of practice, feminism and more. We’ll have more book recommendations from our guests and more laughs coming soon to wherever you listen to your podcasts.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch! <p>We’re always looking for interesting folks with interesting things to say, so if you’d like to be a guest on the Tao of WAO, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">let us know</a>. We are also extremely grateful when listeners get in touch to give feedback!

<p>A recent SpyCloud study showed that over 64% of people reuse their passwords. Some experts continue to stress the use of password managers to mitigate this issue, but this could be squashed by eliminating passwords all together. Going passwordless gained momentum in the second half of 2022 when Apple, Google and Microsoft committed to expanding their support for the FIDO standard. FIDO’s work has resulted in the development of FIDO Universal Second Factor (FIDO U2F), FIDO Universal Authentication Framework, and FIDO2- which have been embraced and further utilized by a few of the largest tech companies in the world.</p>

<p>In recent years, developers have been the targets of multiple attacks due to their access to sensitive systems.&nbsp; As the tech giants have begun their collaboration on making the user experience of passwordless better, users still need to register across all their devices.&nbsp;The solution to this is passkeys that allow users to easily and securely access passwordless systems across all devices. The FIDO2 Authentication standards are based on public key cryptography for authentication that is more secure than passwords and SMS one-time passwords. FIDO2 Authentication enables password-only logins to be replaced with secure and fast login experiences across websites and apps.</p>

<p>Back to our Developer Showcase Series to learn what developers in the real world are doing with Hyperledger technologies. Next up is Jason Sherman, Developer at <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/energy-mines-and-petroleum-resources">Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust, Government of British Columbia’s Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation</a>.</p>



<p>Give a bit of background on what you’re working on and how you got into blockchain</p>



<p>Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) is a pilot project enabling a collaborative digital ecosystem between the B.C. government, natural resource companies, and organizations around the world, making it simpler and more secure to share sustainability data. I am currently working on EMDT’s technology, called Traction. Traction is basically a layer above Hyperledger Aries&nbsp; Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) that enables the Government of British Columbia to use our technology for line of business applications. This allows the government to onboard into the world of digital credentials easily, and to track their business data with their credential and presentation exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Hyperledger frameworks or tools are you using in your projects? Any new developments to share? Can you sum up your experience with Hyperledger?</p>



<p>We are using Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) and Hyperledger Indy. Using Hyperledger frameworks has increased Traction’s interoperability, making it possible to incorporate a broader range of participants, tools, and technologies into the digital ecosystem EMDT is coordinating. We’re using Hyperledger’s open-source software to accelerate the Government of B.C.’s ability to adopt these tools. My experience with Hyperledger technologies is that things change quickly! And any problem or use case I identify is usually already being addressed.</p>



<p>What do you think is most important for Hyperledger Foundation to focus on in the next year?</p>



<p>I think the Hyperledger Foundation should focus on multiple ledger support (which is already underway) and onboarding users (not developers) of the implemented technology.</p>



<p>What advice would you offer other technologists or developers interested in getting started working on blockchain?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a very steep learning curve, but it’s extremely worthwhile. You will very quickly identify areas where the technology could benefit your clients.</p>



<p>As Hyperledger’s projects continue to mature, what do you see as the most interesting technologies, apps, or use cases coming out as a result?</p>



<p>I am interested in the ability for Hyperledger projects to enable more automated business flows using truly trusted and tamper-proof data. The number of personnel hours that can be saved just through automated conversation and interchange of data programmatically is massive.</p>



<p>What’s the one issue or problem you hope blockchain can solve?</p>



<p>I am hopeful that blockchain has the potential to improve trust between businesses. By exchanging information using blockchain technology and digital credentials, the validity and origin of the credential can always be verified, and businesses can proceed with their interactions confidently.</p>



<p>Where do you hope to see Hyperledger and/or blockchain in five years?</p>



<p>I would hope to see blockchain as a viable and easily selected technology, along the lines of Postgresql or MongoDb. I would hope that blockchain could be adopted as a mainstream technology that development teams can look at as a solution to solve their problems.</p>



<p>What is the best piece of developer advice you’ve ever received?</p>



<p>Your code isn’t precious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What technology could you not live without?</p>



<p>Plumbing.</p>

<p>A cyber security breach that unfolded at LastPass – a provider of credential management services – appears to have affected only the firm’s developer environment, and is unlikely to rebound on users, according to community experts, who have praised the firm for its quick and transparent response to the incident. Many providers, including LastPass, are offering and migrating to passwordless logins which use more advanced security technologies such as FIDO2 security keys. This reduces friction for end-users and increases the overall account security.</p>

<p>Our online lives are protected, first and foremost, by passwords. They are a part of our everyday lives and protect our sensitive information in the digital world. However, they aren’t a flawless system of protection, and our lives would certainly be easier without the need for them. Many reuse passwords across accounts or set up very weak ones, easily guessed ones, and the truth is we are under a constant threat of cyberattacks by increasingly savvier hackers. Current basics of online security must ensure there is a high standard of education and password hygiene. From there, there are tools to help reinforce the education, such as password managers, and Single Sign-On (SSO) or Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) options. For a passwordless world, however, there needs to be more. Fast Identity Online (FIDO) technologies support authentication mechanisms, such as biometric face and fingerprint ID and the addition of hardware security keys.</p>

<p>Apple recently presented its version of “passkeys”, which are to replace passwords in the not too distant future. In doing so, the US company is not going its own way, but is relying on the open standard of the FIDO Alliance, which is also supported by other industry giants such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook (“Meta”) and Amazon.</p>

<p>The Universal Resolver is a utility developed by the community at DIF to resolve Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) across many different DID methods, based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C DID Core 1.0</a> and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/">DID Resolution</a> specifications. It is a work item of the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/">DIF Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>, and is provided as a tool to support interoperability efforts and enable testing.</p>
 New DID methods 
<p>We continue to receive great contributions from the community in the form of new drivers as well as updates to existing ones, in order to support as many DID methods as possible. Several more DID methods have recently been added to the Universal Resolver, including:</p>
 
 
<p>did:indy (the long-awaited upgrade of the original did:sov method) - See <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/">https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/</a></p>
 
 
<p>did:cheqd (from the Cheqd community) - See <a href="https://github.com/cheqd/did-resolver">https://github.com/cheqd/did-resolver</a></p>
 
 
<p>did:com (from Commercio Network) - See <a href="https://commercio.network/">https://commercio.network/</a></p>
 
 
<p>did:ala</p>
 
 
<p>Did:everscale</p>
 
 
<p>The Universal Resolver can now resolve 45 DID methods, and more are being added regularly. Visit <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a> to see the full list of supported methods, and visit <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/main/docs/driver-development.md">this github page</a> to contribute a driver for a DID method.&nbsp; In the event of a problem resolving a did or with driver functions, the contributor has 30 days to resolve the issue before the driver and DID method get delisted. This ensures that the list of methods on the Universal Resolver is regularly tested, and remains updated and functional.</p>
<p>For example, try the following commands to resolve DIDs to their DID documents:</p>
<p>curl -X GET <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE">https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE</a></p>
<p>curl -X GET <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:cheqd:mainnet:zF7rhDBfUt9d1gJPjx7s1JXfUY7oVWkY">https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:cheqd:mainnet:zF7rhDBfUt9d1gJPjx7s1JXfUY7oVWkY</a></p>
<p>curl -X GET <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:com:1l6zglh8pvcrjtahsvds2qmfpn0hv83vn8f9cf3">https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:com:1l6zglh8pvcrjtahsvds2qmfpn0hv83vn8f9cf3</a></p>
<p>Or try opening the UI to resolve the above DIDs:</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE">https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE</a></p>

 New hosting environment 
<p>It seems the community has been just as excited about the Universal Resolver as we are, and it has seen traffic grow steadily over the past few months: In order to serve this increased demand the hosting environment of the Universal Resolver has been upgraded and should now be able to handle additional load. DIF's public instance of the Universal Resolver can be reached at <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> and <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind however that this instance is meant for experimentation and testing only, NOT as a production service. It should not be used in situations where a reliable DID Resolution service is needed, or when DIDs are being resolved that are potentially sensitive from a privacy perspective. In general, self-hosting the Universal Resolver, or using other client-side DID Resolution tools, is preferable over relying on the public DIF-hosted instance.</p>
<p>Do you have any interesting applications or examples of where you have used the Universal Resolver? We would love to hear your experiences of it; constructive feedback is always welcome. Get in touch with us directly at <a href="mailto:ops@identity.foundation">ops@identity.foundation</a> or attend one of the meetings of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">DIF Identifiers &amp; DIscovery Working Group</a> to discuss. For further backstory on the Universal Resolver, see this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">blog post</a> and this <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/did-resolution-given-did-how-do-retrieve-document-markus-sabadello-webinar-13/">webinar</a>.</p>
<p>This new-and-improved Universal Resolver joins other tools, such as the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">Universal Registrar</a>, a DIF community-maintained tool to create, update and deactivate Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIF has also recently published <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">version 2 of the DIDComm protocol spec</a> and version 2 of the Presentation Exchange Protocol. Other community tooling includes items like the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/vui-donation/">Verifier Universal Interface</a>, standard APIs to enable interoperability between ID Wallets and Verifier components, and the completed <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree specification</a>, a protocol for creating scalable Decentralized Identifier networks that can run atop any existing decentralized anchoring system and be as open, public, and permissionless as the underlying anchoring systems they utilize. The most popular implementation of Sidetree currently is <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION (the Decentralized Identity Overlay Network)</a>, a layer 2 system.

<p>The Finnish Ministry of Finance has granted the Findynet Cooperative a three-million-euro government grant to build a pilot environment for a self-sovereign identity network. The aim of this public-private cooperation is to strengthen Finland’s leading position in digitalization and support the emergence of investments in new digital services.</p>
<p>The Findynet Cooperative aims to develop a network that ensures that digital wallets developed by different service providers are interoperable, and work seamlessly for both organizations and individuals. Digital wallets enable individuals and organizations to share information about themselves in a reliable and secure manner in various situations. The funding will enable the Findynet Cooperative to develop a common and secure self-sovereign identity network, which can be used to ensure the correctness of information in electronic interactions.</p>
<p>– We are very happy to have received this government grant, which allows us to continue our long-term work with public and private sector actors and build a trust network covering all of society, comments Markus Hautala, Chairman of the Board of the Findynet Cooperative.</p>
<p>The trust network, which will now be built, promotes digital and human-centered data economies. This means that end-users manage their own data and can decide for themselves what information they share about themselves with different parties to preserve their privacy. For example, this exchange of information could involve electronic receipts, credit information, and proof of professional qualifications.</p>
<p>The founding members of the Findynet Cooperative include nine public and private sector organizations: Finance Finland, Finnish Post, Nixu, Nordea Bank, OP Financial Group, Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela), Technology Finland, Tietoevry and Vastuu Group.</p>
<p>The announcement by the Ministry of Finance on the subject can be found <a href="https://vm.fi/-/valtiovarainministerio-myontaa-valtionavustusta-itsehallittavan-identiteetin-luottamusverkon-kehittamiseen">here</a> (in Finnish).</p>

This release includes major updates to the front-end Switchboard web application as well as the back-end libraries and components, giving companies access to the full suite features offered by legacy identity access management solutions in a decentralized architecture.</p><p>Why we built Switchboard<br>Digital identity is integral to every facet of the energy sector, from basic administrative procedures (processing customer rebates for smart thermostats, or registering new solar systems) to high-stakes operational tasks (granting access to customer data, or sending control signals to generators). Given the importance of keeping identity data accurate and secure, as well as the risks and limitations of centralized management approaches as energy systems become increasingly diverse and distributed, SSI has emerged as one of the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/decentralized-identity-market-worth-6-822-million-by-2027--exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets-301557216.html">fastest-growing segments</a> of the enterprise IT landscape in recent&nbsp;years.</p><p>We began developing what is now Switchboard in 2019 to address two gaps in the market that were hindering SSI adoption in the energy sector and&nbsp;beyond:</p>  Most SSI solutions are focused narrowly on end-users (individual identity wallets to store credentials) or organizations (platforms to issue credentials to internal users). We saw a need for a harmonized solution that not only addressed both of these requirements but also provided sophisticated features like role-based access control and identity management for non-human actors (i.e. hardware and software systems).  The end-to-end solutions that do exist align with open standards, but are based on proprietary technology, costly contracts, or permissioned back-ends (either private blockchains or centrally-administered databases). We saw a need for a fully open-source, low-cost solution built on a public network and tightly integrated with the Ethereum ecosystem to improve interoperability (e.g. support for multiple wallets) and usability.  <p>The alpha version of Switchboard was <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-unveils-ew-switchboard-2f71bc82daa0">launched on the Volta test network in late 2020</a> with basic tools for users to manage identities and credentials, and for application, developers to define roles and implement simple role-based access control for users. Since then the Energy Web team has overhauled both the user interface and back-end components to turn Switchboard into a comprehensive, enterprise-grade solution.</p><p>What’s new in production?<br>The production release of Switchboard incorporates several exciting new features that are critical for enterprise adoption:</p>  Credential Revocation: Identity and access management is a dynamic process, and when circumstances change they need to be reflected in user credentials. For example, when an employee resigns from the company, access rights need to be revoked in order to keep confidential information secure. Switchboard now offers tools for administrators to manually or programmatically revoke credentials based on customized business&nbsp;logic.  Credential Expiration: To maximize security credentials should never grant indefinite or permanent access to a given system. Just like driver’s licenses and passports, credentials should carry expiration dates and require ongoing renewal processes. Switchboard now allows role definers (e.g. organization administrators) to set default validity periods for credentials, which can be optionally overridden by&nbsp;issuers.  Full Support for Role-authorized Issuance: This feature allows administrators to delegate responsibility for the issuance of certain credentials to other entities based on their role within or relationship to the organization. For example, a user within a utility company who holds credentials to acquire the role of “IT Manager” may then inherit the ability to issue credentials to other internal users, or an external contractor with credentials granting the role of “Solar Hardware Installer” may inherit the ability to issue credentials to new photovoltaic systems. Multi-level hierarchies are now supported (for example, “Solar Hardware Installer” may be issued by “Installation Coordinator”) and the full hierarchy is verified upon each credential presentation.  Credential Issuance Based on Email Verification: Switchboard is currently used to support Energy Web’s staking system, which issues a verified email role credential based on email verification. This role credential is then used to authorize users to stake. (If you have participated in any Energy Web staking pools, you already have a DID with this credential and you can view its status in Switchboard under the “My Enrolments” page.) This functionality is now available for any other credential issuance and authorization use case that requires email verification.  Better Alignment with Verifiable Credentials Standards: We’ve made significant improvements to Switchboard’s underlying libraries and components to better align with new W3C Verifiable Credential Standards. Switchboard now supports the issuance of JSON-LD format Verifiable Credentials using an EIP-712 signature.  Asset Administration: Switchboard allows asset owners to assign identities to individual assets so they can be enrolled in applications and services, or managed throughout their lifecycle. These tools make it easy for owners to prove attributes to external parties and transfer ownership (including tracking ownership history).  <p>What’s next?<br>We’re proud to celebrate the launch of Switchboard as a milestone in Energy Web’s long-term technology roadmap. You can learn more about <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/switchboard/using-switchboard">how it works</a>, and <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">start using it</a>&nbsp;today.</p><p>However, there are many steps ahead in the journey to unlock the full potential of SSI in support of the energy transition. While Switchboard currently offers all the tools necessary to implement SSI in enterprise environments, we will continue to develop additional tools and features across our broader identity and access management stack, including a decentralized <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">universal resolver service</a> for both credential holders and issuers that makes it possible to resolve identity data from any blockchain or database.</p><p>Stay tuned for more announcements, and be sure <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">to follow us</a> for the latest&nbsp;updates.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>Avast (LON:AVST), a company best known for its antivirus and other cybersecurity products for consumers, has joined the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation as a Steering Member. Avast recently acquired Evernym, a founding ToIP Steering Member, and SecureKey, a ToIP Contributor Member since 2020.</p>



<p>Avast’s ToIP Steering Committee member will be Drummond Reed, Director of Trust Services at Avast. Mr. Reed has served as Evernym’s Steering Committee member since the founding of ToIP in May 2020. He currently co-chairs the ToIP Governance Stack Working Group and Concepts and Terminology Working Group and is a vice-chair of the Technology Stack Working Group.</p>



<p>“Avast brings a new perspective to the Foundation’s mission of defining Internet-scale decentralized digital trust infrastructure,” said Mr. Reed. “Avast has a 30 year history of protecting the digital devices of over 435 million consumers. Now Avast wants to extend that protection to individual’s digital identity and relationships online because identity is at the very heart of cybersecurity.”</p>



<p>Avast, headquartered in Prague, is rapidly building one of the largest decentralized digital trust teams in the world. In June of 2021, they hired Charles Walton, a former Mastercard executive (and Mastercard’s original ToIP Steering Committee member), as General Manager of their new Digital Trust Services division. Then in December 2021, Avast acquired Evernym, one of the global leaders in self-sovereign identity (SSI). In March 2022 they announced the acquisition of SecureKey, operators of the Verified.Me network in Canada that is one of the largest bank ID networks in the world.</p>



<p>In a keynote speech at the European Identity Conference in Berlin, Mr. Walton said Avast would be focusing its efforts on the “empowered consumer”—giving individuals the tools they need to have portable, reusable digital identity credentials that do not depend on any one device, operating system, or identity federation. “It is finally time we had digital wallets with digital credentials that work exactly the same way our real-world wallets do,” said Mr. Reed. “We can take and use them anywhere to privately prove just what another party needs to know in the context of a particular transaction. We don’t have to go through any third-party gatekeeper to do this. That’s the way it should work in the digital world too.”</p>



<p>The challenge, of course, is interoperability—the entire raison d’etre of the ToIP Foundation. According to Mr. Reed, this is the reason that Avast intends to participate very actively in advancing the work of ToIP Working Groups. “Avast is a global company, and the #1 challenge in establishing digital wallets and credentials that work around the world is interoperability,” said Mr. Reed. “It is a key focus of the European Digital Identity Wallets initiative as well as other government-sanctioned digital wallet projects. Avast believes that the ToIP stack is the answer, and we want to help drive its completion and adoption as quickly as possible.”For more information about Avast’s digital trust services and products, please visit <a href="https://www.avast.com/digital-trust">www.avast.com/digital-trust</a>.

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>This video shares a talk from the <a href="https://www.scottishaisummit.com/summit-2022">Scottish AI Summit</a>, addressing how best we can support the commercialization of AI technologies to meet real-world needs. 
<p>The University of Edinburgh has programmes to nurture data-driven entrepreneurs at different stages on their journey from the seed of an idea to scaling globally. As well as supporting both technology transfer from academic research and home grown businesses, the University is also attracting high growth global AI start-ups.</p>
<p>In this panel session, Katy Guthrie and Laura Bernal from the University’s Data-Driven Entrepreneurship programme will be joined by founders of some the companies they have supported, across different sectors including MedTech and ClimateTech.</p>
<p>The discussion will focus on the opportunities and challenges for companies using AI, how scaling AI driven business can benefit the people of Scotland and the world and what can be done to stimulate activity and address issues.</p>
 Introductions – (3m:15s) 
<p>Katy Guthrie, the Manager for the University of Edinburgh AI accelerator program commenced the summit by stating the purpose of the panel, which is to explore how best to support the commercialization of AI technologies.</p>
<p>The university has entrepreneurs at different stages on their journey from the seed of an idea to scaling globally, as well as supporting both technology transfer from academic research and home-grown business. The University is also attracting high-growth global AI start-ups.</p>
<p>She introduced the other members of the panel who are founders of AI-driven companies at different stages. They’ve all taken entrepreneurship programs at the university too.</p>
<p>After the introduction, at about 4m:20s Katy listed the topics to be discussed which are:</p>
 
 The role of AI as an enabler. 
 The areas of opportunity. 
 Challenges faced and how well to overcome them. 
 
<p>She describes how they had a recent program that supported 12 AI-driven companies over a period of 6 months and it’s helped companies to build commercial skills, connect them into networks, and to learn from each other.</p>
<p>At 6m:47s Laura Bernal talks about how they supported Ph.D. students and early career researchers who are looking to commercialize IP or research, and that their program helps companies to be more business-minded. They help scientific background people to think about business because they believe academia can have a relationship with industries. She was formerly a founder before she joined the program.</p>
<p>At 8m:14s they are joined by the other panel members introducing themselves and what they do. Xiaoyan Ma, founder and CEO of <a href="https://danurobotics.com/">Danu Robotics</a> introduced herself and talked more about her company.</p>
<p>Then at 9m:00s, she hands over to Lorenzo Conti, a founder and managing director at <a href="https://www.crover.tech/">Crover</a> who talked about his Edinburgh-based startup which focuses on helping grain storage operators like grain merchants, port operators, and cooperatives.</p>
<p>On to Debbie Wake (10m:28s), a medical doctor and clinical academic with the University of Edinburgh. She is also a Co-founder of a digital health company <a href="https://mywaydigitalhealth.co.uk/">MyWay</a>. She gave a brief talk on how they manage conditions like diabetes, drug response and diagnostic prediction as well as how they offer tools to Education platforms.</p>
<p>Joseph Twigg, CEO of <a href="https://aveni.ai/">Aveni</a>, introduces his company (11m:56s), also an Edinburgh-based startup, where they focus on natural language processing, delivering and helping with solutions in the service industries. They derive insight and automation from customer conversation.</p>
 Scaling AI in Scotland 
<p>From 13m:40s Katy moves on to the detail of the discussion, with the main perspective being to identify why it is important to support the scaling of these businesses, which is to boost economic growth and productivity because these companies are creating high-value jobs.</p>
<p>They also support companies that tackle societal issues in Scotland. They have a strong capability in AI in Scotland which is attractive to companies who want to work not just at the University of Edinburgh but in Scotland.</p>
<p>They are often seen as being great at inventing things but not as good as commercializing them. For example from a review it was identified that the UK is ranked third in the world for research in AI but only 11th in its ability to realize Impact from it. So they want to change that and make Scotland seen as an excellent place to build a high-value AI-driven business.</p>
<p>It’s partly about supporting homegrown businesses and also attracting AI start-ups from elsewhere. The key point is about building the ecosystem.</p>
<p>In Scotland, they’ve got lots of big corporates in industries and they need innovative smaller businesses like start-ups that can bring new ideas. Developing and fostering that ecosystem is a key part of what they do at the Bayes Centre of the University of Edinburgh with the data-driven entrepreneurship support program at the university.</p>
 The Role of AI as the Enabler (16m:23s) 
<p>Here Katy asks the panel why they use AI, to explore what role the technology plays as an enabler.</p>
<p>For example at 17m:04s Joseph said he worked in the financial services industry for 15 years and identified a number of potential scenarios for improved efficiencies through using the technology.</p>
<p>Debbie highlights how they didn’t start as an AI business, but rather as an educational web site for diabetes information, and they came to realize how important data was to that process, and it became clear that AI could play a key role in facilitating better personalized access to that data.</p>
<p>For Lorenzo (20m:00s) they were working with a very novel and complex technology that involves hardware locomotion through a very kind of unstable environment data and they employed AI to tackle several technical challenges in a different part of their product, and to reach the required level of performance. In a very efficient way, AI helped them in the prediction of the robot’s movement around the environment, and since then they have employed it in other areas like the accuracy of their sensors.</p>
<p>At 23m:41s Katy asked Laura if she has any other companies looking up to AI for solutions to early-stage academic problems.</p>
<p>In response to this she mentioned a company that didn’t start as an AI company but later employed AI to model how the results of diagnosis will perform and how effectively it could put them to an advantage over their competitors. She said she has seen many companies that are AI-driven and need AI to increase their competitive advantage.</p>
 Finding Opportunities 
<p>Laura takes over at 25m:11s and asks the panel if there are other areas where AI can be applied.</p>
<p>For Xiaoyan it will have a huge opportunity in traditional industries such as agriculture risk management and manufacturing. AI can help people in the space to improve their operational efficiency, profitability, and sustainability, and&nbsp;can help in changing the procurement processes.</p>
<p>For Lorenzo (29m:35s), what is needed for the AI solution to work is assistance on how to manage funding.</p>
<p>There’s a need for access to another company’s customers’ data and regulatory bar set very high to train models (Joseph 32m:58s), and AI also needs to make a product that compensates for the risk companies are taking.</p>
 If you could do something different this time what it be? (Laura 34m:14s) 
<p>According to Joseph, partner selection would be the first thing to do differently, especially in the first critical phase of developing and validating the concept.</p>
<p>Debbie seconds this at 35m:25s, describing their challenge with Information Governance in the NHS, and how bringing in an expert consultancy to address this early on for them would have saved them up to two years of work.</p>
<p>At 38m:00s&nbsp;Laura asks Katy what opportunities she has seen and the ones coming up next. Katy replies that she sees many, in key areas like Natural Language Processing, and that you can view them through a lens of industry vertical or horizontal technology specialisms, and that there is potential to cut across multiple use cases.</p>
<p>She cites an example of a body scanning app that took part in their accelerator, which can be used for e-commerce scenarios where it can be used to match customers sizes to reduce returns, and it can also be used in Healthcare.</p>
 Challenges Faced by AI-Driven Business 
<p>At 43m:45s the panel moves on to the final topic: Challenges Faced by AI-Driven Business.</p>
<p>These include&nbsp;the volume of data (Debbie 44:23), and when dealing with AI there’s high-risk complexity often that brings in regulatory burden, therefore there’s a need for additional research evaluation risk assessment.</p>
<p>Joseph makes a critical point at 45m:42s, that the Scottish startup support ecosystem is great, but it’s not so great when it comes to encouraging large enterprise organizations to work with those startups. For example providing them incentives to choose to work with a local startup vs AWS.</p>
<p>From 49m:18s, Debbie talked about what can help:</p>
 
 Support within the Scottish ecosystem. 
 Support from using wider support. 
 Support from Scottish Enterprise. They support in a lot of ways around market scoping internationally and have amazing networks and obviously the AI accelerator program. 
 
<p>From 51m:58s Lorenzo adds that there’s a need for support programs that truly understand deep hardware innovators, a challenge globally not just in Scotland.</p>
<p>At 54m:45s Katy asks Joseph: Should early-stage businesses worry about the public perception of AI, or should they just get on with making the best possible solutions?</p>
<p>Lorenzo believes it’s a lot to do with perception, that most people assume AI is intelligent robots when really what is in use is the type of business applications improved by algorithms that have been discussed on this panel. Similarly Joseph adds that while AI is used to augmented processes like those in financial services it is still ultimately a decision made by a human.</p>
<p>Debbie also added that though changing public perception is really hard but as SMEs she thinks they’ve got restricted resources as to how to do that. Working with policymakers and bodies to try and support the industry image is a good thing.</p>
 Wrap Up 
<p>At 57m:32s: Katy handed over to Laura to round off the summit.</p>
<p>Laura started by accepting the fact that there are always going to be challenges in the process. Therefore she encouraged us to think about how we could help companies that are developing in AI and how we can start changing that infrastructure to overcome those challenges as an ecosystem in general.</p>
<p>In her closing remark, she said the AI accelerator would be opening applications for their next intake in April to start the program in September. And also if anyone wants to scale an AI company should contact Katy through her LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katy-guthrie-edinburgh/">Katie Guthrie</a>.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNx3f74AmVQ">this video</a> Kate Forbes, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy, delivers a statement to the Scottish Parliament, about transforming Scotland’s tech sector. 
<p>In August 2020, the Scottish Government published the “Scottish Technology Ecosystem Review”, which is a blueprint to establish Scotland as a leading hub for tech start-ups. The report was written by Mark Logan, the former Chief Operating Officer of Skyscanner, which was one of Scotland’s first tech companies to achieve a valuation of more than £1 billion.</p>
<p>Professor Logan’s report was greeted with acclaim on publication. It was described as an “exciting route map for how the government and the private sector can work together to build Scotland into a global leader.</p>
<p>Last October, the Scottish Government invited suppliers to tender for a contract to establish a national network of five ‘tech scaler’ hubs in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Inverness.</p>
<p>The hubs will provide Scottish companies with commercial education sourced from the best providers in the world. That education will be complemented with physical co-location, first-rate mentoring and vibrant peer communities. Through state-of-the-art remote technologies, all of that will be available virtually in every community in Scotland.</p>
<p>Those tech scalers are a game changer. The government has established a new organization named Scottish Teachers Advancing Computing Science (STACS) which helps driving improvements in equipment, teacher training and the curation of best practice. Working with Toni Scullion and Brendan McCart, the government has invested more than £1 million pounds to add to schools’ existing stocks of computing hardware.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government also invested a further £500,000 in the digital skills pipeline, a bespoke set of modular courses running from beginner level all the way through to advanced coding. They provided grant funding of £150,000 to CodeYourFuture, a truly exceptional organization that supports refugees with the skills and networks necessary to progress in education and employment.</p>
<p>The Scottish National Investment Bank has agreed to support the all-female investor group, Investing Women Angels, to establish a new investment fund focused exclusively on women and minority founders based in Scotland. That makes Scotland one of very few European nations with a bespoke seed investment fund focused on stimulating the growth of female-led companies, delivering yet another of Mark Logan’s recommendations.</p>
<p>STACS ensures that there is greater choice for young people in their formal subject choices and informal extracurricular activities. It is a teacher-led organization, which starts with teachers. It aims to provide support and expertise to and promote skills among computing science teachers across Scotland.</p>
<p>Many young people in Scotland are choosing to work and study simultaneously, and a number of tech businesses are already taking advantage of that apprenticeship model. According to the government, work has also started on expanding the young person’s guarantee.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is progressing a number of recommendations specifically around investment and investment funding, to avoid the situation whereby, for a Scottish start-up to expand, grow and develop, it needs to access funding elsewhere. Although no one would dispute that Skyscanner has been a success, some of the recommendations looked at, for example, establishing a series A funding partnership between the Scottish Government, Scottish venture capitalists and external investors; investment vehicles specifically for certain groups, such as female founders.</p>
<p>In the opinion of Kate Forbes, the government has much to do with the 95 per cent of access to broadband that already exists. Clearly reaching the goals of the R100 program it needs to ensure that every property has access to broadband. They will progress that and ensure that it is delivered despite the fact that it is a reserved area and they are stepping into the breach to do that and the work is progressing.</p>
<p>The tech ecosystem fund has supported multiple events for and by women, with more than £160,000 of funding given to Women’s Enterprise Scotland, Female Founder Squad, Mint Ventures and other organizations providing learning and peer networking opportunities and helping to overcome some of the challenges faced by women in tech. There is a clear gender gap in business participation in Scotland. Closing that gap and unlocking the full economic potential of women in enterprise will have a transformative impact on Scotland’s economic performance.</p>
<p>According to Kate Forbes, being able to provide extracurricular activity that creates equity of access to opportunities to learn is so important. The young women are being role models as female founders and in celebrating female computer science teachers, which is critical to all of this. Right now, Education Scotland has a dedicated team that is working with schools and early learning centers specifically to deal with early gender stereotyping and to ensure that that engagement carries on throughout primary school and high school and ultimately into the university years.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is keen to see more small and medium-sized enterprises embracing the opportunities of technology, and that needs to go hand in hand with cybersecurity. In the past, they have provided financial support, such as vouchers, to help SMEs to do that. She has referred to some of the cyber apprenticeships that all goes hand in hand with promoting best practice across the public, private and third sector.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>Speaking at the Barclays Glasgow Campus on 13 July 2022 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon outlines the Scottish Government’s commitment to supporting entrepreneurship and innovation through the launch of the Tech Scalers network. 
 Video Summary 
<p>Barclays will be the host of the Glasgow Tech Scaler hub and that is good news, a further demonstration of how important this campus is going to be not just to Glasgow but to Scotland as a whole.</p>
<p>Over the last few years Scotland’s tech sector has really developed a very strong sense of community, and you can see, hear and feel this. Businesses are constantly sharing and learning from each other’s experiences.</p>
<p>Within the context of the Scottish Government’s overall&nbsp;approach to the economy the establishment of the Tech Scalers are central to the ambition of creating a more entrepreneurial nation, making sure that the commitment to and success in entrepreneurship in a future Scotland is very much chiming with that reputation for enterprise innovation and entrepreneurship that we have down through past generations.</p>
<p>A few months ago, we published the new Scottish government national strategy for economic transformation looking at how particularly we emerge from the Covid pandemic. We want to build a country that is greener, fairer and wealthier for this and generations to come, and to help us achieve those aims that we’ve set very clearly.</p>
<p>There is a need to establish a sense of common purpose among businesses trade unions, government and the many other partners that all need to contribute to building a successful economy and that sense of common purpose is already very striking in the tech and entrepreneurship sectors.</p>
<p>This has been developed in recent years by the likes of CodeBase, FutureX, the Bayes Centre EIE team,&nbsp;as well as by networks like Startup Grind, The Female Founders Squad, the Scottish Games Network and many others besides.</p>
<p>So, it’s something that as government we want to support and encourage across other parts of the economy. In recent years, for example, we funded SCDI to run productivity clubs to bring companies together to learn from each other about how to operate more effectively and how to benefit from new technology. So, it’s a simple but really powerful way of tackling what is one of the biggest issues facing our economy and how do we sustainably increase productivity.</p>
<p>The benefits of that approach where businesses and organizations cooperate and collaborate for a common purpose is already very clear in this sector. In the tech sector, the efforts you’ve made in recent years are already making this sector a very significant Scottish success story. Scottish startups and scale-ups employ more than 135,000 people which is more than anywhere else in the UK outside of London and the south east.</p>
<p>Our universities are recognized rightly as world leaders in areas like data analytics and informatics and we have got enormous strengths as a country in really key areas for the future like AI robotics and FinTech. So we’ve got lots to be proud of we’ve got lots to be enthusiastic and optimistic about.</p>
<p>The sector can still do much better and to illustrate that with just one example in recent years – Scotland has produced three unicorn companies of course valued at more than one billion dollars and two of these have been tech companies. It is something be celebrated but over that same period that Scotland has produced three unicorns, Ireland has produced seven, Estonia ten, Israel sixteen and Sweden thirty five.</p>
<p>Obviously, the creation of unicorn companies isn’t by any stretch of the imagination the only measure of a country’s success but it is a strong indicator and one that we should take seriously. We can and should be doing even more to build on the current strengths that this sector has. Scotland’s ecosystem before the pandemic was closer to this tipping point than at any time in its modern history.</p>
<p>It highlighted that relatively limited interventions by government could help reach that tipping point and it set out what those interventions should be in the three key areas of education, infrastructure and financing. The Scottish government has started implementing these recommendations.</p>
<p>For example, we’ve established a new organization called Scottish Teachers Advancing Computing Science and are designing a new plan for skills development for computer science and teaching. It will help to shape and transform how computer science is taught in our schools. We also establish the tech ecosystem fund which provides support for organizations that help entrepreneurs connect with their peers and with potential investors.</p>
<p>We invited tenders last year to establish the Tech Scalers. The bidding process generated a lot of interest which is really encouraging and has already led to new collaborations between Scottish and international organizations.</p>
<p>The contract has been awarded to CodeBase, who already run a very successful tech incubator in Edinburgh and under the contract they will establish seven Scalers in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling.</p>
<p>These hubs will be delivered in partnership with universities, local authorities and businesses. The Scalers will provide the basic infrastructure but also a complete support service for startups, will offer five separate courses for companies at different stages of development from new startups onwards. The course for advanced companies will include free access to a program called Reforge, which is Silicon Valley’s most prestigious education program for tech startups.</p>
<p>CodeBase have also promised to develop a national calendar of events for the tech community and companies led by women and minorities, currently significantly underrepresented amongst tech startups will be prioritized for entry to the incubators.</p>
<p>These companies will also be given extra support that recognizes the greater challenges they currently face in raising investment and developing peer networks. Supporting entrepreneurship is one of the most important interventions any government can make in an economy, so that’s why the new role Mark Logan is taking up as chief entrepreneurship officer is so vitally important.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is determined to do everything we can to create a more entrepreneurial nation indeed that’s why we’re investing in these tech scalers at a time when we’re facing a tough public spending environment, because we know that by providing the right environment for business government action can help to support a much stronger and more sustainable economy.</p>

<p>While many self-sovereign identity solutions offer tools for individuals, a government team from Canada is using digital trust technology to improve sustainability reporting in the natural resource sector for organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


 
Nancy Norris 


<p>The Government of British Columbia (B.C.) – a Trust Over IP (ToIP) Steering Committee Member – initiated the Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) project under the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation (EMLI) to facilitate the transition to a resilient, clean economy. EMDT’s pilot enables a collaborative digital ecosystem between the B.C. government, natural resource companies, and organizations around the world to improve sustainability reporting using digital credentials. Digital credentials make sustainability reporting more efficient, enhance business-to-business trust, and protect data from manipulation. Digital credentials can be checked in real time, expediting access to trustworthy information. These trusted, verifiable digital credentials are the core digital trust technologies being piloted and the trust ecosystem in which they operate are defined in ToIP architecture, governance, and related documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join members of the open-source community as they share projects, discuss problems, and collaborate on new solutions at three Linux Foundation conferences this September. Attend one of three sessions featuring EMDT’s business application of digital credentials with Nancy Norris, Senior Director of ESG &amp; Digital Trust in the Ministry for Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation for the Government of British Columbia, and Kyle Robinson, Senior Strategic Advisor.</p>

<p>Security threats are always changing and evolving causing us to shift gears into how we can better approach authentication. While there are plenty of authentication methods, the root of the security problem is the password. Traditional MFA solutions have proven to provide little additional assurance and leave companies vulnerable unless they make a change. By eliminating the password, we can eliminate the most common cyber-attack vector. Passwordless MFA (PMFA) is the only way to break this cycle. PMFA is phishing resistant and is core to the Zero Trust model which is part of FIDO2. CISA has endorsed FIDO2 as the gold standard for authentication. By eliminating the weakest part of the security chain, automated attacks are virtually eliminated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The role of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has notably changed since the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Dale Heath, Technology Lead at Rubrik A/NZ, “A holistic security approach – combining infrastructure, cloud and data security (or end-to-end Zero Trust security) – is required to help keep an organisation safe.”&nbsp; “This means bringing together prevention, detection and investigation as well as ensuring data resilience, data observability and data recovery.”&nbsp; The next plan of action is to go passwordless. The industry is on the cusp of replacing passwords and legacy Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) methods with modern open authentication standards, like FIDO2. These standards will enable widespread adoption of phishing-resistant and usable security, and hopefully, will be able to help CISOs to eradicate an entire class of issues that have long been associated with passwords.</p>

<p>In the last few days, the encrypted messaging platform, ‘Signal’ confirmed a variety of their customers fell victim to the phishing attack on Twilio. It is estimated that 1,900 were affected by the breach via phone number and SMS verification links to “reset passwords” on a phony Twilio link. By posing as Twilio’s IT dept, the hackers were able to obtain victim’s login credentials. Unfortunately, it is still unclear who was behind this attack. Cloudflare also revealed they were subjected to a phishing attack around the very same time as Twilio, but was not breached as an end result owing to the corporation-vast use of hardware-centered, FIDO2-compliant multi-factor authentication (MFA) keys.</p>

<p>Today, human rights abuses are often documented as they happen and quickly shared with others around the world: war is streamed live through digital communications technologies. Protesters carry cameras into the streets and film arrests or the misuse of teargas. Perpetrators share videos of violence in messaging groups. All of this is possible through cheap camera sensors in mobile telephones that allow their owners to film and share videos on social media platforms thanks to high-speed internet connections. The collection, analysis and publication of this information – and other digitally mediated data like satellite imagery and social media profiles – by journalists and human rights investigators has become known as open source investigations. This investigative technique has grown in prevalence over the past decade. Collecting videos and photographs of possible human rights abuses or violations of the laws of war is now part of the researcher’s methodological toolbox. Yet all too often, the collection, verification and use of open source information can happen without thinking through all the ethical considerations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While we have reason to appreciate the increased visibility of serious international crimes that warrant investigation, these probes come with difficult decisions and raise human rights and ethical challenges. The appeal of open source investigations in allowing investigators to map violations across time and space pull these concerns to the fore. Open source research can, for example, uncover the identity of witnesses, victims or perpetrators and the location of a crime in near real time, potentially placing these people at risk. Open source research relies on the collection and analysis of large data sets that create and expose patterns in data. Human rights investigators and their organisations not only need to be aware of the ethical challenges this form of research presents; they also must consider and integrate their responses to them as they plan, execute and make public their research.</p>



<p>We hope this report and workbook offer material to open source human rights investigators and other organisations applying such an approach to their research, with discussion points that ensure that this rapidly-developing field always remains focused on the victim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Zara Rahman and Gabriela Ivens highlight in the <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/digital-witness-9780198836070?cc=nl&amp;lang=en&amp;" title="book Digital Witness">book Digital Witness</a>, “the end mission of defending human rights and revealing rights violations means that investigators should be particularly cautious about their actions and understand the responsibility they carry. In essence: human rights should not be violated during the process of a human rights investigation”.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I only discovered Kim Cameron’s seminar article on the seven laws of identity many years after it was published, it felt as current as anything new I was reading when I first began studying identity. Going through his thought-provoking blog posts about identity and privacy also provided me with ideas and considerations that I could not find anywhere else. As a result, I am deeply honored to be one of the first recipients of the award in his honor in recognition of my work in this field.</p>
<p>My journey with digital identity began as a back-end web developer who was curious about how the systems I was helping to build handled users’ passwords, as well as having to implement single sign-on using SAML. Many years later, when I began pursuing a PhD, my advisor suggested that I specialize in electronic identity at our very first meeting. After reading numerous books, papers, protocol specifications, and implementations, I am now researching quantum-safe IAM protocols and self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>One of my first thoughts while attending the conference was how excited I was to meet the giants who wrote the protocols I have been studying and actively implementing in my academic research. However, Identiverse provided me with much more. The opportunity to (physically) reach out to many like-minded people outside of academia who are interested in the challenges of security and privacy in IAM is perhaps the most valuable outcome.</p>
<p>Furthermore, learning about the most recent developments in the OIDC working groups FAPI, eKYC &amp; IDA, and SSE, as well as the work on the OAuth side of the force with OAuth 2.1, PKCE, and RFCs 9068, 9126, and 9207, was extremely beneficial. Furthermore, it was only through attending Identiverse that I discovered that a sizable portion of the IAM industry is focusing on multi-factor authentication, which surprised me because I assumed this was already well established.</p>
<p>I am grateful to the OpenID Foundation for this incredible opportunity and eager to collaborate with the identity community.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>At the start of 2020 a new workgroup was formed under the OpenID Foundation that was to continue on from activities that had been ongoing in the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">AB/Connect Working Group | OpenID</a>&nbsp;for some months. That new working group came to be known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Working Group</a>.</p>
<p>The initiation of that activity was off the back of a IPR donation from yes.com of an extension to OpenID Connect that they had created.</p>
 What Is It? 
<p><a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0-13.html">OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance 1.0</a>&nbsp;(OIDC4IDA for short) is an extension to&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Core</a></p>
 OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance 1.0 Current Status 
<p>Implementers Draft 4 is currently available for review –&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/2022/08/19/fourth-public-review-period-for-openid-connect-for-identity-assurance-specification-started/">Fourth Public Review Period for OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance Specification Started</a>.</p>
<p>There is a beta version of the Conformance testing suite that supports OIDC4IDA available on request that was developed through directed funding and will allow implementers to check their implementations conform to the specification, making implementation of interoperable solutions cheaper and easier.</p>
<p>The current spec is already being adopted in a number of places including Germany, UK, EU and being seriously considered for use in Australia.</p>
 What is OIDC4IDA Good For? 
<p>OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance is primarily focussed on addressing use-cases where the details of the assurance process used to verify and validate the end-users identity need to be explicitly communicated.</p>
<p>The working group believes it’s a good fit for account opening, staff on-boarding, account recovery and access to restricted services where communication of how the underlying identity was established is needed.</p>
 Who Built It? 
<p>The inspiration for OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance was from yes.com in Germany and donated to the OpenID Foundation in 2019. It has seen further development from a wide range of people from many countries and businesses of many types, including software vendors, services companies, network operators, consultancies, banks, and healthcare providers.</p>
 How Does It Work? 
<p>OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance is intended to be a lightweight extension to OpenID Connect and uses the authorization code flow of OpenID Connect Core including allowing for end user approval. It encourages the use of the claims request parameter where the relying party expresses which parts of the identity data and metadata it needs, and it defines a schema for communication of “verified claims”. The “verified claims” specification has two child elements one with information about “verification” (and validation), and the other containing the verified end-user claims themselves.</p>
<p>Security concerns relating to exchange of sensitive personal data via OIDC4IDA should be addressed simply through use of the output of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> which you can read about in this white paper.</p>

You can ignore this security group for now.</p><p>Click the Create security group button in the top right corner of the page.</p><p>Step 3<br>Configure the new security group with the following parameters:</p><p>Basic details</p>  Security group name: ceramicservers  Description: allow access to Ceramic services  VPC: Leave as default unless you have a more complex AWS environment  <p>Inbound rules</p><p>Rule 1:</p>  Type: Custom TCP  Port range: 7007  Source: Anywhere-IPv4  Description: Ceramic port  <p>Rule 2:</p>  Type: SSH  Source: Anywhere-IPv4  Description: SSH port  <p>Outbound Rules</p>  Leave as default  <p>Tags</p>  Leave as default  <p>Once you have filled in these configuration options click the Create security group button.</p><p>You should now see the newly-created security group in the management console.</p> Creating a Ceramic Node <p>Now that all of the AWS environment setup is complete it's time to begin building a Ceramic node in the cloud.</p> Creating an EC2 Instance For Ceramic <p>Step 1<br>From the AWS Management Console use the search bar to locate the EC2 Service by typing <code>EC2</code> and selecting the corresponding service.</p><p>You should now be able to see the associated EC2 Resources that you set up in previous steps. If you are working from a new AWS environment you will see that there is 1 key pair and 2 security groups.</p><p>If you do not see these resources, ensure that you are viewing the proper region. Sometimes the AWS Management Console will display resources from different regions and can make it appear as though resources are missing when they are in fact in a different region.</p><p>Step 2<br>Below the Resources box you will see a Launch instance section. Click the orange Launch instance button in this section and select Launch instance from the drop down menu that appears.</p><p>Step 3<br>You are now ready to begin configuring an EC2 instance for your Ceramic node. This screen can seem a little daunting with all the options, so take extra care to configure options properly before launching your instance.</p><p>Improper configuration could result in charges to your AWS account. 3Box Labs and the Ceramic Network are not responsible for any charges you incur while working with cloud resources. Please double check all your work and understand the AWS billing process before proceeding.</p><p>Configure your EC2 instance with the following options:</p><p>Name and Tags</p>  Name: Ceramic  <p>Application and OS Images</p>  AMI: Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) - Kernel 5.10, SSD Volume Type (Free tier eligible)  Architecture: 64-bit (x86  <p>Instance Type</p>  Instance type: t2.micro (free tier eligible)  <p>Key pair</p>  Key pair name: ceramickeypair  <p>Network Settings</p>  Firewall: Select existing security group  Common security groups: ceramicservers  <p>Configure Storage</p>  1x: 15gb  GiB: gp2  <p>Advanced details</p>  default  <p>Once you have added these configuration details, set the Number of instances to 1 and click the orange Launch instance button located at the bottom of the Summary</p><p>Step 4<br>The Launch an instance page should now have a button that allows you to View all instances. Click the View all instances button to continue.</p><p>You will now see a new EC2 instance named Ceramic Server running in your environment.</p><p>In the next section you will connect to this instance and configure your Ceramic node.</p> Connecting to The Newly Created EC2 Instance <p>Connecting to this newly created EC2 instance will vary based on your operating system. If you are using Windows you will need an SSH client, such as <a href="https://putty.org/">PuTTY</a>. If you are using Linux or MacOS you will be able to use the built-in SSH client located in the Terminal.</p><p>The instructions that follow will only cover the Linux and MacOS terminal. Once connected to the instance all commands and steps will be the same regardless of which operating system you are using.</p><p>Step 1<br>In the AWS Management Console select the Ceramic Server EC2 instance and click on the Connect button located near the top of the screen.</p><p>After clicking the Connect button select the SSH client tab to see the connection instructions for your instance. Your details will be different from what you see in the screenshot below since AWS populates this information dynamically.</p><p>Step 2<br>This step will guide you through the instructions located on the SSH client tab of the Connect to instance page.</p><p>Open your terminal and locate the key pair file you downloaded in Step 3 of the <a href="https://hackmd.io/ahqZ7_OeRp2f7vAKQyOP_Q#Preparing-AWS-for-Ceramic">Preparing AWS for Ceramic</a> section, it should be named <code>ceramickeypari.pem</code> if you followed along with the earlier steps.</p><p>This file may also have a <code>.cer</code> extension. This is perfectly fine and can be treated as a <code>.pem</code> file.</p><p>In this example the <code>ceramickeypair.cer</code> file is located in the Home directory of the logged in user.</p><p>When you download this file from AWS it downloads with improper permissions for use. If you try to use this file with your SSH client you will see an error explaining that the file has too many permissions to be used safely. Let’s fix that now by reducing the permissions granted to this key file.</p><p>In the terminal run the following command:</p><p><code>chmod 400 ceramickeypair.cer</code></p><p>There will be no output from this command, but if you inspect the permissions you should now see that this file is only able to be read by the owner. <a href="https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php">Learn more about file permissions</a>.</p><p>Now that your file permissions are properly restricted, use your terminal to connect to your EC2 instance. The connection information can be found in the example at the bottom of the Connect to instance page you opened above in Step 1. Your details will differ from what you see below.</p><p><code>ssh -i "ceramickeypair.cer" ec2-user@ec2-54-215-186-11.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com</code></p><p>When prompted to accept the fingerprint, type the word <code>yes</code> to continue connecting to your instance.</p><p>You should now see the terminal change to reflect that you are connected to the EC2 instance.</p><p>You are now connected to your EC2 instance using SSH. Any commands you run inside this terminal will execute on the remote instance located on AWS.</p> Installing Ceramic Dependencies <p>Step 1<br>When you launch a fresh AWS instance, it’s always a good practice to start by updating the package manager. This Amazon Machine Image(AMI) uses <a href="https://linuxconcept.com/yum-package-manager-a-complete-guide/">yum</a> as its package manager. To update the packages on the system run the <code>update</code> command as an administrator. In this case we will add the <code>-y</code> flag to skip being prompted if we are sure we want to apply the updates.</p><p><code>sudo yum update -y</code></p><p>There will be an overwhelming amount of information on the screen after you enter this command. The most important piece is at the end where the result of the command says complete and you have control of your prompt once more.</p><p>Step 2<br>One great thing about cloud computing is that the virtual machines provided for use are slim and often do not contain unnecessary software.</p><p>One downfall about cloud computing is that the virtual machines provided for use are slim and often do not contain the necessary software for our use case!</p><p>For a Ceramic node, your server will need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">NodeJS</a> version 16 installed on it. The simplest way to manage different version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">NodeJS</a> is through the use of a tool called [Node Version Manager(NVM)].</p><p>To download and install NVM on your EC2 instance run the following command in the terminal:</p><p><code>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash</code></p><p>It is important to note that NVM is frequently updated, you should always check the GitHub repository to ensure you are getting the most up-to-date version of NVM. This guide will NOT be updated as NVM versions change.</p><p>Once you see the information about what was added to the <code>.bashrc</code> file, NVM has been successfully installed.</p><p>However if you try to run NVM right now the terminal will display an error telling you the command <code>nvm</code> is not found.</p><p>To fix this error you need to “source” the <code>.bashrc</code> file to reload it into the current terminal session. Use the terminal to accomplish this. There will be no output from this command.</p><p><code>source .bashrc</code></p><p>Now if you type <code>nvm</code> into the terminal you should be greeted with the help text for this command.</p><p><code>nvm</code></p><p>Using NVM, install NodeJS Version 16.</p><p><code>nvm install 16</code></p><p>Your instance is now set up and ready to run Ceramic. Let’s get Ceramic running next!</p> Install and Run Ceramic <p>If you’ve made it this far then rejoice… the hard parts are over! Now you simply need to download and run Ceramic, and your AWS Ceramic Node will be fully accessible for your application.</p><p>Step 1<br>Use NPM to install the Ceramic daemon.</p><p><code>npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli</code></p><p>The amount of output from this command will be overwhelming; however, near the bottom of the output, you should see a message telling you that new packages have been added to your system.</p><p>Step 2<br>Run the Ceramic daemon to make this a usable Ceramic node.</p><p><code>ceramic daemon</code></p><p>Since you are running Ceramic in bundled mode, the output of this command will contain information about IPFS, to include peer discovery as well as Ceramic configuration information. When you see the message saying “Ceramic API running on 0.0.0.0:7007” you are ready to go.</p><p>Congratulations, you now have a Ceramic node running on AWS!</p><p>As you may have guessed, this is not an ideal setup. If you disconnect from this terminal session, shutdown the EC2 instance or perform many other tasks this process will terminate and your Ceramic node will be unreachable.</p><p>You may want to look into creating start-up scripts for your instance to ensure that the Ceramic daemon runs when the instance starts.</p> What’s next? <p>The only thing left is to connect to your instance using a Ceramic client.</p><p>Example using the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/javascript/http">Ceramic HTTP Client</a>:</p> <code>import CeramicClient from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
const API_URL = 'https://yourceramicnode.com' //AWS Public IPv4 info
const ceramic = new CeramicClient(API_URL)

</code> <p>Example using the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-glaze">Glaze CLI</a>:</p> <code>glaze config:set ceramic-url http://&lt;AWS Public IPv4&gt;:7007
</code>  Summary <p>You have now configured a Ceramic node in AWS that is accessible to anyone you share the IP Address or DNS address with.</p><p>It’s important to remember that Ceramic in bundled mode is intended for development purposes. Similarly to cloud providers other than AWS, future blog posts will guide you through setting up a node for production purposes.</p><p>Stay tuned for more Ceramic guides and tutorials.

 Our 20 Year Journey 



<p>Like many provinces and territories in Canada, British Columbia (BC) has a long history of providing secure access to online government services. We started our journey 20 years ago with the introduction of BCeID, a simple username and password solution. A lot has changed since then!</p>



<p>Today, we are investing in Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and a digital wallet. We see these as the cornerstones in the evolution of our digital strategy, adding a much needed layer of trust to the digital economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to share what we are doing, why we focus on interoperability and open-source, and why we are excited about VCs being our natural next step.</p>



 Why We Care 



<p>As a public sector organization, BC has a strong interest in seeing the adoption of technologies that are secure, privacy-preserving, and convenient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital is obviously everywhere. In 2021, 94% of BC citizens said they are online, and 90% of Canadians have smartphones. Also, according to the Business Council of Canada, in the last decade Canada’s digital economy grew 40% faster than the overall world economy.&nbsp; In Digital ID terms, this growth is an opportunity to make people’s online lives easier and safer.</p>



<p>We also know that cybersecurity threats are growing and there are no signs of it slowing down. BC sees an astonishing 496 million unauthorized access attempts per day – that’s 5,741 every second! Identity theft and fraud also continues to rise. We need digital trust solutions that counter this increasing risk.</p>



<p>In responding to this new reality, we recognize that people are familiar and comfortable with the many credentials that governments issue today. Things like physical copies of drivers’ licenses, health cards, passports, permits, and reports are widely accepted and trusted.&nbsp; In BC, we are building on that trust and moving towards providing the same things digitally. We are also enabling confidential connections through the wallet to give people choice and confidence in their digital lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 BC’s Approach&nbsp; 



<p>Clearly, digital trust goes far beyond just the government. Canadians expect more access, with greater security, to high-value services in both the public and private sectors. VCs and the wallet provide a highly flexible way to achieve that goal.</p>



<p>Collaboration is critical to achieving that goal and it’s important to us. BC’s Chief Information Officer, CJ Ritchie, strongly advocates for us working together to meet the expectations of Canadians.&nbsp; She notes, “If we don’t all act together to deliver solutions that protect privacy and interact securely, trust will erode and there will be negative impacts for businesses, people’s livelihoods, and the broader digital economy.”</p>



<p>As our approach evolves, we also remain keen to support open source solutions that interoperate with other national and international efforts. There is no dominant design yet, no one network or technology, so we must remain nimble and flexible in our exploration. We also need to coexist with existing identity solutions that millions of British Columbians already rely upon.</p>



 Technology Interoperability 



<p>In exploring VCs, BC is contributing to solutions that allow agents to verify credentials from multiple networks. Indeed, through one of our Code With Us initiatives, DID indy, we contributed over 11,000 lines of open-source code to support and prove the viability of a “network of networks”.</p>



<p>We also are focused on the interoperability of Hyperledger Aries agents themselves, another key success metric.&nbsp; We are leading contributors to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH)</a>, open-source software that runs a series of Hyperledger Aries interoperability tests and delivers the results to the <a href="http://aries-interop.info/">AATH website</a>. Great interoperability requires that we test—and re-test!—that interoperability on a regular basis.</p>



<p>__</p>



<p>Side note: If you want to test the interoperability of any Aries agent with this ecosystem, please sign up to join the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/event/hyperledger-aries-interoperability-event">Hyperledger Aries Interoperability Event on August&nbsp; 31</a>.</p>



<p>__</p>



 Driving Adoption 



<p>In BC we have a lot of technical skill in working with VCs and with Hyperledger Aries agents. However, for VCs to be successful, it needs to be easy for others to join in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the agents side, to complement our extensive contributions to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py)</a> and other Aries and Indy projects, we also contribute to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript">Hyperledger Aries Framework Javascript (AFJ)</a>, the agent commonly used for mobile digital wallets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why, when thinking about mobile digital wallets, we opted to contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native">Hyperledger Aries Bifold</a> project, helping it also essentially become “Bifold as a framework”. Bifold uses AFJ, and BC and others can use it to easily deploy a custom-designed digital wallet. Jurisdictions within Canada and elsewhere in the world are already taking this approach for their own wallet explorations. It’s an open-source stack right the way down.</p>



<p>VC adoption will be helped by a thriving open-source community, and we are giving back wherever we can.</p>



 Open-Source Success 



<p>We believe the community’s success becomes our success. For years we’ve been committed to open-source, interoperable solutions in this space. Our approach is always evolving, but our contributions and commitment to various digital trust open-source projects and technologies continue.</p>



<p>We hope that even more organizations will join in and contribute. Our goal in BC is a new layer of trust for the internet, making it easier for people to work and play online with confidence.&nbsp;</p>

     <p>Denver, CO August 22, 2022 – Bonifii is excited to announce that its premier digital identity and fraud prevention solution, MemberPass®, has been significantly strengthened and improved. The next generation of MemberPass is released and available for credit union implementation today!</p>
<p>MemberPass was the first completely secure form of digital identity verification. It’s owned and controlled by members and is simple to use as personal authentication for all transactions and web commerce.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/06/02/digital-identity-its-way-more-important-than-you-thought/?sh=7540f69d2eaf">Secure identity verification is essential today</a>. The use of digital channels for routine financial transactions has grown exponentially in the past two years. Now, it’s nearly universal. This, in turn, carries substantial risk. Per the FTC, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/22/consumers-lost-5point8-billion-to-fraud-last-year-up-70percent-over-2020.html">consumers lost $5.8 billion to financial fraud in 2021.</a> The total was up more than 70% from the losses reported in 2020. This reality is what makes MemberPass an indispensable tool for credit union members.</p>
<p>The original release of MemberPass helped credit unions in several important ways. They learned it enabled them to:</p>
 
 Prevent fraud before it happens. 
 Complete member enrollment with minimal friction. 
 Deliver consistent authentication experiences across all channels and transactions  
 Eliminate passwords and challenge questions. 
 Avoid hackable central databases of personally identifiable information. 
 Enjoy lower expenses due to better fraud protection and less MSR time spent authenticating members. 
 
<p>The new next gen MemberPass adds these great benefits:</p>
 
 No core integration required 
 Deploy in your CU in as few as three days. 
 No additional app for members to download. 
 Industry-leading security technology (W3C and FIDO2 compliant) 
 The ability to determine identity, behavior patterns, locations, devices, and channel patterns in real time. 
 Operates independently from your mobile banking platform. 
 Stops online payment fraud in real time for P2P and card transactions 
 
<p>“We are committed to protecting our members accounts by offering best of breed technologies. Next gen MemberPass allows our members to authenticate themselves across any channel through a seamless safe, secure, and private experience in less than 10 seconds” – Tim Ferrio, Team One Credit Union.</p>
<p>
By offering best in breed authentication technologies such as biometrics, enhanced cryptography, and AI, the next generation of MemberPass can provide our members a superior user experience by securely and privately authenticating their identity for e-commerce transactions, ITM’s, visiting a branch, contacting a call center, or logging in to online banking” – Zach Eychaner, 4Front Credit Union</p>
 
An Opportunity to Learn More 
<p>Bonifii will showcase the next generation of MemberPass during the <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/75b946ad-cc6b-4a08-872c-0694fa0d172a/summary?RefId=JHConnect%20Summary%20PG">Jack Henry Connect</a> conference from August 29 through September 1.

 By <a href="https://medium.com/u/61f092fa8507">Michal&nbsp;Bacia</a> <p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/global-threat-report/">According to security analysts, nearly 80% of cyberattacks are identity-based</a>. In these attacks, bad actors steal administrators’ usernames and passwords or issue fake credentials to themselves. With credentials in hand, unauthorized parties can infiltrate enterprise information technology systems and go undetected for long periods of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Many of these attacks can be prevented via security architectures that embrace decentralized authentication and authorization of users and assets. These architectures, based on decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs), can unlock value across many segments of the global economy. But the energy sector, in particular, stands to benefit greatly. The number of energy sector assets (e.g., electric vehicles, smart inverters, batteries) and actors interacting with them is growing exponentially. A centralized, “Web 2” approach to digitizing these assets and their users (creating a centralized data silo and a super administrator of the silo) is expensive, fragile, and creates lucrative honeypots for malicious actors to attack. At Energy Web, we believe a more effective solution is to embrace a decentralized architecture for user and asset authentication and authorization.</p> The role of verifiable credentials <p>A critical component of any security architecture is the process by which users’ credentials are verified in order to be assigned specific roles. As shown below, when a user with a <a href="https://www.bcdiploma.com/en/blog/blockchain-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credential</a> presents it to a verification service, the service validates the VC and issues an access token. As shown in figure 1, this token can be used to unlock access to smart contracts on a blockchain or to perform certain roles using legacy information technology infrastructure.</p>Figure 1 | Security architecture process to verify credentials to specific&nbsp;roles<p>Conducting this verification process is not computationally intensive and has a binary outcome: whether the VC is valid (cryptographically signed by the authorized issuer) or not. There are several ways to conduct the verification process. It can be performed internally by an organization or via a third-party service provider. These traditional, centralized options create a single point of vulnerability since the verification service itself can be compromised, approve false VCs, and (inadvertently or not) whitelist attackers.</p> A decentralized verification service is a far better&nbsp;solution <p>As shown in figure 2, a decentralized verification service uses a diversity of nodes to perform the verification task independently and then reach a consensus about the outcome with other nodes on the same system. In this setting, validator nodes vote on whether or not a VC is valid. If consensus is reached, the user presenting the VC will be whitelisted or receive an access&nbsp;token.</p>Figure 2 |Decentralized verification service With a decentralized verification service, each node is required to stake economic value in order to verify VC presentations and earn&nbsp;rewards <p>Only honest nodes receive rewards. Misbehaving nodes that vote against consensus are penalized by having their stake reduced or removed entirely (for an overview of staking and “slashing” mechanisms on different blockchain-based networks, check out this explainer). The most practical way to implement this mechanism is to use public blockchains, paired with cryptocurrency, for staking and distributing awards to nodes performing the verification work. By doing so, the execution of the verification mechanism is completely automated, immediate, and impartial. This is a far better solution than relying on an opaque, centralized entity and/or process to perform the same verification service.</p><p>Under the decentralized architecture described here, honest nodes can sound an alarm if they don’t agree with the consensus. They receive the stake from misbehaving nodes in case they can prove wrongdoing. Attackers in this setting need to either a) hack each node individually or b) bribe all nodes needed to reach the consensus. The cost of bribing the nodes is equal to N*S+N*N*S, where N= number of nodes and S = stake of one node. Bottom line = more economic value staked across more nodes, more security.</p>Figure 3 | Decentralized verification service<p>Furthermore, consensus requirements can change based on the value of the VC itself. For high-value transactions or important access rights, consensus may require several rounds of voting. For VCs with relatively lower values, only 10% of nodes, for example, may need to approve the&nbsp;VC.</p><p>In summary, decentralized VC authentication powered by public blockchain and cryptocurrency shown in figure 3 can produce significant business benefits for enterprises in comparison to Web 2-based approaches to authentication and authorization. Don’t take our word for it: multiple Energy Web member companies have recently confirmed that public blockchains present a superior way to securing energy infrastructure and internet-connected devices alongside the findings of many research papers on the subject such&nbsp;as:</p>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8355182">Blockchain: A game changer for securing IoT&nbsp;data</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8605485">Secure IoT Communication using Blockchain Technology</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8012302">Can Blockchain Strengthen the Internet of&nbsp;Things?</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9013413">Cloud-Based Secure Service Providing for IoTs Using Blockchain</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7828539">Securing Smart Cities Using Blockchain Technology</a>   Cybersecurity through staking on Energy&nbsp;Web <p>Currently, Energy Web is working in partnership with Parity Technologies (the company behind Polkadot, Kusama, and Substrate) to design, build and launch the Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain, a public blockchain tailored to enterprises. The new blockchain is designed explicitly around the VC verification process described in this post. Our aim is to enable decentralized authentication and authorization for any energy company in any regulatory environment in a way that integrates with existing enterprise information technology systems.</p><p>Since identity management is a foundational component of this new blockchain, Validators on the new network who perform the decentralized VC verification service will be required to stake Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in order to secure the service and the network. In this way, all identity-related processes, together with other blockchain transactions, will be secured by the combined economic value of all <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dSLA-Lightpaper.pdf">EWT staked by Validators and their&nbsp;Patrons</a>.</p><p>With this staking mechanism in hand, the Consortia Relay Chain will unlock security solutions that are impossible to achieve using a centralized, Web 2 paradigm. It will provide unparalleled cybersecurity alongside a robust, flexible DID infrastructure for identity and access management.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers.</p><p>Our solutions for enterprise asset management, data exchange, and Green Proofs, our tool for registering and tracking low-carbon products, are underpinned by the Energy Web Chain, the world’s first public blockchain tailored to the energy sector.

 More system convening, community recognition and a dose of whimsy and weirdness <p>Thanks to <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>, we were able to take part at <a href="https://www.thebadgesummit.com/">Badge Summit 2022</a> in Boulder, Colorado earlier this month. The <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/feed">Keep Badges Weird community</a> was well represented! We had so much fun seeing KBW community members and having the opportunity to bond. There were great conversations, new ideas and connections and some table tennis tournaments.</p><p>In the lead up to Badge Summit, we had three goals for our participation.</p> 1) Make sure people in the Keep Badges Weird community felt respected and recognised <p>A healthy community is one in which people feel like they belong. Belonging comes from connection. Finding ways to help people connect and share is what community building is all&nbsp;about.</p><p>We wanted to do something special for people who have been working to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/keep-badges-weird-is-about-breaking-boundaries-42afb0415826">legitimise badges</a> and recognition for a long time. We have <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wtf-are-stealth-badges-41130a75a1a9">a stealth badge</a> (that isn’t so stealthy anymore) called “the O.G.”. It is a badge issued to people who have been involved in open badges since before January 2017. We invited people who earned the O.G. badge to a rooftop party on the Sunday evening before Badge Summit. Then in the most meta-badge fashion ever, we gifted these O.Gs a hat with a badge with a badge on a&nbsp;hat.</p>All the&nbsp;swag<p>We also gave out iron-on patches of the other stealth badges, Keep Badges Weird stickers and a “I kept badges weird at Badge Summit”&nbsp;badge.</p><p>A community shouldn’t only recognise members through badges and swag, though. At the party and throughout the few days we were together in Boulder, we spent time together! Swag doesn’t substitute the recognition we can give one another through our conversations and attention.</p><p>We’re so excited to hear what people in this community are working on and to find ways to collaborate. We were reminded at how important in real life events are when you’re trying to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">change the world</a>&nbsp;;)</p> 2) Help potential community members join and be able to interact with the community <p>A community needs to have low barriers to entry. It should also help people see themselves as part of something bigger. In KBW, we want to help members find meaningful contribution or reliable resources or whatever else they’re looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>We hosted two sessions designed to demystify some of what this community is working on. In the first, Wikis for Community Defined Skill Frameworks, we collaborated with KBW community members <a href="https://twitter.com/donpresant">Don</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/capt_info">Justin</a>. The session helped people understand the need for <a href="https://www.openskillsnetwork.org/rsd">Rich Skill Descriptors</a>. It got attendees writing RSDs through a collaborative exercise that helped participants connect.</p>Drawing of the session from KBW member <a href="https://twitter.com/CateTolnai">Cate&nbsp;Tolnai</a><p>Our second session, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/keep-badges-weird-helping-people-understand-the-badges-landscape-79cc8cf7281">Keep Badges Weird: helping people understand the badges landscape</a>, felt like a big success. Our idea to explain Badge Pathways with the help of a pizza metaphor went well. At Badge Summit there were lots of interesting questions and a discussion around <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>. We had lots of&nbsp;fun.</p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gxuBP7oZbphwgkYWX0VMEWoS3xg_DpHIrJiAUbhmLHI/edit#slide=id.g13cb12b5ea4_0_16">our very awesome title&nbsp;slide</a><p>At the end, participants were invited to join the community. Everyone went away with some beautiful KBW stickers. To make it extra easy for new people to get involved with the community, <a href="https://twitter.com/markjotter/">Mark</a> made the world’s most beautiful QR&nbsp;code.</p>The most beautiful QR&nbsp;code 3) Raise awareness of Open Recognition (i.e. non-credential use of&nbsp;badges) <p>Our third goal is the hardest to assess. Did we have an impact on people we interacted with and their understanding of Open Recognition? Did people at Badge Summit begin to understand that badging isn’t about supporting the old system of credentialing? That it should to be <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">a new system for a different world</a>? Time will&nbsp;tell.</p><p>We’re pleased to be members of a community that cares not only about “knowledge, skills and competencies”, but also things like talents, behaviours, aspirations, connections and more. <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-every-type-of-learning-ffd137a6fe17">Open Recognition is for every type of learning</a> and <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/feed">this Community of Practic</a>e knows all about it. We were happy that we weren’t alone at Badge Summit. KBW community members had recognition friendly narratives on stage and in their sessions. Surely, the people who attended Badge Summit 2022 went away with a few ideas on how to integrate recognition into their badging programmes.</p><p>In the coming months, we’re looking forward to reconnecting with people we met at the Badge Summit. We will continue to explore how we can support people in finding ways to integrate Open Recognition. Do you have ideas on what the Keep Badges Weird community could do to help you? <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/discussions">Start a conversation about&nbsp;it!</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/summing-up-badge-summit-fb9d974c647d">Summing up Badge Summit</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau<br><br>It has been three weeks since the Digital Trust Hui Taumata at Te Papa Tongarewa and yet it still resonates with many delegates, judging by feedback I continue to receive. It’s a clear indicator of a great event that Digital Identity NZ and NZTech worked hard to bring to the community, overcoming the significant challenges of the time.&nbsp;<br><br>Digital Identity NZ’s Executive Council (EC) remained in Wellington the next day for its annual strategy workshop. It developed a co-creation framework and questions to put to DINZ members – shown further down – regarding what activities our community want to undertake that returns overall value to our members, to DINZ and to Aotearoa’s digital economy in the next 12 months and beyond. &nbsp;<br><br>Let’s refresh our memory of the mahi undertaken in the past 12 months – still some&nbsp;‘work-in-progress’ – but nonetheless impressive for a group comprising of volunteers and minimal staff:</p>



  Creating the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework working group to review the draft Bill and prepare submissions and&nbsp;reports, which have been received positively;  Creating the Te Kahui te Tiriti o DINZ working group to develop and recommend an action plan for DINZ. The plan will help us to deliver on our Te Tiriti obligations SOI and support &amp; promote Māori representation and participation in Digital Identity, though still formative, looks promising;  Creating the Inclusive &amp; Equitable Uses of Digital Identity working group to develop guidance for industry and the Government to help give&nbsp;all&nbsp;New Zealanders equal access to the potential benefits of digital identity – again formative but active engagement underway with civil society organisations;  Completing benchmark consumer and business research in a challenging Covid environment. The results to be made public in a few weeks;  Delivering three&nbsp;in-person member Connect events, again, in a challenging Covid environment;  Delivering the much praised all-day Digital Trust Hui Taumata both in-person and online together with 23 online-only events to the community worldwide&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>  



<p>The 2022 EC reviewed last year’s annual member survey feedback and took the opportunity to review DINZ’s purpose,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">vision and mission</a>&nbsp;to ensure it remains incredibly relevant to the opportunities in Aotearoa’s digital economy.&nbsp;<br><br>The 2022 EC then proceeded to draft a ‘Pillars and Roles’ framework whose purpose is to give better definition and structure to the mahi and associated activities that this communication calls upon members to contribute to; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Four Pillars under which the mahi and associated activities can be categorised – Ecosystem Enablement, Sustainability, Privacy and Trust, Inclusion &amp; Diversity – to be positioned under;  Five Roles that DINZ would play (one or more) applicable to any given mahi and activity – Connect, Communicate, Guide, Develop, Promote;  



<p>DINZ’s Executive Council of 2022 seeks your feedback* on its proposal by August 31st 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YJ225RX">using this&nbsp;Survey Monkey link here</a>.<br><br>The EC’s proposals will be tested against your compiled member feedback and modified where necessary for confirmation through the annual member survey later in the year.<br><br>*Feedback is primarily sought from individual and organisation members of DINZ but feedback from non members is also welcomed.<br></p>



<p>Ngā mihi nui,</p>



<p>Colin and the DINZ Executive Council</p>

<p>As part of the Human Colossus Foundation's rollout of <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/dde-launch">Dynamic Data Economy</a> (DDE) in July, the HCF founders delivered <a href="https://hasgeek.com/PrivacyMode/data-gov-and-sem/">Data Governance and Semantics</a>, a three-part series of talks to the Indian tech community as part of <a href="https://hasgeek.com/">Hasgeek's</a> <a href="https://hasgeek.com/PrivacyMode">Privacy Mode initiative</a>, a forum of discussion for understanding the privacy and security needs of the Indian tech ecosystem through guides, research, collaboration, events, and conferences.</p><p>This Hasgeek initiative aims to help its audience become acquainted with the most efficient approaches and practices to data management, reducing operational risk to businesses. As a forum for experts across multiple sectors, blending in tools, frameworks, principles and design sensibilities, the project encourages organisational teams to address blind spots and treat data governance as a shared responsibility instead of a siloed approach to policy-making, processes and requirements.</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  




<p>The "Data Governance and Semantics" project featured three webinars introducing DDE as a decentralised trust infrastructure acutely aligned with the current movement toward data exchange models in the Economic domain where actors regain transactional sovereignty to share accurate information bilaterally.</p><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en">European Data Strategy</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/data-strategy/data-strategy.html">Canadian Data Strategy</a>, and new <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/fr/home/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id.html">Swiss e-ID</a> initiatives demonstrate governmental support for a new paradigm shift in national data management schemes. Moreover, this particular Hasgeek project aligns with the revision of India's current <a href="https://digitalindia.gov.in/writereaddata/files/6.Data%20Protection%20in%20India.pdf">data protection regulation</a>.</p><p>The DDE conceptual infrastructure gives an equal weight of importance to the three core data domains of decentralised semantics, decentralised authentication, and distributed data governance. The HCF founders presented the core DDE concepts in three webinar sessions which interested parties can access via the Hasgeek platform or the Human Colossus Foundation video platform.&nbsp;</p><p>By incorporating first-principle design methodology into the foundational modelling of the core data domains, a network-agnostic system is possible, offering the cryptographic assurance of verifiable digital interactions and the human accountability of socio-economic governance frameworks.</p>


 

 Part 1: Decentralised semantics <p>Presented by: Paul Knowles, Head of the Advisory Council</p><p>Date: Tuesday, July 5th, 2022&nbsp;</p><p>This talk focused on decentralised semantics and how the segregation of task-oriented objects within a standard layered architecture can provide a long-term solution for unifying a data language within distributed data ecosystems. From that lens, decentralised semantics is ontology-agnostic, offering a harmonisation solution between data models and data representation formats while providing a roadmap to resolve privacy-compliant data sharing between servers, networks, and across sectoral or jurisdictional boundaries.&nbsp;</p> What is “Decentralised semantics”? <p>Data semantics is the study of the meaning and use of data in any digital environment. In data semantics, the focus is on how a data object represents a concept or object in the real world.</p><p><br>Decentralised semantics describes a data modelling methodology of layering and cryptographically binding task-specific objects (overlays) to a standard capture base, which, when combined, defines a complex digital object. The segregation of task-specific overlays enables dynamic semantic interoperability in the construction process of any digital object without compromising the objectual integrity of the semantic structure, its modular components, or the relationship between those objects.</p><p>Decentralised semantics provides a powerful solution for semantic interoperability, data harmonisation, internationalisation, and dynamic presentation.</p>

 Part 2: Decentralised authentication <p>Presented by: Robert Mitwicki, Head of the Technology Council</p><p>Date: Tuesday, July 12th, 2022&nbsp;</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  




<p>The second talk focused on decentralised authentication and how a decentralised key management infrastructure, providing self-certifying identifier (SCID) issuance underpinned by one-way cryptographic functions, can offer information uniqueness from captured entropy. Furthermore, a decentralised authentication system must be ledger-agnostic, with its identifiers interoperable across ecosystems, platforms, and networks.</p> What is “Decentralised authentication”? <p>Data provenance refers to the tracing and recording of the origin of data and its movement between locations. If digital data is tamper-proof (i.e. provable to have not been corrupted after its creation), it can be assumed to be authentic. Data authentication focuses on timestamping data inputs at index time, determining each event as factual.</p><p>Decentralised authentication describes a key management methodology of cryptographically binding SCIDs to an associated log that compiles the history of all uses or changes to the public/private key pair, ensuring verifiable identifier provenance throughout any ambient infrastructure. Immutable ordering guarantees the factual authenticity of the recorded event underpinning any systematic data input. Furthermore, all system identifiers must remain network-agnostic, enabling identifier interoperability within and across any distributed data ecosystem.</p><p>Decentralised authentication provides a powerful solution for identifier interoperability, data provenance, data-intensive event streaming, and event sourcing applications.</p>

<p>Presented by: Dr Philippe Page, Head of the Knowledge Council</p><p>Date: Tuesday, July 19th</p><p>The final talk focused on distributed governance and how a multi-stakeholder Data Governance Administration (DGA) provides the legal provision to assume responsibility for the consensual veracity of data transactions under its administrative control on behalf of the citizens and legal entities it serves. The role of a DGA aligns closely with that of a “data intermediary” as described in the European Parliament’s recently proposed <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0767">Data Governance Act</a>, serving as a mediator between those who wish to make their data available and those who seek to leverage that data.</p> What is “Distributed data governance”? <p>Data governance is a system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models, which describe who can take what actions with what information and when, under what circumstances, and using what methods.</p><p>Distributed data governance describes an operational framework for the provision of rules, common standards and practices, infrastructures and a distributed governance framework to empower individuals through increased digital access to (and control of) their electronic personal data, nationally and across borders, fostering a genuine single market for electronic record systems, relevant components and high-risk artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Multi-stakeholder participation within DGAs guarantees the consensual veracity of purpose-driven ecosystem policy while providing a consistent, trustworthy and efficient set-up for personal data use for research, innovation, and regulatory activities.</p><p>Distributed data governance provides a powerful solution for multi-stakeholder collaboration of rules and regulations for safe and secure data sharing within and across distributed data ecosystems.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: Digital assets are only as safe as their private keys. Securing private keys through responsible key management has thus been a major focus at Blockchain Commons, under our <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a> initiative. Unfortunately, securing keys ultimately isn’t just a logistical problem or a technical problem. It’s also a legal problem because US courts have inserted themselves into the process by demanding keys, often as a part of discovery.</p>

  <p>Turning over keys to courts not only introduces major threats to the digital assets controlled by the keys, but it also fundamentally misunderstands the purpose and use of private keys. There are better tools for court-based discovery, public keys prime among them. There are better, more traditional ways to enforce the turn over of assets. Requiring the disclosure of private keys instead is a needless threat not just to digital assets, but to our rights as well.</p>
</blockquote>

 

<p>Increasingly, attorneys in the United States are asking courts to force the disclosure of private keys as part of discovery or other pre-trial motions, and increasingly courts are acceding to those demands. Though this is a relatively recent phenomenon, it’s part of a larger problem of law enforcement seeking back doors to cryptography that goes back at least to the U.S. government’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/clipper-chips-birthday-looking-back-22-years-key-escrow-failures">failed introduction of the Clipper Chip</a> in 1993.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, today’s attacks on private keys in the courtroom have been more successful, creating an existential threat to digital assets, data, and other information protected by digital keys. That danger arises from a fundamental disconnect between this practice and the realities of technologies that leverage public-key cryptography for security: private-key disclosure can cause irreparable harm, including the loss of funds and the distortion of digital identities.</p>

<p>As a result, we need to support legislation that will protect digital keys while allowing courts to access information and assets in a way that better recognizes those realities. The private-key disclosure law <a href="https://youtu.be/61c3sYGqO-E?t=1063">currently being considered in Wyoming</a> is an excellent example of the sort of legislation that we could put forth and advocate for in order to maintain the proper protection for our digital assets and identities.</p>

<p><a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0105">Wyoming Senate Filing 2021-0105</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    No person shall be compelled to produce a private key or make a private key known to any other person in any civil, administrative, legislative or other proceeding in this state that relates to a digital asset, other interest or right to which the private key provides access unless a public key is unavailable or unable to disclose the requisite information with respect to the digital asset, other interest or right. This paragraph shall not be interpreted to prohibit any lawful proceeding that compels a person to produce or disclose a digital asset, other interest or right to which a private key provides access, or to disclose information about the digital asset, other interest or right, provided that the proceeding does not require production or disclosure of the private key.
</blockquote>

 The Realities of Private Keys 

<p>The forced disclosure of private keys is deeply harmful because it fundamentally runs at odds with how private keys work. Attorneys (and courts) are usually trying to force the disclosure of information or (later) the relinquishment of assets, but they’re treating private keys just like they’re physical keys that they could demand, use, and give back.</p>

<p>Private keys do not match any of these realities. As Wyoming State Legislature Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislators///1971">Chris Rothfuss</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“There is no perfect analog for a modern cryptographic private key in existing statute or case law; it is unique in its form and function. As we build a policy framework around digital assets, it is essential that we appropriately recognize and reflect the characteristics of the underlying public / private key and cryptographic technologies. Without clear, unambiguous legal protection for the sanctity of the private key, it is impossible to ensure the integrity of the associated digital assets, information, smart contracts and identities.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That appropriation recognition and reflection requires us to understand that:</p>

<p>1. Private keys are not assets.</p>

<p>Private keys are fundamentally the way we exert authority in the digital space, an interface between our physical reality and the digital reality. They may give us the ability to control a digital asset: to store it, to send it, or to use it. Similarly, they may give us the ability to decrypt protected data or to verify a digital identity. However, they are not the assets, the data, nor the identity themselves.</p>

<p>It’s the obvious difference between your car and your electronic key fob. The one is an asset, while the other lets you control that asset.</p>

<p>As Jon Callas, Director of Technology Projects at the EFF, says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  “They don’t even want the key, they want the data; asking for the key is like asking for the filing cabinet rather than the file.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. Private keys are not the proper tool for discovery.</p>

<p>Treating private keys as a tool to ensure the discovery of information fundamentally misunderstands their purpose. Private keys are not how we see something in digital space, but instead how we exert authority in digital space!</p>

<p>Turning back to comparisons, it’s the difference between a ledger and a pen. If you wanted accounting information, you’d ask for the ledger; you wouldn’t ask for the pen, especially not if it was a pen that allowed you to write undetectably in the handwriting of the accountant!</p>

<p>Former Federal Prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan, when offering <a href="https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/wyoming-select-committee/private-key-disclosure-buchanan/">testimony</a> in favor of Wyoming’s private-key disclosure law, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>  “the court could order a disclosure or an accounting of all the digital assets that are held, and then those assets could be disclosed and the location of whether they are held across different platforms or even different wallets. But giving the key is actually giving access to those assets. That is the difference.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, there is an electronic tool that meets the needs of discovery: public keys. Wyoming has recognized that in their <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061423LSO-0058v0.2.pdf">legislation</a>, saying that a private key should never be required if a public key would do the job (and they parenthetically noting at hearings that their current understanding is that a public key will always do the job). If our concern is revealing information that will help to catch and prosecute criminals, then public keys are the answer.</p>

<p>3. Private keys are not physical.</p>

<p>Electronic private keys and physical keys are very different. A physical key could pass through many hands and there could be the expectation that it was very likely not duplicated (especially if it were a special key, such as a safety-deposit-box key), and that when the key was returned to the original holder, they would once again have control of all of the linked assets. The same is not true for a private key, which could be easily duplicated by any of the many hands it passed through, with no way to ascertain that had happened.</p>

<p>Returning to the example of a car’s key fob, it would not be appropriate to force the disclosure of the unique serial number stored within a car fob for the same reason it’s not appropriate to force the disclosure of a private key. Doing so, would give anyone who gets that serial number the ability to create a new fob and steal your car!</p>

<p>4. Private keys serve many purposes.</p>

<p>Finally, private keys are likely to have a lot more purposes than physical keys, especially if a court decides to go after not just a specific private key, but the root key from an HD wallet or a seed phrase. Root keys (and seeds) might be used to protect a wide variety of assets as well as private data. They may also be used to control identities and to offer irrefutable proof that the owner agreed to something through digital signatures.</p>

<p>The authoritative uses of private keys are so wide and all-encompassing that it’s hard to come up with a physical equivalent. The closest analogy, which was brought up by Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen at one of the Wyoming hearings, would be if a court demanded access to a hotel room by requiring the hotel’s master key, which can provide access to all rooms. But, a private key is more than that, so it would be as if the court also required that someone with signatory powers at the hotel sign a bunch of blank contracts and blank checks. The potential for harm with the disclosure of a private key is just that high for someone who is using it for a variety of purposes — and there will be more and more people doing so as the importance of the digital world continues to increase.</p>

 The Realities of Courts 

<p>Going beyond the fact that a private key is the wrong tool for courts and that it’s often being used in the wrong way, there are a number of other problematic realities related to the courts themselves and how and when they’re trying to access private keys.</p>

<p>5. Courts are not prepared to protect private keys.</p>

<p>To start with, courts don’t have the experience needed to protect private keys. This danger is made worse by the fact that a single private key is likely to pass through the hands of many different court staff over time.</p>

<p>But, this isn’t just about courts. The problem of creating safe ways to transfer public keys is far bigger. It’s something that the cryptographic field as a whole does not have good answers for. Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen attested in his  testimony in Wyoming that the “immense difficulties of transferring a private key are a risk that allows bearing of false witness.” Putting courts, without crypto-expertise, in the middle of the problem could be catastrophic.</p>

<p>Perhaps cryptographers will resolve these issues in time, and perhaps someday courts will be able to share in that expertise if they decide doing so is a good use of their time and resources, but we need to consider keys whose disclosures are being forced now.</p>

<p>6. Courts are requiring premature disclosure.</p>

<p>The current situation with key disclosure is even more problematic because it’s occurring as part of discovery or other pre-trial motions. Discovery rulings are <a href="https://www.resolvingdiscoverydisputes.com/appeals/obtaining-review-of-discovery-rulings/">almost impossible to appeal</a>, which means that in today’s environment key holders have almost no recourse for protecting the token of their own authority in digital space.</p>

<p>7. Courts are more demanding of digital assets than physical assets.</p>

<p>We recognize that courts should be able to require the usage of a key. Compelling usage is nothing new, but the private key is not required for that, simply a court order.</p>

<p>If someone refuses to use their private key in a way compelled by a court, that’s nothing new either. The physical world already has plenty of examples of people refusing such orders, such as by hiding assets or just refusing to pay judgements. They are handled with sanctions such as contempt of court.</p>

<p>Asking for more from the electronic world is an overreach of traditional judgements that also creates much greater repercussions.</p>

 The Repercussions of Disclosure 

<p>Using the wrong tool for the wrong reasons and putting it in hands not ready to deal with it will have calamitous results. Here are some of the most obvious repercussions.</p>

<p>1. Asset Theft</p>

<p>Obviously, there is a danger of the assets being stolen, as a private key gives total control over those assets. These assets could go far beyond the specifics of what a court is interested in, because of the multitude of uses for keys.</p>

<p>2. Asset Loss</p>

<p>Beyond the problem of purposeful theft, keys could be lost, and with them digital assets. Former federal prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan raised this concern in her <a href="https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/wyoming-select-committee/private-key-disclosure-buchanan/">testimony</a>, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Evidence is lost all the time.” If that evidence was a private key, which might hold a variety of assets, information, and proofs of identity, the loss could be tremendous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wyoming State Legislature Majority Whip <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislators///2035">Jared Olsen</a> agreed with this concern at a recent Wyoming hearing, noting that a judicial assistant could delete a key and cause a loss of $8 billion dollars in Bitcoin when there was only a judgment for $100,000. He said he was “concerned about just simply handling it”.</p>

<p>3. Collateral Damage</p>

<p>Thefts or losses resulting from the disclosure of a private key could also go far beyond an individual before the court. Increasingly, assets are being held in multisignatures, which may grant multiple people control over the same assets. By requiring the disclosure of a key, a court could negatively impact people entirely unrelated to the proceedings.</p>

<p>4. Identity Theft.</p>

<p>Because private keys might also protect the identifier for digital identity, their loss, theft, or misuse could put someone’s entire digital life at risk. If a key was copied, someone else could pretend to be the holder and even make digital signatures that are legally binding for them.</p>

 Support This Legislation 

<p>Protecting private keys is one of the most important things that Blockchain Commons has ever worked on. As Blockchain Commons’ founder Christopher Allen said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I find the protections of this Private Key Disclosure bill crucial for the future of digital rights.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wyoming State Legislature Senate Minority Leader Chris Rothfuss affirmed this, adding:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>” Christopher Allen has been an invaluable member of our blockchain policy community, bringing a lifetime of technical expertise to advise our committee work and inform our legislative drafting. Mr. Allen has emphasized the particular importance of protecting private keys from any form of compulsory disclosure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need your help to make it a reality.</p>

<p>If you’re an experienced member of the cryptocurrency or digital asset field or a human-rights activist, please submit your own testimony in support to the <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Committees/2022/S19">Wyoming Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology</a>. The bill will be coming up for further discussion on September 19-20 in Laramie, Wyoming.</p>

<p>But, Wyoming is just the start. They are doing an excellent job of leading the way, but we need other states and countries to follow. If you have connections to another legislature, please suggest they introduce <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061423LSO-0058v0.2.pdf">similar language to Wyoming’s bill</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t feel comfortable talking with a legislature, you can help by advocating for the protection of private keys as something different than assets.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our new world of digital assets and digital information will succeed or fail based upon how we lay its foundations today. It could become a safe space for us or a dangerous wild west.</p>

<p>Properly protecting private keys (and using public keys and other tools for legitimate judicial needs) is a keystone that will help us to build a sturdy edifice.</p>

<p>Frankfurt, 16th of August 2022</p>

<p>IDunion, the consortium created as part of the “Secure Digital Identities Showcase” funding project, has reached the next stage in building a productive, cross-border ecosystem by founding a European cooperative with limited liability (Sociedad Cooperativa Europea, or SCE for short). </p>

<p>Founding meeting of the IDunion SCE on 20.07.2022 (from left to right: Mirko Mollik/TrustCerts GmbH, Markus Sabadello/ Danube Tech GmbH, Dr. Carsten Stöcker/ Spherity GmbH)</p>

  With the spin-off into the SCE, the infrastructure for verifiable credentials, which was researched and developed in the research project can now go live into production.   The European cooperative will be deploying and operating the necessary technical network to provide the operations.  This will allow citizens, private-sector organisations and government institutions to augment the digital identifications (eID) provided by governments with use of secure digital credentials for  identity attributes required across a wide range of use cases.   The legal form of the SCE was chosen as it offers a legally secure basis for the operations of an independent infrastructure for digital credentials.  While the IDunion research project was initiated with funding from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Action (BMWK), the European cooperative aims to secure private sector funding to provide a stable, non-profit business operation.   The decision to use the legal form of a Sociedad Cooperativa Europea was driven by IDunion’s core principles of neutrality and openness. It allows all legal entities that adhere to the community values to apply for membership to the SCE. Furthermore a future takeover or control by a single entity is prohibited by this legal form. The guiding principle of the cooperative is the joint establishment of the ecosystem – a task that no individual member can achieve on its own.  
<p>On 20.07.2022, the founding members Spherity, Danube Tech and TrustCerts signed the articles of association of the SCE in Essen. “We are very pleased to have achieved this milestone for the IDunion project,” says Helge Michael, consortium Leader of the IDunion research project. “With the IDunion SCE, we have created the ideal basis for building a future-proof identity ecosystem for Europe in which all members can work together as equals. Special thanks goes to the BMWK for providing the funding support as part of the research project ‘Showcase Secure Digital Identities’, which was an essential prerequisite to this next stage,” Michael continues. Dr. Carsten Stöcker, Managing Director of Spherity GmbH, adds: “IDunion SCE provides the legal basis for a cooperative governance structure, which strengthens the interests of individual participants in the interplay of decentralisation and cooperation without allowing a central platform operator to exploit its users economically.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>IDunion: The IDunion research project is a European network that brings together public institutions, government agencies, private organisations, associations, educational institutions and other stakeholders from various fields. Its aim is to develop a fundamentally new, secure digital infrastructure for the verification of identity information.</p>

<p>IDunion SCE: IDunion SCE is a cooperative (European Cooperative Europea) with limited liability that will operate the production network for credential verification, based on the findings of the research project. The SCE and the network are subject to the community governance of its members. Initial founding members of the SCE are:</p>

<p>TrustCerts GmbH: The cyber security start-up TrustCerts from Gelsenkirchen focuses on verifiable credentials and digital identities. TrustCerts’ solution is based on a specially developed blockchain that is compliant with German data protection and security requirements.</p>

<p>Danube Tech GmbH: One of the first companies supporting the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) concept, the Vienna-based Danube Tech specialises in interoperability between different SSI networks across national borders. Among the products developed by Danube Tech are the Universal Resolver and godiddy.com.</p>

<p>Spherity GmbH: The German software provider Spherity provides secure and decentralised identity management solutions for companies, machines, products, data and algorithms. Spherity provides the enabling technology to digitise and automate compliance processes in highly regulated sectors. Spherity’s products strengthen cybersecurity and create efficiency and data interoperability between digital value chains.</p>

<p>Public key cryptographic token API ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that PKCS #11 Specification Version 3.1 from the OASIS PKCS 11 TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>The Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) are a group of public-key cryptography standards devised and published by RSA Security LLC, starting in the early 1990s. The OASIS PKCS 11 Technical Committee addresses the ongoing enhancement and maintenance of the PKCS #11 standard.</p>



<p>PKCS #11 Specification Version 3.1 defines a platform-independent API to cryptographic tokens, such as hardware security modules and smart cards. The API itself is named “Cryptoki” (from “cryptographic token interface” and pronounced as “crypto-key”). This specification defines data types, functions and other basic components of the PKCS #11 Cryptoki interface for devices that may hold cryptographic information and may perform cryptographic functions. It also defines mechanisms that are anticipated for use with the current version of PKCS #11.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>Passwords may be a thing of the past as tech giants are moving to new passkey technology — a passwordless login that is more secure and convenient. Passkeys were created with the Web Authentication API security standard that uses public key cryptography for access. Each key is unique and created with encrypted data for added security. Apple, Google and Microsoft are working with the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure passkeys are implemented in ways that work across multiple platforms.</p>

<p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare says the same attackers that went after Twilio also sent Cloudflare employees malicious SMS messages with links to phishing sites dressed up as an official company website. Despite employees at both companies taking the bait, Cloudflare said attackers were unable to snatch the full logon credentials of its workers because the company’s second layer of authentication isn’t time-limited one-time codes. Instead, every employee at the company is issued a FIDO2-compliant security key from a vendor like YubiKey. Although the attackers siphoned the credentials, the hard key authentication requirement stopped them from snatching a soft token that fooled employees otherwise would have entered into the phishing site.</p>

<p>What has your career journey looked like?<br>I have been in payments and technology industry for over 20 years. My career has ran the gamut from developing innovative products and solutions, engaging with customers through executive account management to being highly engaged in standards and trade organizations around the globe. The last few years I’ve had a keen interest in focusing on developing inclusive, fit for purpose, privacy preserving and user centric digital identity. Social impact solutions to bridge the digital divide is a part of that as well.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?<br>My dream job was to practice law, as I wanted to play a role in assisting underserved communities in navigating legal matters. I grew up in a very rural area where I witnessed certain segments of the population not being able to obtain legal representation on a variety of things simply because they could not afford to do so.</p>



<p><br></p>



<blockquote><p>❝I truly believe that women being engaged in the digital ID space is critically important because solutions need to be inclusive for everyone.❝</p></blockquote>



<p><br><br>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?<br>When I started in the tech industry, there were not many women with a “seat” at the table. Even those women that were involved were typically not given the same voice as male counterparts and had to work extra hard to prove their value in any conversations and in creating products, services and solutions. Quite literally, it always felt like a “boys club” and I never felt comfortable speaking up in the beginning of my career for fear that my voice would not be heard. Often I would carefully tailor questions and responses as not to seem to be a dissenting or diverse voice. As my career grew, I began to embrace my authentic self and the unique viewpoints that I have and started speaking up and realizing my own influence. Today, I encourage women to embrace their authentic self and voice. Also, helping elevate and empower others to their full potential is a key focus area that brings me great satisfaction, as I embrace the concepts of servant leadership to those around me.<br><br>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?<br>I really think of this as just “life balance”. My work self is as much a part of me as everything else. So first and foremost, I have learned that I need to take care of myself. If I am feeling burnout in my work responsibilities, that easily spills over into my personal life (and vice versa). Therefore, I have to stay focused on making sure I am doing things that I enjoy, spending time with family and friends (even if only virtually), exercising, etc. If I am not taking care of myself, I cannot be 100% present in anything. Also, I have learned that I have to unplug. I know personally, in the past, I have felt the need to be the best at everything. But it is an impossible goal. I’ve learned that it is absolutely ok to not overachieve at everything in my life. Some things, I will. Some things, I won’t. That’s perfectly fine</p>



<p></p>

<blockquote><p>❝When I started in the tech industry, there were not many women with a “seat” at the table.

I began to embrace my authentic self and the unique viewpoints that I have and started speaking up and realizing my own influence. ❞</p>Marie Jordan</blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?<br>I truly believe that women being engaged in the digital ID space is critically important because solutions need to be inclusive for everyone. As someone extremely passionate about uplifting economies, women are an integral part of that and if more women became aware of the important role that they play in all parts of ensuring identity is fit for purpose and inclusive, I feel strongly they would understand the need for more diverse thoughts and opinions in this space. Educating women on the importance of identity becoming digital and the need for women’s unique perspectives will go a long way towards achieving that goal. Also, encouraging men as well to be supporters of bringing women into the space is equally as important.</p>



<p></p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?<br>Be a team player, who collaborates with everyone, but also understand your value add to the culture of an organization. A lot of times I believe women try and fit in whereas they should recognize that they can be extremely successful by being themselves. I have personally had some of the greatest successes in my career by being genuine and authentic. This creates trust with those around you, which in turn can lead to great achievements. I’ve also learned the importance of networking and getting to know those around you. By having a supportive, diverse network, you will always have a sounding board and mutually beneficial relationships. A network isn’t transactional. It’s about building meaningful relationships.</p>



<p></p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?<br>I believe the biggest challenge will be women continuing to bridge the gender gaps that exist, particularly with women taking prominent roles at the executive levels within tech organizations. This starts with education that focuses on women in technology, which I still feel is not where it should be. It has slowly shifted over the years but there is still a lot more that can be done.<br><br>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?<br>Be bold. Take chances. Get involved. Understand your value. Do not let fear of failing hold you back. Network and uplift others. Be the one who always empowers others to succeed.</p>

<p>ToIP Steering Committee member, Scott Perry, Principal of Crypto and Digital Trust Services at Schellman, will be speaking at HGF on Monday, September 12th on the topic of Governance and Audit of Blockchain Networks.</p>



<p>While blockchain technology creates strong cryptographic controls securing the integrity of data, successful, cooperative blockchain networks must establish trust between a variety of independent entities to create overall trust.&nbsp; In this presentation, Scott Perry will discuss how trust is created when using blockchain technologies in the utility layer of the Trust Over IP stack.  Scott will discuss how blockchain networks can add accountability within stakeholder roles to ensure that blockchain-based trust ecosystems are trustworthy above the embedded cryptographic trust assertions.&nbsp; Come learn which role systems auditors, cybersecurity professionals, and risk management experts play in ensuring how trust is built within the ToIP stack focusing on how blockchain-based trust ecosystems are maintained when adopting such cutting-edge technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-located at the Conventions Center Dublin the same week is the Linux Foundation <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open Source Summit Europe</a> September 13th to 16th.&nbsp; ToIP will be having a co-located <a href="https://trustoverip.org/summit/">Trust Over IP Summit 2022</a>, during the OSS.&nbsp; So when you<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/register/"> register for OSS</a>, don’t forget to add on the free registration for ToIP Summit 2022.<br><br><a href="https://trustoverip.org/summit/#agenda">Agenda for the ToIP Summit 2022</a>:</p>

It envisions a new paradigm in digital interaction underpinned by a data-agile economy that aims to empower people, businesses and organisations to make better decisions based on insights from harmonised, accurate data. HCF’s mission is to facilitate the creation and subsequent development of such a data-agile economy, focusing on building open source core public utility technologies.</p><p>DDE "Dynamic Data Economy" refers to a data-agile economy composed of three foundational pillars - semantics, inputs and governance. The DDE is essentially a decentralised trust infrastructure aligned with the European data strategy where actors have the transactional sovereignty to share accurate information bilaterally. HCF facilitates DDE development by promoting standards that guarantee digital objects' structural and contextual integrity, the factual authenticity of events, and the consensual veracity of purpose-driven data agreements.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s blog post explores Accenture’s journey as they adopted passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>With cyber-attacks on the rise, phishing has become the primary method used by attackers to compromise user data.&nbsp;Now, even though multifactor authentication (MFA) defeats over 90% of&nbsp;password breaches, it isn’t immune to phishing. Microsoft’s vision for a passwordless world emphasizes FIDO 2.0-powered inherently phish-resistant credentials like Windows Hello for Business and FIDO 2.0 External Security Keys. Accenture’s implantation includes over 500,000 users primarily using Windows Hello For Business, 200,000 Phone Sign in users, over 10,000 FIDO2 key users, and an 80% drop in day-to-day usage of passwords across the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A new type of security technology being introduced by major vendors such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google in fall 2022 that aims to limit the need for passwords when signing into different applications. This technology, developed by the FIDO Alliance, uses tokenization rather than passwords during the login process and is meant to help prevent phishing and spoofing.</p>

<p>An effective Zero Trust environment requires an authentication system that can be relied upon to form a strong, solid foundation. With passwords and other shared credentials, the weakest links in any authentication system, Zero Trust MFA must fully eliminate these from the authentication process. The government has recognized this, with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency calling Fast Identity Online (FIDO) protocols the “gold standard” of MFA.</p>

<p>Stu Sjouwerman, founder, and CEO of KnowBe4 Inc shares his thoughts on how MFAs fell short in data security. A Verizon research report says that 82% of all cyberattacks fall on human error (stolen credentials, phishing, misuse). For a hacker to successfully gain access to credentials they need some level of human involvement to get around MFA defences. Some common phishing techniques include, MiTM attacks, SIM-swapping attacks, “Pass-the-cookie” attacks, and MFA fatigue. The strongest forms of MFAs are based on FIDO2 standards that enables users to access resources through biometrics. The deployment of FIDO2 eliminates the risk of phishing attacks but ensuring users are well trained to identify cyberthreats is just as important if not more.</p>

<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/2022-07-sms-phishing-attacks/">blog post</a>(opens in new tab), Cloudflare co-founder Matthew Prince, together with team members Daniel Stinson-Diess and Sourov Zaman, explained how the attack happened and what made the difference between success and failure.</p>



<p>The threat actor made a couple of key preparations ahead of the attack: they registered a domain that looked legitimate and would fool many victims: cloudflare-okta.com. Okta is Cloudflare’s identity provider. They also managed to somehow obtain the phone numbers of almost 80 Cloudflare employees, as well as family members for some.</p>

<p>Yesterday, August 8, 2022, Twilio shared that they’d been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/august-2022-social-engineering-attack">compromised by a targeted phishing attack</a>. Around the same time as Twilio was attacked, we saw an attack with very similar characteristics also targeting Cloudflare’s employees. While individual employees did fall for the phishing messages, we were able to thwart the attack through our own use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/">Cloudflare One products</a>, and physical security keys issued to every employee that are required to access all our applications.</p>



<p>We have confirmed that no Cloudflare systems were compromised. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudforce-one-threat-operations-and-threat-research/">Cloudforce One threat intelligence team</a>&nbsp;was able to perform additional analysis to further dissect the mechanism of the attack and gather critical evidence to assist in tracking down the attacker.</p>



<p>This was a sophisticated attack targeting employees and systems in such a way that we believe most organizations would be likely to be breached. Given that the attacker is targeting multiple organizations, we wanted to share here a rundown of exactly what we saw in order to help other companies recognize and mitigate this attack.</p>

 Consumer Financial Protection Circular 2022-04 



 Insufficient data protection or security for sensitive consumer information 



 Question presented 



<p>Can entities violate the prohibition on unfair acts or practices in the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) when they have insufficient data protection or information security?</p>



 Summary answer 



<p>Yes. In addition to other federal laws governing data security for financial institutions, including the Safeguards Rules issued under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), “covered persons” and “service providers” must comply with the prohibition on unfair acts or practices in the CFPA. Inadequate security for the sensitive consumer information collected, processed, maintained, or stored by the company can constitute an unfair practice in violation of 12 U.S.C. 5536(a)(1)(B). While these requirements often overlap, they are not coextensive.</p>



<p>Acts or practices are unfair when they cause or are likely to cause substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Inadequate authentication, password management, or software update policies or practices are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers, and financial institutions are unlikely to successfully justify weak data security practices based on countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Inadequate data security can be an unfair practice in the absence of a breach or intrusion.</p>

<p>This update provides a brief overview and technical analysis of the results of the “snapshot” mechanism currently being used to track the consistency of staked Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in the Consortia staking pool. Patrons staking EWT can use the tools provided at <a href="https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/">https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/</a> to check the status of their wallets and snapshots if applicable.</p> Snapshots and Variable EWT&nbsp;rewards <p>A series of Snapshots are being taken of wallets that have staked Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in the Energy Web Consortia staking pool. The purpose of the snapshots is to measure the consistency of staking. Specifically, snapshots track how much EWT is deposited into a staking contract by a given wallet and how long that stake is maintained throughout the life of the Consortia staking pool. Since staking will be a major contributor to the cybersecurity of Energy Web solutions tied to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">the upcoming Consortia blockchain</a>, having a consistent, high stake of EWT is crucial. Therefore, EWT staking pools reward consistent stakers with higher rewards compared to stakers who withdraw EWT before the staking pool&nbsp;ends.</p><p>In the case of the current Consortia staking pool, there will be an additional, variable reward distributed to all Patrons (individuals who have staked EWT into the pool) with at least 1 snapshot. This reward comes from redistributing all unallocated rewards from the Consortia staking smart contract. The staking contract was deployed with the maximum possible reward balance in order to provide rewards for Patrons staking a total of 7.5 million EWT for the entire 9 month duration of the staking&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Because the staking pool has yet to reach its capacity, not all fixed rewards will be distributed. This is where snapshots come in: the reward balance that is left unallocated will be distributed to Patrons who have snapshots. Rewards vary depending on the number of snapshots and the amount of EWT staked. For each wallet, the reward will be determined by an exponential formula taking into account the number of snapshots and average EWT stake. The exponential formula will incentivise Patrons to collect all snapshots, since a wallet with all snapshots will earn much higher rewards than wallets with 5 and less snapshots and the same EWT&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Similar to the timing of the snapshots, variable rewards are impossible to predict as they depend on the timing of snapshots and actions of other staking patrons. Therefore, the only rational behavior that maximizes variable APY is to stake as much EWT into a single wallet as possible and leave it staked consistently until the end of the Consortia staking pool. To be clear, the variable rewards will be distributed in addition to the fixed award already awarded by the Consortia staking&nbsp;pool.</p> Snapshot 1 Balance&nbsp;Analysis <p>In total, 6,408 wallets were included in the first snapshot. These wallets staked 5,540,589 EWT. The individual balances vary from 1 EWT (the lower limit for snapshots) to 3,000 EWT (the upper staking limit for a single wallet). The chart below shows the balances of all snapshot wallets: wallets on the horizontal axis, balances on the vertical&nbsp;axis.</p><p>The next chart shows the stake balance distribution with balance bounds on the horizontal axis and the number of wallets in each section on the vertical&nbsp;axis:</p><p>Almost 2/3rd of all wallets have balances under 500 EWT (out of which 334 are staking just 1 EWT), and 17% of wallets have balances higher than 2,500 EWT. This is surprising, as normally such distributions follow a power-law distribution (the higher the balance, the lower the number of wallets). In the case of Consortia staking, the relatively large number of wallets can be explained by Patrons holding many EWT (more than the upper limit of 3,000 EWT) staking with multiple wallets. Out of 1,110 wallets staking over 2,500 EWT, 970 are staking the maximum allowed 3,000&nbsp;EWT.</p> Snapshot 2 Balance&nbsp;Analysis <p>Snapshot 2 was taken on block #<a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/block/18648235/transactions">18648235</a> generated on June 27th, 2022 at 9:16 PM UTC+1. This time, there were 6,641 wallets staking (up 233 from the first snapshot), staking a total of 5,730,962 EWT, so (up 190,373 EWF from snapshot&nbsp;1).</p><p>Here are the balances of snapshot 2 (in orange) compared to snapshot 1 balances (in blue). Wallets on the bottom, balances on the vertical&nbsp;axis:</p><p>The orange spikes are wallets adding more EWT between snapshot 1 and 2. The orange dips are wallets withdrawing EWT. On the far right of the chart there is the orange line and no blue line: these are the completely new wallets that didn’t participate in snapshot&nbsp;1.</p><p>In total, 880 wallets increased their EWT stake and 350 of were completely new (not staked during snapshot 1). 180 wallets decreased their stake, 117 of them withdrawing all their EWT and not qualifying for snapshot&nbsp;2.</p><p>Here’s the balance distribution comparison between stake 1 and 2 balances. Bounds on the bottom, number of wallets in each category in the vertical&nbsp;scale:</p><p>We can see a slight increase in each category, even in the highest balances section: 41 new wallets staked between 2,500 and 3,000 ETW, out of which 40 staked the 3,000 EWT maximum. For comparison, there are now 150 additional wallets staking under 500&nbsp;EWT.</p> Snapshot insights and what to expect&nbsp;next <p>So far, staking in the Consortia pool has been consistent in line with the design of the snapshot mechanism. This is evidenced by the balance distribution of snapshot 1 and 2 and <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/address/0x181A8b2a5AEb25941F6A79b4aE43dBb1968c417A/coin-balances#address-tabs">EWT balances in the staking contract</a>:</p><p>Such consistent staking will provide a high degree of economic cybersecurity to all enterprise-grade Energy Web solutions (for more information on the connection between consistent staking, cybersecurity, and Energy Web solutions, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">please review our announcement on the upcoming Consortia chain</a>).</p><p>As mentioned above, the next 4 snapshots will be taken randomly between now and the end of the Consortia staking pool in December 2022. Patrons who receive at least 1 snapshot will qualify for additional rewards. The rewards will be calculated and distributed after the Consortia staking pool ends. Again, since variable rewards are impossible to predict, the best strategy for all patrons is to stake as high a balance as possible and do so consistently.</p><p>Also read: <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-community-staking-pool-snapshots-explained-3a9c3eebf28b">https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-community-staking-pool-snapshots-explained-3a9c3eebf28b</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>By Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>July 2022 was a busy month for FIDO members in APAC, particularly with the events that took place in Korea and Vietnam:</p>



<p>FIDO Tech Seminar in Korea</p>



<p>On July 13th, the FIDO Korea Working Group held a half-day virtual tech seminar with 250+ attendees.&nbsp; The sessions included updates on the state of the FIDO Alliance and its certification programs, an introduction to FIDO Device Onboard (FDO), a FIDO Authentication 101, an introduction to multi-device FIDO credentials (also known as “passkeys”), and a presentation on understanding Korean&nbsp; laws mandating the use of passwords.</p>



[Pic 1: Snapshot of FIDO Tech Seminar Platform][Pic 2: Samples of Virtual Sessions]



<p>This tech seminar covered topics such as FDO and passkey, and provided a forum for industry experts to learn about phishing-resistant online authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the post-event survey, over 30% of attendees reported they were victims of credential thefts, though they are online security industry experts or studying in the related fields.&nbsp; Mr. Hyeong Won Pyo at Chosun Media thoughtfully summarized what he learned from the seminar while sharing with his colleagues and friends: “Our journalists are under attack by online phishing campaigns, and it was great to learn how to protect them with FIDO Authentication.”</p>



<p>Those who missed the live streaming sessions can watch the recordings <a href="https://youtu.be/eXeAB8gCBiw">here</a>.</p>



<p>Vietnam Goes Passwordless Roundtable</p>



<p>On the same afternoon, FIDO Alliance participated in another hybrid event, the Vietnam Goes Passwordless Roundtable, organized by VinCSS and Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communication.</p>



<p>It was the first forum on passwordless authentication in Vietnam, and the cyber security industry leaders in the region gathered representatives from the state banks, and local journalists.</p>



[Pic 3: FIDO Update by Andrew Shikiar][Pic 4: Panel Discussion Session]



<p>During the event local cyber security leaders discussed and shared best practices on digital authentication, disruptive technologies, and mega trends of passwordless authentication.&nbsp; The experts recognized the recent increase of cyber-attacks in Vietnam as a risk factor for further developing digital applications, which is one of the top strategic activities of Vietnamese National Digital Transformation Program.</p>



<p>Mr. Do Ngoc Duy Tranc, CEO of VinCSS said, “VinCSS is ready to sponsor and support the nation by integrating strong FIDO-based passwordless authentication technology by building broader cooperation mechanisms with multi-sectors.”</p>

<p>This blog post outlines the revised version of <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges.pdf">the initial RFC</a> detailing the TRAC bridging approach from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain based on the feedback received on the initial version from the OriginTrail community.</p> Teleporting TRAC to the OriginTrail Parachain on&nbsp;Polkadot <p>The <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges.pdf">previous version of this RFC</a> proposed the initial TRAC bridge for near-term utilisation be implemented via the Chainbridge system, while enabling emergent bridging infrastructure (such as the Snowfork bridge) as potential long term bridging solutions.<br>Due to the concerns expressed by the TRAC community regarding the inherent risks associated with such a bridge implementation (details below and in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/issues/16">RFC comments</a>), and demonstrated vulnerabilities of similar bridges seen recently within the crypto space (even while writing this update of the RFC), an alternative approach will be implemented — “one way teleports”.</p><p>A one way teleport is an already proven approach within the OriginTrail community as it was successfully executed during the Starfleet stage of the OriginTrail Parachain development. Via a “one-time” TRAC bridge from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain the OriginTrail community has successfully staked 100MM TRAC tokens to be transferred to the (then stand-alone) OriginTrail tailored blockchain.</p><p>The exact approach and details of the smart contract implementation are specified in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC%2010%20Starfleet%20boarding%20(staking)%20smart%20contract%20specs.pdf">OT-RFC-10</a>, however for practicality an outline is presented here:</p>  A special smart contract is deployed on Ethereum blockchain designed to lock a specific amount of TRAC tokens, to be teleported to the OriginTrail Parachain. The contract is permissionless and anybody can deposit (lock) TRAC into&nbsp;it.  The equivalent amount of TRAC tokens gets minted on the OriginTrail Parachain to the same address as the one that locked tokens on the Ethereum side (so tokens can be utilised by the same&nbsp;wallet).  Special care is taken to ensure security of the smart contract — a thorough smart contract audit has been conducted, together with functionality minimization (to lower complexity and thus risk surface) as well as coding and testing best practices.  <p>The near-term TRAC bridging proposal therefore is&nbsp;to:</p>  Perform one way TRAC teleports from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain by reutilizing <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/starfleet-boarding-contract">the same smart contract</a> already proven in the previous 100MM TRAC Starfleet staking procedure. This contract implementation has <a href="https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/origin-trail-starfleet-staking">been security audited by Quantstamp</a> and proven functional and secure in a production environment. Additionally, the smart contract is built in such a way that the locked funds can be used to integrate with the future&nbsp;bridges.  Execute teleports in a total of 15 batches in two week intervals.  This approach removes third-party code (non-OriginTrail ecosystem) from the bridging infrastructure, additionally minimising the risk surface until a more trust-minimising solution is available.  The approach enables continued exploration of bridging solutions within the Polkadot ecosystem for the mid- and long-term viability of a two-way TRAC bridge. It is expected that multiple options will be available, such as common-good parachain bridges, Snowfork and others, developed by the wider Polkadot community. Once a suitable bridge is available, all teleported tokens will be migrated (subject to the same RFC process as with this implementation).   Teleporting details <p>Teleporting will occur in 15 batches, each of which will be performed with a process similar to the previously executed Starfleet staking. Due to the nature of the smart contracts and them being audited and tested, only parametric changes can be implemented and no changes in smart contract code will be performed.</p><p>Each of the 15 teleportation batches will deploy a separate Teleport contract on Ethereum, managed by a multisig wallet. The illustration below shows the lifecycle of each Teleport contract and its phases as per smart contract design (specified in OT-RFC-10). There are 5 distinct periods defined in the life&nbsp;cycle:</p>  Preparation period: used for contract preparation and deployment on Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.  Boarding period: the period during which TRAC can be deposited in the smart contract for teleportation. The boarding period will last 2 weeks for each batch (except for the first batch lasting 3&nbsp;weeks).  Lock period: the period during which tokens are immobile (locked) in the teleportation smart contract on Ethereum. TRAC tokens are teleported to the OriginTrail Parachain and available for use with the same address as used for locking. Each lock period will be set to expire on March 31st&nbsp;2023.  Bridge period: the period during which locked tokens can be transferred from the teleportation smart contract on Ethereum to a fully fledged bridge implementation (which is expected to be available in the bridge period). The bridge period lasts for 12 months (latest until March 31st&nbsp;2024).  Fallback period: period used in the fallback scenario of a fully fledged bridge not becoming available, after all previous periods have expired. In this period it will be possible to teleport TRAC tokens back to Ethereum, using the accounting feature as described in the contract spec (OT-RFC-10).  <p>To incentivize the teleportation process and utility of the OriginTrail Parachain and the (then deployed) OriginTrail DKG v6, a designated amount of OTP bounty tokens will be made available for the users (to be announced).</p><p>The teleport timeline is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  August 18th (tentative): first Teleportation contract deployment and Batch #1 teleporting start, the first boarding period lasting 3&nbsp;weeks  September: first minting of TRAC on OT Parachain, added OTP bounty to enable the use of the OriginTrail Parchain (bonus size&nbsp;TBD)  Mid-September: Once TRAC is available, execute OriginTrail DKG v6&nbsp;launch  Batch #2 and further teleportation batches continue immediately after the first teleportation is completed and validated as successful.  <p>The detailed timeline will be shared in the following documents as soon as this RFC is approved.</p><p>The complete and updated OT-RFC-12 v2 document can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges%20(v2).pdf">here</a>.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">OriginTrail Twitter</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain">OriginTrail Parachain Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-12-v2-teleporting-trac-to-the-origintrail-parachain-on-polkadot-de535a9d2693">OT-RFC-12 V2: Teleporting TRAC to the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We’re excited to share that we launched the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network">Ceramic Community Forum</a>! The forum is the place to ask technical questions and receive support from your fellow community members and Ceramic’s core team.</p> Why did we launch the forum? <p>If you have been a part of Ceramic’s developer community for a while, you probably know that we've been exchanging knowledge and receiving updates from the Ceramic core team on a <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord Server</a>. One piece of feedback we received from multiple members of the community is that, over time, the RSS feed-like nature of Discord made it difficult to get answers to technical questions and search for information. It became clear that we need a better platform for facilitating technical support and empowering our developer community to share technical knowledge about Ceramic.</p> What do I use the forum for? <p>The forum is dedicated to asking and answering technical questions about Ceramic. It consists of a few main categories dedicated to specific aspects of Ceramic tech. If you have a question to ask, simply open it under the most relevant category. The questions asked on the forum will be answered between the Ceramic community and Ceramic’s core team.</p><p>The forum includes a few additional features that should improve the technical-information sharing and question answering across the Ceramic developer community:</p>  Better search—you can use the forum’s built-in search tool to discover questions that might be similar to yours  Sign-in with Ethereum—to begin using the forum, you can sign up using your Ethereum wallet.   And what about the Ceramic Discord server? <p>The Ceramic Discord Server is not going anywhere. Going forward, the server will be focused on facilitating more high-level discussions around Ceramic—e.g. talking about community projects, sharing ideas and feedback about specific aspects of the Ceramic Network. Over the next month, expect to see some architectural changes in the Discord server as we transition technical support to the Ceramic Forum.</p><p>Try out the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">Ceramic Forum</a> and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbtubbs/">David Tubbs</a>, Director of Marketing Communications at <a href="https://www.applyboard.com/">ApplyBoard</a>. Additional contributions made by members of DIACC’s Outreach Expert Committee.</p>



<p>Relationships are built on one thing: trust. It is the basis to which we form opinions and develop long lasting associations with who and how we make decisions in our everyday lives. Trust is typically established through one of three ways: 1) personal experience, 2) opinions from others we trust, and 3) third party verification in the form of reviews or trustmarks.</p>



<p>Let’s explore this third avenue and find out exactly what a trustmark is, how they come about, and most importantly, why they matter. In the digital era with an increase of online and accessible services, trustmarks matter more than ever before trustmarks matter more than ever before.</p>



<p>What is a trustmark?</p>



<p>Trustmarks are all around us every single day. They are woven into the fabric of our daily lives in the community, but more importantly in our digital lives.</p>



<p>When you login to a website and see the lock icon on your browser to denote a secure connection, when you walk into a bank in Canada and see the purple Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) logo right at the entrance, or when you go to a hotel website and see their Trip Advisor rating posted. These are all trustmarks and they exist to establish consumer confidence.</p>



<p>Trustmarks are less about what it stands for and more about how it makes the user feel. Do they feel a familiarity and understanding as to what the trustmark means? Do they feel like a third party actually verified something? And, does the user feel safe? These are questions a trustmark needs to answer to both communicate what it stands for and serve a wider purpose. Both of these factors can only come from a shared understanding of the trust to be built.</p>



<p>Creating a shared understanding</p>



<p>Crafting a universal and shared understanding for what a trustmark stands for is not easy. A trustmark must cross cultural, age, socioeconomic, and educational boundaries to make its ubiquity and utility impactful. It must also be supported by enough parties to gain critical mass so that adoption begins crossing traditional boundaries.</p>



<p>This often begins with an organization or group of entities to establish the need for a trustmark, its use, and also its limitations. It is vital that this organization remains unbiased. From there it is expanded through a virtuous cycle of education and adoption by more organizations until that critical mass of adoption is met. No matter what, the establishment of a solid foundation of a shared understanding is essential if widespread adoption of the trustmark is to be found. Without it, the trustmark will simply be a niche symbol for something only a small group will understand and recognize.</p>



<p>Creating mass adoption of a trustmark</p>



<p>The start of this shared understanding is happening right now as previously covered by Julianne Trotman in her article on <a href="https://diacc.ca/2022/03/11/digital-id-trust/">the development and adoption of trust frameworks</a> and the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF). The PCTF is the set of established needs and expectations around what validates that trust. The development of the iconography for a digital trustmark, in this context, is an important part of the process, but not as important as the actual adoption.</p>



<p>Adoption of a trustmark must be done across all our digital platforms. It should be shared on partner websites, on platforms, social media, traditional materials, and more. Ubiquity is not a bad thing, but should be embraced.</p>



<p>To continue with the example of the PCTF, because DIACC was the central source of its development and articulation, any trustmark would begin with its collaborative members. Its members would act as evangelists to start creating a distribution network for the trustmark. The key after this is repetition and growth. There is no set timeline for a trustmarks societal adoption, only that it is a journey that is wholly dependent on ongoing adoption by other organizations, companies, and if applicable, government.</p>



<p>Trustmarks take time. That being said, they start with a collective of people looking to reassure and build trust in our society. The more we talk about and show off a trustmark, subtly or overtly, the better adoption will be. It is a journey, but a journey worth starting.</p>

   Shops.scot will provide a Scottish 'Multi-Vendor Marketplace', a platform for many micro-businesses to create their own e-commerce store. 
 The post Shops.scot – Like Ebay Stores, but Scottish appeared first on digitalscot.net.

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/community/venture-builders/"></a>Shops.scot is a new venture under development. 
 Join the <a href="https://community.digitalscot.net/c/venture-builders/shops-scot-like-ebay-stores-but-scottish">Venture Builder group discussion</a> to participate. 
<p>Co-founders, dev partners, reseller agents, early adopter customers – All welcome.</p>
 Multi-vendor Marketplace 
<p>As the title suggests, this will operate a ‘Multi-vendor Marketplace’ – A site where multiple sellers can each create their own e-store, and visitors can browse and buy from any of them.</p>
<p>This will accelerate our Digital Nation Action Plan, specifically the digital enablement and support of micro and small businesses. It’s still the case that many don’t even have a web site.</p>
<p>So this will provide them an ultra simple way of achieving that, with the key distinction from other options like EBay or Amazon obviously being that it’s entirely Scotland focused. This means a much more local, hands on technical support, and a concentrated market focus.</p>
 Features 
<p>Key features will include:</p>
 
 A powerful set of digital marketing tools – As well as loading up your products, you’ll be able to send e-vouchers, email marketing etc. 
 Cryptocurrency – Accept Bitcoin payments et al. This is another key technology field where SMEs know they should be doing more but it is simply beyond them. 
 
<p>In short it will leverage the SaaS (Software as a Service) model to make easily accessible the powerful e-commerce and digital marketing technologies that most small businesses would greatly benefit from but don’t have the resource or expertise to deploy themselves.</p>
<p>There is also great potential to team up with other Scottish innovators, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/">Miconex</a>. They offer a gift card system that could tie in with #1, with a particular focus on local towns, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/casestudy/case-study--the-perth-gift-card">Perth</a>.</p>
<p>Shops.scot will be able to provide the core e-commerce tools for selling their products, and organized into similarly local sections, like Shops.scot/Perth. This will provide a powerful combined solution to achieve key Scottish Government goals like <a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/scottish-government-offers-support-local-online-firms">boosting local commerce for local merchants</a>.</p>

<p>Fast Identity Online (FIDO) outlines secure authentication protocols that are available to all. Now, Microsoft, Google and Apple are doubling down on passkeys to support FIDO Alliance. Their goal is to normalize passwordless authentication and eliminate passwords from the user authentication equation. FIDO Alliance seeks to bring the idea of the “password” into modern times with stronger security — by developing the FIDO protocols and setting a new standard.</p>

<p>Time to leave the passwords behind. Consumers are leaning that way — and would be happy to abandon that age-old, friction-filled relic that traces its genesis to the dawn of the Internet. The door is opening for authentication to increasingly be done by behavioral analytics. Advanced technologies parse how individuals wield their devices, how they type and enter data and leverage geolocation to help prove that people are who they say they are. The Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance also promotes the processes where the devices themselves authenticate identities as the devices are unlocked.</p>

<p>Apple has revealed more details on its plans to try and remove passwords with its new ‘passkey’ tool in an effort to increase online security, in collaboration with the FIDO Alliance. Passkeys are based on public key cryptography, which involves storing a private security key on your device. Because there’s no password to type, phishing and other scams will become far less frequent.</p>

<p>Apple are on the brink of a breakthrough with the new password feature in Mac OS Ventura’s Safari. Keys replaces typed passwords with Touch ID on a Mac. On the iPhone or iPad, you can use Face ID. No more searching for the unique password you create for each internet account. Apple works with the FIDO Alliance so passwords also work on non-Apple devices.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/community/venture-builders/"></a>The <a href="https://digitalscot.net/community/venture-builders/">Venture Builders Group</a> is a&nbsp;community group for entrepreneurs seeking to launch new global-scale tech ventures. 
<p>The group provides a forum to brainstorm your venture idea, discuss business models, recruit co-founders and fast-track to launch, and we’ll showcase new ventures here on this site.</p>
 Learn.scot – A Virtual School for Scotland 
<p><a href="https://Learn.scot">Learn.scot</a> is a new venture under development, intended to deliver ‘Scotland’s Digital Learning Centre’, a community marketplace platform where members can be both learners and tutors, accessing and also creating e-learning courseware.&nbsp;A summary of the business model:</p>
 
 Learning Community –&nbsp;Enable members to be both student and teacher, creating as well as accessing courses, with site forums and other features enabling a collaborative, supportive online community. 
 Blockchain Certifications –&nbsp;Utilize the Blockchain to digitize course credentials, improving engagement through ‘gamified’ curriculum and awarding of&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.scot/badges/">digital badges</a>. 
 Industry Engagement –&nbsp;Work with employers and industry groups to develop ‘Course to Career’ pathways, with a focus on practical courseware that is directly relevant to required workplace skills.

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/library/digital-education/"></a>Transforming Education 
<p>It is intended to play a pivotal role in <a href="https://digitalscot.net/library/digital-education/">Transforming Scottish Education for the 21st Century</a>.</p>
<p>While you would assume e-learning would now be a mature component within the education sector, the reality is that it’s adoption is still quite immature – <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-53067254">62% of parents</a> said their school had not provided any online learning for their children and <a href="https://www.tes.com/news/coronavirus-pupils-not-engaging-online-learning">teachers were struggling</a> with how to deliver it effectively.</p>
<p>Writing for Reform Scotland Jenifer Johnston offers <a href="https://reformscotland.com/2020/05/scotland-needs-a-virtual-school-jenifer-johnston/">this</a> simple but very compelling ideal for what is needed – A ‘virtual school’ for Scotland:</p>
<p>“My ask of the Scottish Government is that there is a national online curriculum developed and delivered digitally in really simple, open-access websites, no passwords, no gatekeeping, just lessons broadcast daily on a website, join in if you can. Scotland has many superstar teachers who could deliver classes to the nation’s kids in a virtual school – we could get to know them as well as our own fantastic class teachers. Lessons could be live and recorded to watch later if children can’t get to them right away.”</p>
<p>Our national opportunity is to harness this collective pool of innovation and define how various combinations of each can be applied to meet the various education needs of Scotland.</p>
<p>“Scotland has many superstar teachers who could deliver classes to the nation’s kids in a virtual school – we could get to know them as well as our own fantastic class teachers. Lessons could be live and recorded to watch later if children can’t get to them right away.”</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Harnessing modern digital learning platforms can address Scotland’s challenge, and overall presents the country with the opportunity to modernize not only what we learn, but how&nbsp;we learn, and transform our entire approach to education.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of Digital Scotland is to drive the initiatives that will see us emulate the digital nation success of countries like Estonia, and with this program&nbsp;ask and answer the question how might Scotland achieve this same level of digital capability and the same high performance academic achievement it enables.</p>

<p>Accenture, Broadcom, Copado, IBM, Security Compass, US Department of Defense, and Others to Enable VSM Data Sharing Across Platforms</p> 


<p>2 August 2022 — Members of OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, are working together to define interoperability standards for value stream management (VSM). The new VSM Interoperability Technical Committee’s goal is to bring increased interoperability to existing value stream standards, tools, and best practices, enabling a more secure approach to sharing data across platforms in the software supply chain and systems ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For VSM journeys, sharing of data across enterprise platforms to get holistic, valuable data in the form of forensics, observability and auditability, for example, is critical. But it requires data standards and secure interoperability,” said Eveline Oehrlich, Research Director at Research In Action and Chief Research Officer at DevOps Institute. “Having such interoperability allows for teams to look at events that are relevant to an organization with additional context for the forensic processes of post incident and future incident management work, as an example use case.”</p>



<p>The TC’s work will focus on defining key component parts of value stream data, enabling interoperability of value streams among users and platforms, establishing good practice for value stream data architecture, and creating open standards for value stream management metrics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The formation of the OASIS VSM Interoperability Technical Committee is an important next step in the advancement of VSM, with the potential to provide an accelerated path to VSM adoption. We look forward to leading this talented group of organizations as we work towards our common goal of aiding VSM capabilities,” said VSMI TC co-chairs Helen Beal of Value Stream Management Consortium and Kelly Cullinane of Copado.</p>



<p>Organizations typically use different tools to measure the performance of their software delivery processes. Using VSM tools, an organization can utilize data and metrics to maximize innovation, drive growth, and add greater value. This TC sets out to create a VSM standard for interoperability and tool integration, allowing for broader adoption in the long term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participation in the OASIS VSMI TC is open to all through membership in OASIS. Digital product leaders; product value stream organizations; cybersecurity, public sector security, and quality management professionals; and others are invited to join the group.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Support for Value Stream Management Interoperability Technical Committee</p>



<p>Broadcom<br>“As a leader in introducing and implementing VSM solutions Broadcom Software is thrilled to support this initiative. VSM has emerged as a critical success factor in digital transformation and uniting to support interoperability standards is the next logical step, especially as we see more businesses adopting VSM. Data lives at the core of ValueOps VSM and we are committed to continually innovating in this space.”<br>-Jean-Louis Vignaud, Head of ValueOps, Broadcom Software</p>



<p>Copado<br>“Standards are critical for the proper interoperability of internet infrastructure and software. That interoperability drives innovation and capabilities that help create a more resilient ecosystem. That’s why it’s so exciting to launch VSMI; this will help companies normalize value stream management data for better measurement, auditability and terminology between large scale ecosystems.”<br>-Daniel Riedel, SVP Strategic Services, Copado&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM<br>“Often times, enterprises are constrained from realizing maximum value from their workflows because of disparate systems that may not seamlessly integrate. This situation is further challenged when there are mergers and acquisitions, and new tooling is invariably brought into the value stream. VSMI can play a key role in bridging this void. We support the VSMI initiative and feel like this will be the logical next step towards creating Next-Gen DevSecOps organizations.”<br>-Sunil Joshi, Vice President &amp; CTO, Hybrid Cloud Services, Americas, IBM</p>



<p>Security Compass<br>“Value streams are a critical part of integrating our disparate security activities and aligning them to produce business value. Including multiple stakeholders, from business leaders to developers, to derive requirements and deliver insights in security activities is the next evolution in securing our applications and infrastructure. Security Compass is honored to participate in this OASIS working group to help create an open standard around value streams so that we can collectively build a world where organizations build secure systems at the pace of business demand.”<br>-Altaz Valani, Director of Insights Research, Security Compass</p>

 Deadline: 8th Aug. 
 Budget: £70k. 
 

			 
		 
	
 RFP Summary 
 Business Case 
<p>We recognise that our current website is not serving us well and will be developing an organisational digital strategy. We require an agency to partner with on this transformation journey that can help establish a new improved website and a new standard for how we develop digital information and services linking with our established organisational systems.</p>
<p>A digital strategy is in development, alongside a digital framework. Improving our user journeys and website is integral to achieving our strategic aims and to maximise reach, efficiency and engagement. As an organisation, we are in the process of pivoting to be userled and insight-driven to develop intuitive and supportive journeys to support decarbonisation of homes. An organisation-wide customer journey is being planned, which will need to be developed in tandem with our website transformation.</p>
 Tech Platform 
<p>Changeworks’ staff and teams range from those that are highly digitally capable, to people who have few or limited skills. We are in the process of moving to SharePoint and embedding usage of Power Platform capabilities such as our CRM across Changeworks, and we are still in process of adoption and learning. There is an ICT team responsible for Power Platform, CRM and support relating to information technology.</p>
<p>The Digital, Marketing and Communications team is responsible for the website and have a content lead, but only limited SEO capabilities, and no developer or UX resources.</p>
<p>We are currently using Drupal 7 but it is not fit for purpose. While we can make minor updates to our website, bigger changes to webpages need to be done through an agency, which is time-consuming and not cost-effective. Our website is not optimised towards user needs and user journeys are poorly mapped out. Though we have a wealth of quality content, it is difficult to find and surface to users, and our service proposition is unclear.</p>
 Project Scope 
 
 Develop a digital roadmap for our website transformation project incl. project timeline, milestones and quality assurance. 
 Develop user personas and journeys for our B2B and B2C audiences, engaging with Changeworks teams through a Discovery phase to determine which services or aspects of services are equipped with online self-servicing and/or lead generation in a phased approach. Includes providing support with:<br>
a. Content audit and content migration<br>
b. User personas and journeys development and testing<br>
c. Plan for lead generation<br>
d. SEO and content development 
 Re-platform the Changeworks website to a more user-friendly CMS (and develop a Minimum Viable Product version as necessary before full website launch alongside new brand). 
 Ensure the website, CMS, tech stack and other necessary components can integrate with current and future requirements, and are able to support Changeworks’ ambitious aims of scaling up reach through digital including digital service design over the 22-25 strategic period and beyond.
 
 Changeworks is invested in Microsoft (including use of Power Platform for e-marketing and as our CRM). The long-term aim is to use Microsoft Azure Cloud. Sharepoint migration began in May ’22. Dynamics 365 / Power Platform can integrate with the majority of systems as long as they accept HTTP requests, which most modern CMS and websites should be able to handle. 
 
 
 Ongoing (min. 3 years) contract for hosting and maintenance incl. options for annual extensions and break-out clauses. 
 
 Proposal 
<p>Identify and map out costings for the above as well as phased project management cycles as may be required.</p>
<p>a. Proposed costings for website transformation project<br>
b. Proposed costings including fixed budget for maintenance and hosting<br>
c. Estimate costings for future development work (for example for new online services or further integrations)</p>

 revocation of the wallet authentication credential
 
 alternative linkage solutions enables the certifying entity to revoke the wallet authentication credentials based on upcoming security flaws of hardware mechanisms

 Members of the Ethereum Foundation joined the SIG to review Ethereum's Decentralized Identity discussion in general, and ideas around a 'portable KYC' system in particular. You can find the discussion on the Ethereum website <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/decentralized-identity/">here</a>, and a problem statement draft on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/sustany/dvg/wiki/Problem-Statement-Framing">here</a> 
 Invited speaker&nbsp;Anessa Allen Santos.&nbsp;Anessa's legal practice is largely dedicated to blockchain and fintech by helping innovative corporate clients navigate the evolving regulatory landscape for securities, commodities, and financial services. 
 John Popeo, a Partner at The Gallatin Group, joins the group. Before entering private practice, John spent a decade in various roles at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Having been on both sides of the regulatory divide, John brings a unique perspective to our discussion towards untangling the externalities of current AML and KYC regimes.

<p>Today, GoTrustID Inc.

MojeID became the first eIDAS approved eID service that leverages the FIDO standards and certification program. This is a remarkable milestone that benefits Czech citizens by letting them utilize phishing resistant technology.</p>

<p>Most breaches involve a stolen password or credential, but ironically enough, passwords are still a popular way to protect your online identity. A study conducted by Google revealed that 52% of people reuse the same password for multiple accounts, making it easy for hackers to guess your passwords. Thankfully, there has been a major shift towards a passwordless future with the development of FIDO2 by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using FIDO2, your smartphone will serve as your identity authenticator and store a passkey with the help of public and private key cryptography.</p>

<p>Google, Apple and Microsoft want to say goodbye to the principle of passwords altogether. Instead, a method jointly developed by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is to be used. The FIDO method generates a key pair on devices that is linked to a fingerprint or other biometric factors. Logging on to a cell phone is then sufficient to access accounts on a computer.</p>

  Sometimes solving two complex problems together from an alternative 
perspective is more manageable than tackling them separately. So, slowly 
but surely, we are bringing our contribution toward more robust 
cybersecurity and seamless interoperability through our Dynamic Data 
Economy vision.

<p>Two years ago, we launched an atypical foundation with a societal mission to create synergies, exposing the formidable challenges of inclusiveness and privacy in digital transformation. Nevertheless, the core design of the Human Colossus Foundation is about experimentation, progressive development, and testing.</p><p>We want to thank our early supporters in the private and public sectors for providing nearly CHF 0.5 Mio of seed funding for prototyping core components to support data harmonisation, digital event authentication and distributed ecosystem governance</p><p>Our focus now shifts from experimentation to progressive development. Funded by the EU Horizon 2020 eSSIF-Lab initiative, the closing of our DKMS-4-SSIproject marks that transition as we hit the road of no return in our journey. Here we present our path to inclusiveness and privacy in digital transformation.</p> 0. Today <p>Every day more private and public services are available online. Users receive the digital benefits of increased availability and mobility. Digital services are available everywhere all the time. But the advantages come at a price: accessibility to the platform delivering the services. Moreover, with the current economic incentive that values data over the purpose of usage, platforms collect more data than they need for the intended purposes of the service. Furthermore, data are kept behind a walled garden, forcing users to share too much data with too many institutions. </p><p>Therefore services are restricted to users with the technological capacity to access the platform. Unfortunately, the same platforms too often force a form of consent, allowing them a secondary usage of user's information outside the initial purpose.</p><p>As a result, we evolve towards a two-tier society, excluding individuals that can not access the platform or are not willing to open their private sphere for an unclear rationale.</p> 1. Inclusiveness Needs Interoperability <p>Early in the 20th century, Georges Orwell introduced the "Big Brother" concept in his novel "1984". Although, at the time caricatural, it recognised early that no single over-centralised system could cope with the diversity and complexity of society. </p><p>When it comes to digital transformation, there is a direct technological corollary: digital platforms can not scale beyond a specific limit. If they grow outside their intended purpose, societal friction appears as they can not cope with the complexity of society as a whole. The diversity of our daily activities as individuals, of our customers as businesses or citizen's needs as a government requires digital services to focus on a clear purpose. Interoperability between services tailored to their user base is the natural solution to include every specific case in our digitalised society. Interoperability should be to services what cooperation is to humans; a natural core capacity enabling growth as a group. </p><p>This interoperability of services requires first machines to talk together (the unfortunately too narrow technological definition of interoperability) while the ultimate exchange of information remains under the user's control. Thus we started with the essential element: the tooling for a decentralised cryptographic key management infrastructure (DKMS). Then, within the creativity nest provided by the eSSIF-Lab, we started building libraries allowing developers to begin their journey into the most advanced decentralised authentication architecture: KERI, the brainchild of the prolific veteran of network security, Samuel Smith. Designed for secure authentication, KERI provides the grounds for an alternative form of interoperability. The user and platform authentication does not rely on an administrative intermediary. Instead, an ambient infrastructure under the separate control of each party lets them choose an adequate level of security according to the context. Security is distributed, and interoperability can follow. </p><p>Michal, a core team member of the DKMS-4-SSI project states: </p><blockquote><p>"Distribute the responsibility and decision making for authentication and authorisation among network participants and let them decide. No more castles with giant walls but a synergistic approach where network participants interact and make decisions based upon other participants' reputations. The foundations for our alternative are very similar to what the US National Institute of Standards (NIST) proposes with the "Zero-trust concept" -- distribute". </p><p>Michal Pietrus -Senior Developer &amp; Co-Founder of ArgonAUTHs</p></blockquote> 2. Privacy Needs Cybersecurity + Information Security = Human Governance <p>Interoperability requires more than secure authentication; it requires trust between participants. The user naturally becomes the central point of overall control of his digital experience. And trust requires meaning, not faith in technology providers. </p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation sees privacy as a fundamental factor enabling human cooperation at all levels. If cybersecurity protects data, privacy protection is at a higher level where data acquires meaning. A text string becomes a name only when the data model unambiguously links it to an attribute. Our equation is simple, Data plus Meaning equals Information. It is information usage that must be governed to protect privacy.</p><p>Like authentication, to be effective at the complexity scale of the Internet, a peer-to-peer mechanism to define the meaning of data has to supplement available standards. This requirement is the motivation behind the decentralised semantics domain. As a result, we elevate privacy protection to the governance of information. In other words, securing privacy requires more than data protection regulation. It requires adherence to the complete existing legal framework of an ecosystem. </p> 3. The ambition: valuing information usage, not data itself. <p>In conclusion, to address the challenges of inclusiveness and privacy, the journey starts by solving thorny technological questions in the domains of authentication and semantics. Then, digital communication channels and the fantastic potential of digital technologies to enrich information can be included case-by-case in the existing trust frameworks (legal, ethical, cultural). This is our roadmap towards accurate information for decision-making.</p><p>Once reached, our ambition loops back to the origins of the foundation as captured by Robert Mitwicki as co-founder:</p><blockquote><p> "Data has value when it flows. It is costly when it stagnates"</p><p>Robert Mitwicki, Head of the Technology Council of the Human Colossus Foundation</p></blockquote><p>To receive updates about the Foundation and DDE v1.0, subscribe to the Foundation’s mailing list <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kRop_rIejjA22GecV--GTbKxwQLF5JVP/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

  <p>The Human Colossus Foundation, a Swiss-based independent non-profit organisation, announces the release of its eagerly-awaited Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) v1.0 architecture, describing the core concepts and technologies to enable a next-generation data-agile economy. Two years following its conception, the Foundation published today DDE v1.0, which includes the Principles and a Trust Infrastructure Stack as well as a rollout plan for a related suite of components: Overlays Capture Architecture, Trusted Digital Assistant, Data Governance Administration. In addition, a DDE Founding Donors’ Programme launch accompanies the release, offering exclusive opportunities for organisations to become the earliest DDE v1.0 contributors and experts by engaging in the next stage of development.&nbsp;</p><p>Inspired by the three co-founders' aspiration for secured, authentic data management in an increasingly digitised world, the Foundation coined the term "Dynamic Data Economy", the "DDE". With an overarching vision to empower people and organisations, the DDE enables better-informed decisions based on insights from harmonised, accurate data framed by sound data governance. It has developed an ambient cryptographic infrastructure to underpin ecosystems dealing with harmonised data within distributed governance, a paradigm shift in human-centric digital interaction, free from existing, platform-centric economic models. Further development of the DDE continues to bridge existing data standards and legacy infrastructure whilst preserving nuanced jurisdictional and human distinctions and differences in the digital space. Since its formation in 2020, the Foundation has received multiple rounds of government and private funding to develop this groundbreaking next-generation infrastructure. The release of DDE v1.0 marks the Foundation's readiness for broader collaborative stakeholders and community engagement.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“The DDE v1.0 conceptual models, methodologies, and technological infrastructure provide a realistic solution for digital transformation across distributed data ecosystems. It is about returning to the roots of how humans interact online, arming individuals and businesses with the conceptual knowledge to understand the technical design limitations of the current Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last two years, our team has contributed to open standard and open source development of the new Internet at various community forums and summarised our learning and insights into critical blog posts and webinars. It has become clear to us that we developed wrong habits in the digital space, letting technology take over our agency for authentication and privacy. We would never allow this in our physical world; nor should we have done so for the digital one. It is time for real DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, one that can create a more sustainable, scalable, and human-friendly Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>We released DDE v1.0 today to help you start seeing what we see through the DDE vision and its short-term development roadmap. We also want to invite you to participate in our journey to develop DDE further and use it to solve our collective problems. Are you ready?”</p><p>Dr. Philippe Page, Chair of the Board of Trustees</p></blockquote><p><br>DDE Principles</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  




<p>The DDE, a decentralised, network-agnostic trust infrastructure acutely aligned with the European data strategy, is built upon a set of core <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f288b25f9c364d7945e6eb/1660061875006/HCF+DDE+Principles+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Principles</a>. The DDE Principles describe the essential building blocks of any information system, leading to a trust infrastructure that preserves the structural, definitional, and contextual integrity (DDE Principle 1) of any object and their relationships in the Semantic domain, the factual authenticity (DDE Principle 2) of any recorded event in the Inputs domain, and the consensual veracity (DDE Principle 3) of any purpose-driven policy or notice in the Governance domain. As a result, actors in DDE ecosystems will ultimately have the transactional sovereignty (DDE Principle 4) to share accurate information bilaterally in the fourth domain, the Economic domain.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>DDE Trust Infrastructure Stack&nbsp;</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  




<p>To better define and describe what contributes most notably to creating a cross-sectoral trust infrastructure for access and use of data according to the DDE principles, the Foundation developed the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Trust Infrastructure Stack</a> that presents "Infrastructure" versus "Security" incrementally through the core data domains (see figure below). Deployed implementations that align with the Stack will positively affect the relationship between DDE actors and incentivise them to share horizontal data across sectors and jurisdictions. The cryptographic assurance of verifiable digital primitives and the human accountability facilitated by socio-economic data governance administrations and framework empowered by the Stack is pivotal for innovation in analytics, artificial intelligence, or other data-driven applications.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>DDE v1.0 Rollout Plan</p><p>As part of the DDE v1.0 release this year, the Foundation will launch three foundational DDE tools, which include:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a standardised global solution for data capture and exchange which protects sensitive data, providing a positive alternative to current architectures;</p>  <p>Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA), a key DDE software interface component that provides a way to look at and interact with information in distributed data ecosystems; and&nbsp;</p>  <p>Data Governance Administration (DGA), a suite of governance methodologies for distributed data ecosystems.</p>  <p>To build a community of DDE developers and advocates, the Foundation will organise community events to facilitate learning and dialogue, launching the Colossi Network later in 2022 as an open forum for more structured community collaboration and contribution.</p>

<p>First public review - ends August 27th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC are pleased to announce that Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Architecture Specification Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment. This is the first public review for this specification.</p>



<p>Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyber defense via statically configured products operating in isolation is untenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system and between systems. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. A high level overview of OpenC2 featuring insights from the Technical Director of NSA’s Capabilities Directorate can be viewed at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCooyNJoOrU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCooyNJoOrU</a>.</p>



<p>This specification describes the abstract architecture of OpenC2 to define a common understanding of the messages and interactions for all bindings and serializations.</p>

<p>In late June, as a part of <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/meet-our-new-matchbox-partners/">our work with Ugandan organisation Albinism Umbrella</a>, we hosted a<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/invite-community-call-responsible-data-social-justice/"> Community Call about Responsible Data</a>. The call included speakers <a href="https://twitter.com/amosdoornbos">Amos Doornbos and </a>former Engine Roomer <a href="https://twitter.com/paolasinu">Paola Verhaert</a> and brought together a variety of civil society organisations interested in collecting, managing, and storing data in equitable and responsible ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversation was centred on the risks and potential harms of data management, and how to go about integrating responsible data into an organisations’ ongoing work. Below are some of the insights that surfaced in the call.</p>



 Starting from the top: figuring out what data you are using 



<p>Speaker Amos Doornbos pointed out that it is best to start by identifying the ways in which your organisation is using data. It can be easy to underestimate how much data you’re collecting in your day-to-day work, how your team is using it (or not using it!) and what is actually being done with all of it. He introduced the following guiding questions, as well as <a href="https://thisisamos.com/data-inventory-map-fillable-template/">this short Cheat sheet</a>, to support the process of mapping this out:&nbsp;</p>



  What data is being collected and why?&nbsp;  Who is collecting it?&nbsp;  Where is it stored?&nbsp;  Who is this data shared with?&nbsp;  



<p>For further support, The Engine Room’s <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/">Becoming RAD! [Retaining, Archiving, and Disposal]</a> Tipsheets can guide you through some of the processes in more detail.&nbsp;</p>



 Responsible data as an organisation-wide priority 



<p>Our speakers also talked about how important it can be for the whole organisation (and if possible, also the organisation’s partners and the communities they work with) to be involved in conversations about potential risks and harms related to the data the organisation collects, stores and works with. Data is not just an issue for the “tech person” on your team: the consequences of the ways individuals on the team use data will affect the whole of your work. In addition to that, taking your team’s different experiences and perspectives into account is a good way of designing your data strategy and solutions that work for all.</p>



 Mitigating risk and potential harm 



<p>Much of our conversation focused on the importance of assessing how the data we work with could generate or exacerbate risks for the people reflected in the data. Our speakers shared the following resources to support teams in reflecting on potential risks and harms:</p>



  <a href="https://thisisamos.com/2022/02/09/identifying-potential-data-risks-and-harms/">Identifying Potential Data Risks and Harms</a>  <a href="https://thisisamos.com/cheat-sheets/">Data Sharing Cheat Sheet</a> (scroll down the page)  



<p>We also talked about how practising data minimisation – that is minimising the amount and the categories of data you collect – can be a good strategy to prevent potential harm. If the data you collect does not serve a purpose for your work, consider deleting it and/or not collecting it all.</p>



 Participation is key 



<p>Another insight from our speakers referred to consent practices: The communities you serve should be informed about potential risks associated with your use of their data, and should be able to withdraw their consent regarding the data you store at any point. That is why baking participation into your processes is a good practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Relatedly, a key point that emerged in the call was this: Responsible data is not a one-off thing. It’s not a conversation you have once (for example, at the moment that you’re collecting data from the people you work with).&nbsp; Context regularly changes (and so do the potential risks you and your organisation face), so plan accordingly. One way to do this is by creating user-friendly check-ins throughout your project to inform people about what’s happening with their data, making room for them to exercise their agency and select whether to opt-in or out.&nbsp;</p>



 Be specific and realistic with your data management goals&nbsp; 



<p>A different suggestion that came up in the call is to avoid broad and abstract recommendations and processes when implementing responsible data practices in your organisation. Paola Verhaert highlighted how important it is to make them clear and practical, so that they can be implemented easily. Staff might not have extra time on their hands to spend on this, so being specific and realistic with your data management goals is a good way of making sure your team is able to implement them.&nbsp;</p>



 Where to start? 



<p>Changing the way your organisation operates can seem overwhelming. If you need support advocating for changes around your data practices, look for allies both within your own organisation and in the sector (the <a href="https://responsibledata.io/get-involved/">Responsible Data Community</a> might be a good place to start!).

<p>The OriginTrail ecosystem is a two-layer system, driving its two symbiotic networks by their respective crypto tokens — the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (hosting the multichain OriginTrail DKG, as indicated<a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper?section=origintrail-technology-stack"> in the whitepaper</a>) driven by its utility token TRAC, and the underlying blockchains with their respective native tokens used for transactions.</p><p>The OriginTrail Decentralized Network utility enabled by the TRAC token therefore requires each of the respective blockchains to support the TRAC token according to the TRAC tokenomics design, and requires necessary bridge infrastructure between relevant chains. TRAC being an ERC20 token on Ethereum has been so far successfully bridged to two blockchains — Gnosis chain (formerly xDAI) and Polygon with their respective bridge infrastructure.</p><p>With the launch of the dedicated OriginTrail blockchain on Polkadot — the OriginTrail Parachain — the required bridge infrastructure needs to be created to facilitate the OriginTrail DKG operation on this new chain. Moreover, the same infrastructure will enable further network effects for TRAC on all of Polkadot emerging parachain infrastructure and solutions, such as Acala and its DeFi stack (DEX, aUSD stablecoin, etc).</p><p>The purpose of this document is to outline the technical approach to bridging the TRAC token to Polkadot via the OriginTrail Parachain and collect relevant feedback from the OriginTrail community.</p> Bridging TRAC to OriginTrail Parachain and&nbsp;Polkadot <p>Polkadot is a network designed to enable high interoperability between blockchains and inter-blockchain trustless operations, such as bridging Polkadot based tokens on connected blockchains. As a multi blockchain network of parachains connected via the common Layer 0 Polkadot Relay Chain, bridging tokens is enabled by the powerful <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain">cross chain messaging format XCM</a>. Using these inherent functionalities of Polkadot therefore solves the “bridging problem” within the entire Polkadot ecosystem — once the TRAC token is available on the OriginTrail Parachain, making it available to other parachains is a non-issue.</p><p>When it comes to external blockchains such as Ethereum however, there are a multitude of bridging approaches evolving in parallel. Two of the most promising approaches at the moment of writing this RFC&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://snowbridge.snowfork.com/">Snowbridge</a>, a general purpose trustless bridge in development by the Snowfork team, yet to be launched,  <a href="https://chainbridge.chainsafe.io/">Chainbridge</a>, an EVM to Substrate bridge already available and in utilization by parachains such as Moonbeam and Centrifuge.  <p>As development progresses, we can naturally expect new and improved bridging solutions in the years to come. Therefore, bridging of TRAC to the OriginTrail Parachain will, over time, most likely involve a multitude of different bridges and related infrastructure as the Polkadot ecosystem evolves. It is therefore essential to plan for this eventuality from the start and thus enable the bridge infrastructure evolution to be “inherited” by the TRAC bridges on the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>It is important to note that TRAC token will stay an ERC-20 token on Ethereum and will be implemented as a bridgeable asset on the OriginTrail Parachain, which operates with its native token&nbsp;OTP.</p> Near term bridging approach — Chainbridge <p>Out of the two approaches outlined above, the core developers of OriginTrail propose the implementation of the Chainbridge bridge system for the first TRAC bridge between Ethereum and OriginTrail Parachain. Chainbridge is a battle tested, two way bridge, used by several teams within the Polkadot ecosystem to move assets to parachains.</p><p>Chainbridge implements a bridge smart contract on the Ethereum side (similar to Gnosis and Polygon bridges), with a respective pallet enabled on the OriginTrail Parachain. Tokens are transferred between the Ethereum bridge contract and the parachain via a set of relayers which listen for bridging events on both blockchains and executing the necessary transfers on the blockchain on the “other side” of the bridge, as illustrated below.</p><p>The bridged TRAC token will be implemented as a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-assets">parachain asset </a>on the OriginTrail Parachain and further bridged to the EVM&nbsp;pallet.</p><p>The Chainbridge implementation has been significantly researched by the OriginTrail core developers and progressed in implementation together with assistance from the Parity development team. To our knowledge and experience it is the most mature and tested system within the ecosystem and is the proposed solution for the near&nbsp;term.</p><p>However, as most existing bridges (such as Gnosis and Polygon bridges) its trust model can be improved, as explained in the <a href="https://chainbridge.chainsafe.io/">Chainbridge docs</a>:</p><p>“In its current state ChainBridge operates under a trusted federation model. Deposit events on one chain are detected by a trusted set of off-chain relayers who await finality, submit events to the other chain and vote on submissions to reach acceptance triggering the appropriate handler. Research is currently underway to reduce the levels of trust required and move toward a fully trust-less bridge.”</p><p>Therefore a key component of this proposal is to avoid “bridge lock-in” and enable further development of the OriginTrail bridging infrastructure to involve more trust-minimized solutions (such as Snowfork when&nbsp;ready).</p><p>The initial set of bridge relayers will be run by OriginTrail core developers, with an ambition to include additional relayers from the ecosystem in the near&nbsp;future.</p> Long term approach — multiple&nbsp;bridges <p>We expect a multitude of improvements as bridging infrastructure evolves to support more than one bridge on the OriginTrail Parachain. These will most likely include improvements in security models (trustless bridges), efficiency and user experience. It’s important to note however that having multiple bridge systems bridging the same asset effectively creates multiple “mirror versions” of the same asset on the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>To enable a sustainable, long term evolution of the bridging infrastructure therefore 3 key considerations need to be applied from the&nbsp;start:</p>  Ensuring equivalence of bridged TRAC tokens as they might need to be implemented as “different” assets on the OriginTrail Parachain — for example, a TRAC token bridged via Chainbridge and a TRAC token bridged via Snowfork might be two “mirror version” assets on the parachain, with essentially the same value (1 TRAC). Equivalence would involve enabling OriginTrail DKG and other systems utilizing TRAC to register all TRAC mirror versions on the Parachain as the same (equivalent).  Appropriate mirror asset naming should be applied to avoid confusion, especially as these assets move across the Polkadot ecosystem.  “Phase out” capability for mirror assets in case of potential bridge issues (such as a major flaw being discovered), which would enable a safe decommission of potentially problematic bridges, ensuring TRAC tokenomics preservation.  <p>Having these points in place while implementing the first bridge is important and already taken into consideration by the core development team.</p> Conclusion <p>This document outlines the near and long term approach of enabling the utilization of TRAC token in the Polkadot ecosystem via the OriginTrail Parachain token. We invite the OriginTrail community to provide their improvement proposals, comments and suggestions via the <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository">official RFC repository</a>.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">OriginTrail Twitter</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain">OriginTrail Parachain Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-12-origintrail-parachain-trac-bridges-57bb6852dfa7">OT-RFC-12 OriginTrail Parachain TRAC bridges</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Part 2 of this 2-part series explains the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md">did:pkh</a>/<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md#simple-summary">CACAO</a> variation for Verite data models and flows, which provides an entry path for wallets that may not support sufficient functionality for emerging decentralized identity patterns</p><p>Since some wallets may not themselves be willing to embed protocol-specific logic (interaction with verifiers) or more general verifiable-credential logic, we have to find a kind of "minimum viable" level of support for today’s non-DID-enabled crypto wallets. While handling DIDs and signing Verifiable Presentations brings a kind of secure indirection that enables portability and multi-chain wallets, these properties are not strictly essential to the core functionality of Verite. For this reason, we define a crypto wallet that can receive and pass to dApps a Verifiable Credential issued against its blockchain address adequate, with a few adjustments and supplements.</p> Phase 0: Issuance Directly to Crypto Wallet<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>In a crypto-wallet centric end-to-end flow, the trust model is different and the interplay between credential wallet and crypto wallet can be greatly simplified. The credentials themselves must also be slightly different– instead of obtaining the credential subject DID directly from the wallet to which they are being issued, the issuer will use a credential subject identifier based on a specific blockchain address controlled by that wallet. Using DID terminology, rather than attest to the controller of a wallet, it attests only to a specific address controlled by that wallet.</p><p>This greatly simplifies the ownership question, by relying on native mechanisms for proving ownership of the address– at the time of issuance, as well as at time of verification of the credentials.</p> Two Options of Expressing a Blockchain address as a DID (and as a VC subject)<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Instead of defining the subject of the VC as a chain-agnostic DID provided by the wallet, the issuer will deterministically generate a DID from the blockchain address controlled by the connected wallet. Multiple DID methods allow this possibility; we’ll describe two of them, assuming a wallet with an Ethereum address (referred to as <code>ETH_ADDRESS</code>).</p>  did:key method - issue against a crypto wallet’s public key: If the issuer has the wallet address <code>ETH_ADDRESS</code> and any signature over a known message, the corresponding public key can be recovered using the <code>ecrecover</code> mechanism ported over from Bitcoin in the early days of Ethereum. In this way. the issuer can deterministically obtain a<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/"> did:key</a> DID that will be used as the value of <code>credentialSubject.id</code>. This is the method Circle will begin with, for ease of implementation by participants.  In this case, the mapping is:<code> did:key:&lt;ecrecover(ETH_ADDRESS, signature)&gt;</code>  For blockchains that do not use a Bitcoin-style pay2hash address system, like Solana and Polkadot, no recovery from a signature is necessary because the base form of the address is already a public key supported by <code><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-multiformats-multibase">multibase</a> </code>and thus by <code><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/#introduction">did:key</a></code>.    did:pkh method - issue against a crypto wallet’s public address: Other DID methods, like [did:pkh](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md), allow DIDs to be defined directly based on blockchain addresses in their commonly-used, public-facing forms. Long term, this is the preferred method. Among other advantages, the implementation across chains is more apparent. - In this case, the mapping is: <code>did:pkh:eip155:1:&lt;ETH_ADDRESS&gt;</code>. eip155 here refers to the EVM namespace (defined in EIP155), while 1 refers to the ethereum mainnet according to EIP155. - Just as the did:key URI scheme relies on the <code>[multibase](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-multiformats-multibase)</code> registry, so does the did:pkh URI scheme rely on the ChainAgnostic Standards Alliance’s [namespace registry](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/namespaces) to add non-EVM namespaces. - In cases where human-readability is important, end-users can introspect the VC and see their familiar address, as opposed to a public key that in pay2hash systems like BTC or ETH, they might never have seen or know they control   Sign-In With Ethereum and dApp-native Identity<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Wallets that have not incorporated decentralized identity capabilities rarely support JWT _signing _features, or other token mechanics that are common to the traditional web2 identity world. For this reason, many web3 sites and dApps have started using the wallet connection pattern to create a more feature-rich and auditable session mechanism via offchain message signing (i.e. <code>personal_sign</code> on EVM systems). Equivalents for other blockchain ecosystems, such as Solana, are forthcoming.</p><p>In the case of issuance, this signature is enough to extract the crypto wallet’s public key, as mentioned above. Importantly, though, it also enables delegated keys to sign offchain events without another onerous or fraught wallet-interaction, as we will see below.</p> Phase 1: Off-chain Verification<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a>  Variant: Crypto-Wallet only with only VC storage capabilities<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>At verification time, when a wallet "connects” to a dApp by providing an off-chain signature over a structured <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/5e9b0fe0728e160f56dd1e4cbf7dc0a0b1772f82/EIPS/eip-4361.md#informal-message-template">authentication message</a>, the dApp will have the wallet’s address (and live proof-of-control, if the authentication message included a secure nonce) so it can simply compare this address with the corresponding DID:PKH <code>credentialSubject.id</code> of the VC. This way, the verifier will not need to do an ownership check on the VC, and the dApp can trust the verifier to have received credentials from the right wallet because it, too, will require a wallet connection and prove ownership of the same wallet.</p><p>Without necessarily even having to parse, validity-check, or introspect the verifiable credentials, any wallet that can store them (whether as JWTs or even as raw text files) can submit them directly to verifiers, as shown below.</p><p></p><p>Note: while it is recommended that crypto wallets parse verifiable credentials and check their validity or safety, crypto wallets could in theory allow blind passthrough if the user can assume the responsibility for their contents. In the Verite case, there are little security concerns or abuses possible.</p><p>By itself, however, this bare VC is inferior to a VP from a full-featured decentralized-identity wallet, since it does not contain a non-repudiable off-chain wallet signature for auditing purposes. Or, to put it another way, it is only as trustworthy as the authentication of the wallet that sent it to you, and there is little standardization of the receipts you keep of crypto-wallet authentication to replay it for a future auditor or security review.</p><p>While the corner cases of impersonation or exfiltrated VCs might be vanishingly rare, the "audit trail” of a bare VC is weaker than a VC wrapped in a timestamped signature. For this reason, we encourage Verite dApps to create a functional equivalent to a verifiable presentation in the form of a signed presentation receipt (signed with a session-specific ephemeral key) for logging purposes. To accomplish this, we return to the Sign-In With Ethereum pattern to elaborate on its key delegation feature.</p> Sign-In With Ethereum Flow<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>As mentioned above, we support the emerging standard approach of the "Sign-In With Ethereum” mechanism which defines a sign-in message that includes a domain-binding anchor, an ephemeral session key, and other caveats. While the ephemeral session key property was not essential to the issuance wallet connection, it can be useful in the verification situation for more trustless (and auditable) logging.</p><p>By generating an ephemeral key and including it in the initial wallet-connection message for the crypto wallet to sign over upon authenticating itself to the dApp, the wallet effectively "delegates” that ephemeral key for the duration of the session. In UX terms, this saves the user from a distinct off-chain wallet signature at each confirmation or consent event. Carefully defining the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361#message-field-descriptions">other properties</a> of the SIWE message, dApps can secure and constrain that delegation, link to an applicable terms-of-service agreement, enable DNS-based domain-checks analogous to the "lock symbol” in modern browsers, etc.</p><p>Once the user has "connected” their wallet by signing this SIWE message, a CACAO is generated as a receipt of that session (and of the delegation of signing rights to the key). This allows the dApp to use smoother UX than requiring a full off-chain wallet signature to confirm each consent event or internal transaction (such as the presentation of VCs in a signed VP). But it also provides a compact and tamperproof way of encapsulating each event or internal transaction as a time-stamped and signed object for logging purposes– this makes each event as verifiable as an off-chain (or on-chain) signature, via the indirection of the delegated key.</p> Ownership Verification<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>You could say that the crypto wallet delegates the encapsulation and signature of a VP to the dApp, which creates a short-lived key with which to sign the VP, which is a kind of standardized logging object for a presentation event. This allows the verifier to confirm that the dApp is interacting on behalf of the wallet. Since the Verifier has confirmed control of the wallet address with a SIWE message, and the VC is issued to the address directly, there is no ownership verification needed as with a decentralized wallet; thanks to the CACAO, future auditors can replay these interactions and re-check signatures and tamper-proof objects to confirm all of these transactions trustlessly.</p> Detailed Flow<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p></p>  Wallet initiates DeFi transaction with dApp.  dApp generates a session-specific ephemeral signing key and encoded it in the SIWE message for the wallet to sign. This generated session key will delegate the wallet for future signings, once after wallet vouches it (by signing the CACAO).  Once the wallet has signed it and returned it to the dApp, the signature and message are encoded into a compact <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md">CACAO</a> session receipt for logging and forensic purposes (if needed).  Next the dApp lets the verifier know about the session, by POSTing the receipt to an endpoint (eg. <a href="https://github.com/centrehq/verite-minter-allowlist/blob/main/backend/src/index.js#L136">signIn</a>). The signed receipt also includes <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md#test-cases">caveats</a>, a domain-binding, an expiration, and other constraints to secure the delegation and the transfer of the session parameters.  The verifier saves the CACAO. The verifier only uses this CACAO in the scope of this verification session (to prove the VP signed by the ephemeral key). Once the CACAO verification step is completed, the session object will be updated.  Instead of sending the wallet to verify directly with the verifier (as in the previous post), the wallet will submit the VC directly to the dapp (or an agent/service it trusts). The dApp presents the prompt to verify.  Wallet submits the bare VC.  Subsequent requests from the dApp will include a reference to the session which the verifier can use if they need to check signatures made by that key. The VC(s) submitted by the dApp in this case will not be signed in a VP with the wallet’s key; instead, it/they will be put into a VP and signed by the dApp using the ephemeral key (the signing key mentioned in the first step above) delegated to it by the SIWE message. Introspection into the CACAO is required to extract the public key that signed the VP, as well as a signature from the wallet key over the public key.  When all the information is submitted to the verifier, the verifier needs to examine the ownership of the credential:  Extract the public key of the session signing key from the resources section of the CACAO  Use the public key of the session signing key to validate the VP’s signature. This is to ensure that the dApp properly (which held the key and got user consent to delegate signing rights to it) signed the VP and that it has not been tampered with in transport.  Compare <code>iss</code> in CACAO with the wallet’s DID in VC (in this case a did:pkh representing the wallet address as a long URI). They should match, if the dApp’s SIWE message. conforms to the SIWE specification. This is to check the wallet which vouched the session key is the subject (and holder) of the VC, which is also connected to the dApp with a signature over a nonce, included in the CACAO to keep future auditors from having to trust the verifier.     Conclusion:<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Circle’s implementation of the Verite protocol allows us to serve our customers and the dApps they interact with equally, putting the rigor of our KYC processes at the service of a process that is auditable and verifiable end-to-end without duplicating KYC process or PII from those processes across the chain of asset custody. We are proud to be driving the Verite process, and welcome more implementations, whether end-to-end issuer+verifier solutions like ours or more focused implementations that bring more wallets and more users into the ecosystem.</p><p>As the Centre team updates its documentation and sample implementation to reflect the new patterns and flows, we will continue to work with them to share the insights we are gaining from our exploratory work with dApps and clients.</p>

<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada has an incredible opportunity through DIACC and its highly respected member participants to create a trusted framework for Digital Identity that will drive the local economy and be recognized and leveraged globally. Canada is poised to be a role model in the global development of identity ecosystems.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>DIACC is creating the gold standard for Digital Identity in Canada. As the most highly respected association in the Canadian digital identity market, it makes sense that PXL Vision is part of such an organization. With PXL Vision now having a local presence in Canada, we are not only able to be a member but also to participate in the local Expert Committees to provide a global perspective from our Swiss-based experiences. PXL Vision is the technology behind the SwissID in Switzerland, and we are pleased to share best practices as Canadian provinces and the federal government digitize Canadian Government-issued IDs.</p>

<p>Following the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/w3cdidspec-2/">approval of the Decentralized Identifiers (DID) Core Spec</a> by the W3C as an official open web standard, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation </a>(DIF) announced the approval of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm v2 specification</a>. Combined, this represents a major step forward in the acceptance of decentralized identity, one that opens the path to widespread adoption and further development especially with regard to the types of peer-to-peer communication now possible.</p>
<p>DIDComm, short for Decentralized Identifier Communication, is a communications methodology that works with the decentralized design of DIDs to provide private, secure interaction. "Methodology" is used rather than method because it describes more than just a mechanism for individual or sequential messages. DIDComm defines how messages are composed into application-level protocols and workflows. Just as DIDs are a foundational element of decentralized identity by providing non-revocable identifiers, DIDComm provides secure communication between parties based on the service endpoints and keys present in a DID Document.</p>
<p>DIDComm provides the next step in decentralized identity: direct, secure communication between the owners of DIDs. Currently, APIs are the norm for communicating with online services; however, APIs favor those with the ability to provide highly-available online services; they are ill-suited to peer-to-peer cases where the endpoints are not highly available and the infrastructure costs must be low. In contrast, DIDComm enables peer-to-peer interaction with computers, phones, and even IoT devices.</p>
<p>The protocol derives its security properties independently of the transport being used. The privacy and security guarantees are the same whether using HTTPS, or websockets, or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transport.</p>
<p>By removing architectural barriers, DIDComm-based protocols return individuals and small companies to first-class citizen status on the Internet, a state largely lost via the expansion of large social media platforms and the rise of APIs as a primary integration method.</p>
<p>Version 1 of DIDComm started in the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">HyperlLedger Aries project</a> and resulted in full community adoption. Version 2 of DIDComm (also called DIDComm Messaging) began at the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) as parties outside the HL Aries community became interested in and started working collaboratively on the protocol. The [DIF DIDComm working group]((<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html</a>) is responsible for the numerous improvements and simplifications that now form DIDComm v2.</p>
<p>DIDComm v2 has now reached DIF Approved Status, joining <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1/">SideTree spec</a> as a complete and approved open-source specification. DIDComm v2 is now ready for development, with planned adoption by the HyperLedger Aries community. The DIDComm spec and "What's New in DIDComm v2" section links are below, along with some explainer videos to help those wishing to understand more.</p>
<p>While the initial spec work may be done, there are plenty of ways to get involved with the ongoing work of the DIDComm community. The <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Sdw8swxpDJ">DIDComm Users Group</a> is open to all, and a great place to get started with using DIDComm and asking questions: Join the conversation on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Sdw8swxpDJ">Discord</a>. This group is working on the creation of the "DIDComm Book," which is available in a live version here: <a href="https://didcomm.org/book/v2/">https://didcomm.org/book/v2/</a></p>

<p>There has been much hype about the Metaverse, a vision for our digital future that's increasingly merging with Web3's. For this article, let's sidestep attempts by Facebook, ahem Meta, or NFT tribes to stake their claim to the Metaverse. We think of the Metaverse as the entirety of all composable and interoperable resources, identities, applications, platforms, services, and protocols that exist in cyberspace.</p><p>Our vision of the Metaverse will run on the Dataverse: a composable, web-scale data ecosystem—owned by everyone and no one. Developers will build interchangeable interfaces and online experiences that directly interact with the Dataverse and the composable data that lives there. The Dataverse will play arguably the most important role within the Metaverse: a shared, high-performance, always-available graph of all data created and used by all applications</p><p>Most features on the web are just data rather than monetary value transactions. For example, the DeFiverse would refer to the universe of interoperable financial protocols, assets, and applications; but, just think about the applications you use on a daily basis. How many times do you click, ‘send’, or ‘like’ compared to ‘buy’ or ‘transfer’? In the Dataverse, your data follows you around from app to app, putting you at the center and in control of your own digital universe.</p><p>Over the next five years we will see a massive explosion in the developer market and a full integration of permissionless protocols into the mainstream development stack, giving rise to a billion networked applications that run and interoperate on shared, composable backend infrastructures. That’s an app for every 10 people on the planet.</p><p>We’d like to take you on a tour of the Dataverse—how we navigate from the data silos of today’s Web2 apps and the data desert of today’s Web3 apps—to a future where everyone in the world is building applications and they’re all doing it on the same networked, composable data layer.</p> The Golden Era for Application Development <p>The route to that interoperable Metaverse depends on enabling developers. The next five years will be the golden age of application development.</p> Everyone’s an App ‘Developer’ <p>Application development is going to become so accessible that five years from now it will be possible for anyone in the world, regardless of location, technical ability or education level, to build and launch an application on the internet. Basically everyone will be able to be a “developer.” For example, even a non-technical journalism student will be able to launch a fully-featured, crowd-sourced intelligence forum in a few hours.</p> Bye, bye, backend. <p>The trend of everything-as-a-service will have abstracted much or all of the backend application development logic away, allowing front-end developers to launch zero-infrastructure applications. These infrastructures could be provided by either decentralized networks or managed service providers.</p> Open, Shared Platforms <p>By this time, decentralized permissionless networks will be widely adopted by the mid- and long-tail of application developers, with some forward-leaning Web2 companies joining in on the fun as well. The primary benefit of building on these platforms is that, in addition to providing zero-infrastructure deployments, it makes cooperation and interoperability within the Metaverse feasible. This solves a lot of traditional application development challenges including centralized platform risk (read: Twitter shutters API, Facebook shuts game developers out of its platform), onboarding new users, bootstrapping content, building network effects, creating delightful user experiences, etc.</p> Copy/Paste Frontend <p>There are two primary trends driving the minimization of front-end development. First, low/no code solutions are doing a good job of making it easy for non-technical folk to create an app. Second, by nature of building on open platforms and users desiring increased transparency, more application code is getting open sourced than ever before at an accelerating rate. Combined with zero-infrastructure backends this means that basically every application is available to be inspected in its entirety, sampled, forked, cloned, remixed, modified, and redeployed. Creating applications becomes so easy that it looks more like copy/pasting others’ front-end code or dropping modular pieces that work together onto a canvas.</p> Global Access, Equal Opportunity <p>Connectivity will have improved around the world through the rollout of satellite-based over-the-top 3G+ internet delivery, causing a new generation of developers to come online for the first time. This connects more people over cyberspace, and gives the inclined more incentive to create something in a global market. The web will be filled with free educational material—all it will take is a little curiosity and initiative.</p> Powerful Incentives and Direct Rewards <p>Given two ways of building the same thing, all else equal, people would want to work on the one with the most upside. Web3 provides powerful native participation and builder incentives that are compelling and directly accessible to developers of all backgrounds. Large tech companies will struggle to compete for talent, as the upside potential of going from 0 to 1 on your own (or joining a Web3 rocketship) will far outweigh the draw for working at a company like Amazon. The Metaverse as a whole will outcompete for talent.</p> Power to the People <p>The organizing principle of the Metaverse will be the individual. When developers build on this shared application architecture, because it is better for their application (user-centric composability), it coincidentally unlocks a new world for end-users where they can reclaim control over their digital identity and begin to experience the web as if every application was built specifically for them and their data was magically everywhere they wanted it to be.</p> Self Agency and Determinism <p>In the Metaverse, individuals have a choice. Based on foundations of public key cryptography, users in the Metaverse begin their life—no permission needed—as a simple, self-sovereign, pseudonymous keypair. From there, they can decide who they want to be. They can allow someone else to control their identity for them. They can be their own bank and take self-custody. They can begin to attach as much or as little data as they want. They can set permissions for who can do what with their data under which conditions. This level of digital ownership and self-agency is how the Metaverse can stay independent and remain secure.</p><p>But self-sovereignty doesn’t stop at an account. Users will also have trusted independent infrastructure for keeping their data around for the long-term so they never have to rely on someone else.</p> The Magic of Interoperability <p>If one of the primary draws to building in the Metaverse is interoperability, then applications are naturally incentivized to adopt the minimum foundational standards needed to enable this interoperability. The easiest and most intuitive way for interoperability to be achieved is through adopting a user-centric architecture. In this model, the user acts as the nexus of data interoperability between different applications; wherever they go, so does their data.</p><p>For end users, the experience of interoperability feels magical—like how the internet should work. No more passwords, forms, verifications, reposting content, refollowing the same person across platforms.</p> An explosion of Knowledge, Science, and Human Progress <p>As a public resource, the Dataverse will enable an explosion of shared knowledge and accelerate science and human progress. The original use case for Internet 1.0 was sharing scientific databases between California and Massachusetts. Web 3.0 is going to take that idea and supercharge it.</p><p>Until now, semantic web and linked data implementations, which are good for information graphs, have really only been deployed in production within the internal systems of the largest companies and institutions in the world such as Google. They’re hard to build and require many of the brightest minds.</p><p>The Dataverse will provide simple, open access to a graph of semantically-defined, structured data that takes the most cutting edge research and allows everyone to build and collaborate on it. While the implications of the progress that can be made when we can connect the entire scientific community on one unified verifiable data platform cannot be overstated, we don’t need to go into unnecessary forward-looking predictions on what that might ultimately look like.</p> The Creativity of a Billion Networked Applications <p>What can be known is the diversity, creativity, ingenuity, and innovation that will be unleashed when everyone in the world is building applications and they’re all doing it on the same networked, composable data layer—let’s refer to this network that supports the Dataverse as a platform.</p><p>As more developers are joining the platform, and more data exists on the platform, it will become even easier for developers to create applications. The startup costs drop to near zero. This allows for a diversity of implementations and experiments that add resilience and allow Darwinism to chart the path forward. It allows developers to hack scalable microapplications together in a few minutes and focus on product-market fit instead of taking weeks to ship a hacky monolith. It provides a new vector to allow everyone-but-Facebook-or-Google to compete with Facebook and Google. The pace and ingenuity of the bazaar, in this case, will outpace the cathedrals.</p> Big Bets <p>A few trends that define the Dataverse and the future of the web.</p> Web3 Applications Explode With Data Functionality <p>The Web3 developer market, containing collaborative groups of value-aligned innovators/early adopters (some of which are already building in other parts of the Metaverse), will be first to adopt the Dataverse. To date, Web3 applications have been data deserts. This makes sense, as there’s only so much data functionality you can build with smart contracts.</p><p>This trend is changing and will continue at an accelerating rate as the market becomes more crowded/mature and applications look for new vistas for innovation. As the market demand picks up for building data features and applications begin cooperating over large data sets, the network effects of the Dataverse will quickly accelerate and the Web3 application market will be flush with data-powered features. Others beyond this market will notice the ecosystem and be compelled to join it.</p> Interoperable Ecosystems Will Outcompete Siloed Platforms <p>The perfect cocktail is brewing for the Metaverse to outcompete even the largest, most entrenched institutions. No one will want to build their own application on an island anymore or for big companies. The simplicity, creativity, pace of innovation, speed of development, open data, and rewards that are available in the Metaverse will be too strong. The incumbents who have already built their business on an entirely different incentive structure will find it tough to pivot or compete.</p> Identity Emerges From Needs of Communities and is the Organizing Principle of the Dataverse <p>Identity is inherently multiplayer. This is true not only in the physical world, where it began as a construct enabling human-to-human interactions, but also in the digital world where it’s more important to have a profile on a social media application than it is to have on your personal note-taking application. Identity is a tool for providing context, trust, and efficiency to transactions. By providing an inherently multi-player data ecosystem, Ceramic is a platform that we can expect to generate a widely-adopted identity system that can serve to provide greater interoperability to the Metaverse.</p> The Effectiveness and Sustainability of Digital Communities <p>Less technical and more sustainability related, we’re betting on the fact that strangers on the internet, unified by a community-owned protocol and its inherent incentives, can effectively organize and create high-impact work with high efficiency. Although this trend has positive indications, it still stands to be seen if these communities can sustain themselves over the long term or if they can stay innovative and keep speed high. The design and implementation of effective digital communities is something we’re keeping a close eye on, but we also believe that a lot of what will make communities successful over the long term has yet to be discovered.</p><p>Some people have gone full degen into “working for the internet” as a contributor to protocols and DAOs, picking up one-off tasks or engaging in longer contracts. We already have participants in DAOs lobbying in front of congress. DAOs are legally recognized meatspace entities in Wyoming. Digital communities have long been used for OSINT (open-source intelligence), where groups of highly-motivated strangers come together on topic-based platforms such as subreddits or Facebook groups to do things that any single person (or government agency) couldn’t—such as crowdsourcing villains or solving investigations. Wikipedia runs beautifully. These are all things that make me optimistic about how this fluid work and incentive system will evolve over time.</p><p>There are positive indications that these communities are beginning to cross the chasm into mainstream, which only deepens their tentacles into society making them more resilient. Bored Ape Yacht Club basically has every celebrity with an ape as their Twitter profile picture; Alexis Ohanian and Serena Williams wore pins of their CryptoPunks to the Met Gala. These digital-first communities will spill into every aspect of society with influencers and celebrities sporting their flair and representing their tribe.</p><p>To get a sense of where Web3 (as opposed to NFTs) will cross into mainstream culture, we should look at where there exist networks of highly-engaged, multiplayer user bases/communities, what it means to be a member of that community, and how people fly their flag.</p> Ceramic: Decentralized Infrastructure for Building on the Dataverse <p>Although the market may be primed for the Dataverse, it doesn’t necessarily mean it will emerge organically. The best developer platform for building applications in the Dataverse requires a few key design considerations.</p> General-Purpose Data Protocol <p>Data is highly varied, and developers need freedom and flexibility to build their applications and data use cases. Rigid standards won't work, or will lead to fragmentation. We need a highly-generalized protocol that is capable of supporting the diversity of use cases that will emerge from the Dataverse. It’s important that all these use cases seamlessly interact and the easiest way is to have them building on the same protocols. It shouldn’t matter which wallet users log in with or what feature you’re building on the front end or what type of data you want to store; it should all just work.</p> Fast, Decentralized, High-Volume Processing <p>This general purpose data protocol needs to support mutability with fast, decentralized, high-volume transaction processing simply for the fact that there are so many data events occurring all day, every day, in every application. Current blockchain protocols cannot scale to support this level of processing and this is a strong area of differentiation. Data consensus properties, like Ceramic’s, can be treated differently than value consensus properties, like Bitcoin’s.</p> Globally-Consistent, Always-Available State <p>Next, it’s important that the system has a way to provide participants with a highly available state that can be trustlessly verified and reconstructed from the underlying event streams. This is critical, because it’s actually what allows developers to build permissionless, composable applications on shared data. The availability of state can be ensured by anyone who plugs into the underlying event streams, as updates are published through this system all participants can immediately update their state database.</p><p>Related to global state availability is state representation. Ceramic currently supports state outputs in the form of simple JSON objects and a native indexing system, which is good for graph-based application use cases. The protocol should be able to adapt and support different state representations based on the optimizations required by the data structures better suited to these use cases. This can be achieved by plugging into the event streaming layer of Ceramic and building custom databases on top.</p> Object-Oriented Permissions <p>Every piece of data in the Dataverse should be verifiable, secure, and useful—not spam or bits of data that clog up the network. By using a protocol for decentralized, cryptographic, object-oriented permissions, we can give decentralized identities provable agency over their data while allowing the access permissions for each state (or even nested/recursive/chained permissions to groups of states) to be completely customizable.</p><p>For example, users can grant their therapist, their school counselor, and their best friend permanent access to their diary. Or someone can give an application the ability to update a state on their behalf for the duration of a session. It can also be natively integrated with the different cryptographic authentication systems used within developers’ applications (e.g. sign in with Ethereum). It’s important that we collaborate with other Dataverse protocols and services to adopt the same permissioning standard so that we can achieve maximal interoperability. In a lot of ways, the more robust, developed, and flexible the permissions protocol is, the less important it is to tie an identity to any single key.</p><p>We should also expect a lot of innovation from the developer ecosystem in the area of permissioning writes and reads within the network. We’re already seeing experimentation along these lines with programmatic permissions protocols. Examples include hosted custodial agents or “personal data managers” or something like “credit bureaus” for managing permissions for users’ data. We should encourage all kinds of diversity, especially early on.</p> Fast, Expressive, Network-Wide Queries <p>Whenever a user logs into an application with their wallet, that application needs to gather data about that user from the Dataverse. When an application wants to fetch a single state that they already somehow know the identifier of—that’s easy. But application developers need much more data retrieval capability than fetching content using its specific machine-readable identifier.</p><p>When this application is multi-player, such as a social network, developers need to gather data sets from across users to display in one interface. This type of data retrieval functionality is core to almost any application, and is especially core to the ones that are most valuable to the data ecosystem as a whole. When the identifiers of the users are known, this can be done by looking at each user’s index of their data that exists in the Dataverse and then pulling in that data. This supposes the existence of a protocol for such a user-centric index, whether physically stored as a single list somewhere in the Dataverse, or maintained using metadata and an indexing service.</p><p>Applications, however, don’t always have the full picture about a user—a wallet address alone doesn't tell the full story. Context can be gained by looking at the broader social graph of communities where the user participated in or rankings in games.</p><p>Developers who build on Ceramic will have the ability to use indexing and querying to pull in opt-in data from users in other apps in the Ceramic ecosystem.</p><p>Ceramic will soon offer a graph database that will enable developers to explore those ties from any of their user's accounts to a stream of data, e.g. all blog posts. But in further iterations, Ceramic will allow relationships between any account, model, and data stream related to model. This will allow infinitely complex queries across the Dataverse.</p> Open Marketplace of Data Models <p>The Dataverse demands interoperability. This is achieved with emergent consensus on data models. Data models on Ceramic are similar to ERC contract standards in Ethereum—e.g. ERC20 for tokens, ERC721 for NFTs—which are basically the equivalent of features for Ceramic. This makes it easy for any developer to just choose from a pre-existing set of feature templates, add a few lines of code to their frontend, and have an app that can access all data sets in the Dataverse that also conform to the same data model.</p><p>The community can build out and curate the biggest universe of data models in the world. The most powerful way to create enough good standards for this to become a vibrant marketplace is by giving the community ownership and upside.</p> Developer Community <p>The Dataverse is owned by no one, and everyone. It’s the output of a community all working toward building creative, networked applications that result in creating a valuable resource for the world. This big project can only be successful if there is a large, engaged community behind it.</p><p>Community members can help with building out the developer tooling and stack ecosystem, growth and influencing, creating educational content, network operations, etc. We have to deliberately consider the incentives of all ecosystem participants so we can maximally deploy this community for good.</p> Path Forward <p>We will start by focusing on delivering data-rich application capabilities to advanced Web3 developers building in highly-networked application ecosystems using data models—the market and use cases most primed for Ceramic. Each phase will look to the previous for a signal on what infrastructure to use and how to build, that’s why full focus on today’s innovators is so important.</p> Unmet Needs of Web3 Developers <p>The Metaverse is emerging from the foundation paved by blockchain; it possesses all the right conditions mentioned earlier to make it a flourishing, vibrant interoperable application ecosystem. Web3 developers are already building applications on blockchain, and a lot of them are looking to differentiate and mature their product by expanding into data.</p> Reputation Features <p>Reputation features are needed across many different Web3 multi-player applications, decentralized protocols, social communities, and span everything from a profile, to assets I can prove to own (NFTs, domain names, social handles), to experience (self-asserted and attested skills trees), to contribution tracking, to KYC VCs (verifiable credentials).</p><p>Some of these use cases include VCs, many do not. Within this set, Ceramic can serve public and ephemerally private data use cases. Fully private use cases should be stored encrypted on an access-controlled server that ideally uses IPLD and CACAO so it can natively interoperate with the data on Ceramic—something like Kepler from Spruce Systems.</p><p>Over the longer term, this collection of data sets will function like one’s identity and passport within the Metaverse. The stakes are high. For example, the future of DeFi is very much in flux until reputation and credentials are figured out.</p> Social Features <p>Social is very hot now in Web3 and a lot of momentum is building around the decentralized social graph and decentralized social media. We see an expansion of the traction and experiments from Orbis, Convo, and CyberConnect, into different iterations and experimentations. These may come in the form of full-blown decentralized social networks, or social features embedded within other applications. Expect social graphs, feeds and posts (blogs, microblogs, etc), reactions, private and public groups, DMs, forums, address books.</p> Account Features <p>Many applications and protocols are asking themselves how to identify a user when they have many different wallets or accounts. This is becoming more important for Web3 applications that are integrating more and more Metaverse protocols into a single application. Maintaining that user object with all the mappings becomes cumbersome and is extremely prone to implementation error. There are a certain set of data features that can be explored for different models of creating an aggregated identity for users in the multi-account, cross-chain (MACC) Metaverse.</p> The Best Has Yet to Come <p>The best has yet to come for the internet. The Metaverse will be the biggest breakthrough in application development over the last 25 years, and it will replace the cloud as the application environment of choice.</p><p>In order to unlock the full potential of the Dataverse, there needs to be interoperability. This type of composable, interoperable data network will be the catalyst for a new wave of innovation that not only reshapes the way we build applications but also how we share knowledge, invent science, and progress as a society. This is the world we are building toward with Ceramic.</p><p>To start building with Ceramic, check out our<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/getting-started-with-ceramic/"> guide</a> or join the<a href="https://chat.ceramic.network/"> Discord</a>!</p>

 Our easy-to-repeat workshop for The Badge Summit&nbsp;2022! <p>In early August 2022, at <a href="https://thebadgesummit.com">The Badge Summit</a>, we’re <a href="https://badgesummit22.sched.com/event/13q6M/dream-makers-lounge-keep-badges-weird-helping-people-understand-the-badges-landscape?iframe=yes&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no">running a workshop</a> related to <a href="https://badges.community">Keep Badges Weird</a>. This is an emerging Community of Practice exploring the badges landscape and helping people understand that badges are more than just credentials.</p><p>In this session, we’re using an organising metaphor of co-creating pizza toppings to delve into how to design an equitable, emergent badge system that works for Communities of Practice. We want the session to be accessible to those who can’t make it to Boulder, Colorado for The Badge Summit, and so created this resource for them to be able to participate remotely!</p><p>You may find this resource useful as a starting point for workshops you run. The aim is to create an inclusive, welcoming space to help people move beyond individual badges as credentials, and towards a system of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>.</p><p>This resource is licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) licence</a>, as is the accompanying <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gxuBP7oZbphwgkYWX0VMEWoS3xg_DpHIrJiAUbhmLHI/edit">slide deck</a> (apart from Bryan Mathers’ images, which are <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC BY-ND</a>). We encourage you to remix these resources for your own purposes!</p> Aims of the&nbsp;workshop <p>By the end of the session, participants should be able&nbsp;to:</p>  Explain the difference between credentialing and recognition  Demonstrate the hallmarks of an inclusive badge system for Communities of&nbsp;Practice  Reflect on their own assumptions and experience using the pizza&nbsp;metaphor   Check in &amp; Intro (15&nbsp;min) <p>To break the ice, and to encourage participants to ‘lean forward’ rather than ‘lean back’ as the session begins, start with a question. Turning to the person sitting next to them*, participants should discuss and answer the following question&nbsp;prompts:</p>  If you really knew me you know&nbsp;that….  If you could learn any skill, what would it&nbsp;be?  What is one of the nicest things a person has done for&nbsp;you?  <p>The aim of this part of the session is to allow those who arrive slightly late not to feel like an inconvenience, to get people talking, and to create a welcoming atmosphere.</p><p>As the facilitator, indicate when time is up, and get people to share out either their own answers to the question, or other people’s that they found interesting.</p><p>Then introduce yourself and other facilitators, and go on to explain that this session is about Communities of Practice, systems of Open Badges, and Open Recognition. Go through a couple of slides explaining what Open Recognition is using images and the definition:</p><blockquote>“Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.” (<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">What is Open Recognition, anyway?</a>)</blockquote><p>Explain that we’re going to use metaphors, and in particular a pizza metaphor to help people gently leave their comfort zone and examine their practice from a different perspective.</p><p>*if you are running this session remotely, the facilitator should put people into breakout rooms of three rather than two, to help participants feel&nbsp;safe.</p> Make a Pizza (20&nbsp;min) <p>Encourage participants to get into groups of four.* You and your 3 friends are having a pizza together. Don’t overthink just make one. How is it going to look? Either provide your own paper-based materials, or use <a href="https://app.mural.co/template/e8f6ec36-13f4-4599-89bb-d6a3e83354a6/c3848ce8-f372-4cbc-b79d-1e043e363bd2">this Mural board as a template</a> to co-create your&nbsp;pizza!</p><p>Once participants have created their pizzas, bring the room back together and have a look at them together. Ask why they created them this way. Answers will range from taste preferences, to dividing out the pizza&nbsp;equally.</p><p>Reflect that in order to build the pizza together, the groups needed to talk about individual needs, work together and design a solution. Explain that they were a Community of Practice in Pizza building!</p><p>Show participants the slides demonstrating linear, cluster, and freeform ways of laying out pizza ingredients. Make the point that none of them designed linear pizza toppings, so why design linear badge systems? Make the point that in a Community of Practice the co-creation of a badge system helps decentralise power by giving community members a seat at the&nbsp;table.</p><p>Reiterate that working together allowed them as individuals to integrate their personal needs and expectations into the pizza. Make the point that some people needed a particular topping, while others may have been willing to sacrifice their preference for the good of the&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Explain that if we understand the ingredients as a metaphor for different types of badges, then an useful, inclusive, successful badge system includes all kinds of elements: membership, participation, capability, and&nbsp;mastery.</p><p>Take questions, but remind them that this is just a metaphor and therefore being used to illustrate a point about keeping badge (systems) weird! Show other metaphors, such as stepping stones, Trivial Pursuit segments, and constellations of&nbsp;stars.</p><p>*if you are running this session remotely, you can either put people back into their groups of three, or re-create the rooms to be groups of&nbsp;four.</p> Discussion: Open Recognition Pathways Pizza (15&nbsp;mins) <p>Ask participants to return to discuss in their groups* what kind of metaphors they might use to help one another, and their colleagues, understand the importance of recognition as well as credentialing.</p>  How could they change some of their current practices to include Open Recognition?  How could they make co-designing badge systems more inclusive?  How could they ensure badge systems are emergent within their Communities of Practice?  <p>After 10 minutes of discussion, allow participants to come back and share one thing they’ve learned back to the wider group. Allow people to respond to other people’s points if it’s useful for the majority of people in the&nbsp;room.</p><p>*if you are running this session remotely, put people back in their breakout room for this activity.</p> Wrap-up and next steps (10&nbsp;mins) <p>Finally, invite people to continue the conversation by showing ways they can get involved in the <a href="https://badges.community">Keep Badges Weird community</a>. Show badges that can be earned through membership and participation in the community, as well as for levelling up skills and knowledge around Communities of Practice and Open&nbsp;Badges.</p><p>If you’ve already prepared it, allow participants to claim their “I Kept Badges Weird at X” badge, either using a claim code, or by issuing the badge using their email address. You can download image files to edit to create your own version of the badge from this <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iDrX5_APJ-glMDahziKVB_9YLJOfGU79?usp=sharing">Google Drive&nbsp;folder</a>.</p><p>Stick around to chat to people who might be super-enthused by the ideas stimulated during the workshop, and provide easy ways to keep in touch. Congratulations, you’re done!

<p>Aotearoa’s first&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;is taking place on Wednesday. While the event alone is significant enough, this month let’s look at&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/programme/">the programme</a>&nbsp;in more detail to consider what it might offer up in terms of the future for digital identity in New Zealand and around the world. To help with context, I offered my perspective on some emerging trends in the form of a&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2022/07/15/leading-the-digital-trust-conversation/">Q&amp;A here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have been blessed with quite simply an extraordinary array of speakers bringing their expertise and experience from their respective backgrounds and perspectives. We have been privileged to have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rikiconsultancy.co.nz/">Janelle Riki-Waaka</a>&nbsp;Chair the conference whose deep understanding of te ao Māori and its application to digital trust is unassailable. She is supported by a diverse cross section of experts from the public and private sectors. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/minister/biography/david-clark">Hon Dr David Clark</a>&nbsp;follows the Chair’s opening remarks, and we will be listening for any insights regarding the range of legislation proposed under his watch, the most important of those to us at&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity NZ</a>&nbsp;being the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/whole.html#LMS459679">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) Bill</a>&nbsp;which has entered its Second Reading.&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/speaker/tamara-al-salim/">Tamara Al Salim</a>&nbsp;from NZDF (also Women in Identity’s New Zealand&nbsp;country ambassador) is next with the Opening Keynote – Trust in the Aotearoa context – followed by two panels playing forward the Trust theme inwards to developing more domestic capability and outwards to ask the question ‘Is Trust an exportable asset?’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discussion over lunch however is bound to revolve around globally acclaimed UK speaker David Birch and his take on that amorphous concept, the Metaverse and whether Identity has anything to do with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dave is joined at the event by an Australian trio of speakers each with very different perspectives. Internationally acknowledged identerati aficionado&nbsp;<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/about/">Steve Wilson</a>, will beam in with his view into the future as to how all the ‘infostructural’ pieces might fit together, while Gold Sponsor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.okta.com/au/">Okta’s</a>&nbsp;April George will offer practical tips for implementing Zero Trust in organisations large and small. From the public sector across the Tasman, we are looking forward to an update from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/digital-identity">DTA</a>&nbsp;on the operationally more advanced but legislatively further behind Australian equivalent to New Zealand’s DISTF – the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/tdif#:~:text=Trusted%20Digital%20Identity%20Framework%20The%20Trusted%20Digital%20Identity,templates%20to%20support%20providers%20to%20meet%20TDIF%20requirements.">TDIF</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Australian showings will be more than matched by the locals. Silver Sponsor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nec.co.nz/">NEC NZ</a>&nbsp;co-presenters Steven Graham and Graham Prentice will focus on current best practice, specifically in the field of Biometrics, followed by Lightning Rounds from Kiwi startups<a href="https://frankly.ai/">&nbsp;FranklyAI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://jnctn.nz/">JNCTN</a>, while&nbsp;<a href="https://ahau.io/">Ahau’s</a>&nbsp;Kaye-Maree Dunn will provide perspectives on the user as the key stakeholder. The finale will feature representatives from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dia.govt.nz/For-people-and-businesses">DIA</a>&nbsp;leaving us with plenty to think about over drinks regarding the role of standards as the ultimate connector in this Hui’s range of topics alongside&nbsp;DIA’s overall reflections.</p>



<p>There’s audience participation planned too. To help the digestion of lunch, an hour’s Roundtable Discussion will begin the afternoon sessions, where delegates choose two topics from a range of options and meet with like-minded individuals, moderated by a Hui speaker or panellist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All up, the Hui Tumata is set to be insightful and thought-provoking, guaranteeing that delegates come away more informed and knowledgeable.&nbsp; See you there!</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi nui,</p>



<p>Colin and the DINZ Executive Council</p>

<p>Since Verite’s original release, we’ve gotten feedback from development partners and the broader community about which patterns are useful and where guidance could be improved. Some themes include:</p>  Persistence of verification results to on-chain registries is over-emphasized.  Verite’s current <a href="https://verite.id/verite/patterns/verification-flow">verification flow documentation</a> assumes that Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are stored in wallets that support decentralized identity protocols, which are currently somewhat scarce in the market.  <p>Upcoming Verite releases (including code and documentation) will address these concerns as follows:</p>  A forthcoming editorial revision of Verite documentation will explicitly describe a variant of the subject-submission patterns without any on-chain persistence.  A coming release will include code and documentation demonstrating how more of today’s wallets can participate in VC flows in a standardized way, until DIDs become more common.  <p>In this two-part blog series, we’ll preview these updates. This post (Part 1) includes an overview of options for the use of off-chain VCs to support on-chain decision-making, including subject-submission without on-chain persistence. This begins with a summary of core concepts and principles of Verite. Readers already familiar can skip ahead to the "Two Phases of Verification" section for an overview of the new flow being added to the Verite docs and pioneered by Circle’s implementation. After this new end-to-end pattern for Verite is outlined, a more analytical "Discussion" section follows.</p><p>The second post in the series will zoom in on how wallets that do not currently support sufficient functionality for emerging decentralized identity patterns can be "retrofitted” and supplemented to support Verite’s off-chain verifications like those described in this post.</p> Verification Concepts <p>If you’re new to Verite, or want a reminder, this section describes how Verite credential verification works off-chain to support smart contracts with maximum privacy around sensitive identifying information.</p> Roles<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The following entities are involved in the Verite credential verification process:</p>  Crypto wallet: aka "payment wallet”, controls a blockchain address; may be browser or mobile, hosted or self-hosted.  Credential wallet: aka "identity wallet”, stores and shares VCs, controls a "DID” (meta-wallet identifier). Some or all of these functional roles may be subsumed into a crypto wallet or a trusted dapp, or this entity may be completely distinct software, depending on flow and trust model.  Verifier: aka the "verifier service” or "verifier endpoint” that consumes a privacy-preserving, off-chain token (a verifiable credential) on behalf of a dApp. It can be operated by the dApp or a trusted partner but in either case it needs to be previously known to and trusted by the dApp at a static address.  dApp: decides which verifiers to trust; the dApp frontend is responsible for triggering the verification process; the dApp backend is responsible for on-chain validation  On-chain verification registry (optional): depending on the implementation choices, dApps may rely on on-chain storage of verification results. This may be part of the dApp or a separate registry accessible by other parties. For simplicity, we’ll assume the former case in this blog.   Verification Result<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>A Verification Result enables a "verified” crypto wallet – that is, a wallet whose controller has proven possession of a valid VC that has passed a dApp-trusted-verifier’s verification process – to interact on-chain.</p><p>You can think of a Verification Result as the result of slicing and dicing a VC, potentially obfuscated, with an attached proof from the Verifier. The Verification Result structure in Verite’s reference implementation includes the following fields, returned along with the Verifier’s cryptographic signature:</p>  subject: identifies the wallet address  schema: indicates the kind of credential (flexible according to the implementation)  expiration: a number that is less than or equal to the expiration value in the VC.  <p>The Verification Result may be extended to include additional fields, which could be carried over identically or fuzzed/obfuscated in some way (which is especially relevant if using on-chain storage).</p>   <code>export type VerificationResult = {<br>  schema: string<br>  subject: string  // address<br>  expiration: number<br>}<br></code>      Verifier vs Subject Submission<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Verite’s implementation demonstrates two possible methods of submitting Verification Results to smart contracts; or in other words:</p>  Verifier-submitted: the verifier submits the Verification Result and signature directly to the smart contract immediately after verification.  Subject-submitted: the verifier returns the Verification Result and signature to the subject (or an entity or code acting on the subject’s behalf) who then submits the signed Verification Result to the smart contract.   Verification Principles <p>While verifications can be carried out using a variety of methods, all are expected conform to the following principles:</p>  Trusted issuer principle: the credential was issued by one of a list of trusted issuers.  Credential ownership principle: The crypto wallet that owns (i.e. can prove themselves to be the subject of) the credential is the one making the DeFi transaction request, regardless of whether the credential itself is held and presented by a separate piece of hardware (i.e. whether the credential wallet and the crypto wallet are distinct)  Trusted verifier principle: The verifier that provides verification is on the allowlist of verifiers already trusted by the dApp.  <p>The fact that all Verified Credentials are signed by their self-identifying issuers makes the first criteria simple: issuers’ public keys can be obtained from the identifiers listed in a registry of trusted issuers, and their signatures can be checked against them at verification time. In this way, the verifier enforces the trusted issuer principle.</p><p>DApps, in turn, uphold the trusted verifier principle, deciding which verifiers they trust to verify VCs – including standard VCs checks (non-revocation, tamper-free) and any other fitness-for-purpose checks (such as subsetting valid Verite credentials according to additional constraints on issuers or <a href="https://verite.id/blog/crossfunctionationality">KYC processes</a>).</p><p>Enforcement of the credential ownership principle will vary depending on how the crypto wallet relates to the credential wallet. In this post, we’ll describe how this works with a distinct decentralized identity wallet controlled by the same actor as a crypto wallet; in the next, we’ll describe how crypto-wallets-only actors may be accommodated.</p> Two Phases of Verification <p>Verite’s <a href="https://verite.id/verite/patterns/smart-contract-verite">Smart Contract Patterns</a> documentation describes the two-phase process of how smart contracts can require successful verification of VCs. To summarize:</p>  Phase 1: "Off-chain” verification by a verifier, based on traditional web or API stacks, resulting in a lightweight "Verification Result” object.  Phase 2: On-chain validation of the Verification Result, which is optionally persisted on-chain in private, obfuscated, or opaque form referred to as a "Verification Record”.  <p></p><p>The two-phase process enables the use of VCs with chain-based applications for which verification operations are not technically possible and/or economically practical. More importantly, this reduces (by construction) the amount of potentially sensitive data sent on-chain. All examples that follow will refer to main-net Ethereum, but all these patterns should be replicable on all major chains, availing themselves of further privacy or obfuscation techniques where supported.</p><p>The subsequent sections discuss these phases and variations. This first post in the two-part series assumes a decentralized identity wallet, and the next will cover other options.</p> Phase 1: Off-chain Verification <p>Assuming a Decentralized Identity+Crypto Wallet</p><p></p>  <p>The wallet initiates a DeFi transaction with a dApp.</p>  <p>The dApp (frontend) chooses a trusted verifier to start the verification process.</p>  <p>The verifier responds to the wallet, telling it how to start the process<a>1</a> through the dApp.</p>  <p>The wallet chooses one of the credentials stored locally and submits it to the verifier.</p>  <p>The verifier confirmed the credential’s signature and the validity of its contents. The dApp retrieves (via callback or polling) confirmation.</p>  <p>DApp unlocks the subsequent DeFi transaction flow.</p>   Ownership verification<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>In step 4, when the wallet submits the credential, the wallet wraps the VC with a Verifiable Presentation (VP) and signs it. When the verifier receives the credential, it uses the Decentralized Identifier (DID) – for example, <code>did:key:&lt;public_key&gt;</code><a>2</a> – listed as <code>holder</code> in the VP to verify the JWT’s signature (made from the corresponding private key). It also compares this DID in the VP with the DID listed as <code>credentialSubject.id</code> in the VC, i.e. the public key that the credential was issued against. Those two checks guarantee the wallet, submitting the credentials, was the same wallet that the issuer intended, and thus rightly owns it.</p> Phase 2: Validation and use in smart contracts <p>The second phase of verification covers how a Verification Result gets used as a prerequisite to on-chain interaction.</p> Validating a Verification Result<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Along with a verification result, a smart contract will receive a signature on the result, allowing them to confirm that the result was provided by an authorized party, as described <a href="https://verite.id/verite/patterns/smart-contract-verite#verification-results">here</a>.</p> On-chain storage of Verification Results (or not)<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>We’ll look at 3 cases below. With the verifier-submitted pattern, the verifier always stores the Verification Result on-chain. With subject-submission, the Verification Result may or may not be stored on-chain, depending on the implementation.</p> Case 1: Verifier-submitted verification result, stored on-chain<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>With the verifier-submitted approach, the verifier stores the Verification Result on-chain after verification.</p><p>We’ll cover step 1.5 later; this is relevant for subsequent interactions with a dApp when on-chain storage is used.</p><p></p> Case 2: Subject-submitted verification result, stored on-chain<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The subject-submitted approach also supports persistence, as determined by the implementor. Like the verifier-submitted case, in subsequent interactions, the dApp will be able to determine that the wallet is already registered.</p><p>We’ll cover step 1.5 later; this is relevant for subsequent interactions with a dApp when on-chain storage is used.</p><p></p> Case 3: Subject-submitted verification result, off-chain<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>If the Verification Result is not persisted on-chain, then every interaction of the wallet with the contract will be associated with a fresh, unique Verification Result.</p><p></p> Subsequent interactions <p>Assuming the implementation is using on-chain storage, after the phases 1 &amp; 2 (plus on-chain storage) are completed, then on subsequent interactions, a dApp could check the registry to confirm the wallet/address is already approved, avoiding the need to re-verify the VC. The dApp backend (or registry, if separate) can simply check that <code>msg.sender</code> is in the set of registered addresses.</p><p></p><p>Without on-chain storage, in general the VC would be re-verified<a>3</a> each time (as shown in the diagram in Case 3), and the verification result submitted along with the transaction. Since verification is off-chain (and generally fast/inexpensive, depending on the provider), and since this avoids on-chain storage of potentially correlatable data, this is often the preferred solution.</p> Discussion  On-chain Storage Considerations<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The on-chain storage patterns have implications that require careful consideration:</p>  On-chain persistence of any potentially identifiable (or re-identifiable) data should be avoided. If on-chain persistence is used, it is up to the design of a particular implementation to manage that smart contract’s access rights and obfuscation mechanisms to minimize privacy risks.  The verifier-submitted pattern, in its current form, assumes the verifier’s willingness to pay transaction fees (e.g. "gas fees”, in EVM systems).  The verifier-submitted pattern includes an obligation that the verifier update the on-chain state corresponding to revoked credentials.  In general, this may not be the most cost-effective option.  <p>There are optimizations – in the Verite open source, the Verification Registry may be used among multiple contracts, and <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0xFd283fBb301f332A94969f629E1832824DEA3684/IFYyHg6OUQVj4QurIOOpVvHHBWaC1cJzdI6B4OU15WM">proposed improvements enable further reuse through proxies</a>. These are all possible for implementations; Verite’s open source repositories are intended as example implementations, and not as normative guidance.</p><p>However, we think it’s important to draw attention to off-chain options, as it has a profile of privacy characteristics we find favorable in many use-cases. This is one of the reasons we’re increasingly demonstrating this option, as seen in the <a href="https://verite.id/blog/NFT-allowlists-with-verifiable-credentials-and-verite">off-chain NFT allowlist</a>.</p> Circle’s Implementation Choices<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>It was not necessary to write the verification results to on-chain storage in Circle’s implementation. The advantages of flushing to chains include the avoidance of repeated verification for the same wallets. However, the advantages do not always outweigh the drawbacks:</p>  Short TTL is required for verification because a user's KYC status could change.  Chain writers must pay a gas fee.  <p>As a result, Circle chose and suggests other implementers also choose this approach: do not write verification results into chains unless there is a substantial efficiency gain, i.e., if many transactions will be authorized by the average on-chain write operations.</p><p>Since Circle’s architecture is optimized for delivering verification reliably and simply to dApps, we choose to explain the design choices we’ve made from the perspective of the verification process, where valid Verifiable Credentials get communicated to smart-contracts powering dApps.</p> Up Next<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>In the following post, we’ll describe options for wallets that don’t understand Decentralized Identity protocols to participate in VC exchanges, while conforming to the verification principles above.</p><p>The Verite core team is grateful to Circle’s Verite engineers Tao Tao, Daniel Lim, and Fei Niu for taking the lead on this exciting work!</p>    Crucially, this includes not just the usual redirections and tokens but also an artifact called a "Presentation Submission" object which describes the credentials that a given verifier will accept. This enables wallets to “pre-select” appropriate credentials to the end-user, in the case of a full wallet.<a>↩</a>  An "onchain DID" (decentralized identifier) scheme such as did:ion can be used here if the wallet controls such an identifier– this is basically a user-controlled indirection, which allows user-initiated rotations and even migration to a new wallet. In an end-to-end system, however, this indirection is optional, because the verifier has access to the issuance records, and can simply use a public key in both places since they are opaque to any other audience.<a>↩</a>  The verite reference implementation avoids resubmission of the same verification results / signature to avoid replays<a>↩</a>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of the University of Sherbrooke?</p>



<p>As a leading research university recognized for the originality of its programs, the University of Sherbrooke is committed to working with its communities to train responsible citizens that will change the world. That is why the University of Sherbrooke has created an Interdisciplinary Research group that brings together over 14 professors committed to developing Canadian expertise in digital identity.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Identity has been central to civilization since the dawn of time. It serves to establish the structure and functioning of society. A trusted digital identity is therefore critical for existing and emerging markets because the digitization of our societies must be supported by standardization of digital identity that favours the continuum of exchanges of goods, services and information while maintaining an adequate quality of service. Thus, it now seems trivial that the protection of privacy relies as much on a sound management of personal information, including cybersecurity, as on a strict control of any secondary use of data that could be associated with our identity.</p>
 



  
<a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/"></a> 


<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digitization is pervasive in our society. It is a fundamental part of every democratic action and business transaction. With digital transformation, the reality of the market forces businesses to outdo themselves in order to offer products and services at ever-improving prices. As a result, digital identity is becoming the cornerstone of the current and future development of our organizations. This pressure is sustainable if businesses manage their means of production in an agile and sustainable way. Universities are experiencing this transformation through the accelerated renewal of their course offerings, the need to implement a digital campus, the way they reach their clientele and the acceleration of certain research. Among the challenges is the research on the trust relationship necessary for the proper functioning of digital identification.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada has caught up and is now considered a world leader in digital identity. This is fundamental because every transaction or action in a system relies on the correct identification of the third parties involved – people, organizations and objects. In addition, efficient digital identity management enables economies of scale that benefit all Canadians.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>As an academic researcher interested in digital identity, this is a key interest group, connecting key players from business, government, academia and other key stakeholders. The DIACC has an established structure and drives a lean operation with international visibility. They help make research relevant by making digital identity issues visible, including through their design, governance, operationalization, standardization, etc.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>The University of Sherbrooke’s reputation for dynamism and innovation attracts students and professors from all over the world. Its international partnerships and human, intellectual and scientific potential allow it to be an actor of global change. In 2020-2021, the University will have 31,328 students in the three cycles of higher education in eight faculties supported by 7,398 people.

<p>The specification defines a RESTful web services interface for the management of architectural resources and relationships between those and related resources such as product change requests, activities, tasks, requirements or test cases.</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of its newest OASIS Standard, approved by the members on 11 July 2022:</p>



<p>OSLC Architecture Management Version 3.0<br>OASIS Standard<br>11 July 2022</p>



<p>OSLC Architecture Management defines a RESTful web services interface for the management of architectural resources and relationships between those and related resources such as product change requests, activities, tasks, requirements or test cases. To support these scenarios, the specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, as well as HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.</p>



<p>The specification is part of a broader set of OSLC specifications that are part of the OSLC-OP project.

<p>Tell us about your career journey.<br>I started my career at a young age. I worked as a co-op student at Ontario’s Vehicle Sales Regulator, and at the end of my placement,  I was hired as a full-time legal assistant. After two years in that role, I moved to a different department where I could enhance my people skills. I travelled around Ontario, conducting car-buying seminars for consumers and educational sessions for car dealerships. After six years in the regulator space focusing on education and communications, I moved to my current role at the Canadian Finance &amp; Leasing Association. I now manage the association’s communications and membership services – a perfect combination of my passions.<br></p>
 
 
 


<blockquote><p>❝I think an opportunity for the next generation will be normalizing all genders and sexualities in the workplace. We’ve come a long way, but there’s still work to do.❞</p>Scott Long</blockquote>



<p><br>Prior to starting your career, what was your dream job and why?<br>In all honesty, I could never settle on a dream job. My friends and family knew that my “dream job” was always a flavour of the month, like becoming a cardiovascular surgeon, because it looked like a cool job on television. Unsurprisingly, my shaky hands and abysmal biology grades shut that brief ambition down. Overall, I just wanted to work with many people in customer service, education, or communications.<br><br>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?<br>Since the pandemic, I’ve found it extremely difficult to disconnect. Work bled into life because it became so accessible. The best way I’ve managed balancing both is by asking myself, “Can this wait until tomorrow morning?” I’ve found that this question helps put things into perspective and realize that there’s more time available than I thought.<br><br>As a 2SLGTBQIA+ leader, what have been the most significant barriers and opportunities in your career?<br>The most significant barrier I’ve faced is a question that I suspect everyone in the community has asked themselves: “What will they think of me when they figure out I’m gay?” It has stopped me from speaking up, applying for jobs, and even engaging in camaraderie with colleagues. Being gay gives you an outsider’s perspective because of the time we’ve spent in the closet, either pretending to fit in with the norm or avoiding it altogether. While challenging at times, the lasting impacts have allowed me to look at things more objectively. This has helped me be more patient and understanding with colleagues and stakeholders. We never know what someone else is dealing with personally or professionally.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>❝Inclusive policies and advertising are only effective when they’re practiced regularly.❞</p>Scott Long</blockquote>



<p><br>What will be the biggest challenges and opportunities for the incoming generation for 2SLGTBQIA+ people?<br>I think a big challenge will be dealing with tokenism. It’s fantastic to see organizations pay more attention to social issues but can sometimes rely on marginalized staff to provide answers to complex questions. I think an opportunity for the next generation will be normalizing all genders and sexualities in the workplace. We’ve come a long way, but there’s still work to do. More exposure can help our community feel more comfortable without fearing rejection.<br><br>Would you like to suggest actions that can be taken to encourage more 2SLGTBQIA+ to pursue careers in the digital identity/tech space?<br>I’d suggest moving away from corporate-speak, like boilerplate language in job advertisements that only say “equal opportunity employer” or only publishing 2SLGTBQIA+ communications in June. Inclusive policies and advertising are only effective when they’re practiced regularly.<br><br>Do you recommend any strategies or tactics to help 2SLGTBQIA+ amplify their organizational voices?<br>Remember that each time you speak up, it doesn’t mean you have to come out of the closet again. Sexuality doesn’t make you better or worse at your job, so speak to matters you know about. Even if it sounds ridiculous in your head, that could mean nobody has thought about it.<br><br>What advice would you give to 2SLGTBQIA+ people entering the digital identity field?<br>In the grand scheme, digital identity and tech are “new” ideas. Our community has trailblazing experience, so I suggest 2SLGTBQIA+ persons use their unique perspectives to move these ideas forward.</p>

<p>Back to our Developer Showcase Series to learn what developers in the real world are doing with Hyperledger technologies. Next up is Daniel Bluhm, Software Engineer at <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>. </p>



<p>Give a bit of background on what you’re working on and how you got into blockchain</p>



<p>I am currently working on Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent – Python and other agent implementations. I spend most of my days working on agents and protocols. I first got into blockchain at the Sovrin Foundation where I got my start as an associate software engineer. I was actually around at the founding of the agent ecosystem, back when we all collaborated in the Hyperledger Indy Agent Working Group. I was one of the first implementers and continued working with it as the community grew. Eventually it snowballed into the Hyperledger Aries project.</p>



<p>What Hyperledger frameworks or tools are you using in your projects? Any new developments to share? Can you sum up your experience with Hyperledger?</p>



<p>I really like where things are going with the Aries Cloud Agent – Python repo, driving towards more pluggability and making it so we can extend functionality without changing the core project itself. I am also excited to get did:indy method support into Hyperledger Indy, as well as multi-ledger support in ACA-Py.We already have reads down, so now we’re just working on the writes.</p>



<p>What do you think is most important for Hyperledger to focus on in the next year?</p>



<p>We have a really diverse and thriving community in the Hyperledger Aries space; what we really need going into 2022 is a push for greater adoption of the technology and getting it into the hands of people who aren’t engineers. I would also really like to see a focus on encouraging more interaction with the Hyperledger Indy project, especially after seeing how positively this affects our work with Hyperledger Aries.</p>



<p>What advice would you offer other technologists or developers interested in getting started working on blockchain?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest piece of advice I could give is to not be afraid to step in, contribute, and break stuff. It doesn’t matter if your pull request isn’t perfect.The maintainers of the project will work with you to get it right.</p>



<p>As Hyperledger’s projects continue to mature, what do you see as the most interesting technologies, apps, or use cases coming out as a result?</p>



<p>The technologies that are most interesting to me are the ones that allow us to use multiple different technologies at the same time – which is exactly what we’re striving for in Hyperledger Aries. This enables us to take advantage of the strengths of one technology – be it blockchain, communication, protocol, crypto suite, or something else – and use those strengths to shore up the places where another technology might fall short. Beyond that, anything that makes it easier and more efficient for the end user will be a huge step in the right direction.</p>



<p>What’s the one issue or problem you hope blockchain can solve?</p>



<p>The biggest problem that I would like to see blockchain solve is power imbalances. This applies across the board, to finance, representation in government, data used and collected by big orgs, and other scenarios we just haven’t thought up yet. I’d like to see blockchain enable individuals to have a say in how they are treated and be more self-deterministic – they should have at least some level of control over what’s running their lives.</p>



<p>Where do you hope to see Hyperledger and/or blockchain in five years?</p>



<p>I would like to see Hyperledger and blockchain technology in general in the hands of real people. They don’t necessarily need to be aware that they are using a blockchain. In fact, I think there are some really good arguments to the contrary. But it should be a positive influence in their lives as it is used day to day. I would like to see the blockchain space settle down, drop some of the hype, and just be used for what it’s good at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is the best piece of developer advice you’ve ever received?</p>



<p>No one gets it right on the first try. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, break tests, crash CI/CD pipelines, or push broken code. Don’t do it intentionally, of course, but the faster you can get at shortening the “experience a failure, find the problem, implement the fix” cycle, the faster you’ll learn and master your code. In short, don’t be afraid to break stuff. Just give it a shot and learn from the result.</p>



<p>When a problem or change needs to be made in the future, the developer then can see what your thought processes were for writing the code you did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What technology could you not live without?</p>



<p>I could not live without Git. Without it it would be nearly impossible to get any code written and submitted. It’s part of my everyday workflow and even crucial in my hobby projects.</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmechanic/">Meyer Mechanic</a>, Founder and CEO at <a href="https://vaultie.io/">Vaultie</a> with additional contributions made by members of DIACC’s Outreach Expert Committee.</p>



<p>In the 22 years since electronic signatures were made legal for business use in Canada, they’ve become a mainstay of how we interact with our customers. As they’ve gained familiarity, use, and traction, there has been a group of companies (that are becoming smaller) that wouldn’t adopt the technology. About 4 years ago, I started asking what barriers are preventing sensitive documents such as wills, financial instruments, notarized documents, and major contracts from being digitally signed (as opposed to “wet-ink” signatures) and what protections would need to be in place for these types of documents to go that route.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What does the future hold for sensitive digital contracts? What is in use today?</p>



<p>Not all signatures are created equal, and different products have different features. For simplicity, let’s break electronic signatures into three categories: E-signature, digital signature, and credentialed signature (Digital ID).</p>



<p>What are they?</p>



<p>E-signatures – These were the first iterations acceptable in court, although are no longer accepted in some provinces. A simple electronic indicator that can be attributed to the user. This could be as simple as typing your name in a box, adding a jpeg, or clicking to produce an image to imitate how your name would look when written with a pen. The precedent law on this is actually that the footer of an email could be enough to consider something electronically signed.</p>



<p>Digital signature – A digital signature uses a combination of public and private keys to issue certificates with encrypted claims that could be attributed to a document. When signing a document with a digital signature, information about the session could&nbsp;be recorded, such as what email address the user was logged in from or when they issued this certificate. All of this information could be presented as evidence that you’ve signed a document.&nbsp;You likely use this type everyday without even knowing it, it’s common for financial services, real estate, and even everyday business. These signatures sacrifice a little bit of privacy in order to create some more evidence as to who has signed.<br></p>


 
 


<p>Credentialed signature (Digital ID) – A signatory verifies their ID (usually government-issued) against a biometric, and a credential is created for them by a credential issuer, which is usually an identity and access management company, or the integrated signature provider company. That credential can then be applied to a series of digital assets (mostly contracts) to verify that a live person signed a document. That credential may include other permissions as well, such as authentication from additional issuers based on a series of attributes of the signatory (e.g., job title, professional designation, educational status, etc.). This expands the reach of a traditional digital signature in two key ways. First, the verified ID and biometric checks expand assurances of the signature to the person on the other side of the screen, who was present at the time of signing. Second, with a Credentialed signature we can prove that the signature hasn’t been subject to fraud and the signer is, in fact, who they claim to be. This allows the document to be universally verified which means that a party who was not in the room when a document was signed can still ascertain who, specifically, signed a document and that it hadn’t been altered. This type of signature is only starting to take hold, but is already in use for financial assets, both tangible and digital, art, and many situations where there is a higher risk of fraud.</p>



<p>Future of Digital ID in contracts</p>



<p>As more sensitive types of documents begin to go digital, higher levels of assurances are becoming imperative as methods of resisting fraud attempts. While an E-signature may be an appropriate tool for a retail business with lower stakes, there is growing adoption of Credentialed Signatures for high-value sales such as securities, precious metals, legal contracts, real estate, digital assets, and more. We are already seeing the adoption of these standards in multiparty financial agreements, where a customer and a third-party agent may agree to a transaction, but the funder is not present in the room. The application of a digital ID in these cases protects all parties involved since the funder can verify every aspect of a contract without having to ever meet the customer and the customer has a verifiable document that could be easily proven should anything ever go awry. The use of Credentialed Signatures protects the asset and can confirm Know Your Customer (KYC)/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) assurances while helping the signer claim ownership by creating direct connections between them and the asset. We see this niche growing substantially over the next five years and better-linking people to their digital worlds. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelmagrath/">Michael Magrath</a>, Managing Director, Digital Identity at <a href="https://kuma.pro/">Kuma</a> with additional contributions by members of DIACC’s Outreach Expert Committee.</p>



<p>If there is one industry that everyone participates in, it’s healthcare. Believe it or not, Canada’s healthcare system is far more progressive than many other nations, but there is a lot of room for improvement.&nbsp;Our patient experience can and will be improved as the sector continues down its digital transformation journey. Identity management and in general, digital identity, will be a major factor for healthcare providers and patients alike. This blog will focus on patients, because after all, you are one.</p>



<p>Patient identity is at the centre of healthcare. Treating the wrong patient by misidentification, has led to everything from allergic reactions to death. Indeed, providing high quality care to the right patient is paramount.</p>



<p>While everything seems to be going digital today, healthcare is rooted in the offline, physical world, and full transformation to digital is a long and arduous journey.&nbsp;Provincial governments have done arguably a respectable job enabling us to prove who we are via our health insurance cards presented at point-of-care.&nbsp;The card includes our name, date of birth, photograph, provincial health card number along with physical security features like holograms to thwart the production and use of fake cards.</p>



<p>But what about in the digital world? As good as our health insurance cards are at point-of-care, they do not prove who we are online. The pandemic only magnified these shortcomings. At the moment, there are wide-scale social engineering and phishing attacks designed to trick individuals to share their online account login credentials to takeover accounts, access company files and assets, drain bank accounts, and create false identities, to name a few. In 2022, we need a secure, voluntary, and privacy-enhancing digital identity in order to cease the use of passwords for login to protect our digital lives.</p>



<p>A digital identity is a digital representation that uniquely identifies a person presented to service providers, such as a physician’s office, hospital, bank, or government agency when accessing online services. Like a driver license, possessing a digital identity is not a government mandate and should be a choice for an individual, but it does make life easier and more secure when transacting business online.</p>



<p>Changes are coming which will significantly improve our lives as patients. Have you ever lost a paper prescription or had to wait for the pharmacist to call your doctor because their handwriting is illegible? There is a better way – electronic prescriptions sent by your physician to the pharmacy are commonplace in many countries, and even mandated in some.</p>



<p>Those in the “sandwich generation,” caring for themselves, their children, and their elderly parent(s) know the frustrations of coordinating care with multiple healthcare providers. Patient portals have added convenience for Americans to schedule appointments, view test results and medical records, and will soon benefit all Canadians. To protect patient privacy and security, healthcare organizations need high assurance that the person accessing the portal is who they claim they are. Digital identity can enable all of the above, and if you don’t use one already, a digital identity wallet may be in your future.</p>



<p>Digital identity wallets are just what they sound like. They are analogous to physical wallets in that they contain digital versions of the wallet owner’s identity proofs and related assets. These assets typically include digital versions of familiar physical cards and documents (e.g., driver’s license, proof of insurance, health cards, etc.). They are highly secure and provide consumers with the ability to protect their privacy and have control over their information by sharing what they choose with an organization. The example often used for a digital or mobile driver license is entering a nightclub. The bouncer at the door only needs to know that the person is of legal drinking age. They do not need the person’s name and home address. To protect privacy and security, the digital wallet holder can share only their age with the bouncer. When was your child’s last tetanus shot? It could be a few clicks away, securely stored in your digital wallet accessible from your mobile device.</p>



<p>As we can see the light at the end of the dark and deadly pandemic tunnel, life will noticeably change.&nbsp;One positive change will be our online safety and security. With Web3 on the near-term horizon, having and utilizing digital identities will be more important than ever for all Canadians.</p>

<p>Co-Chairs – Wenjing Chu of Futurewei and Vikas Malhotra of WOPLLI Technologies</p>







<p>Trust over IP foundation (<a href="http://www.trustoverip.org">www.trustoverip.org</a>) is forming a new task force on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Metaverse (AIM for short), under its Technology Stack working group. The mission of this new task force is to complete a ToIP Recommendation for the ToIP community to address opportunities and challenges brought on by advances in AI, Metaverse and related technologies in relation to ToIP’s mission of creating interoperable trust over the Internet.</p>







<p>In one aspect, AI technologies may break the traditional assumptions of digital systems design, even most of the SSI systems or other decentralized systems. In another aspect, AR/VR/XR/Metaverse, combined with AI, may fundamentally alter/blur/erase the boundaries between digital and the real world. After all, our face is our identity, whether we choose it or not, and anyone can create that implied identity without our permission or even knowledge. Once it is in a system, it has a life of its own. How do we find what is real from fake and establish Trust? It is something missing today but critically important if we want our solutions to be useful in the next 5-10 years.</p>


 
 


<p>Metaverse and Web 3.0 are two intertwined drivers in pushing many Trust related issues and technologies to the forefront of defining what is the next internet or the next web. &nbsp;AI technology raises critical ethical issues with regard to how we think about trust over the internet, e.g. fairness, privacy and accountability. All these aspects, and more generally, AI ethics and harm prevention, point to the importance and relevance of the intersection between Trust and AI.</p>



<p>Many additional topics have to be explored, including Trustworthiness of data, how the AIs work with each other, how does a person determine trustworthiness of AI “on the fly’, potential of harms caused to a person with increased surveillance in Metaverse environments etc.</p>



<p>The task force plans to carry out its work in two phases below –</p>



  Phase 1: Survey and White Paper  Phase 2: Recommendation and/or White Paper

 What is the Verifier Universal Interface (VUI)? 
<p>Originally funded by <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/essif-lab/">eSSIF-Lab</a>, a project funded by the European Commission within the <a href="https://www.ngi.eu">Next Generation Internet (NGI) Program</a>, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/vui/">Verifier Universal Interface (VUI) initiative</a> aims to build a set of standard APIs to enable interoperability between ID Wallets and Verifier components. After months of hard work and collaboration, the VUI work has been successfully donated to DIF with the goal of furthering its evolution and reach to the international community.</p>
<p>As different technology providers build SSI solutions, it becomes critical to ensure interoperability between these solutions. Available standards for SSI still have important gaps, leading us to an ecosystem of full-stack providers whose approach to interoperability is building proprietary plug-ins for each one of the other available solutions. This approach to interoperability is not scalable, the underlying problem being that building standards takes time. For this reason a practical and focused approach was proposed to enable scalable interoperability in the SSI community: a role-centric approach to standardization at the API level.</p>
<p>The VUI working group, led by <a href="https://gataca.io/">GATACA</a> and composed of 12 SSI organizations, identified a minimum set of 6 APIs to offer an end-to-end credential verification flow.</p>
 
 DID resolution 
 Status resolution 
 Data agreements 
 Presentation exchange 
 Issuer resolution 
 Schema resolution 
 
<p>Since both DID Registry &amp; Status resolution APIs have advanced pre-defined work, VUI set out to build a team to work on the remaining interfaces.</p>
<p>In just one year, the working group has been able to define APIs for Data Agreements, Presentation Exchange, and Issuer Resolution.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the delivery for the Presentation Exchange API was an extension of the existing work based on WACI. As for the remaining API, Schema resolution, future work of VUI will involve its definition as it is only one without a definition proposal or an existing normative reference.</p>
 Results 
<p>The results of these efforts include <a href="https://identity.foundation/vui/">API specifications</a> built on ReSpec, API swaggers, and an open-source library that organizations can use to easily implement these APIs. Below are some details of each Working Package.</p>
 Data Agreements 
<p>In current SSI architectures, there is little to no support for data agreements, also known as consent management, on the usage of Verifiable Credentials. On one hand, there was some groundwork done by<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">  Kantara</a> on a generic<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-consent-receipts">  Consent Receipts</a> specification that could apply to any digital service, yet in the context of SSI frameworks, the only progress made were proprietary implementations of consent mechanisms, such as GATACA's Verifiable Consent; but no proposal had received major adherence. Due to the standardization gap, the<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-data-agreement">  Automated Data Agreement</a> (ADA) project was created under the EssifLab organization and led by<a href="http://igrant.io/">  iGrant.io</a> and builds upon Kantara<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-consent-receipts">  Consent Receipts</a> to allow data privacy mechanisms to be enforced in the framework of Hyperledger Aries. Given the strong alignment with the Consent Management API defined at VUI, both teams decided to join forces into one single initiative.</p>
<p>Now, the VUI Data Agreement sub-ReSpec proposes a specific Data Model to manage data agreements, built upon both<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-data-agreement">  Automated Data Agreements</a> and Kantara<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-consent-receipts">  Consent Receipts</a>. It also defines a basic protocol and the mechanisms to embed it inside a<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-dif-presentation-exchange">  Presentation Exchange</a>, which could be supported by multiple exchange standards.</p>
 Presentation Exchange 
<p>There are multiple known and adopted technology solutions or standards focused on the presentation exchange between a wallet and a verifier, the DIF Presentation Exchange (PE) data model being the most widely accepted. This is because DIF PE is compatible with multiple exchange protocols such as WACI, CHAPI, DID Comm, and DID Siop, making it scalable. To avoid further siloing the standards market by developing another PE data model from scratch, the VUI group believed supporting a successful, pre-existing data model was the best approach and decided to develop an extension of the groundwork done at DIF PE. Our core work consisted of proposing new extension features including:</p>
 
 
<p>Linkage to the data agreement (as mentioned before)</p>
 
 
<p>Mutual authentication (right now, it's performed at the exchange layer protocol), and</p>
 
 
<p>Mechanisms to improve the link between the credential subject and the person managing the wallet.</p>
 
 
 Issuer resolution 
<p>Who should be trusted as an issuer? This is a common, yet challenging question often asked in the online authentication space. In the past, many technology providers have attempted to provide generic solutions such as hardcoded lists in configuration files, API services, Domain name consultations, or Blockchain/DLT registries. In the SSI world, however, it's the Verifier who has the final decision on who he/she will trust to supply valid, verifiable data.</p>
<p>One of the most mature trust frameworks for Issuers has been defined at the<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/CEFDIGITAL/EBSI">  EBSI/ESSIF</a>  project by the European Commission, which includes a trusted issuer registry designed with a complex governance protocol to determine who can issue which credentials and who can vouch for those issuers.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the VUI team is taking it one step further by designing a generic, platform-agnostic issuer registry approach that is portable across any governance platform. The goal is to offer a generic adaptation compatible not only with EBSI/ESSIF trusted registries, but also with any other trust framework, where the Verifier will just have to build a generic query interface, similar to the Universal DID Resolver, to retrieve the issuers from any platform, and manage them at his preference.</p>

 Next steps 
<p>The VUI initiative has been steadily gaining international traction. In addition to having been donated to the DIF, it was recently mentioned in a<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/canada-eu-joint-workshop-series-enabling-interoperability-and-mutual-support-digital-credentials">  report published by the European Commission (DG Connect) and the Canadian Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, (ISED)</a>, as a key global interoperability approach to explore.</p>
<p>Moving forward VUI can help the SSI community successfully achieve interoperability between Verifiers and Wallets, a necessary step towards mass adoption. DIF's vast community and SSI expertise is precisely what VUI needs to make a tangible global impact.</p>
