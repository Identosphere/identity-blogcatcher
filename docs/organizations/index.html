   Self-sovereign identity centers on placing data control squarely in the hands of individuals. The goal is to rectify a mistake that has grown exponentially since the late 90s—the dominance of certain companies over personal information.&nbsp; 
 The current model has data providers sending to data consumers directly, for the most part, with little to no consent from the data subjects themselves in

<p>Elastos is excited to announce a strategic partnership with <a href="https://www.bevm.io">BEVM</a> to enhance the capabilities of Bitcoin using the Bitcoin Elastos Layer 2 (BeL2) protocol. This collaboration focuses on providing comprehensive toolsets and SDKs that enable native Bitcoin transactions to communicate and execute smart contracts on BEVM. This integration bridges information seamlessly across layers and unlocks a myriad of potential applications, with the peer-to-peer <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-loan-app-bitcoin-finance/">Bitcoin loan product</a> being a significant example.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Partnership: Expanding Bitcoin’s Utility 
<p>The core motivation behind the partnership is to unlock $1 trillion of untapped potential of Bitcoin by integrating it into the world of smart contracts and decentralised applications (DApps). By enabling native Bitcoin transactions to directly communicate with BEVM’s smart contract ecosystem, this partnership aims to expand Bitcoin’s Defi utility without compromising its inherent security, uniting technologies.</p>
<p>This interoperability is made possible through the Bitcoin Elastos Layer 2 (BeL2) protocol, which enables seamless interaction between Bitcoin transactions and smart contracts on BEVM. By leveraging BeL2’s advanced toolsets and SDKs, developers can create a wide range of decentralised applications that utilise Bitcoin’s security and liquidity.</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>
 
 Direct Communication: Native Bitcoin transactions can trigger and interact with smart contracts on BEVM, facilitated by BeL2’s advanced toolsets and SDKs. 
 Enhanced Interoperability: These SDKs allow seamless interoperability between Bitcoin and EVM-compatible environments, enabling a wide range of decentralised applications. 
 Security and Privacy: Utilising zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), the SDKs ensure secure and private transactions without exposing Bitcoin to additional risks. 
 
<p>As an initial service, the partnership aims to develop a peer-to-peer Bitcoin loan product. This product will allow Bitcoin holders to use their assets as collateral for loans, unlocking significant dormant value in the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>
<p>Loan Product Highlights:</p>
 
 Collateralisation: Users can lock their Bitcoin as collateral in a smart contract and receive Layer 2 assets such as USDT. 
 Decentralised: The process is peer-to-peer, reducing the need for intermediaries and maintaining user privacy. 
 Security: Bitcoin remains on its native network, and the loan process is secured by smart contracts and ZKPs. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Bigger Picture: Connecting Bitcoin Layers 
<p></p>
<p>BeL2 connects different layers in the Bitcoin ecosystem, integrating Layer 1, Layer 2, sidechains, protocols, and applications. BEVM offers a Layer 2 EVM execution environment using Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) as gas, enabling complex transactions and smart contracts at a fraction of the cost. This partnership aims to provide tools and SDKs for building diverse applications, including loan products, leveraging Bitcoin’s security and liquidity. Elastos and BEVM’s collaboration enhances Bitcoin’s capabilities through the BeL2 protocol, paving the way for innovative financial products. Excited to learn more?

<p>Policy experts from Africa, Europe, Latin America, and North America outlined next steps for global AI regimes and networked capacity&nbsp;building</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nasa?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">NASA</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/photo-of-outer-space-Q1p7bh3SHj8?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a><p>By Lis Sylvan &amp; Niharika Vattikonda</p><p>Nearly a year and a half after the introduction of ChatGPT, artificial intelligence remains in the regulatory hot seat. While the EU AI Act put the so-called Brussels Effect into play, more regions across the globe are now weighing risks, rights, economic opportunities, and regional needs. On May 28th, the <a href="https://networkofcenters.net/">Global Network of Centers of Internet &amp; Society Research Centers</a> (NoC) and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at Harvard University (BKC) hosted a group of policy experts from Africa, Latin America, the US, and the EU to discuss this state of global AI regulation and outline next steps for collaboration across continents.</p><p>Lis Sylvan, Senior Director of Strategy and Programming at BKC, moderated the discussion with Carlos Affonso de Souza (Director of the Institute of Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro), Mason Kortz (Clinical Instructor at the Cyberlaw Clinic at BKC), Gabriele Mazzini (European Commission, chief architect of the EU AI Act), and Ridwan Oloyede (Certa Foundation, coauthor of their recent “State of AI Regulation in Africa” report), with NoC Executive Director Armando Guio providing behind-the-scenes support. The group delved into how governments are weighing sectoral versus horizontal regulatory approaches; the role of the administrative state and existing data protection and competition regulators; the new models of AI regulation in Rwanda and Brazil; the impact of the EU AI Act across all jurisdictions; and the potential for truly global governance.</p> Origins and Approaches <p>De Souza contextualized the current moment of global AI regulation as a decade-long journey of AI regulation that started with charters and declarations of governing principles from various governments and entities. Over time, those charters and principles were reflected in national AI strategies, which have been in the works for five years and can be seen as the precursor to AI regulation; Brazil’s AI regulatory evolution, for example, closely followed this time frame. De Souza highlighted the impact of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on this evolution; after GDPR took effect, countries have established data protection authorities that have largely been the main point of contact for early AI governance. As a result of GDPR, he said, “data protection may be an accelerator, may be an entry point for countries in the majority world, because that’s the conversation that we have been having in the last decade, and that’s where resources [and] attention had been moving forward in those countries.” However, he cautioned against using data protection law as the sole basis of AI regulation, because the data protection framework does not necessarily address the full scope of challenges raised by the development of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Mazzini explained that the technical discussions about the EU’s proposed AI legislation date back to 2019. One of the key concerns with a sectoral approach, he said, was the risk of privileging certain sectors over others. The horizontal approach, though, results in added complexity as regulators needed to find regulations that would work across sectors and avoid repetitions; moreover, the scope of EU legislation is limited by the exclusion of national security, military, and defense sectors. While the EU AI Act takes an omnibus approach, Mazzini said it did not make sense to regulate AI as its own technology but rather a general-purpose tool with a variety of applications.</p><p>“What was clear to me since the get-go is that It didn’t make sense to regulate AI as a technology as such, because indeed what we are dealing with is a general purpose technology that has a variety of applications that we don’t even foresee today…” said Mazzini, “…and therefore, from my perspective, the idea to establish rules for the technology as such, regardless of its use, didn’t make any sense…We came up with this approach of establishing rules depending on the specific use to which that account is put, with the greatest burden, from a regulatory point of view, being on the high risk,” which Mazzini outlined to include applications of the technology that are linked to health and safety, including medical devices, automated cars, and&nbsp;drones.</p> Sectoral and Regional Approaches <p>In the U.S. and in the African Union, regulatory agencies have found it more effective to apply existing laws — across data protection, competition, consumer protection, employment, and other sectors — to govern AI, often taking a sectoral approach. Oloyede said that data protection authorities and competition authorities have largely driven the initial AI regulatory agenda, as these authorities are best equipped to enforce consumer protection, data protection, intellectual property, and competition laws as the basis for national AI governance strategies. “We might see some sort of like a clearinghouse model image where not every country in Africa, for example, will try to come up with a specific AI regulation,” Oloyede&nbsp;said.</p><p>Oloyede indicated that the sector-based approach has been dominant on the African continent, with countries including Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Rwanda, and Egypt beginning to develop roadmaps for AI governance and establish regulatory task forces. Oloyede said the sectoral approach has allowed regulators to develop specific policies for the deployment of AI in healthcare, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>According to Mason Kortz, this sectoral approach is typically favored in the U.S. because the U.S. regulatory approach values subject-matter expertise over technical expertise. The U.S. will likely have subject-matter experts regulate AI in their own domains, Kortz said — for example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development would regulate AI for housing. The U.S. approach relies on the country’s strong administrative state and directs specific federal agencies to take on different pieces of AI regulation. Meanwhile, certain state laws have sought to regulate specific use cases of AI in housing and employment contexts.</p><p>Kortz also noted that the current approach in the U.S. is a confirmation that existing rights-based regimes will be applied or extended to harms resulting from the use of AI systems; with a notoriously slow legislature, he said, only making small changes as needed is an advantageous approach, particularly when existing enforcement agencies may already have the power to make those changes. The U.S. common law system is well-suited to this approach, he said, as it lends judges relatively strong power to reinterpret the law in ways that are binding on lower courts without necessarily having to rewrite civil&nbsp;code.</p><p>“When it comes to some of the more rights-based statutes we have,” Kortz said, “I think, actually, we have a pretty good governance model right there, and we just need some small adjustments around the edges to modernize those statutes and bring them in line, not just with AI, but hopefully, if not future-proof them, at least provide a little more stability for whatever comes next after AI.” However, Kortz allowed that AI is so fundamentally transformative that certain existing laws, such as intellectual property law and copyright doctrine, may not be enough and global harmonization of AI laws should be a priority.</p> Global Collaboration and&nbsp;Capacity <p>Oloyede indicated that African countries have introduced solutions at the level of the Global Privacy Congress, although these solutions will need to reflect differing national and regional interests. Mazzini noted that generative AI and general-purpose AI create additional issues that require international collaboration — fighting misinformation, he said, will require such collaboration. However, de Souza cautioned that regulatory transformation must keep in mind how those laws will be applied in the future. In some cases, he noted, new liability regimes for AI are now stricter than the remaining body of law; Costa Rica, for example, has adopted a strict liability approach for high-risk uses of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>“If we turn out to have the chapters of liability on our AI laws more severe than what we have in our general law for other situations, if we are all in agreement that, in the future, AI is going to be in everything, the legislators that are designing those laws today, they are designing general laws on liability, because we will have AI in almost all sectors,” de Souza remarked. “So the decisions that we’re making today on liability, they might end up scrapping the provisions that you have on your civil code, consumer protection code, because the AI law will be the law that is more recent, more specific, and that may be the one that will be applying in most&nbsp;cases.”</p><p>This international collaboration will require capacity building across the globe, and Mazzini emphasized that the EU AI Act has prompted additional work to support the authorities in the EU that will implement and enforce the regulation. Although the AI Act will impact multiple private sectors, he said, its public enforcement will require both financial and knowledge-based resources. De Souza noted that the Brussels Effect will prompt a need for global bureaucracy to support global compliance with the EU AI Act, and well-resourced national authorities are needed to support that implementation. Oloyede, however, said that lessons learned from the GDPR rollout may inform a better approach to implementing the EU AI Act with a more nuanced understanding of the local context. While the EU AI Act will require capacity building to support new governance bodies with funding and resources, he said, it is essential to preserve existing collaborations with data protection and competition authorities and empower those authorities to address AI in their own&nbsp;domains.</p><p>Despite different countries taking more sectoral versus horizontal approaches, the global community is working to establish flexible approaches to AI governance in their respective regions. As Oloyede said, “AI is here today. Tomorrow is going to be a different technology. And we can’t keep legislating for every new technology that we have.” Mazzini described a need for international coordination when he said, “when it comes to this new type of AI that is sometimes is called ‘generative AI’ or ‘general purpose AI’ that we have specifically regulated in the EU — notably in the last few weeks, in final stages of the negotiations — I think I would like to see there certainly more international coordination, because there we are dealing with a number of questions that I think are pretty common across jurisdictions.”</p><p>Though approaches across the globe may be different, a common cross-cutting theme of the work is balance: protecting rights versus supporting innovation, legislating a critical technology while its capacity and impact is still developing, and providing necessary limitations while allowing nimble innovation.</p><p>The <a href="https://networkofcenters.net/">Network of Internet &amp; Society Research Centers (NoC)</a> is a collaborative initiative among academic institutions with a focus on interdisciplinary research on the development, social impact, policy implications, and legal issues concerning the Internet.

		<p>Dear Edge Community,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well. As we continue to adapt to the industry changes brought about by VMware’s acquisition by Broadcom, I want to share some important updates and reaffirm our dedication to assisting you through these transitions.</p>
<p>Pricing Changes Post-Acquisition: Following Broadcom’s post-acquisition adjustments to VMware’s licensing, contracting, and operational model, Edge will no longer manage an Enterprise Licensing Agreement (ELA) on behalf of our members. As a result, Edge will not be responsible for negotiating pricing, co-terming licensing dates, or participating in the quoting and billing process.</p>
<p>VMware Horizon Update: VMware Horizon is becoming a new organization, separate from VMware/Broadcom, called Omnissa. Licensing for Horizon must be procured separately from VMware and can also be fulfilled by partners like Carahsoft.</p>
<p>What This Means for Members:</p>
<p>Members will need to procure Broadcom/VMware licensing through standard reseller channels. Discounting will be determined by negotiations between each member and Broadcom/the reseller.</p>
<p>Edge still has procurement vehicles available for members to quickly process orders. These include:</p>
 
 The EdgeMarket TeCHS contract, fulfilled by SHI. 
 Other preferred resellers through our convenience contract via Carahsoft. 
 
<p>Additionally, Carahsoft will continue to assist the VMware reseller community in preparing your pricing and quotes.</p>
<p>Alternative Solutions and Expert Support: In light of these changes by Broadcom, we believe it is prudent to consider alternative solutions that may better meet your financial and operational needs. We have secured a robust selection of substitute products and services under Edge procurement vehicles. Most of the market available substitutes are available through the EdgeMarket portal, and I am pleased to introduce several key points of contact who can assist you with these options:</p>

<p>Nick Price, who co-chairs DIF’s Travel &amp; Hospitality SIG and Nick Lambert, CEO of DIF member Dock Labs explored the potential for decentralized identity to revolutionize the traveler experience during a discussion with Rob Otto of Ping Identity, Cadrick Widmann of cidas and Roger Olivieira, co founder of Ver.id at EIC in Berlin last week.&nbsp;</p><p>Nick Price: “Hotels are still stressed about verifying and storing passport information. They have a very large number of customers on file, and a very low amount of usable information. You’re not surprised when they ask whether you have stayed before, though you’ve stayed many times. Decentralized identity promises a substantial improvement in these areas.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of the valuable information that makes travel work will be self-attested. Travel is not just about crossing the border or making a transaction, it’s about 'This is me, I'm a vegetarian, I like some extra legroom on the flight', et cetera. </p><p>"Travel companies need that information. The customer wants to give it to us, but they don’t currently have the tools to do it. This is exactly what we’re building for a large project in the Middle East: a decentralized identity journey for the traveler across airlines, transport, hotels and the tourism experience.” </p><p>Rob Otto: “What consumers really want is a value exchange. When I give you my data, use it to improve my experience. Maybe I even want the hotel to know how I'm feeling today, so I present an 'introvert or extrovert' credential.”&nbsp;</p><p>"You don’t need decentralized identity to figure out someone is staying at a hotel for the tenth time, you just need a system that isn’t stupid.”&nbsp;</p><p>Nick Lambert: “People do care about privacy, but it’s incumbent on us to provide that control over their data. For example, if you want to book a hotel or hire a car, you only want to provide the information the hotel or car hire company needs. </p><p>"From an organizational perspective, holding all that data centrally is a honeypot for hackers to target and sell, as well as a GDPR / CCPA compliance risk. Companies are keen to get rid of the liability and pass it over to customers."&nbsp;</p><p>Roger Olivieira: “There are new regulations coming up where you won’t be allowed to store this data any more. Digital wallets are a good solution. They do three things very well: authentication, consent and digital signatures." </p><p>Cadrick Widmann: “But it’s hard for users to download a wallet just for one use case.”</p><p>Nick Lambert: “True. The user experience needs to be better than what exists today. For example, staff at Condatis (an Edinburgh-based CIAM provider, and DIF member) use decentralized identity to enter the office and access systems remotely, which is great. The challenge is integration with legacy systems.”</p><p>Roger Olivieira: “We solve that problem by putting a service provider between wallets and platforms, using common protocols like AuthO / OpenID Connect."&nbsp;</p><p></p>

 How to think about the three-sided marketplace of skills validation CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>After more than a decade of working with digital credentials like <a href="https://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a>, we still sometimes hear the sceptical question: “Who’s asking for&nbsp;this?”</p><p>While digital credentials offer far more than just helping people into a job, this remains a significant and powerful use case. However, creating an ecosystem where this is not only possible but also straightforward takes time. It’s a complex, three-sided challenge that requires more than simply asking users what they want; it involves anticipating their needs and providing innovative solutions that work for everyone involved.</p> The Appeal of Credentials <p>People and organisations are often attracted to digital credentials for their potential to recognise and validate a broad range of skills and achievements. They can help democratise learning, making it accessible and recognisable beyond traditional educational settings. For learners, these kind badges represent an opportunity to showcase their skills in a way that is immediately recognisable — and verifiable.</p> Challenges <p>Despite the initial excitement, many individuals and organisations find themselves asking, “Now what?” In our experience, this question stems from several challenges. Earners can sometimes have a lack of clarity on how to effectively use badges in practice, and so struggle to see how these credentials translate into real-world opportunities.</p>CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Issuers such as educational institutions and other organisations may find it difficult to convince stakeholders of the value of alternative credentials. Meanwhile, employers may exhibit uncertainty about the validity and relevance of these badges, leading to hesitation in recognising them as part of the hiring or promotion process.</p> Understanding the Three-Sided Marketplace <p>To address these challenges, it’s important to understand the interplay between the three main groups involved: earners, issuers, and employers.</p>  Earners: These are individuals who seek to acquire credentials to validate their skills and knowledge. A <a href="https://www.jff.org/jobseekers-want-digital-credentials-for-skill-sharing-are-employers-ready/">significant proportion are already using digital credentials</a> in the application process, with their main concern being whether these badges will be recognised and valued by employers and educational institutions.  Issuers: These include schools, universities, and other organisations that award credentials. Their challenge is to establish the credibility and relevance of their badges as a form of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markcperna/2022/07/25/workforce-credentials-are-going-digital-heres-why-this-helps-everyone/?sh=58d6ec8673e3">skills currency</a>.  Employers: These are the entities looking to hire or promote individuals with verified skills. <a href="https://www.aacu.org/research/falling-short-college-learning-and-career-success">Fewer than half of employers</a> say that they find university transcripts useful in helping them to evaluate job applicant’s potential to succeed at their company. So they need a quick and easy way to verify skills in a way that is a reliable indicator of&nbsp;ability.   Shifting the&nbsp;Question <p>So, rather than asking, “Who’s asking for this?” perhaps we should instead focus on understanding the needs and motivations of each group in this marketplace. By shifting our perspective, we can better appreciate the value of credentials and work towards making them more effective.</p><p>Just look at the progress we’ve made as an ecosystem:</p><p>✅ Clear value proposition — digital credentials offer tangible benefits, like <a href="https://digitalpromise.org/2024/04/11/unlocking-the-benefits-5-key-reasons-for-earning-micro-credentials/">job opportunities and career advancement</a>, by validating a wide range of skills. Secure, digital wallets make it possible for earners to feel like they truly own and control their credentials.</p><p>✅ Widespread adoption and recognition — increasing numbers of institutions and employers are recognising and accepting digital credentials, thanks to the work of organisations such as the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC), <a href="https://www.jff.org/">Jobs for the Future</a>, and <a href="https://www.thersa.org/design-for-life-our-mission/hubs/cities-of-learning/create-digital-badges-and-pathways">The&nbsp;RSA</a>.</p><p>✅ Robust technology infrastructure — advanced platforms and secure technologies are being developed to support issuing, verification, and management of digital credentials, based on foundational work of standards organisations <a href="https://www.1edtech.org/">1EdTech</a> and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>​.</p><p>✅ Collaboration between key industry bodies — industry leaders, educational institutions, and technology providers are working together to standardise and promote the use of digital credentials. See, for example, the work around <a href="https://www.skillsfwd.org/">SkillsFWD</a>, <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/">Opportunity@Work</a>, and the <a href="https://www.t3networkhub.org/">T3 Innovation Network</a>, and networking at events such as <a href="https://www.thebadgesummit.com/">The Badge Summit</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://epic.openrecognition.org/">ePIC</a>.</p><p>✅ Data standards and taxonomies — establishing consistent data standards and taxonomies helps in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">creating interoperable systems</a> where credentials can be easily shared and verified across different platforms. Credential Engine has developed the <a href="https://credentialengine.org/credential-transparency/ctdl/">Credential Transparency Description Language</a> (CTDL), supporting comparability across credential types and providers.</p><p>A huge amount of funding and effort has gone into getting us to this place. It’s going to take more money and time to get us over the line, so where should we focus our attention?</p> Creating Value for All&nbsp;Sides CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>To make digital credentials truly valuable for jobseekers, we need to address the concerns of all three&nbsp;groups:</p>  For earners: Credentials should lead to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">tangible benefits</a>, such as job opportunities or career advancement. We need clear pathways for using certain types of badges, with examples of how and where digital credentials have successfully led to job offers or promotions.  For issuers: It is crucial to developing robust standards such as <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/why-open-badges-3-0-matters-09bb231be864">Open Badges 3.0</a> to promote the credibility of their badges. Issuers can collaborate with industry leaders to ensure their credentials remain relevant and respected, as well as regularly updating the criteria for earning these badges based on industry&nbsp;needs.  For employers: Providing tools and frameworks to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-future-of-trust-in-professional-networks-4e75f09286b2">easily interpret and trust</a> these badges will encourage wider acceptance and use. Employers can partner with educational institutions to co-create badges and/or develop practical tests to verify the skills claimed by the credentials.   Final Thoughts <p>In summary, the question “Who’s asking for this?” may not be the most productive one. Instead, we should focus on understanding the interconnected roles of earners, issuers, and employers in the credentialing process. By doing so, we can move beyond the trough of disillusionment and realise the full potential of these <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/creating-a-culture-of-recognition-39ffdb6cf943">new forms of recognition</a>.</p><p>At WAO, we’ve been working closely with the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC) on storytelling and communications strategies that help everyone <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-to-find-the-right-mental-models-for-your-audience-c68097a7f0ed">understand and embrace</a> the value of digital credentials. The DCC is a key player in the ecosystem, and one of a number of organisations helping build a future where Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials are a natural and trusted part of the hiring&nbsp;process.</p><p>🔥 Do you need help with digital credentials?

<p>What forms of pAI—personal AI—are Apple, Mozilla, Google, Meta, Microsoft and the rest not doing?</p>
<p>Let’s look at those first two because they’re at the top of the news LIFO buffer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> (“coming in beta this fall<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/?cid=wwa-us-kwbi-features-slid--Brand-AppleIntellligence-Announce-&amp;mtid=20925e1t39169&amp;aosid=p238&amp;mnid=nHJFhcGO-dc_mtid_20925e1t39169_pcrid_78134256302923_pgrid_1250146041615591_&amp;msclkid=fb43aa7f55c8150c7b4ecc171ee3e360#footnote-1">*</a>“), announced yesterday, will help you with writing and creating images while giving you less lame answers from Siri. (Which they should re-name. Siri is Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/?cid=wwa-us-kwbi-features-slid--Brand-AppleIntellligence-Announce-&amp;mtid=20925e1t39169&amp;aosid=p238&amp;mnid=nHJFhcGO-dc_mtid_20925e1t39169_pcrid_78134256302923_pgrid_1250146041615591_&amp;msclkid=fb43aa7f55c8150c7b4ecc171ee3e360#footnote-1">Clippy</a>.) It “can draw on larger server-based models, running on Apple silicon, to handle more complex requests for you while protecting your privacy.” The “larger models” will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24174786/apple-openai-partnership-chatgpt-wwdc">white-labeled ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://x.com/maxwinebach/status/1800277157135909005">plus Apple’s own small language models</a> (SLMs).</p>
<p>Mozilla, which <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/mozilla-signs-lucrative-3-year-google-search-deal-for-firefox">got $400+ million a year from Google (for search in the Firefox browser) starting in 2020</a>, announce on June 3 that they will be <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-builders-accelerator/">Building open, private AI with the Mozilla Builders Accelerator</a>. Jive:</p>
<blockquote><p>This program is designed to empower independent AI and machine learning engineers with the resources and support they need to thrive. It aims to cultivate a more innovative AI ecosystem, and it’s one of&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozillas-biggest-ai-moments/">Mozilla’s key initiatives</a>&nbsp;to make AI meaningfully impactful — alongside efforts like&nbsp;<a href="http://mozilla.ai/">Mozilla.ai</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-launches-responsible-ai-challenge/">Responsible AI Challenge</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-rise25-ai-nominations/">Rise25 Awards</a>.</p>
<p>The Mozilla Builders Accelerator’s inaugural theme is local AI, which involves running AI models and applications directly on personal devices like laptops, smartphones, or edge devices rather than depending on cloud-based services…</p>
<p>We chose Local AI as the theme for the Accelerator’s first cohort because it aligns with our core values of privacy, user empowerment, and open source innovation. This method offers several benefits including:</p>
 
 Privacy:&nbsp;Data stays on the local device, minimizing exposure to potential breaches and misuse. 
 Agency:&nbsp;Users have greater control over their AI tools and data. 
 Cost-effectiveness:&nbsp;Reduces reliance on expensive cloud infrastructure, lowering costs for developers and users. 
 Reliability:&nbsp;Local processing ensures continuous operation even without internet connectivity. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Looks to me like both of these are Big AI writ small. It’s “local,” not personal. It’s made to serve your needs with what BigAI offers through APIs. It is still essentially AIaaS (AI as a Service), rather than truly personal AI (pAI): <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">personalized</a> more than personal.</p>
<p>That’s also what I see when I read between the lines at <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/mozillaai/">Mozilla’s AI job openings</a>. Take <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/mozillaai/jobs/4357000007">platform engineer</a>. This person will (among other things), “assist in managing and orchestrating workloads across multiple cloud providers.” That’s fine. I’m sure true pAIs will do that too. But most of pAI will be more personal than that. It will deal with the mundanities of your everyday life. Not with coughing up answers that can only come from AIaaSes.</p>
<p>The problem with personalizing AI giant offerings is that they are large language models (LLM) trained on everything that can be crawled on the Internet, plus who knows what else. Not on your truly personal stuff. This is why “prompt engineering” worthy of the noun is ” <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04444">not for anybody</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prompt engineering is crucial for deploying LLMs but is poorly understood mathematically. We formalize LLM systems as a class of discrete stochastic dynamical systems to explore prompt engineering through the lens of control theory. We investigate the reachable set of output token sequences $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ for which there exists a control input sequence $\mathbf u$ for each $\mathbf y \in R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ that steers the LLM to output $\mathbf y$ from initial state sequence $\mathbf x_0$. We offer analytic analysis on the limitations on the controllability of self-attention in terms of reachable set, where we prove an upper bound on the reachable set of outputs $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ as a function of the singular values of the parameter matrices. We present complementary empirical analysis on the controllability of a panel of LLMs, including Falcon-7b, Llama-7b, and Falcon-40b. Our results demonstrate a lower bound on the reachable set of outputs $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ w.r.t. initial state sequences $\mathbf x_0$ sampled from the Wikitext dataset. We find that the correct next Wikitext token following sequence $\mathbf x_0$ is reachable over 97% of the time with prompts of $k\leq 10$ tokens. We also establish that the top 75 most likely next tokens, as estimated by the LLM itself, are reachable at least 85% of the time with prompts of $k\leq 10$ tokens. Intriguingly, short prompt sequences can dramatically alter the likelihood of specific outputs, even making the least likely tokens become the most likely ones. This control-centric analysis of LLMs demonstrates the significant and poorly understood role of input sequences in steering output probabilities, offering a foundational perspective for enhancing language model system capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>But all that stuff applies mostly when we’re prompting a big LLM system.</p>
<p>What about using AI in our own lives, where the data that matters most are in our calendars, contacts, financial and health records, our travels, our correspondence (email, chat, whatever)? And how about all the location data we might get from our cars, phone apps, and phone companies? These should be much easier for a pAI to gather, examine, and help us do useful things. Caring about much less data also means a pAI will be less likely to give wrong (hallucinated) answers.</p>
<p>Today the mental frame almost everybody uses for AI is the Big kind, ingesting everything they can get their crawlers on, and munching all of it in giant compute farms. Those systems are great for lots of stuff, but they still don’t deal with personal data listed in the last paragraph.</p>
<p>Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>Look at it this way. For each of us, there are three data pools:</p>
 
 The entire Net, which is what gets crawled by all the giant LLM operators, plus whatever else they can get their claws on. 
 One’s personal life, some of which is digitized in useful form (contacts, calendar, mail, stuff in folders inside PCs and attached drives). 
 Personal data that is in the hands of giants, but is rightfully ours. These include our driving record and driving practices (,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html">recorded by our late model cars and snitched to insurance companies and others</a>), our location data (kept and shared by car and phone carriers to the likes <a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/09/30/theres-a-multibillion-dollar-market-for-your-phones-location-data">of Google</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/how-federal-government-buys-our-cell-phone-location-data">the feds</a>), our TV viewing habits, (<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-stop-smart-tvs-from-snooping-on-you">gathered</a> by Google, Amazon, Roku, Apple, etc.). 
 
<p>The pAI greenfield is with the last two.</p>
<p>Tell us who is working on what there, preferably with open source, and not sitting on walled garden silicon.</p>
<p>[Later… ] Since readers told me I had small language models (SLMs) wrong in one of the paragraphs above, and I’m not sure I had them right, I rewrote them out of the piece. I invite readers to post comments to further correct and expand on the subject of pAIs and what they can do.</p>

<p>The BeL2 team is excited to announce the latest update to our Bitcoin-Elastos Layer 2 (BeL2) ecosystem: the Loan App Demo 0.2, now live at <a href="https://lending.bel2.org/">lending.bel2.org</a>. This update is a significant step forward in integrating Bitcoin with smart contract functionalities, enhancing both usability and security. Please remember this is a demo app today and not commercial, it is being built to showcase the underlying BeL2 technology as part of the larger roadmap. Let’s jump straight in!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s New in Loan App Demo 0.2 
  
<p>Since the last production release, showcased in Hong Kong, BeL2 has introduced several enhancements to improve user experience and functionality:</p>
 
 Enhanced Order Details: Comprehensive order details now include the status of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). 
 Manual BTC Transfer Confirmation: Borrowers and lenders can manually confirm BTC transfers before ZKP completion, saving time. 
 Tip Functionality: Borrowers and lenders can provide tips to each other to encourage faster confirmations. 
 Lender Time Unlock Branch 3: Adds flexibility for lenders. 
 Wallet Compatibility: Unisat is now supported throughout the entire process, expanding beyond the Essentials wallet. 
 Dynamic Timelock Values: The UI now dynamically follows timelocks provided by the contract, no longer relying on hardcoded values. 
 Repayment Countdown Bug Fix: Addressed the repayment countdown duration bug. 
 Order Cancellation: Lenders can cancel an order if it remains unpaid for more than six hours. 
 New Order Status Filter: A new “ongoing” status filter has been added. 
 Bug Fixes: Various minor bugs have been resolved. 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Updates to Essentials Wallet 
<p>To support the BeL2 loan app, Essentials has also received crucial updates:</p>
 
 Direct APK Download: Android users can now download the latest version (3.1.5) directly from <a href="https://d.web3essentials.io/">d.web3essentials.io</a>. 
 iOS Version Update: The iOS version has been updated and is available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/web3-essentials-crypto-wallet/id1568931743">App Store</a>. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 BeL2: Expanding Bitcoin’s Capabilities 
<p>BeL2 enhances Bitcoin’s scalability, programmability, and privacy, leveraging the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) while preserving Bitcoin’s integrity. BeL2 enables Bitcoin to interact with smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology.</p>
<p></p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Decentralised Loan App 
<p>The Loan App on BeL2 allows Bitcoin holders to use their BTC as collateral for loans in USDT. Key features include:</p>
 
 BTC as Collateral: Users lock their BTC in a smart contract to borrow USDT. 
 Fixed Interest Rates: Protection against crypto market volatility. 
 No Forced Liquidations: Safeguards against violent price fluctuations. 
 Smart Contract Automation: Ensures predictable, automated repayment schedules. 
 Relayers and ZKPs: Enhance security and privacy in transactions. 
 
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Vision Forward 
<p>BeL2’s focus is on refining its technology and providing robust SDKs for developers to build a wide array of financial applications on top of Bitcoin, executable on EVM ecosystems like Elastos Smart Chain. They are focused on continuously enhancing the efficiency and security of our ZKP mechanisms and optimise smart contract performance for seamless integration across blockchain ecosystems. The team are developing next comprehensive Software Development Kits (SDKs) to simplify the process of building financial applications on BeL2. These SDKs will include:</p>
 
 Smart Contract Templates: Pre-built templates for common financial applications. 
 API Integrations: Easy-to-use APIs for integrating Bitcoin with other blockchain ecosystems. 
 Developer Tools: Advanced debugging and testing tools. 
 Documentation and Tutorials: Extensive documentation and tutorials to guide developers. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Building a Financial Ecosystem 
<p>The Loan App serves as a framework for developing various financial applications, demonstrating how Bitcoin can be used as collateral within a decentralised financial ecosystem. Potential applications include:</p>
 
 Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs): Platforms for trading cryptocurrencies without a centralised intermediary. 
 Lending Platforms: Smart contract-based lending services with APR. 
 Payment Solutions: Enabling businesses to accept native Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for online platforms. 
 Investment Platforms: Decentralised platforms for investing in various assets using Bitcoin’s security and liquidity. 
 
<p>We invite the Elastos community to explore the capabilities of the Loan App Demo 0.2 and experience the integration of Bitcoin with smart contracts on the Elastos Smart Chain. Your participation and feedback are invaluable as we continue to innovate and expand the BeL2 ecosystem.</p>
<p>Join us at <a href="https://lending.bel2.org/">lending.bel2.org</a> and be part of the future where Bitcoin gains new functionalities and applications through BeL2. Together, we are building a more robust and decentralised financial landscape.</p>

<p>This document intends to provide a comprehensive understanding of attestation’s role in enhancing and advancing the digital security landscape, specifically with respect to authentication. It focuses on the core function of attestation: verifying the origin and integrity of user devices and their authentication materials. FIDO credentials are discussed with a focus on how they offer more secure alternatives than traditional password-based systems and how FIDO attestation enhances authentication security for both Relying Parties (RPs) and end-users. In this document, RPs are those entities that provide websites, applications and online services that require the need for secure user access by confirming the identity of users or other entities. FIDO Alliance’s historical journey is presented with practical analogies for understanding FIDO attestation, its enterprise-specific technical solutions, and privacy aspects involved in the attestation process.</p>



<p>Targeted for CISOs, security engineers, architects, and identity engineers, this white paper serves as a guide for professionals considering the adoption of FIDO within their enterprise ecosystem. Readers should possess a baseline understanding of FIDO technologies, the meaning of attestation, and have a desire to understand why and how to implement attestation.</p>

<p>New Committee Specification from the CACAO TC</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that CACAO Security Playbooks Version 2.0 from the OASIS Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) for Cyber Security TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) is a schema and taxonomy for cybersecurity playbooks. The CACAO specification describes how these playbooks can be created, documented, and shared in a structured and standardized way across organizational boundaries and technological solutions. This specification defines the CACAO Layout Extension for the purpose of visually representing CACAO playbooks accurately and consistently across implementations.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>CACAO Layout Extension Version 1.0<br>Committee Specification 01<br>04 April 2024</p>

<p>Earlier this year, we announced a <a href="https://elastos.info/news/beatfarm-elastos-blockchain-music-collaboration/">collaboration</a> with BeatFarm, a project working to disrupt the music industry with a Superfan dApp. So, what is a Superfan dApp? In this article, we will explore BeatFarm and their mission to empower creators and fans alike. Let’s get stuck in!</p>
<p>What is a Superfan App?</p>
<p>A Superfan app is a platform that helps content creators engage deeply with their most dedicated followers. It offers exclusive content, direct communication, and a community which fosters stronger and longer connections. By providing insights into fan behaviour and allowing monetisation through personalized content and merchandise, these apps enhance both engagement and revenue for creators.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/beatfarm_io">BeatFarm</a> exists to empower creators, establishing a direct and profitable avenue of engagement with their superfans. BeatFarm’s mission is to empower the artist by providing resources and tools which increase the overall value of their content through direct collaboration with their most loyal fans. By eliminating the intermediaries, BeatFarm guarantees that every artist has complete creative freedom and ensures they maximise their potential revenue. BeatFarm uses sophisticated technology like blockchain and smart contracts to ensure, in essence, that an artist is ensured to be compensated in perpetuity for the creative work they have developed.</p>

<p>At its core, BeatFarm uses the infrastructure of <a href="https://elastos.dev/">Elastos</a> to create an open, transparent, and secure way of monetisation for artists. The utility of blockchain and smart contracts allows artists to easily create, share, and monetise their content. Everything – be it songs, virtual events, or merchandise, is auto-embedded with smart contracts that trigger payment at the snap of a finger whenever that content is used. BeatFarm even creates superfan channels that have various grading levels of payment mechanisms, varied analytics for measurement of fan behaviour, and a deep e-commerce channels. This gives an artist an ecosystem which provides an entire commercialization network for maximum revenue generation through superfan engagement.</p>
<p>What BeatFarm Offers</p>
<p>BeatFarm offers a superfan platform that clears and fairly values the proposition for the artist to generate more revenue from their content. Its key offerings include direct monetisation, empowerment to self-monetise a piece of content and therefore assuring that every artist earns more for every content created and shared.</p>
 
 Blockchain and the Use of Smart Contracts: BeatFarm’s use of blockchain technology and smart contracts ensures transparent, reliable, and automated payments in perpetuity. This consequently ensures the continued monetisation of artist’s content. 
 Agile Content Creation: From track creation, live hosting, and merchandise selling to engaging&nbsp; with the fans in real-time, everything can be done across the BeatFarm platform. 
 Superfan Apps: Their latest launch: superfan apps providing several payment levels, analytics to measure fan behaviour, and an e-commerce channel that helps maximise revenue.

<p>DIF's ED Kim Hamilton Duffy, Wayne Chang, CEO of SpruceID and Professor Linda Jeng, a lawyer, former financial regulator and founder of Digital Self Labs, took to the stage at EIC to discuss how Decentralized Identity (DI) can help mitigate threats posed by Large Language Models (LLMs), ably moderated by KuppingerCole's Anne Bailey. </p><p>The panelists' thoughts on the nature and scale of the problem</p><p>Wayne: “Until now, we’ve been able to get by holding a driver's license up to a webcam, but with new AI tech you can fool these systems - this is already showing up at the edges. AI voice generation is really good now. People are saying it's not a valid identification factor any more. </p><p>"Phishing attacks are also on the rise, for example people pretending to be a romantic partner before encouraging the target to invest in crypto. Using AI bots for mimicry makes it easy for scammers to quickly establish trust".</p><p>Linda: "The rights conferred by GDPR, to decide with whom you share your data, are already difficult to enforce. Deepfakes will make this even harder. </p><p>"I’ve been meeting East Berliners here who tell me surveillance capitalism reminds them of what it was like growing up under the Stasi".</p><p>Kim: "A lot of the threats are not new, what we are talking about is an acceleration of these. We were already uncomfortable online. Now, with the things we’re seeing due to the advent of cheap, easy-to-use deepfake tech, we are past breaking point."&nbsp;</p><p>How Decentralized Identity can help mitigate these threats</p><p>Wayne: “We need to add authenticity to communication. We don’t want to present a strong ID every time we want to use a chat app, so it makes sense to embed DI into comms channels, to prove I’m real.</p><p>“I define DI as the ability of any party to play the role of issuer, holder and verifier, based on cryptographic trust. Having digital credentials issued by many parties will enable trusted content certification, giving us confidence about what goes into an AI model.</p><p>Linda: “It’s not about identity, it's about data governance, and creating chains of trust to combat risks from synthetic data. </p><p>Kim. “I think of DI as a set of standards, technologies and principles that restore individuals’ control over their data. With these technologies, we have the possibility to build products and solutions on strong foundations.&nbsp;</p><p>"One of the key aspects with DI is the ability to provide a consistent experience across channels, creating a much safer environment for individuals. For example if you get a phone call from your CEO asking you to transfer money, with DI you can be sure it’s them and not a deep fake of their voice.</p><p>Recommendations for solution developers&nbsp;</p><p>Wayne: “Focus on the value for the end user. The DI standards uniquely enable you to provide a great user experience while also ensuring privacy and solution sustainability, including the ability to swap out vendors if needed without disrupting the service you’re providing."&nbsp;</p><p>Linda: "We have grown used to not having to pay for digital services. The incentives need to change. Think about new models where we get paid for our data, enabled by content authenticity and DI tech."</p><p>Kim: “We have to balance usability and privacy. It’s clear people want to use LMM based tech in their lives. On the other hand we’re seeing increasingly aggressive interfaces, for example asking you to give full access to your documents or even your desktop. With DI, finally there are ways to provide people both the convenience AND the trust”</p><p>Other opportunities</p><p>Wayne: “There’s exciting work happening at Kantara Initiative around automated compliance with data regulations. Imagine giving someone a license to your personal data. Then, if you're a Data Processor it’s easy to automatically demonstrate compliance using consent receipts. </p><p>"It makes the “Accept all” problem go away, as you can decide what kind of consent receipts should be automatically generated for which parties.”&nbsp;</p><p>Linda: “We need to spend time educating policymakers and the public, but in the end it comes down to end user demand for solutions. There’s no legal requirement for open banking in the US, but it’s happening anyway as people want to share their banking data with fintechs. Creating a smooth, easy UX will help to create the demand.”</p><p>Kim: "There’s a huge role for expanding the scope of trust to content authenticity, similar to the browser check mark that shows a website has a valid SSL certificate. C2PA (link) is fantastic, and is already using VCs. However, there is a risk of getting locked into who can verify these claims, if we use Certificate Authorities (CAs) as the root of trust. We are talking to them and there’s strong interest in generalizing the trust model.”</p><p>The panelists' key takeaways</p><p>Wayne: "One of the early goals of the internet pioneers was to have your personal agent in cyberspace. We need to get back to that original definition of personal agents, taking advantage of them to certify our content and things done on our behalf."&nbsp;</p><p>Linda: "We need the right to certify our data as authentic. Right now we can’t tell what’s synthetic versus from an original creator. It’s not judging whether the data is good or bad, it just gives us additional info about the data we’re using."</p><p>Kim: "Everything we’re talking about is already here, its just about connecting the pieces. If you're building products, this is a great time to get involved. Come and talk to us at DIF!"</p><p>Linda Jeng, Wayne Chang, Kim Hamilton Duffy, Kristy Lam and Elissa Maercklein published <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4854347&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Chains of Trust: Combatting Synthetic Data Risks of AI</a> earlier today.</p>

<p>Two predominant themes stood out at last week’s Identiverse 2024 conference in Las Vegas. First, there was the issue of how to defend against rapidly evolving advances in deepfakes, especially for live remote verification. Second, there was a common assumption that widespread adoption of passkeys is right around the corner, and that organizations must prepare to manage and secure passkeys when they become mainstream.</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CEO Andrew Shikiar touched on both topics in a session Wednesday (May 29) titled “<a href="https://identiverse.com/idv24/session/2089529/">FIDO, Passkeys and the State of Passwordless</a>.”</p>



<p>He announced the alliance’s new certification standard for facial-recognition technologies. The first (and so far only) organization to receive that certification is iProov. In a <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv24/session/2089484/">keynote address</a> Thursday (May 30), Shikiar added that the FIDO Alliance was ready to offer independent testing of facial-recognition technologies.</p>



<p>As for passkeys, the passwordless, FIDO-certified PKI-based WebAuthn credentials that reside on hardware keys, smartphones, PCs and in the cloud, Shikiar said the question was not if consumers would adopt them, but when.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance’s goal is “to make passkeys inevitable,” Shikiar said. No one at Identiverse expressed any doubt that they would be.</p>

<p>Today, the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> announced <a href="https://hrf.org/hrf-bitcoin-development-fund-grants-1-billion-satoshis-to-14-projects-worldwide/">a Bitcoin Development Fund grant</a> to Blockchain Common for its continued support of the development of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">FROST</a>, including holding <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/#upcoming-events">two more virtual FROST meetings for the developer community</a>.</p>

<p>FROST is a powerful quorum threshold signature scheme built using Schnorr signatures that offers many advantages over existing signature methodologies. That includes crucial integration with Distributed Key Generation: private keys can be created in pieces by discrete online servers, with no server ever having the whole key. Altogether, FROST can improve privacy, resilience, and security alike, making it truly a next-generation key-management system.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has long looked forward to the mainstream deployment of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">Schnorr</a> and FROST because of their considerable benefits over traditional key-management and signature schemes. We held out first <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">FROST Implementer’s Round Table</a> in 2023 to give FROST library implementers and cryptographers a chance to talk with each other, and we were asked to do more. We also hosted a <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/summary/">FROST Developer’s Meeting</a> this year where we worked with Jesse Posner to offer wallet developers a look at what the future of FROST means.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons is thrilled by HRF’s recognition of our work. Their funding makes it possible to continue this work this year: we’ll be hosting a second round table for FROST library implementers &amp; cryptographers on September 18, then a second meeting for wallet developers on December 4. If you’re a cryptographer or library implementer, sign up for our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#frost-implementers">FROST implementer’s list</a> and if you’re a wallet developer, sign up for our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#gordian-developers">Gordian developer’s list</a> to receive the announcements on these events. Admission is free thanks to the support of HRF!</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has also placed FROST on our developmental road map for the year, to consider incorporating it our reference code and tools. More details as additional funding and our schedule firm up.</p>

<p>In the meantime, put September 18 and/or December 4 on your calendars so that you can join Blockchain Commons for these important events that will unveil the future of multi-party signatures and key management.</p>

<p>Digital identity pioneers Markus Sabadello and Nat Sakimura crossed swords on stage during an absorbing discussion at EIC in Berlin this evening. </p><p>Markus kicked off by asking why the internet has become highly centralized, in spite of its beginnings as a peer-to-peer network. </p><p>Markus observed that technology embodies the values of the community that spawns it. He illustrated this by comparing W3C versus SD JWT VCs - contending that the W3C format offers more "Liberte" - as well as DIDComm versus OID4VC - arguing that DIDComm features more "Fraternite". Here's a flavor of their conversation (apologies to both for any mistakes in capturing your comments).</p><p>Markus: "One of the biggest discussions right now is how to get a VC into a wallet and present it. With OpenID4VC, there is asymmetry between issuer and holder, whereas with DIDComm, you have a model where everyone can connect to everyone else and establish true peer-to-peer relationships."</p><p>Nat: "The same can be said for STMP. The philosophy was that everyone runs their own mail server. I do, but how many others do? Instead, we have enormous mail servers like Office 365 and gmail. Just the fact that protocol provides Liberte, doesn't ensure decentralization."  </p><p>Markus: "No one said Liberte was easy. The easiest thing is to log in with Facebook!". </p><p>Nat: "What's the cost of enabling Liberte? It will make things more complex and error prone. </p><p>"You need to specify what is being decentralized. For example, IDPs are so-called centralized, yet there are hundreds of thousands of them. The number of wallets will be even more than the size of the population, but thinking about wallet providers, it will probably be far fewer than the number of IDPs. </p><p>"It's not only the technical architecture we need to look at, but also the operational and legal controls. Don't try to solve everything in a technical way."</p><p>Markus: "SSI arose to ensure we can have the same social structures and protections we enjoy in the real world, in the digital world.  We want Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite, and these ideas are baked into SSI standards."</p><p>Nat: "The goal is not the technology, but how to achieve Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite. Don't get too fixated on the technology." </p><p>Markus: "We can agree on that!"</p>

<p>DIF’s ED Kim Hamilton Duffy and SC member Steve McCown delivered a  Technical Mastery Sprint to a packed audience on the opening day of the 2024 European Identity and Cloud conference. </p><p>Steve highlighted the scale of internet security and data privacy problems, noting that some 25 billion login credentials had been leaked to the dark web by 2022, a 65% increase from 2020. Identity is the hackers’ real objective, since this is what enables lucrative fraud schemes. This threat impacts both individuals - what happens when your biometrics are stolen? - and organizations - 98% of whom have relationships with at least one vendor that has experienced a breach within the past 2 years, according to the Cyentia Institute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve and Kim introduced key decentralized identity building blocks including Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), DID methods, DIDComm, wallets and agents, and how they can help address the current privacy and security challenges.&nbsp;They emphasized that these elements can be readily incorporated into existing systems, demonstrated by the growing use of decentralized identity to create on-ramps between Web2 and Web3 (and now Web5) applications. </p><p>Sam Curren demonstrated a new protocol that bridges DIDComm and OpenIDConnect, facilitating eIDAS-compliant integration of DI within the EU digital identity wallet to enable new use cases.</p><p>Steve and Kim spoke about how trust is established in a world where anyone can issue credentials, and highlighted several approaches that are gaining traction, including Trust over IP Foundation Trust Registries and DIF Credential Trust Establishment.&nbsp;</p><p>Kim outlined credential issuance and exchange flows and highlighted some implementation challenges, solutions and best practices, including credential storage and key management, and provided tips for managing a DI project and how to get started. She also outlined several existing government, educational, workforce management and supply chain use cases, and wrapped up the session with a live demonstration of DID creation and credential issuance using the Veramo CLI toolkit.&nbsp;</p><p>The session generated strong audience engagement, with Kim and Steve answering questions on topics including the trust relationship between issuers and relying parties, delegated authority (e.g. where a parent manages their child’s credentials), credential revocation, reconciling multiple user accounts, the need for centralized record keeping (e.g. for regulatory compliance), key storage and wallet recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>Look out for a more in-depth post where we provide their answers! </p>

<p>Alan Mayo goes beyond digital identity to consider identity in person, online, and by telephone. He has developed a structured way of describing identity that has, until now, been severely lacking. Alan questions the currently accepted status quo, suggesting that we will need to pass through an Identity 2.5 phase before reaching Identity 3.0.</p>



<p>With topics from verifiable credentials and passkeys to digital wallets and identity ecosystems, you can find Alan’s Digital Identity newsletters <a href="https://www.newsletters.identity25.com/">here</a>.</p>

 Setting up a successful leadership transition <p>After years of working with and for a variety of different kinds of social impact organisations — from educational institutions to cooperative federations, small community-based charities to global non-profits — we’ve been lucky to see how our strategy and “critical friend” services can help leaders set foundations for an organisational programme or initiative.</p><p>It’s only lately that we’ve thought about some of what we do through the lens of “Fractional Leadership”. We are experts in cooperation, learning, technology and community, which means the type of leadership that we bring into projects is quite <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-business-case-for-working-openly-and-transparently-867e3fb04588">specifically OPEN</a>.</p> What is Fractional Leadership? cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Fractional leadership is essentially outsourcing a role or a part of a role to an expert who can help you hit the ground running. Such positions are great when you know you need a new department (e.g. Digital Transformation) or if you’re kicking off a new project that needs someone to lead. They’re also helpful when you know you want to hire someone full-time, but want to find the right person for your organisation.</p><p>Fractional leadership provides you and your organisation with some flexibility because it gives you the time and space to make the right decisions in staffing and for your organisation as a whole. It’s potentially less expensive than hiring someone full time and can be explicitly bound in a statement of work. It’s also a way to test whether or not a particular new position makes sense to your organisation.</p><p>It is a way to work with diverse experts who have wide-ranging experience that you would like to apply to your organisation as it grows, changes and transitions.</p> The shadow side of fractional leadership cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>As with any concept we pull from the world of bizniz into the social impact space, we need to be aware of how it can manifest inside an organisation that isn’t only trying to maximise&nbsp;profits.</p><p>Often, organisations in our space are unaware that what they need is a leader and look to us to create a specific “thing”. “We just need a digital strategy,” or “We just need a training programme,” are things that often come up in projects that obviously need something more. Working openly and helping people to understand how technology and funding intermingle, how community drives participation, how recognition motivates or how a learning programme can scale all require leadership.</p><p>Often funding in the social impact space is to develop a specific thing, not the impact that thing should have. Complex realities also mean that someone who might be a leader in one context might not have what it takes to lead in your context. This is why an open leader is so important. Fractional leadership in the open is a rare thing&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>A fractional leader needs to be adaptable and find ways to stay within the bounds the organisation has, while also setting a project or department up for future&nbsp;impact.</p> Preparing for a new colleague cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Still, experienced fractional leaders are well versed in making do with what they’re given. They can lay out plans and programmes with the future in mind. The strategies and processes put in place during a time of transition reflect a moment in time. Setting them up as iterative and designing them to evolve empowers future&nbsp;leaders.</p><p>We’ve offered “critical friend” services to help onboard the people who will take over from what we were asked to start. We’ve advise on workload and priority based on community engagement in tandem with organisational goals. We like to do the work of documenting and establishing open, productive processes and policies help future collaborators take over when the time&nbsp;comes.</p> Is Fractional Leadership for&nbsp;you? cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Your fractional leader can&nbsp;start:</p>  Developing a strategy that focuses on long term social&nbsp;impact  Creating processes or frameworks to measure impact or create processes for gathering data and&nbsp;insights  Building assets to begin implementing the change needed to achieve the impact you’re looking&nbsp;for  Supporting and working with others on your team to co-design principles and approaches that support your&nbsp;mission  Determining the skills and competencies necessary to lead the project, programme or department they’re working within and helping your organisation find someone to take&nbsp;over  <p>The whole point is that you can bring in engaged experts to help you get something going while looking for your forever person. There are lots of people working in the social impact space who have deep expertise in everything from finance to HR to product development and&nbsp;design.</p><p>Fractional leadership is something you can simply try out. As you create briefs or write out job descriptions just ask yourself, “Would a designated fractional leader give me more time and space to ensure this is a long-term success?” If so, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact">get in&nbsp;touch</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/fractional-leadership-in-social-impact-organisations-5c03daf9e08e">Fractional Leadership in Social Impact Organisations</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>DIF at ID4Africa</p>
<p>DIF was honoured to participate at the ID4Africa 2024 AGM in Cape Town last week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIF's Catherine Nabbala and Damian Glover delivered a plenary presentation to the conference, together with Anand Acharya of Bhutan National Digital Identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The session highlighted DIF’s work within the broader landscape of national ID schemes and provided real-world insights into the implementation of decentralized identity by the Thai and Bhutanese governments.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
The presentation elicited engagement with DIF from a variety of quarters, including several countries that are rolling out national digital identity programs, and others looking to do so.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our conversations with stakeholders evidenced a strong desire for Africa-specific digital infrastructure, and awakening interest in decentralized identity as a tool to empower citizens and promote cross-border interoperability while avoiding lock-in to ecosystems controlled by outside interests.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Universal Resolver<br>
<br>
The <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/iota-digital-identity-method-gets-support-from-decentralized-id-universal-resolver/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">IOTA Digital Identity (DID) method is now resolvable using the DIF's Universal Resolver</a>. The Universal Resolver is DIF-hosted infrastructure enabling resolution of any registered DID method through its flexible plugin model. This widely-used service is invaluable to the decentralized identity community. Accordingly,  DIF has invested in boosting its reliability and stability to ensure uptime and availability of the Universal Resolver.</p>
<p>The Universal Resolver was generously developed and contributed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/danube-tech/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Danube Tech</a>.</p>
<p>You can experiment with the Universal Resolver at <a href="https://uniresolver.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://uniresolver.io</a> and even follow our simple process for allowing your own DID method to run in the Uniresolver.</p>
<p>As a non-profit, DIF funds and hosts public good infrastructure like the Universal Resolver. Support our efforts by <a href="https://lnkd.in/gTyk6x4c?ref=blog.identity.foundation">joining DIF</a>.</p>
<p>DIF adds new liaison IOVF</p>
<p><br>
IOV Foundation’s mission is to create a new open financial ecosystem that provides accessible and fair services. They focus on Latin America, specifically demonstrating solutions for interoperability between governments (countries, cities) and organizations in Central and South America. Their current pilot focuses on building an identity platform for the Argentine Chamber of E-Commerce, aimed at managing event tickets and board meeting attendance.</p>

  🗓️ ️Community Events  
<p>Bridging the Gap: OpenID and DIDComm<br>
<br>
SC member Sam Curren and Artur Philipp from IDUnion unveiled OpenID-DIDComm, a new protocol that bridges OpenID4VC and DIDComm, enabling credential issuers and holders to communicate securely in a way that complies with EU requirements for credential exchange.</p>
<p>The community call was highly anticipated and was well attended, despite public holidays in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Following an introduction by DIF’s Senior Director of Community Engagement, Limari Navarrete, Artur noted that there are many reasons why issuers and holders will need to communicate, though OpenID4VCI (OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance) only supports the initial credential exchange.</p>
<p>For example, an issuer may need to notify a holder that a credential has expired or been revoked. On the other hand, a holder may want to request a batch of additional credentials from the issuer (single-use SD-JWT credentials will be important to prevent correlation of the holder).</p>
<p>The mutual authentication that is integral to the DIDComm protocol provides resistance to phishing attacks, compared with approaches requiring switches to channels such as SMS or email. What’s more, the security properties of a DIDComm connection do not degrade over time. These and other features make DIDComm an excellent choice to establish a persistent communication channel between issuers and holders.</p>
<p>The next step is for the project team to validate that the new protocol does not interfere with OpenID4VCI, in consultation with the group developing the OpenID specification. Enabling DIDComm connections to be established over OpenID4VP (OpenID for Verifiable Presentations) will follow later.</p>

  <p>By Hany Farid, UC Berkeley Professor, CAI Advisor</p><p>News and trends shaping our understanding of generative AI technology and its applications.</p><p>Hardly a day goes by that I don't receive several emails or calls asking me to review a piece of content to determine if it is real or fake. Time permitting, I'm usually happy to oblige because I think it is important to help reporters, fact checkers, and the general public verify what is real and expose what is fake.</p><p>In this blog series as well as its earlier <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">incarnation</a>, I've spoken about a range of different analysis techniques that my team has developed and regularly uses to validate an audio file, image, or video. This type of reactive technology that works after a piece of content surfaces, alongside proactive tools like <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/">Content Credentials</a> that work as a piece of content is being created or edited, helps us navigate a fast and complex online world where it is increasingly difficult to tell what is real and what is fake. </p><p>With <a href="https://openai.com/index/understanding-the-source-of-what-we-see-and-hear-online/">OpenAI</a> and other companies committing to labeling AI-generated content, consumers can soon look forward to Content Credentials showing up on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-adopts-c2pa-standard-patrick-corrigan-kwldf/?trackingId=4gnjmapwRsmugUNqwj0fRw%3D%3D">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/tiktok-joins-content-authenticity-efforts">TikTok</a>, and their other social media news feeds.</p><p>Over the past few weeks I have received emails from fact-checking organizations asking if I would analyze: </p>  <p>An image of a shark on a flooded Los Angeles highway that Senator Ted Cruz <a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1693628732982841728">shared</a> on X.</p>  <p>An audio recording claiming to be Michelle Obama announcing she is running for President in the 2024 election.</p>  <p>As nearly a billion people head to the polls in India, dozens of videos of Indian politicians up and down the ticket saying all manner of offensive or highly improbable things.</p>  <p>At first I thought that these otherwise reliable fact checkers had lost their minds. Why would they possibly be asking me about these obviously absurd pieces of content? After a quick online search, however, I found that each item was gaining traction.</p><p>We have entered a world in which even the most absurd and unlikely claims are believed by a not insignificant number of people. A decade ago, around 4% of Americans believed in unfounded theories including the idea that intergalactic lizard species control society, and 7% believe the moon landing was faked. Starting in 2020, however, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08830v2">belief in unfounded theories</a> saw a startling rise. </p><p>This is a stunning and worrisome increase in the belief in unfounded conspiracies at the same time when the internet is supposed to be giving us unprecedented access to information and knowledge. But of course, while the internet has democratized the distribution of and access to information, it has made no distinction between good and bad information — and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aap9559">bad information seems to spread faster and further than good</a>.</p><p>I am not saying that we should blindly believe everything we are told by the media, the government, or scientific experts. We should ask hard questions, consume information from a broad set of voices, be vigilant when confronted with day-to-day news, and be skeptical when confronted with particularly incredible claims. Whether you agree with them or not, reporters and fact checkers are, for the most part, serious people doing a serious job, and they are trying to get the story right. </p><p>So by all means, let's use technology to help us distinguish the real from the fake, but let's not let technology be a substitute for common sense. This past month has seen a continued rise in the quality and sophistication of generative AI images, audio, and video, so buckle up because we are going to have to deploy all of our common sense alongside the types of technologies that I will continue to discuss in the coming months.</p><p>Finally, I don't know why, but a constant over my past 25 years in the space of media forensics is that images with sharks are almost always fake, so much so that I'm not even sure any more if sharks are real. </p>

<p>This paper explores the emerging practices surrounding the use of synced passkeys which allow passkey use across multiple devices by syncing the passkeys over the cloud, specifically addressing the initial choices and considerations for service providers (aka relying parties or RPs). These practices are in their early stages and are likely to progress, since operating systems, browsers, and passkey providers are still in a phase of enhancing functionality. This document outlines crucial areas such as registration, authentication, passkey management, and accessibility for RPs to consider and presents a range of emerging approaches for adopting this technology. The objective is to guide RPs through these budding strategies, acknowledging that the specifics of ensuring secure and convenient passkey usage may evolve as the digital landscape continues to advance.</p>



<p>This paper is written with independence for each section, allowing readers to read specific topics of interest without the need to read the entire paper from the beginning.</p>



<p>This white paper is intended for various stakeholders of relying parties, including non-developers, such as information security executives, product owners, identity and access management practitioners, UI/UX designers, and accessibility practitioners.</p>

<p>An innovative collaboration has emerged in the AI sector, as <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a>, a leading AI platform developer headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, and Trace Labs, the core development company of <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a>, based in Hong Kong, have just announced a strategic partnership aimed at supporting the development of the Knowledge Layer — the Internet of Knowledge.</p><p>This partnership signifies that two prominent players in the AI industry have come together to support a decentralized ecosystem where AI agents and infrastructure partners collaborate within the decentralized knowledge graph (DKG) landscape.</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to building a Verifiable Internet for AI, and this partnership marks the beginning of their collaboration with SingularityNET’s leading AI platform and robust ecosystem.</p><p>In some of the key highlights of this partnership, Trace Labs is tasked with developing sophisticated infrastructure that allows for efficient access and retrieval of information stored on the DKG, tackling challenges of AI hallucinations, bias, and model collapse due to an explosion in the amount of synthetic data produced by AI. This effort is aimed at enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of the decentralized knowledge graph within the OriginTrail network.</p><p>SingularityNET will then provide users access to its decentralized platform, where specialized AI models and Large Language Models (LLMs) can be purchased and used for data analysis. These models are designed to operate seamlessly with the data supported by the OriginTrail network, fostering a more robust ecosystem. The company will also develop AI models that can be trained directly on the Decentralized Knowledge Graph. This approach helps realize the shared vision of the two partners; eliminating the need for data centralization, and leveraging the decentralized nature of the blockchain to enhance privacy and security.</p><p>Leveraging SingularityNET’s leading position in mission-critical research of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Trace Labs’ experience in commercializing Web3 and AI solutions, the strategic partnership is in particular aimed at solving the real world challenges with decentralized AI within the key sectors, such as Industry 4.0, decentralized science (DeSci), real world assets (RWA), and education.</p><p>Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO of SingularityNET, stated, “As we move from an Internet of documents, media and apps to an internet of knowledge and AI, the basic composition of the Internet as a ‘decentralized network of decentralized networks’ becomes ever more important. Both SingularityNET and Trace Labs have powerful capability to grow decentralized networks around knowledge graphs and associated AI capabilities; connecting these networks together into a cross-linked, cross-token meta-network will yield a host of different synergies enabling a broad-based boost in intelligent functionality. As a practical example: Putting together a subgraph of OriginTrail’s DKG decentralized knowledge graph covering shipping logistics, with a knowledge meta-graph living in the OpenCog Hyperon system deployed on SingularityNET covering the timing of events in various markets, one could achieve an unprecedented level of emergent knowledge in the minds of AI agents carrying out supply-chain planning and forecasting. SingularityNET’s new MeTTa-Motto tool integrating Hyperon symbolic AI with LLMs and other deep neural nets could play a critical role here. Similar examples exist in every vertical market, which gives this partnership an almost unbounded potential for economic benefit and human&nbsp;good.”</p><p>Žiga Drev, Managing Director of Trace Labs, added, “The benefits of AI are limitless and so are the risks, like hallucinations and model collapse as the growth in synthetic data outpaces the provision of real world data. A truly open AI that fosters inclusion and a more equitable distribution of value can only be achieved through a collaborative and modular approach. We are proud to partner with SingularityNet, founded and led by the visionary Dr. Ben Goertzel, who coined the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Working alongside the leading visionaries at the convergence of crypto and AI opens exciting opportunities to accelerate real-world adoption of neuro-symbolic AI, combining the power of OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and SingularityNET’s specialized marketplace for Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI&nbsp;models.”</p><p>Both organizations will also engage in collaborative marketing and social media efforts to promote their partnership and the innovations it brings to the blockchain world, the AI industry, and the intersection of these two sectors. The two partners are also mutually exploring and plan to integrate AI services into Trace Labs’ DKG and paranets.</p><p>The partnership is about working together today to solve the challenges of tomorrow; synergizing blockchains and knowledge graphs for safe, verifiable AI that emphasizes secure and privacy-preserving mechanisms for user authentication and authorization within the knowledge layer, and ultimately ensuring all data processing by users is rooted in their&nbsp;consent.</p> About SingularityNET <p><a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a> was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel with the mission of creating a decentralized, democratic, inclusive and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). An AGI is not dependent on any central entity, is open to anyone and is not restricted to the narrow goals of a single corporation or even a single country. The SingularityNET team includes seasoned engineers, scientists, researchers, entrepreneurs, and marketers. Our core platform and AI teams are further complemented by specialized teams devoted to application areas such as finance, robotics, biomedical AI, media, arts and entertainment.</p> About OriginTrail <p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> is an ecosystem building a Verifiable Internet for AI, providing an inclusive framework that tackles the world’s challenges in the AI era, such as hallucinations, bias, and model collapse, by ensuring the provenance and verifiability of data used by AI systems.

<p>Conformance with the AuthZEN request/response protocol marks a significant milestone in simplifying and standardizing authorization approaches</p>
 &nbsp; 
 The OpenID Foundation led the standardization of authentication protocols with OpenID Connect and now we are proud to host the AuthZEN Working Group as they seek to do the same for authorization.”<p></p>
 — Gail Hodges, Executive Director for OpenID Foundation 
 
<p>LAS VEGAS, NV, USA, May 28, 2024 /<a href="https://www.einpresswire.com/">EINPresswire.com</a>/ — The OpenID Foundation AuthZEN Working Group announced today that select leading authorization vendors successfully achieved conformance with the AuthZEN request/response protocol, marking a significant step in bringing interoperability and standardization to the authorization market. The industry leaders include 3Edges, Aserto, Axiomatics, Cerbos, Permit.io, Rock Solid Knowledge, SGNL.ai, Strata Identity, and Thales, demonstrating their commitment to documenting common authorization patterns, defining standard mechanisms for communication between authorization components, and recommending best practices for developing secure applications.</p>
<p>Established through the OpenID Foundation, the AuthZEN Working Group’s focus is to tackle the complexities of authorization, to promote decoupling and externalizing authorization logic from applications, and to simplify the implementation of a robust authorization layer that can be edited and audited with ease within diverse application environments. With members from leading authorization vendors, the group aims to unify and standardize the way authorization decisions are enforced across varying platforms, with an initial focus on a specification that ensures interoperability and integration between policy enforcement points and decision points. This initiative draws on the expertise of leading companies in the security and authorization space, fostering a collaborative approach to enhancing the scalability and security of access control systems.</p>
<p>The AuthZEN Working Group is currently focused on three key areas to improve interoperability:<br>1. Defining a standard for the communication flow between policy enforcement points and policy decision engines.<br>2. Creating a standard for communicating access policies to policy decision points.<br>3. Identifying and documenting common usage patterns and recommended best practices.</p>
<p>The working group recently completed successful interoperability testing, which included a defined interop scenario in the form of a Todo application. Participating companies include 3Edges, Aserto, Axiomatics, Cerbos, Permit.io, Rock Solid Knowledge, SGNL.ai, Strata Identity and Thales – all of whom achieved success in this testing.</p>
<p>The AuthZEN Working Group is open to all organizations committed to the goal of improving interoperability and standardization in authorization. For more information, visit <a href="https://openid.net/wg/authzen/">https://openid.net/wg/authzen/</a> and <a href="https://authzen-interop.net/">https://authzen-interop.net/</a>.</p>
<p>Quotes:<br>Gail Hodges, executive director for OpenID Foundation<br>“As more and more players offer externalized authorization, it is critical that we ensure safe and secure patterns across implementations. The OpenID Foundation led the standardization of authentication protocols with OpenID Connect and now, ten years later, we are proud to host the AuthZEN Working Group as they seek to do the same for authorization.”</p>
<p>Derek Small, co-founder and president for 3Edges<br>“The OpenID AuthZEN Working Group is tackling authorization challenges faced by organizations of every nature and size. Dynamic authorization is cataloging the rich authorization patterns that support authorization decisions between organizations and varying platforms. As this Working Group continues its mission to address interoperability and standards in support of authorization policies of today and those of the future, 3Edges remains committed to supporting the critical workings of the AuthZEN Working Group and to supporting this interop at Identiverse 2024.”</p>
<p>Omri Gazitt, co-founder and CEO for Aserto<br>“Interoperable authentication is mostly a solved problem, thanks to standards such as SAML and OpenID Connect. But we haven’t yet had our “OIDC moment” in the authorization space. The OpenID AuthZEN Working Group is the definitive effort to get us there, and Aserto is proud to be among the first vendors to adopt it. “</p>
<p>David Brossard, chief technology officer (CTO) for Axiomatics<br>“Put simply, the goal here is to become the OAuth of authorization. We’ve taken the lessons learned from the past 15 years working to implement authorization for our customers along with the standardization efforts within OASIS XACML to produce an even simpler, more lightweight PEP-PDP protocol. Axiomatics is proud to support the work to facilitate integration between applications and externalized authorization services, raising the quality and security of authorization.”</p>
<p>Alex Olivier, co-founder and chief product officer (CPO) for Cerbos<br>“Cerbos is a proud contributor and early adopter of the OpenID AuthZEN specification enabling external authorization portability. This standardization effort provides software builders with the confidence to adopt a more secure and scalable access control layer in their applications. “</p>
<p>Or Weis, CEO for Permit.io<br>“Enterprises spend months and sometimes years struggling to apply authorization to their applications. Reinventing wheels due to the lack of standards in the space. At Permit.io, we’re excited to be early backers of the AuthZEN standard and its promise to unify simplicity across the landscape.”</p>
<p>Andrew Clymer, co-founder for Rock Solid Knowledge<br>“With many years of experience building single sign-on (SSO) solutions based on open standards, we are proud to support the AuthZEN Working Group in delivering open standards for authorization. As an early adopter of the draft standard, we are excited to make our .NET authorization engine, Enforcer, accessible to heterogeneous environments.”</p>
<p>Atul Tulshibagwale, chief technology officer (CTO) for SIGNL.ai<br>“The AuthZEN standard will be critical to achieving externalized management of authorization. SGNL is proud to have initiated standardization activity by contributing the first draft spec and is happy to participate in the interoperability event.”</p>
<p>Gerry Gebel, vice president of product and standards for Strata Identity<br>“Interoperability is a core capability needed for enterprises to securely deploy authorization services in complex environments comprised of systems from multiple vendors. Strata is honored to support the demo with the Hexa Policy Orchestration’s integration with Open Policy Agent (OPA). Identiverse is the logical place for this first interoperability demonstration to occur since the AuthZEN working group was founded based on meetings held at this event.”</p>
<p>Bertrand Tavernier, vice president/chief technical officer for Thales (secure communication and information systems)<br>“Thanks to the support of the OpenID AuthZEN Working Group and leveraging our long-standing experience with the OASIS XACML standard, we were glad to demonstrate the capability of our AuthzForce solution to combine XACML policy expressiveness and versatility with the new, ultra-lightweight AuthZEN authorization API for the great benefit of customers, especially in edge computing environments.”</p>

<p>Welcome to the 4th edition of CeramicWorld! Last month has been busy with new features and developments happening across the Ceramic ecosystem. Here’s a TL;DR for what has happened:</p>  Ceramic released an a new library for building points on Ceramic  Index is making strides in powering decentralized AI  Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) is moving away from IPFS pubsub  Ceramic’s Data Feed API is here    A new library for building points on Ceramic has dropped 🔥 <p>Ceramic core team has just released the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramic-solutions/points?activeTab=versions&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">points library</a>, designed to facilitate developers in initiating experimentation with reputation systems on Ceramic and accelerating iteration. The points library serves various use cases, including implementing rewards for community engagement, incentivizing collaboration, or facilitating community quests and educational initiatives.</p><p>As an illustration of its functionality, the Points library has been integrated into the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/sandbox?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Sandbox</a>. By following the steps outlined in the Sandbox, you can earn your first points, stored on Ceramic! 🔥</p><p>And that’s not all. In addition to the points library, there is also a <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/demo/fullstack-app?ref=blog.ceramic.network">points demo application</a> that you can use as the basis of your own project. This example app showcases how the points library can be utilized to incentivize community members for their engagement, such as participation on key social platforms. To learn more, check out the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/web3-points-library-tutorial/">comprehensive tutorial</a>, and watch the accompanying video walkthrough:</p> <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/libraries/points?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Start building with points library</a>   Powering Decentralized AI with Composable&nbsp;Data <p><a href="https://index.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Index</a>, a composable discovery protocol, is revolutionizing web discovery by empowering users to curate personalized search engines, known as indexes, tailored to their specific needs.</p><p>Built on Ceramic's decentralized graph database, <a href="https://mirror.xyz/indexnetwork.eth/pETWkxZcN3OW0fUWohAo6vAh4IPqfnF6h5v9O-Pwi_k?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Index is driving decentralized AI</a>. It leverages a decentralized semantic index, utilizing ComposeDB, to enable semantic interoperability and a highly relational composition of use cases. By integrating AI-based discovery functions with Ceramic's decentralized network, Index ensures data integrity, privacy, and personalized discovery experiences across peers, mitigating privacy risks associated with centralized systems. This interconnected approach fosters a discovery experience where responses are both personalized and trusted, exemplified by a chat setup drawing from both community and private indexes.</p><p>Today, Index network is partnering with a number of projects in the ecosystem, including Ceramic, Lit Protocol, Fluence, Disco, Intuition Systems, Verax, and Olas Network, among others.</p><p>Just a few days ago Index team <a href="https://docs.index.network/docs/resources/libraries/langchain?ref=blog.ceramic.network">announced the collaboration with LangChainAI</a> which enables developers to seamlessly build their composable semantic indexes with LangChain's suite of LLM pipelines. The new integration is supported in both Python and JavaScript.</p> <a href="https://index.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Explore the Index Network</a>   Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) is moving away from IPFS pubsub<br><br>Earlier this month, the core Ceramic team shared an update regarding the work that has been done to enhance Ceramic network's reliability, scalability, and performance, particularly focusing on the Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS). As the team is approaching the release of Ceramic’s Recon protocol, CAS is transitioning away from using IPFS pubsub to synchronize Streams in Ceramic. To facilitate this, a new HTTP-based mechanism has been developed for sharing Time Events from CAS to Ceramic nodes. This eliminates the dependency of newer Ceramic nodes on IPFS pubsub.<br><br>To ensure seamless data delivery and prevent potential data loss, it's crucial for all Ceramic nodes to be upgraded to at least v5.3.

<p>Earlier this month, Otto Mora from Polygon ID and Kim Duffy from DIF hosted a webinar titled "Credential Schemas: Streamlining KYC." We were thrilled with the enthusiastic participation and valuable feedback we received from attendees. </p><p>Throughout the webinar, we conducted interactive polls to gather real-time feedback from participants. Here's a recap of the key highlights, discussions, and feedback throughout the session.</p> Understanding Decentralized Identity <p>We began with an introduction to decentralized identity, explaining the technologies and principles that empower individuals to control their digital identities and personal data. Key benefits include:</p>  Privacy &amp; Security: Ensuring data is shared only with necessary parties, protecting against misuse.  Streamlined Onboarding: Facilitating efficient customer onboarding with trustworthy data.  Bi-Directional Trust: Reducing fraud and fostering confidence in interactions.  Trust &amp; Transparency: Enhancing economic and social opportunities through new markers of trust and reputation.  <p>We asked participants “In your opinion, what is the most impactful use case for decentralized identity?”. At 36%, “Enhancing privacy and security” took the lead, with “Streamlining onboarding processes” coming in second at 27%.</p><p>The responses to “Other” included interesting applications such as:</p>   Governance, membership, voting, and sybil resistance  Virtual rights management (VRM)  <p>And others added powerful cross-cutting differentiators of SSI including user-controlled identity and interoperability.</p><p>For the rest of the webinar, we focused specifically on the "streamlined onboarding" benefit.</p> Real-World Use Cases <p>We explored various use cases where credential schemas can make a significant impact in onboarding:</p>  KYC/KYB: Streamlining financial transactions with verified identity claims.  AML: Reusable claims to help identify and protect against money laundering.  Age Verification: Ensuring age-appropriate access to services and content.  <p>We asked participants which credential schemas they (and their companies) are  interested in. KYC took the lead, which was not surprising given the webinar theme.</p><p>We had a freeform option to enter other credential schemas of interest, and participants responded with:</p>  Known customer credential  Verifiable product-related sustainability information  <p>For the rest of the webinar, we focused specifically on Decentralized Identity and credential schemas as they benefit KYC/KYB use cases.</p> Challenges in Traditional KYC/KYB <p>We reviewed challenges with traditional KYC/KYB processes, including:</p>  High Costs: Traditional methods are costly and resource-intensive.  Compliance Complexity: Meeting compliance requirements like AML assurance is challenging.  Time Inefficiencies: Current processes are time-consuming and require substantial manual effort.   The Role of Credential Schemas <p>We highlighted the importance of credential schemas as data templates that ensure consistency and interoperability across systems. The benefits include:</p>  Facilitating Innovation: Enabling innovators to focus on new applications rather than compatibility issues.  Enhancing Interoperability: Ensuring credentials are broadly recognized across different systems.  Encoding Best Practices: Capturing best practices and recommendations from experts.  Boosting Efficiency: Reducing the need for custom integration work.   DIF’s new Schema Work Item <p>We announced DIF's new schema work item, to be launched at the end of May, dedicated to credential schemas including:</p>  Basic KYC Model: For identity verification across financial services and other sectors.  AML Schema: To comply with anti-money laundering regulations.  Proof of Age: To verify age or age range for access to age-restricted content.  Proof of Humanity: To confirm real human identities, useful for community governance and anti-fraud.   General Discussion <p>The discussions provided us with great insights; one such key insight is that such schemas do not need to provide the complete answer – if they can shave off 80% of the verification work, then that’s a win.</p><p>We also discussed the importance of schema discoverability to promote convergence, which we'll discuss more later.</p> Thank You for Your Participation <p>We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who joined the webinar and contributed to the conversation. Your feedback was invaluable and underscored the relevance and potential impact of credential schemas in streamlining KYC processes.</p><p> As discussed during the call, an interdisciplinary, holistic approach is key to the success of this effort, and we'd love to continue the discussion with you!</p><p> Contact <a href="mailto:membership@identity.foundation">membership@identity.foundation</a> if you'd like to get involved. We are targeting an end of May start date. You can join the work item later, but getting involved now ensures we factor in your availability.</p>

<p>Face Verification Certification launched to bring confidence to ID ecosystem among rising online identity theft and bias concerns&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>May 29, 2024 – The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> announced today the launch of the first globally available certification program to test and certify the performance of remote biometric identity verification technology when verifying a user against a trusted identity document for accuracy, liveness, and bias. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/face-verification/">Face Verification Certification</a> program comes at a time of soaring demand for face biometric identity solutions and recognition of the importance of robust enrollment and identity re-binding processes to the overall security of online accounts. <a href="https://www.iproov.com/liveness-detection">Dynamic Liveness</a>, the science powering the <a href="https://www.iproov.com">iProov</a> Biometric Solution Suite’s Remote Onboarding Solution and Authentication Solution, is the first product to pass the rigorous certification testing.</p>



<p>The certification program, consisting of 10,000 tests at a minimum, assesses a biometric system’s performance across different demographics, including skin tone, age, and gender. It measures resistance to spoof and deepfake attacks with Imposter Attack Presentation Accept Rate (IAPAR), and also assesses the usability and security of solutions by measuring False Reject and Accept Rates (FRR and FAR respectively). The certification also tests “selfie match” capabilities to ensure a user’s “selfie” matches their government-issued ID in the initial account setup process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combating bias and deepfake threats in biometric ID systems</p>



<p>Biometrics has <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Authenticate-2023-Barometer-Report.pdf">ranked top as global consumers’ preferred way to log in</a> and the method they think is most secure for the last two years. However, as governments and businesses globally roll out remote identity solutions, two urgent issues remain to address – bias in some biometric systems and new security threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations including NIST have been closely <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software">monitoring the disparities in performance for some time</a> – with NIST’s most recent <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_demographics.html">evaluation of solutions across different demographics</a> ​​released this year. The issue of bias is tightly linked to brand reputation too; new research from FIDO Alliance released today has found 50% of American and British consumers said they would lose trust in an organization if its biometric system was found to be biased, while 22% said they’d stop using a service entirely. Similarly, generative AI’s boom has also heightened security apprehensions about online verification; the same survey revealed over a third of consumers (37%) are more concerned about verifying themselves online due to the rising number of deepfakes. In ENISA’s latest remote ID report, researchers observed that while deepfake injection attacks are increasing and more sophisticated, deepfake presentation and injection attacks remain the <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/remote-id-proofing-good-practices">top two biometric attack types most difficult to mitigate</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bringing trust to the ID ecosystem</p>



<p>Commenting on the news, Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CEO of the FIDO Alliance, said: “Remote identity solutions unlock huge benefits for governments, organizations, and consumers alike, but as appetite grows across the globe, there are understandable concerns mixed with excitement. Identity theft is rising, while bias in biometric systems has caused organizations to delay or reconsider implementations at a time when inclusivity and accessibility have never been more important.</p>



<p>“Certification unlocks the power of open standards and catalyzes ecosystem-wide innovation and opportunity. With iProov’s market-first certification for biometric face verification now completed, we look forward to serving additional providers who understand the value of independent, accredited lab testing. This new certification program provides a launchpad that enables all stakeholders to fast-track deployments that are robust enough for the modern threat landscape and work well for everyone, anywhere in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leading biometrics solutions provider, iProov, has become the first vendor to complete the rigorous certification process. iProov provides market-leading biometric solutions that protect the world’s most security-conscious organizations from deepfakes and other types of identity fraud. Andrew Bud, founder and CEO at iProov said: “Biometrics are a powerful tool that organizations can utilize to facilitate secure, inclusive, and user-friendly interactions online. Each of these three fundamental components must be given equal consideration as organizations evaluate their options. With the FIDO Face Verification Certification program, organizations now have a trusted compass for navigating these decisions. We applaud The FIDO Alliance for addressing the importance of biometric identity verification to strengthen the full user identity lifecycle. Independent certification creates a much-needed quality benchmark for this evolving technology and further demonstrates our ability to provide trusted identity assurance in an age of AI threats and identity fraud.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Testing requirements are built upon proven ISO standards and are developed by a diverse international authority of stakeholders, including industry, government, and independent subject matter experts. Participating vendors can benefit from identifying gaps in product performance and demonstrating clearly to the market their solutions can be trusted, which can reduce individual testing needs and boost adoption. Two independent labs are currently accredited to support this certification – <a href="https://ingeniumbiometrics.com/">Ingenium Biometrics</a> and <a href="https://www.tuvit.de/">TÜV Informationstechnik (TÜV NORD GROUP)</a> – with more expected to follow later this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program expands upon the Alliance’s existing <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/biometric-component-introduction/">Biometric Component Certification</a> and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/document-authenticity/">Document Authenticity (DocAuth) Certification</a> programs and demonstrates FIDO’s ongoing commitment to meet marketplace demand and address evolving threats with third-party certifications. Combined, these programs provide unrivaled end-to-end assurance to implementing organizations, consumers and vendors and support the world’s migration to more secure digital verification systems and passwordless security.</p>

<p>May 29, 2024 – The FIDO Alliance today released new design guidelines to help accelerate <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/implement-passkeys-overview/">passkey adoption</a> and deployment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Design Guidelines aim to help online service providers design a better, more consistent user experience (UX) when signing in with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The guidelines are developed for designers, engineers, product managers, content strategists, and UX researchers to use for reference and guide their initial implementation of passkeys and expansion of passkey support over time.</p>



<p>The new guidelines are available at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/design-guidelines">https://fidoalliance.org/design-guidelines/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As organizations are increasingly deploying passwordless authentication based on FIDO standards around the world, the end users of passkeys – along with the practitioners implementing them – have become top priorities for successful adoption,” said Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CEO of The FIDO Alliance. “Our <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/content-ebook-consumer-password-and-passkey-trends-wpd-2024/">research</a> shows consumers and employees are adopting phishing-resistant passkeys at a rapid pace while relying organizations are experiencing cost savings and fewer security incidents.&nbsp; By continuing our investment in the evolving user experience, the FIDO Alliance is committed to ensuring brands have a consistent and accessible set of guidelines that are fully aligned with design best practices and FIDO technology requirements. We encourage online service providers everywhere to use these publicly available guidelines to enhance the user experience and enjoy greater success with FIDO passkey deployment and adoption.”</p>



<p>Following the first release of FIDO UX guidelines for passkeys in 2022, the 2024 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/design-guidelines/">Design Guidelines</a> have been updated with optimization included for service providers evaluating and deploying passkeys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2024 Design Guidelines are organized into five sections to provide clear guidance, confirm design principles, and offer flexibility:</p>



 
 User experience research: Provides confidence that the guidelines are informed by design research 



 Principles: 10 UX principles and 3 content principles for passkeys that are core to any passkey implementation 



 “Get started” design patterns: Patterns are the heart of the guidelines, containing self-contained experiences that can be combined to match unique business needs 



 Optional design patterns: Patterns that can be added after the “get started” patterns over time 



 Resources: Provides additional resources like events, Figma UI kits and community groups to jump-start work with passkeys 
 



<p>The FIDO UX Working Group created the guidelines and comprises 131 UX researchers, designers, and PMs from 31 global brands. The guidelines were created in partnership with usability research firm Blink UX – with added underwriting support from 1Password, Dashlane, Google, HID, Trusona, U.S. Bank, and Yubico.</p>

 How can we verify users are genuine in an online world? 



<p>Online identity theft has steadily risen in recent years, while the generative AI boom has driven a new wave of deepfake-powered attacks that threaten remote enrollment and identity security. Meanwhile, bias in biometric systems has been monitored for some time, varying significantly across solutions and impacting consumer trust and perception of the technology.</p>



<p>As the adoption of remote identity verification technology rises, two critical concerns and challenges need to be addressed: bias and new security threats.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance recently sponsored an independent study of 2,000 respondents across the U.S. and the U.K. to understand consumer perception towards remote identity verification, online security, and biometrics. This eBook reveals those insights on remote biometric face verification, including how many people have used biometric face recognition successfully, and their opinions on verification accuracy, potential discrimination, and concerns about deepfakes.</p>



 Key findings 



 
 Consumers want to use biometrics to verify themselves online more, especially in sensitive use cases like financial services – where one out of two people said they would use biometric technology (48%). 



 One in four feel they experience regular discrimination when using automated facial biometric systems (25%). 



 Equity in biometric systems is vital to trust – with half saying they would lose trust in a brand or institution (50%), with one out of five saying they’d stop using a service entirely if found to have a biased biometric system (22%). 



 Over half of respondents are concerned about deepfakes when verifying identities online (52%). 
 



<p>Read the full results of the survey in this eBook and learn about these consumers’ experiences with biometric face verification technologies, and discover how organizations can improve global digital access, authentication, and security when leveraging these remote identity verification technologies.</p>

<p>Email: <a>markeblairmd@gmail.com</a><br>
Name: Mark E. Blair, M.D.<br>
Current Council Member: Yes</p>
<p>Experience:<br>
“As a current member of the Cyber Republic Council (CRC), my experience over the past 4 years has been both rewarding and enlightening. I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with dedicated members like Sir Kahuna and Vegas Mike as part of ‘The Strawberry Council.’ Together, we have upheld the philosophy of ‘derived from the community, for the community,’ driving strategic initiatives that promote decentralization and community involvement within the Elastos ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Background:<br>
“In my role, I have focused on enhancing Elastos’ contributions to the Bitcoin ecosystem and digital/data rights, especially through my work as the Head of Strategy for BeL2 since December 2023. This position has allowed me to explore investment opportunities and strategize the rollout of BeL2 infrastructure, providing me with a unique perspective on how to further our community’s goals.”</p>
<p>Contribution Goals:<br>
“For another term, my aspirations include continuing to drive innovation and growth. I hope to continue to support the rollout and adoption of BeL2, which will not only increase use cases for the Bitcoin ecosystem but also boost Elastos’ visibility and adoption. Additionally, I am committed to exploring outside investor opportunities to increase the project’s ecosystem development and long-term viability.”</p>
<p>Improvements:<br>
“In my opinion, while the CRC is currently effective in serving as a DAO, there are areas that could be further improved:</p>
 
 Increased Community Engagement: Encouraging more active participation from community members, ensuring their voices and ideas are heard and integrated into our strategic plans. 
 Transparency and Communication: Enhancing transparency in decision-making processes and improving communication channels between the CRC and the wider Elastos community. 
 Strategic Partnerships: Forming strategic partnerships with other blockchain projects and organizations to foster collaboration and mutual growth. 
 Innovation and Flexibility: Implementing a framework that allows for greater innovation and flexibility in adopting new technologies and approaches, keeping Elastos at the forefront of blockchain development.”

Name: chen2rong2<br>
Current Council Member: No</p>
<p>Background:<br>
“I haven’t run for a council seat previously, and I will not run next year. However, I feel obligated to offer my help at this critical juncture of the Elastos initiative if I am elected. I have been with the Elastos project since the beginning. And I believe there is a need for a bridge between internet developers and crypto developers so they can work together to build a new Web3. I wish to share some of my thoughts with the Cyber Republic communities, especially in the DePIN area, because Web3 is a network first and foremost.”</p>
<p>Contribution Goals:<br>
“‘You own your data’ — that’s for everyone. Web1, Web2, and Web3 are for all internet users, not just crypto enthusiasts. I will try to help build the SmartWeb, our interpretation of Web3, in any way I can. The SmartWeb can’t survive unless project developers, internet influencers, and e-business vendors can make profits on their own.”</p>
<p>Improvements:<br>
“Currently, there is also a divide between the eastern and western members of the Cyber Republic communities. I hope to be an interpreter and help people see that both the world and the internet are common ground for us all.”</p>

 Greater agility, faster innovation, increased engagement Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Excuse us as we go full on bizniz mode for the rest of this post. We’re quite serious about the benefits of openness and have built our cooperative as well as our individual careers on the fact that Open Source is about more than just code. What follows is the “business case” for shifting your organisation to a more open model. We’ve borrowed liberally from the <a href="http://theopenorganization.org/">Open Organization community</a>, a group of people (including one of our members) who have written about the models and behaviours inside of FOSS for many&nbsp;years.</p><p>The evidence is clear: open working leads to greater agility, faster innovation, and increased engagement. Members of your organisation are more capable of working toward goals in unison and with shared vision. Ideas from both inside and outside the organisation receive more equitable consideration. Members clearly see connections between their particular activities and an organisation’s overarching values, mission, and&nbsp;spirit.</p><p>These advantages translate directly into better business performance and a stronger bottom line. If you want your organisation to obtain better results with the resources you currently have available, then embracing open working practices is one of your best paths toward sustainable success.</p><p>But don’t just take our word for&nbsp;it:</p>  Agility: According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/how-to-create-an-agile-organization">McKinsey &amp; Company</a>, organisations that adopt information transparency across their operations can achieve up to 30% gains in efficiency and customer satisfaction.  Innovation: <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/12/how-open-innovation-can-help-you-cope-in-lean-times">Harvard Business Review</a> reports that companies that support open and collaborative working environments can see a speed increase of up to 30% in their innovation cycles.  Engagement: Research by <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx">Gallup</a> reveals that highly engaged business units realise a 41% reduction in absenteeism, 17% increase in productivity, 10% higher customer ratings, see a 20% increase in sales, and are 21% more profitable.   5 Characteristics of an Open Organisation <p>Open Organisations are <a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-org-definition">defined</a> as exhibiting the following characteristics:</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Let’s explain what’s meant by each of&nbsp;these:</p> Transparency <p>This is fundamental to open organisations and involves everyone involved on a project to access all relevant materials by default. As a result, this means that team members are all able to review, assess, and contribute effectively to the work being done. Moreover, transparency means team members being not only informed about decisions and processes, but being encouraged to participate in discussions and provide feedback. Both successes and failures are discussed openly, meaning that valuable lessons can be learned, goals can be clarified, and roles well-defined. All of this enhances the overall organisational accountability.</p> Inclusivity <p>Open organisations actively welcome diverse viewpoints and ensure that everyone has a voice in the future of both the project, and organisation as a whole. This can be achieved not only through well-established technical channels but also through social norms that encourage a range of perspectives. It’s important that there are clear protocols for participation so as to promote an inclusive environment where feedback is valued. Leadership for inclusivity includes proactively including overlooked voices and ensuring that all relevant opinions are heard and considered. This approach enriches the decision-making process and also reinforces a sense of duty among employees to contribute meaningfully to discussions about their&nbsp;work.</p> Adaptability <p>The adaptability of open organisations is characterised by their flexibility and resilience, based on collective problem-solving and collaborative decision-making. To allow true adaptability, feedback mechanisms need to be accessible to both internal and external members. This allows for peer support and agency which can have clear impact on operational methods. This orientation towards continuous learning and the readiness to adapt based on feedback helps organisations avoid repetitive mistakes. It also helps them stay responsive to the changing needs of their environment.</p> Collaboration <p>In open organisations, collaboration is the default mode of operation. These is a general belief that working together produces superior outcomes, not only in project work, but also in terms of improving organisations. Ensuring a spirit of openness means that work is not only shared within the organisation but is also available for improvement by external parties, leading to greater innovation and continuous improvement. The ease with which people can discover, provide feedback on, and join ongoing work is a useful barometer for how different, welcoming, and collaborative open organisations are compared to&nbsp;others.</p> Community <p>The community aspect of open organisations is based on shared values and principles that guide participation and decision-making. These values should be clear to all members and help define the organisation’s boundaries and success criteria. Team members within this community approach are empowered to make significant contributions based on a common ‘language’ to prevent miscommunication. Sharing knowledge and experiences is encouraged to further the group’s work, which strengthens the communal bond and ensuring collective progress towards organisational goals.</p><p>As you can see, these characteristics are interconnected and intertwined, leading to a virtuous cycle of openness.</p> Practical Steps Towards&nbsp;Openness Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Ultimately, working openly is about cultural change. A change in attitude as much as a change in processes.</p><p>To transition to more open working practices, consider the following steps:</p>  Clear guidelines: Work together to document and share clear guidelines on what open working could look like in your organisation. This includes how information is shared, how feedback is given and received, and how decisions are&nbsp;made.  Culture of transparency: Encourage leaders and team members to share their work and the reasoning behind their decisions openly. This can be facilitated through regular meetings, shared digital workspaces, and open forums where ideas and projects are discussed transparently.  Inclusive communication: Ensure that all team members have equal access to communication tools and platforms. Use a variety of channels to accommodate different working styles and preferences, and encourage everyone to contribute to discussions and decision-making processes.  Collaboration across boundaries: Use technology and collaborative tools to break down silos within your organisation. Encourage teams to work together across departments and even invite external partners or customers to contribute to projects where appropriate.  Community engagement: Create spaces (physical/virtual/hybrid) where employees can interact, share ideas, and support each other. Regular community-building activities and team-building exercises can strengthen the communal bonds and enhance the shared sense of&nbsp;purpose.   Addressing Potential Challenges Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>While transitioning to an open working environment offers many benefits, it also comes with challenges that need to be managed. For example, information overload can be avoided by sharing information in a structured and digestible way so as not to overwhelm team members. Try using tools that allow for information to be categorised and easily searched.</p><p>While transparency is to be encouraged, clearly define sensitive information to ensure that robust security practices are in place to protect it. Provide training to team members around data protection standards and the importance of respective privacy and confidentiality.</p><p>While open working encourages broader participation, this needs to be balanced with the need for efficiency. So set clear objectives and deadlines for collaborative projects to avoid decision-making bottlenecks or&nbsp;delays.</p><p>Some team members may resist changes to traditional ways of working. Overcome such cultural resistance by demonstrating the tangible benefits of open working practices through pilot projects and sharing success stories. Provide training and mentoring to help adaptation to the new ways of doing&nbsp;things.</p> Conclusion Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>The shift towards working openly and transparently is a strategic move that can significantly enhance an organisation’s agility, innovation, and engagement. By encouraging a culture of openness based on transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community, organisations can create an environment where every member feels valued and empowered to contribute.</p><p>This approach not only drives better business performance but also cultivates a sense of shared purpose and commitment among employees. Embracing open working practices isn’t just an ‘initiative’ but a pathway to sustainable success and a robust bottom line. By implementing clear guidelines, engendering a culture of transparency, ensuring inclusive communication, promoting collaboration, and engaging the community, organisations can navigate potential challenges and realise the full benefits of open&nbsp;working.</p><p>As you would expect of an organisation called We Are Open, our cooperative can help you and your organisation on this journey. <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">Get in touch</a>, or take our <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/open-course/">free email-based course</a>, to find out&nbsp;more!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-business-case-for-working-openly-and-transparently-867e3fb04588">The Business Case for Working Openly and Transparently</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>IDunion SCE, the neutral and democratically organised European cooperative created from the IDunion research consortium, has been offering their managed network infrastructure for industrial and productive use since April 2024.</p>

<p>As a neutral basic infrastructure, the distributed and redundant network enables every company to independently store and manage identity information and all types of company-related data. Companies can store unique and distinctive company identity-related identifiers (DID – Decentralised Identifier) on the IDunion network, which are permanent, unchangeable and verifiable and do not require the use of a central register. The identifiers can be linked to user-defined company data or company attributes. All company data can be managed according to predefined parameters and can of course also be revoked. IDunion SCE makes the identifiers available to companies as required and assigns corresponding write authorisations for network use on an individual contractual basis.</p>

<p>The network is based on the open source software Hyperledger Indy. All network nodes are operated exclusively by cooperative members in accordance with the principles of the IDunion SCE and monitored by the latter as a neutral body. The IDunion SCE and the infrastructures it manages and supports are subject to the principles of openness, neutrality, sovereignty, transparency, integrity and cooperative competition. All members of the cooperative have the same voting rights, regardless of their company size. This ensures that all participating companies can have an equal influence on the technical and organised development of the IDunion SCE and thus the ecosystem. Companies can join the European co-operative as members at any time.</p>

<a href="https://elastos.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3.-去中心化人工智能和数字版权管理案例.mp3">https://elastos.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3.-去中心化人工智能和数字版权管理案例.mp3</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/05/openai-scarlett-johansson-sky/678446/">controversy</a>, Scarlett Johansson <a href="https://x.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1792679435701014908">disclosed</a> that she had been approached by OpenAI to voice their latest ChatGPT 4.0 system. After declining the offer, she was dismayed to find the released AI voice, named “Sky,” closely mimicked her own, raising ethical concerns about the unauthorised use of her voice. This incident highlights the need for decentralised AI and digital rights management to ensure creators retain control over their contributions and identities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Problems with Centralised AI Systems 
<p>Centralised AI systems, like those managed by OpenAI, control vast amounts of data and intellectual property. These systems can replicate individual contributions without proper consent or compensation, as seen in Johansson’s case. Centralised control can lead to misuse and ethical violations, undermining the rights of creators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Elacity’s Decentralised Digital Rights Management (dDRM) 
<p>Imagine a future where you can go to an open market and purchase Scarlett Johansson’s AI voice directly from her for your personal AI, seek her advice on the film industry, or use her 3D avatar to create a custom movie. In this decentralised AI marketplace, professionals from various sectors offer their AI-trained services. You could access legal advice from an AI trained by top attorneys, receive medical consultations from doctor-developed AIs, or engage in therapy sessions with AI counsellors. Students benefit from AI tutors for personalised learning, while creatives can hire AI voice actors, writers, and editors for high-quality content.</p>
<p>Professionals can use AI personal assistants for administrative tasks, and fitness enthusiasts can access AI personal trainers for customised workouts. This decentralised AI marketplace democratises access to high-quality services, fostering innovation and personalisation across various fields, where everyone is fairly rewarded. AI processing for all is performed on the user’s device like your Iphone or Laptop using edge computing with complete privacy over third-party servers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.ela.city/">Elacity’s</a> dDRM system built on the <a href="http://elastos.info">Elastos SmartWeb</a> offers a solution through blockchain technology and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Here’s how it can revolutionise AI and empower creators:</p>
 1. Decentralised AI Training and Ownership: 
 
 AI Capsules: Creators can encapsulate their contributions, like voice recordings, into encrypted AI Capsules stored on decentralised networks. This ensures creators retain ownership and control over their data. 
 Collaborative Training: In a decentralised AI ecosystem, multiple stakeholders can collaboratively train AI models, with contributors receiving fair compensation through smart contracts. 
 
 2. Smart Contracts and Tokenisation: 
 
 Tokenisation: Digital Capsules are indexed with ERC-721 tokens for distinct ownership and managed with ERC-1155 tokens for access, distribution, and royalties. Smart contracts enforce transparency and fairness. 
 Automated Royalties: Smart contracts automate royalty distribution, ensuring creators are paid immediately and fairly whenever their contributions are used. 
 
 3. Global Decentralised Marketplace: 
 
 Marketplace for AI Capsules: Elacity’s platform supports a marketplace where AI Capsules can be traded. Creators can directly monetise their contributions, fostering a global economy free from centralised control. 
 Transparent Transactions: Blockchain technology ensures all transactions are verifiable and secure, reducing the risk of unauthorised use. 
 
 4. Decentralised AI Playback: 
 
 
 
 Runtime Execution Environment: Elacity’s decentralised runtime operates on the user’s device, executing AI locally and ensuring complete privacy. This setup eliminates the need for centralised servers, allowing AI models to run securely and privately on individual devices. Users retain control over their data and interactions, enhancing security and privacy in AI applications. 
 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Benefits of Decentralised DRM for AI 
 
 Empowers Creators: Creators maintain control and receive direct compensation, preventing unauthorised use as seen in Johansson’s case. 
 Ensures Transparency and Security: Blockchain provides transparent, secure, and immutable transactions. 
 Encourages Collaboration: Decentralised AI promotes collaborative training, benefiting from diverse data sources while protecting individual rights. 
 
<p>The controversy involving Scarlett Johansson and OpenAI highlights the need for a decentralised approach to AI and digital rights management. Elacity’s dDRM system, leveraging blockchain technology, provides a secure, transparent, and fair solution for managing digital assets. By empowering creators and protecting their rights, Elacity paves the way for a more democratic and ethical digital economy where AI systems are co-trained and managed fairly.

<p>Spring conference season is in full swing and the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) is heading to Europe to participate in several major conferences:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) </a>— June 4-7, Berlin, Germany 



 <a href="https://www.terrapinn.com/exhibition/identity-week/">Identity Week Europe </a>— June 11-12, Amsterdam, Netherlands 



 <a href="https://diceurope.org/">Digital Identity unConference Europe (DICE</a>) — June 18-20, Zurich, Switzerland.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>We will also be attending the second regional summit of the <a href="https://sidi-hub.community/about-sidi/">Sustainable &amp; Interoperable Digital Identity (SIDI)</a> Summit 2024 series.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP, which celebrates its fourth birthday this month, has long been known for its dual stack that emphasizes why we must combine technical interoperability with governance interoperability in order to establish truly interoperable digital trust ecosystems.</p>







<p>Although in our early history we were best known for our work on the governance side of the dual stack, at these June conferences our emphasis will be on two new technical specifications for which we just published Implementers Drafts: the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/11/toip-announces-the-first-implementers-draft-of-the-trust-spanning-protocol-specification/">Trust Spanning Protocol</a> and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/03/toip-announces-the-implementers-draft-of-thetrust-registry-protocol-specification-v2-0/">Trust Registries Protocol</a>. Both of these protocols are designed to maximize interoperability and authenticity and minimize risk, while still enabling each ecosystem to make the choices they need for their specific context.</p>



<p>The following is a schedule of all the conference sessions and talks in which ToIP members or our partners will be participating.</p>



 



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join us at EIC for a panel of ToIP Steering Committee Members, moderated by Executive Director, Judith Fleenor.</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5643/1">Panel: The Emerging Trust Layer for the Internet: Using Minimum Viable Protocols to Achieve Maximum Interoperability</a> 



<p>Friday, June 07, 2024 13:30—14:30</p>



<p>Interoperability is not created alone and that is why ToIP collaborates with other standards organizations and certifications bodies.&nbsp; Executive Director, Judith Fleenor has invited the Executive Directors from <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/">Open Identity Exchange</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">Open Wallet Foundation</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> to unpack the role each foundation plays, how we collaborate to create the full picture for digital trust, and why it is so important for organizations and individuals to support and participate in several foundations, not just one.</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5709/1">Panel: Executive Directors Speak: Why We Need More Collaboration</a> 



<p>Friday, June 07, 2024 14:30—15:30</p>



<p>At last year’s EIC Judith gave a keynote on <a href="https://youtu.be/Hhv5-xbcmkw">Decentralized Identity Why is it all the rage?</a>&nbsp; Her premise was that the technologies that enable decentralized identity could be used, not only for traditional identity and access management, but more importantly for content authenticity and to assist in the challenges that AI brings.&nbsp; This year, Al will be a big topic at EIC, and several ToIP Steering Committee members will be addressing these topics in various sessions throughout the week.</p>



<p>On Wednesday Wenjing Chu, Futurewei Technologies and Drummond Reed, Gen Digital will be on the panel:</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5686/1">Redefining Human Identity in the AI Era: From Digital Evolution to AI Integration</a>

  You’re reading this on a machine with an operating system: Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, or Android. But that’s not your OS. It’s your machine’s.

<p>You’re reading this on a machine with an operating system: Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, or Android.</p>
<p>But that’s not your OS. It’s your machine’s.</p>
<p>How about one for you, that runs on your machine but is entirely yours? Let’s call it a Personal OS, or a POS.</p>
<p>The POS will have a kernel onto which abilities (not just applications) can be added. An extreme example of how this might work is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GftSkyUsA94">Neo learning ju jitsu</a> in The Matrix:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GftSkyUsA94"></a></p>
<p>That OS amplified&nbsp;Neo’s own intelligence, in his own head. We’re far from that today. But we can at least add abilities to a POS of our own. Those too can give us more agency of many kinds.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there is only one POS so far. It’s called <a href="https://paios.org/">pAI-OS</a> (<a href="https://github.com/pAI-OS/paios">Github code</a>), and it’s led by <a href="https://kwaai.ai">Kwaai</a>.* To my knowledge, pAI-OS is the first and only truly personal operating system. (If others do the same, let me know and I’ll talk those up too.) And it is built to run our own AIs. Let’s call them PAIs, where the A can mean amplified or augmented (<a href="https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/">sourcing Doug Englebart</a> for the latter).</p>
<p>So, what kind of abilities are we talking about?</p>
<p>Let’s start with something that could hardly be more mundane and important: memory.</p>
<p>In Laws of Media, Marshall McLuhan said (five decades ago) that computing promises “perfect memory—total and exact.” For many millennia, our species has been outboarding memory through speech, the written word, and collecting all of that in libraries and museums. And now, in the digital age that dawned with microcircuits and the Internet, we now occupy a <a href="https://www.digitallife.center/index.php/digital-life">digital world</a> where everybody can publish whatever they want. To peruse that, we made search engines. Those ruled from the late ’90s until approximately yesterday, when AIs took over servicing our interest in answers to questions. Google, Microsoft, ChatGPT, Perplexity.ai, and others have moved into a space we might call AI answerware.</p>
<p>Running all that answerware are corporate AIs. Lets call them CAIs. Nothing wrong with CAIs, but also nothing personal, because they are not ours. I explain the difference in <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">Personal vs. Personalized AI</a>. Here’s a graphic from that post showing a bit of what abilities might run on your PAI:</p>
<p></p>
<p>PAIs can extend our own memories by accumulating personal stuff we need to know better, and our ability to meet, access, and use the external abilities of the CAI world. So we’ll have our agents + their agents, working together.</p>
<p>For an example of how that might work, take a look at <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">The most important standard in development today</a>: <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/">P7012:&nbsp;Standard for Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms</a>, which “identifies/addresses the manner in which personal privacy terms are proffered and how they can be read and agreed to by machines.” After seven years with a working group, it is now in the IEEE editing and approval mill, edging toward becoming a finished standard by next year. It works like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here your agent (a PAI, represented by the ⊂ symbol) proffers your privacy terms (<a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/tools/terms/p2b1/">here is one example</a>) to a corporate agent (which might or might not be a CAI, but is still represented with the reciprocal symbol ⊃. (This should be familiar to ProjectVRM veterans as the <a href="https://projectvrm.org/category/r-button/">r-button</a>. We may finally get to use it!)</p>
<p>The ceremony here is the exact reverse of what we have today with the cookie popovers on most website home pages. This can and should be done ⊂ to ⊃. So should signing and recording the agreement, or the choice of the site, should it tell you to screw off. (An agent running on your PAI will record that diss.)</p>
<p>I also bring this up because it will be a key required ability—not just for you and me but for the world, starting with Europe, where <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/">the GDPR lists six lawful bases for processing personal data</a>. They begin—</p>
<blockquote><p>(a) Consent: the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose.<br>
(b) Contract: the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.</p></blockquote>
<p>By now everyone knows that (a) Consent has failed. It’s an expensive and meaningless dance, with high cognitive (mostly cynical) overhead, and almost no accountability. Now they’re ready for (b) Contract, especially in ceremonies where the individual (not a mere “user”) takes the lead.</p>
<p>I believe there is less limit to what each of us can do with a PAI than there is to what we can do with a laptop or a phone. Because our PAI is our own. It runs on a deeper machine OS, but is not limited by that. Your PAI, running on your POS, may prove to be the first truly personal layer ever put on a machine OS.</p>
 
<p>*Full disclosure: I am now the <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/about">Chief Intention Officer</a> there. At this stage, it’s a voluntary position.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Node12 
 
 Email: breakingyield@gmail.com 
 Current Council Member: No 
 Background: “My background with Elastos dates back to February 2018 albeit with limited community involvement until November 2023 when I read the Bel2 whitepaper. Having a long-term interest in Defi, Bel2 was the Elastos development that compelled me to pursue an expanded role. My professional background consists of 20 years in financial services with multiple executive-level roles in private equity investment management and management consulting with a focus on asset management.” 
 Contribution Goals: “Based on my professional background, I would have the greatest impact in the areas of finance and accounting. Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&amp;A), Capital Requirements / Project Evaluation, Budgeting, Financial Modeling.” 
 Improvements: “Given a finite amount of capital (ELA/BTC) and unlimited opportunities, I would like to see metrics to evaluate ROI for new and ongoing proposals.”

 Tyro and his Friends 
 
 Email: ligreatmen@gmail.com 
 Current Council Member: Yes 
 Experience: “As a current member of the Council, I have witnessed the challenges and growth of Elastos over the past year. Each proposal is crucial to the development of Elastos; however, considering various rules and realities, it is not easy to decide whether to approve each proposal. The votes of the Council members represent their own opinions and aim to consider the concerns of other community members as much as possible. Therefore, in the new round of elections, I have organized nine community members to participate together, named Tyro and his friends! Before each new proposal is formally voted on, the nine of us will discuss it internally to form a consensus. After which, I will cast the final vote on behalf of the group. This is an extension of the CR consensus, and we believe it can better represent the community’s opinion.” 
 Background: “I am a long-time supporter of this project, and I still believe we can make it! I want to participate in this project more deeply!” 
 Contribution Goals: “Carefully review and vote on each proposal, ensuring the stable operation of our node. Continuously promote Elastos on social media and actively engage with community members.” 
 Improvements: “I personally believe that the CRC can encourage greater involvement. Although there are only 12 nodes, if each node is comprised of several community members, forming mini DAO teams within a DAO framework, that would be even more ideal.”

 Iggispopis CRC 
 
 Email: biroigor@biroigor.sk 
 Current Council Member: No 
 Background: “I have many years of experience in strategic management, marketing, and finance, which has given me a comprehensive perspective on solving complex challenges and leading projects to successful completion. As an OG member of the Elastos community, I have always supported transparency, efficiency, and active participation in decision-making processes. I am inspired by the growth and potential of Elastos as a technological platform for the decentralized web, which is why I decided to run for a position on the Cyber Republic Council.” 
 Contribution Goals: “If elected, my priority will be to address technical barriers that hinder the broader adoption of Elastos technologies such as RPC, Explorers, Bridge, and the development of the Essentials wallet. I plan to propose removing the ‘Abstain’ option in voting, changing the decision to a simple ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. I will actively communicate proposals and projects with the community on Telegram, where members are most active and interaction is practically immediate. Conducting surveys and polls will help us gather valuable feedback and understand the community’s views on various proposals and the direction of Elastos.” 
 Improvements: “I believe there is room for increased transparency and community engagement within the CRC. Currently, the community is not sufficiently involved in managing and deciding on proposals and their funding. Many do not express their opinions on the Cyber Republic website. I plan to actively communicate these proposals on Telegram, where members are most active. I also aim to ensure better information about the progress of projects funded by the CR treasury.”

 Metaverse4Good 
 
 Email: roger.darashah@elastoselavation.org 
 Current Council Member: No 
 Background: “Roger is a communications professional with over 30 years of experience working in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. He previously managed multi-market programs for HP (for the PR firm Edelman) covering 40 countries; adapting messages and assets for local consumption and collaborating with teams across cultures, backgrounds, and nationalities. Roger speaks French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian. He also served as Chief Operating Officer at India’s largest PR firm, Adfactors; operating from Mumbai across local and international clients including the Tata Group, Mphasis, and Schneider Electric. In 2020 he co-founded LatAm Intersect PR, a firm operating in 12 countries with an audience-based programming approach. Roger also co-founded the community Metaverse4Good to discuss and define a set of behaviors that would ensure Web3 remained a truly open, accessible, and inclusive environment for all.” 
 Contribution Goals: “Firstly, to communicate the real benefits of the SmartWeb; not only in technical terms but from a consumer/societal perspective. Secondly, to help ensure Bitcoin attains its true potential as a decentralized currency of confidence. These are the issues that I’ll be highlighting through compelling content, storytelling, and case studies; where the users are the protagonists rather than any particular brand.” 
 Improvements: “I believe that we should now singularly focus on the current product stack and proposition: BeL2; to liberate and use otherwise ‘dormant’ Bitcoin (through staking); to create multiple sustainable business models and revenue streams for the entire ecosystem. Elastos’ BTC Oracle; combining on/off-chain data to understand who is using Bitcoin and for what, and to create/refine business models based on these insights.”

 Strawberry Republic 
 
 Email: wildstrawberrysupernodes@gmail.com 
 Current Council Member: Yes 
 Experience: “As members of the Strawberry Republic, formerly known as the Strawberry Council, our collective experience over the past four years in the CRC DAO has been both rewarding and transformative. Our perfect voting record stands as a testament to our commitment and reliability, reflecting our dedication to incorporating community sentiments into every decision we make. With the rebranding to Strawberry Republic and the return of Vegas Mike, a founding member of the original Strawberry Supernodes, we are energized by the synergy and perspectives he brings back to the team. Together, we are united in our vision for Elastos, dedicated to amplifying the voice of the community and supporters, whether they are interacting with us online or offline.” 
 Background:
 
 Sir Kahuna: “With over two decades of experience in the construction industry, I am the owner of a profound construction company specializing in residential development, commercial, and industrial infrastructure projects. My approach is characterized by a drive to achieve grand visions, a principle that I also apply to my role within the Elastos ecosystem. As a founding member of the Wild Strawberry Supernodes, I have been dedicated to securing the Elastos blockchain since its early days in 2018. Beyond hosting Supernodes, securing the Elastos network, and running a construction company, I am a junior graphic artist, where I channel my creativity into producing engaging NFT collections and dynamic graphics.” 
 Vegas Mike: “As a coffee-fueled entrepreneur and seasoned graphic designer, my career spanning over 25 years has been dedicated to pursuing creative excellence. My foundation in graphic design and garment manufacturing has allowed me to consistently produce top-notch designs and apparel that embody innovation and practicality. I am adept at anticipating industry trends and utilizing cutting-edge software technologies, ensuring my work remains relevant and leading-edge.” 
 
 
 Contribution Goals: “As the Strawberry Republic, our dedication to the Elastos community remains steadfast. If re-elected for the 2024/25 CRC term, we will continue to prioritize the community’s best interests in every decision and vote. Our approach is fueled by a deep passion and love for Elastos, which we actively express through grassroots art initiatives and dynamic social media engagement. Additionally, we will vigorously promote Vegas Mike’s online store featuring Elastos, BEL2, and Bitcoin merchandise, bringing your favorite crypto logos and art to life. We are also keen on exploring collaborations with startups to drive innovation within the Elastos platform.” 
 Improvements: “If re-elected, one of our primary goals is to enhance transparency and communication between the CRC and the Elastos community. We are committed to collecting community sentiment before casting our votes, ensuring that every decision reflects the true interests and perspectives of the community members.”

 Yew/Mark 
 
 Email: ywj970104@hotmail.com 
 Current Council Member: No 
 Background: “My name is Yew and I am from Malaysia. I am just an average crypto enthusiast like many of you in this community. My real-life job is a Teacher, and I teach students sports and physical education. However, provided this opportunity to have a seat in this council and being here as an active community member since last year, the potential of this project being recognized globally is huge from observing Rong, Sunny, Sash, Jon, and other team member’s discussions, updates, and ongoing developments here. What is lacking now in my very honest opinion is community voice and recognition which is why my partnership with Mark in this seat is to represent Community Voice and to ensure this Voice is heard.” 
 Contribution Goals: “My contribution would be to express the community’s thoughts, feedback, and proposals to direct Elastos in the direction that the community wants and to ensure Elastos grows to be an excellent organization that is recognized globally. This partnership between myself and Mark is to represent the community and showcase Community Voice to ensure a community-focused project development.” 
 Improvements: “Recognizing community feedback, thoughts, and proposals.”

 Gelaxy 
 
 Email: jiangzehua@gelaxy.io 
 Current Council Member: Yes 
 Experience: “Participating in CR meetings and proposal discussions in the past year has helped make our team better. Understanding the current community dynamics and project development can provide great help for functional development on the chain. I hope to continue our efforts in the next year, provide some technical suggestions for relevant decisions, and contribute to the better development of Elastos.” 
 Background: “The Gelaxy team is mainly responsible for the development of main and side chains. The implementation of many proposals requires the participation of the chain team. It is necessary to be able to discuss and know the relevant details at the CR committee meeting.” 
 Contribution Goals: “Participate in proposal discussions, understand the details of the proposal, and give suggestions and opinions on technical implementation.” 
 Improvements: “I hope that it will be easier to initiate the proposal and allow community members to easily participate in the advancement of the proposal, not just the CR members themselves; some members of the community will apply for proposals. Funding is not very standardized, I hope ELA application can be more standardized.”

 Bean 
 
 Email: <a>go.elastos@gmail.com</a> 
 Current Council Member: Yes 
 Experience: “In the past year as a member of the Council, I have focused on enhancing community engagement and supporting project development. If re-elected, I aim to continue these initiatives, improve transparency, and strengthen community communication to ensure sustainable growth.” 
 Background: “I have a background in investment and have been involved with the Elastos ecosystem for years. My interest in blockchain technology and belief in Elastos’ vision inspired me to run for the CR council. I am dedicated to using my experience to support the community and contribute to its growth.” 
 Contribution Goals:
 
 “Provide professional advice to the CR and ecosystem based on my knowledge and experience.” 
 “Work with council members to improve transparency and communication within the community.” 
 “Work with ecosystem partners to develop support systems for new and existing projects to help them succeed.” 
 
 
 Improvements:
 
 “Efficient Decision-Making: Streamlining our decision-making processes can help us respond more quickly to emerging opportunities and challenges. This includes improving coordination among council members.” 
 “Comprehensive Support for Projects: Developing a structured support system for projects within the ecosystem can ensure their success and sustainability. This includes providing mentorship, resources, and networking opportunities to help projects grow.” 
 “Professional Advice and Expertise: Leveraging the knowledge and experience of council members to provide professional advice can help guide the CRC and the broader ecosystem towards informed and strategic decisions.”

 Sash | Elacity 🐘 
 
 Email: <a>sash@ela.city</a> 
 Current Council Member: Yes 
 Experience: “As a dedicated member of the Elastos community and a current council member with a 100% voting track record, I have been deeply involved in developing and promoting Rong Chen’s vision. My focus has been on bridging the technical aspects of Elastos with community culture, ensuring that the innovative potential of our platform is both understood and utilised by the broader community. This is particularly highlighted as the Founder and CEO of Elacity, innovating dDRM and Head of Operations at BeL2, allowing Bitcoin to communicate and execute services to EVM without bridging assets.” 
 Contribution Goals: “My primary goal is to continue fostering understanding and integration of Elastos’ technical capabilities within the community. By leveraging my experience and the insights gained from previous council terms, I aim to enhance the accessibility and adoption of our decentralised technologies. This includes promoting the development and deployment of Digital Capsules and Bitcoin Finance within the Elastos SmartWeb, expanding the functionality and reach of the Elacity and BeL2 platforms.” 
 Improvements: “I believe there is significant potential in increasing community engagement and transparency. My initiatives will focus on enhancing communication channels between the council and the community, reducing the reliance on closed chats, and promoting more transparent interactions. Based on my experience, platforms like Telegram often create silos and negative feedback loops despite everyone’s best intentions. With the newly established CRC DAO LLC, I propose shifting more operations and features to the CRC website, which will help ironically ‘centralise’ and streamline open communications. This move will ensure that social media platforms are primarily used for marketing purposes, allowing the CRC website to become the main hub for community engagement and operational updates”.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By highlighting your consistent track record, dedication to Rong Chen’s vision, and focus on community and technical integration, your entry will resonate well with voters who value experience, commitment, and a forward-thinking approach.</p>
<p>These candidates bring a wealth of experience and a wide array of perspectives to the table. The CR election promises to be a significant step forward in shaping the future of Elastos. We encourage all community members to engage with the candidates and participate in the voting process.</p>

<p>Digital ID has been increasingly in the news lately, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansardr/27632/&amp;sid=0017">Australia</a>&nbsp;begins to ramp up its systems pilots development following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196986150773792768/">the passing of legislation</a>. In Aotearoa there’s been<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202405/nz-cabinet-minister-champions-digital-id-in-government-transformation-at-data-summit?utm_source=MarketingList&amp;utm_campaign=dc16ec863f-Top+Reads+17-05-202417%2F5%2F24+11%3A59+AM&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_3ab9d4375a-dc16ec863f-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D">&nbsp;a lot happening too</a>&nbsp;as Minister Collins opened<a href="https://nzgovdata.co/">&nbsp;this year’s Summit</a>&nbsp;where DINZ was on stage later.</p>



<p>Contained within the avalanche of consultations posted in March and early April, was the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DISTF-Rules-Draft-April-2024.pdf">second revision of the rules</a>&nbsp;that support NZ’s own<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2023/0013/latest/LMS459583.html">&nbsp;Digital Identity Trust Framework (DISTF) Act</a>. The Department of Internal Affairs(DIA) presented to a packed virtual lunchtime audience on it earlier this month. Digital Identity NZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/dinz-distf-working-group/">DISTF Working Group</a>, comprising both private and public sector participants,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DINZ-Response-DISTF-Rules-submission-May-2024.pdf">responded in detail</a>, reflecting the overall message that, despite good intentions to improve security, data protection, and privacy to reduce online fraud, there are alot of moving parts for stakeholders to consider. The fact that it is ‘opt-in’ for stakeholders and that alternative/non-digital channels should always be offered to people and organisations because it is not compulsory, should help provide time to become comfortable and confident with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/biometrics-special-interest-group-sig/">DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group</a>&nbsp;made a&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DINZ-Submission-Biometrics-Code-Exposure-Draft-May-2024.pdf">deeply considered submission</a>&nbsp;on the Office of the Privacy Commissioner’s (OPC)<a href="https://privacy.org.nz/news/consultations/biometrics">&nbsp;exposure draft of a Code of Practice for biometrics under the Privacy Act 2020</a>. We continue to assert that a code is premature with potential for unintended consequences, whereas well drafted, clear guidance at the outset will deliver better outcomes for all New Zealanders. As if the above two were not enough, the<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2024/0044/latest/whole.html">&nbsp;CDR/CPD bill&nbsp;</a>is set to be introduced to Parliament, which also has a critical digital identity component.</p>



<p>Since the CPD and the Biometrics Code (should it be implemented) are mandatory for specific digital ID service providers undertaking particular identity-related processes, whereas the DISTF is opt-in, I sense that the weight of regulatory burden will result in tough choices for the industry in this small market, despite the good intentions of all stakeholders. In my view, we’ll have to be conscious of the potential for market stall. Could the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2024/0044/latest/whole.html?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=5e09a5a86b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_03_18_11_43_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-5d57a7a812-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D">CDR/CPD bill</a>&nbsp;help unify our data and streamline our sector and service laws to better suit our market size?</p>



<p>Meanwhile, sectors continue to analyse the role of digital identity and the potential to operate schemes within the DISTF, with financial services leading the way. This is demonstrated so clearly by the&nbsp;<a href="https://comcom.govt.nz/about-us/our-role/competition-studies/market-study-into-personal-banking-services?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=8c96051db1-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_03_18_11_43_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-5d57a7a812-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D#projecttab">Commerce Commission’s consultation on personal banking</a>, which highlights the importance of robust digital identification for frictionless bank-switching and faster progress towards Open Banking.</p>



<p>With the above very much in mind,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7194476205281087488/">Payments NZ and DINZ co-hosted a highly productive investigative sprint earlier this month</a>&nbsp;across its combined membership. We brought together experts, representatives from the private, public and NGO sectors, and heard inspiring presentations from Australia’s&nbsp;<a href="https://connectid.com.au/">ConnectID</a>&nbsp;and our very own<a href="https://mattr.global/">&nbsp;MATTR</a>.</p>



<p>The research and education sector have been deeply engaged with digital identity for many years and continue to lead on many fronts. Learn more at our lunchtime webinar on Thursday 13 June simply titled ‘<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-higher-education-aotearoa/">Digital Identity, Higher Education, Aotearoa</a>’, when DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.themiddlewaregroup.com/">Middleware</a>&nbsp;showcases fellow DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university.html">University of Auckland</a>.</p>



<p>The following week, DINZ and FinTechNZ members with a general understanding of ‘digital cash’ should diary note 20 June for a ‘town hall’ styled dynamic submission with The Reserve Bank of New Zealand – Te Pūtea Matua on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/hub/news/2024/04/consultation-opens-on-a-digital-currency-for-new-zealand#:~:text=The%20Reserve%20Bank%20of%20New%20Zealand%20%2D%20Te%20P%C5%ABtea%20Matua%20is,coins%20will%20still%20be%20available.">criticalities (including digital ID) surrounding ‘digital cash</a>’ – a Central Bank Digital Currency as a potential alternative to physical cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DINZ and FinTechNZ members who are familiar with ‘digital cash’ should watch for details about a town hall meeting on Thursday, June 20, with The Reserve Bank of New Zealand – Te Pūtea Matua, discussing a potential Central Bank Digital Currency as an alternative to physical cash. The meeting will cover important topics such as digital ID.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, the Ceramic network was meant to be an open and customizable platform for developers to build on. The core Ceramic team is excited to keep delivering on that promise and launch Ceramic’s new Data Feed API.</p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/networking/data-feed-api?ref=blog.ceramic.network">The Data Feed</a> provides a new API for Ceramic that allows developers to receive notifications of updates to JSON documents that are managed via Ceramic. This feed of document updates allows developers to customize the way their data is indexed and queried, and enables the development of new custom database products on top of Ceramic. Databases built on top of the Data Feed API get the advantage of powerful querying capabilities custom-tailored to the needs of the application, while retaining interoperability and composability of the underlying data with all other databases built on the Data Feed API throughout the Ceramic ecosystem.</p> What is the Data Feed API <p>The Data Feed API enables developers to keep track of all the new state changes happening to documents in the Ceramic network, as they are observed on a Ceramic node. These state updates can either be from writes sent to the Ceramic node through the HTTP Client, or writes discovered from the network for Streams belonging to Models that are indexed on the Ceramic node. Ultimately, the Data Feed API can be used to build custom indexers and other database products, e.g., <a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB</a>.</p> Supported API Methods <p>The Data Feed is a read-only API, allowing you to retrieve the feed data through HTTP GET methods. The Data Feed operates on the aggregated state of documents (such as Models and ModelInstanceDocuments), abstracting away the lower-level concerns of the underlying event streaming system. This allows developers to build with familiar JSON documents while taking advantage of automatic application of updates to document state with built-in schema validation.</p><p>Feed data can be accessed via a new HTTP endpoint on the js-ceramic node with the URL path <code>api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents</code>. The feed utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push messages with the following schema:</p> <code>FeedDocument = {
  resumeToken: string
  commitId: CommitID
  content: any
  metadata: StreamMetadata
  eventType: EventType
}
</code> <p>So for example, the following request:</p><p><code>curl http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents</code> </p><p>will return the following response:</p> <code>data: {
  "resumeToken": "1714742204565000000"
  "commitId": "k6zn3t2py84tn1dpy24625xjv65g4r23wuqpch6mmrywshreivaqiyaqctrz2ba5kk0qjvec61pbmyl15b49zxfd8qd3aiiupltnpveh45oiranqr4njj40",
  "content": "{...}",
  "metadata": {
    "controllers": [
      "did:key:z6MknE3RuK7XU2W1KGCQrsSVhzRwCUJ9uMb6ugwbELm9JdP6"
    ],
    "model": "kh4q0ozorrgaq2mezktnrmdwleo1d"
  },
  "eventType": 2
}
</code> <p>The Data Feed API can also be consumed through event listeners to continuously pull and process events from the feed. For example:</p> <code>import { EventSource&nbsp; } from "cross-eventsource";
import { JsonAsString, AggregationDocument } from '@ceramicnetwork/codecs';
import { decode } from "codeco";

const source = new EventSource('&lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents&gt;')
const Codec = JsonAsString.pipe(AggregationDocument)

source.addEventListener('message', (event) =&gt; {
	console.log('message', event)
	//use JsonAsString, and AggregationDocument to decode and use event.data
	const parsedData = decode(Codec, event.data);
	console.log('parsed', parsedData)
})

source.addEventListener('error', error =&gt; {
	console.log('error', error)
})

console.log('listening...')
</code>  Resumability <p>The Data Feed API also comes with a resumability feature that provides “at least once” delivery semantics. Resumability is the ability for a consumer of the feed to pick up “where it left off” after downtime. Without resumability, an indexer that goes down has no way of receiving and indexing data that was propagated while the indexer was offline. The goal of resumability is to ensure that a consumer of the Data Feed API can be guaranteed to receive the most recent data for each Stream at least once, even in the event of failure.</p><p>Resumability in Data Feed API is enabled by the <code>resumeToken</code> property, which is added to every object emitted by the Data Feed API. This property enables you to initiate a connection and ask for the entries starting immediately after <code>resumeToken</code>.</p><p>For example, let’s say your application got an entry containing <code>resumeToken: "1714742204565000000"</code> . When connecting, you can pass the token value as a query parameter, as follows:</p> <code>// ... same as a code snipped above
const url = new URL("&lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents&gt;")
url.searchParams.set('after', '1714742204565000000') // Value of the last resumeToken
// Connection to &lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents?after=1714742204565000000&gt;
const source = new EventSource(url)
</code> <p>Note that the internal structure of the resumeToken is meant to be considered opaque and may change in the future. You should not try to craft resumeTokens manually, instead, you should always use the resumeToken of the last event you received and processed successfully from the Data Feed resuming the feed with a new connection.</p> What’s coming next? <p>This release marks the initial public release of the Data Feed API with quite a few significant updates already on the horizon.</p><p>One of the upcoming significant updates will be introduced with the new Event Streaming API, powered by ceramic-one (a new implementation of the Ceramic protocol, written in Rust), which will allow developers direct access to the underlying event streams that have historically been hidden behind document-based APIs.</p><p>In addition to that, the core Ceramic team is committed to listening to your feedback and feature requests and taking them into account for future releases.</p><p>At this stage, the core Ceramic team would like to see early adopters trying out the new API and sharing the early feedback with the team.</p> Share your feedback with the Ceramic team! <p>Do you have ideas for how Data Feed API can enable the development of your projects? Or maybe you have questions or feedback on what could be improved? Share your thoughts with the core Ceramic team on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Forum</a>. We would love to hear from you!</p>

<p>Identity providers including Canadian Bank Note (CBN), Veridos (a joint venture between German security tech company Giesecke+Devrient and federal technology company Bundesdruckerei) and Thales shared digital and mobile identity innovations, developments and lessons learned from real-world deployments during Day 2 of ID4Africa in Cape Town. </p><p>The discussion concluded that Digital Identity is a powerful tool to increase inclusion and opportunity. A successful program is one everyone can use, including issuers, holders and verifiers. Convenience, security and interoperability are critical success factors. </p><p>Why build on global standards?<br>Trust - global standards are what enable relying parties / verifiers to trust digital IDs</p><p>Security - digital IDs are always verified electronically using standardized protocols, eliminating the need for error-prone physical inspection</p><p>Ecosystem development - building on standards enables ecosystems to benefit from network effects. For example, wallet provider like Google and Apple are working to persuade entities like Uber and Airbnb to adopt mDOC - reducing the need for ecosystem conveners to find verifiers for the ecosystem </p><p>Scalability - building on standards facilitates planning for the future and readiness to expand into new use cases. For example, the TSA (the body that manages security of air travel in the US) has started accepting mobile IDs for domestic air travel in some states where ISO mDL has been implemented </p><p>Cost reduction - avoid being locked in to a single vendor and reduce the cost of ongoing maintenance and support. Digital Identity based on the 3-party model enables holders to present credentials directly to verifiers, meaning there is no longer a need to maintain verification infrastructure, unlocking major financial savings compared to federated identity schemes, Mark Sullivan said</p><p>Benefits of participation in standards development</p><p>Canadian Bank Note (CBN) is involved in both standards development and implementation. "Digital Identity will be constantly changing for a while now. Participating in the standards process enables us to bring the latest and greatest in Digital Identity back into our solutions space", said Mark Sullivan, Director of Digital Services </p><p>Standards development gaps </p>  Standards integration. CBN is currently focusing on ISO mDL, as it is the only credential format that formalizes credential exchange today   Cross-border trust. Don't reinvent what already exists. For example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Public Key Directory is a database holding national cryptographic keys used in authentication of e-passport information - need something similar to ensure interoperability between countries  <p>Adoption insights</p>  The tools and standards are in place, but there is still hesitance to start building  Issuing Digital Identities is not enough to ensure adoption; there must be services associated with these identities  Governments' role is to create digital infrastructure which individual agencies and private sector orgs can leverage to make customers' lives easier and safer   Ease of use is critical: Digital Identity needs to be as easy to use as presenting a physical ID card. CBN recommends tight integration of UX/ UI teams into the software development process; their UX team benefited from deep dive research into other apps that require trust to be established, such as mobile banking  <p>Addis Ababa scoops ID4Africa 2025 AGM host city</p><p>The National ID Ethiopia team are celebrating in Cape Town tonight after being announced as winners of the competition to host the ID4Africa 2025 AGM!</p>

		<p>Slalom and New Jersey Institute of Technology Launch “Sophie”–A Prototype Digital Student Concierge</p>
<p>NEWARK, NJ, May 22, 2024 – The EdgeCon conference series continues to solidify its place as a destination event for higher education decision makers, with EdgeCon Spring garnering the event’s highest-ever attendance rate and attendee satisfaction rate. Edge members and vendors are taking note, and choosing the event as a key venue for innovative announcements.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.slalom.com/us/en">Slalom</a> and longtime Edge member, <a href="https://www.njit.edu/">New Jersey Institute of Technology</a> (NJIT), chose EdgeCon as their venue to officially debut a prototype AI Student Success Tool to attendees.</p>
<p>EdgeCon served as the ideal environment for the debut, given the prevalence of higher education membership in attendance, as well as the timely discussions of how AI is transforming higher education. Currently being referred to in development as Sophie, the AI tool is called the NJIT Digital Student Advisor, and is a prototype “digital student concierge”. Sophie was built using Soul Machines technology, with chat capabilities provided by GPT 3.5, and hosted in Microsoft Azure. The prototype was designed to work on any cloud platform with a native LLM integration (AWS, Google, etc.).</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Launching the prototype for our digital student advisor ‘Sophie’ in partnership with NJIT is just the beginning of a transformative journey for higher education in New Jersey. As we embark on a journey to humanize the future of AI, we’re not just shaping technology, we’re shaping the future of education itself, unlocking limitless possibilities for personalized learning and student success.”&nbsp;</p>

		<p>In this prototype stage, Sophie was programmed to address a specific use case regarding a student interested in switching majors. The Q&amp;A format shown in the demo was developed around typical questions a student may ask when switching majors or attending NJIT for the first time. Further development will focus on additional use cases to support students in their journey when accessing academic or social services at NJIT. The overall purpose is to create and improve upon a digital humanizing experience for students and faculty – one that is both informative and supportive.</p>
<p>Ed Wozencroft, Vice President for Digital Strategy and Chief Digital Officer, Vice President Digital Strategy CIO, NJIT, shared, “NJIT’s Artificial Intelligence Initiative seeks to embed AI in all facets of our university–from teaching and learning; to research and innovation; our operations and infrastructure – all while remaining human-centered. Undoubtedly AI is here to stay, and higher education must adapt to succeed. With great partners like Slalom, we can quickly develop and deploy great tools and services that change the nature of education and improve the value proposition of investing in a now highly personalized higher education.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the prototype is in its early stages, NJIT is currently in development discussions with Slalom to determine the next phases and potential release dates. Stay tuned for launch dates and availability.</p>

<p>DIF SC members and staff are among 2000+ participants from 101 countries participating in the ID4Africa 2024 AGM in South Africa.</p><p>Almost half of the delegates present at the event in Cape Town are representing African governments, as the ID4Africa movement celebrates its tenth year. The opening morning was rich with strategic and operational insights,  including</p>  The stakes are high. Digital identity is critical to "defeating the scandal of invisibility" and ensuring equal access to education, healthcare and economic opportunity, according to Mr Mthiyane, policy director of South Africa's Department of Home Affairs  Optimism tempered by realism. Digital identity is growing fast, but it's still early days. It has taken 30 years for e-passports to reach universal adoption, and ID4AFrica Executive Chairman Dr Atick expects a similar timescale for full adoption of digital ID, though this will be on a bigger scale  Theory versus reality. Some believe citizenship and access credentials should be kept separate. In practice, "You can't think of the technology without considering the national context" Dr Atick stated. This was borne out by the accounts of countries with multiple or porous borders, where establishing citizenship is a key step, though not all services require it    Need for policy and technology alignment. In a poll taken during the initial plenary session, 88% believed a policy requiring a unique National ID Number (UID) to access services should be a priority for lawmakers. Such a policy comes with its own challenges, including how to address the risk of exclusion and safeguard citizens' privacy.  Mix of physical and digital credentials. ID cards are not about to disappear. Most if not all of the programs outlined by speakers combine a UID (often linked to birth registration), a physical card and a digital ID (usually stored and presented via a mobile app). Most programs have adopted a multi-modal approach, with enrollment, authentication et cetera possible online, offline and in-person. That said, digital identity is seen as an important tool to accelerate progress towards Identity For All (UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9). For example, Malawi's digital ID scheme has helped it transition from a situation where most citizens lacked any legally recognised ID in 2017, to being on track to become the first African country to achieve UN SDG 16.9.    Digital identity as Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). This is the overall theme for the 2024 AGM and was reflected in several panel discussions after the lunch break focused on public policy. A number of related questions were discussed, including how countries can leverage digital identity programs to bootstrap a wider DPI while avoiding being locked into any particular technological approach or stack. Uganda's UGHub team shared that they are pursuing a strategy to establish DPI using protocols, not point solutions. Benefits include 100% uptake of electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) by banks and the rapid deployment of e-signatures across many sectors.  "I urge you to look at UGHub as an example of how to successfully establish DPI" Dr Atick commented.   Evolving privacy approaches. Most schemes rely on centralized databases to store foundational ID data. Privacy and security measures include UID randomization, data encryption, strong access management (including requiring government agencies to prove compliance with privacy laws), explicit user consent for data sharing and tokenized / decentralized authentication. Interest in standards-based privacy enhancing technologies such as decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials is growing.  <p>These insights elicited many challenging questions from the audience. </p><p>Implementation insights from Ethiopia's Fayda ID program</p><p>DIF Steering Committee member Yodahe Zemichael kicked off the presentations from national ID teams by providing an update on Ethiopia's Fayda program. </p><p>Launched in 2022, Fayda provides a foundational ID for citizens and refugees. Key achievements to date include</p>  Personal data regulation passed, creating a strong foundation for Fayda acceptance and uptake  integrated 44 organisations including banks and telcos covering more than 60% of the population, enabling them to securely onboard customers  Started authentication for real-time KYC by relying parties - currently processing 8,000 requests per day  <p>Mr Zemichael described the key points of Ethiopia's strategy for digital credentials:</p>  Enabling citizens to download a legal ID credential as a printable document with embedded QR code, share via a mini-app or show as a plastic printed card (all 3 are equally accepted)   Enable online and offline authentication for eKYC. Most authentication is offline to date (via an authenticator app). This is beneficial for privacy, and Mr Zemichael believes it will continue to be the mainstay of KYC processes for some time   Security and privacy are of utmost importance. The national ID team is looking to support W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) standards in time   <p>Mr Zemichael shared valuable learnings from the Fayda rollout, including </p>  Strong demand for physical credentials - requires printed cards to be delivered to citizen's homes  Enrolling people is an expensive affair including extensive educational activities plus a physical presence in multiple locations. As a result, Fayda is being scaled up  gradually  Importance of citizen education and support, including a national call centre which is open 6 days a week and fields a high volume of queries  <p>The day wrapped up with a fascinating session on DPI, that showed the wide range of approaches being adopted by African nations. Three examples illustrate this diversity</p>  Zambia started by digitizing healthcare records, as this was the most urgent use case. The national ID team is now looking at which outputs can be re-used in other use cases, creating opportunities to build DPI 'on the fly'  Senegal started by identifying digital assets that already existed within different agencies. The country is now building a federation scheme that enables all agencies to leverage these assets  Malawi adopted a 'greenfield' approach that capitalizes on the previous lack of identity infrastructure, enabling the country to create a best-practice digital ID program from scratch without needing to integrate legacy systems and platforms   <p>Dr Atick wrapped up the first day's proceedings by concluding that Africa has talent, digital public infrastructure and choice. </p><p>More updates from the DIF team tomorrow! </p>

 A less technical community-centric guide Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>It’s <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/03/16/verifiable-credentials-and-open-badges-3-0-whats-changed/">been a while</a> since the upcoming changes to the Open Badges specification were first proposed. The <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/impl">change to v3.0</a> has now been ratified, with six organisations at the time of writing having platforms that are <a href="https://site.imsglobal.org/certifications">certified compatible</a>.</p><p>We’d like to give a shout-out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerrilemoie/">Kerri Lemoie</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nateotto/">Nate Otto</a> who have tirelessly pushed this work forward, ensuring that the original community-focused mission has continued now that the standard is stewarded by&nbsp;1EdTech.</p><p>The video below gives a overview with the rest of the post helping break down the changes in a less technical way. We can’t say “non-technical” because, well, it’s a technical standard. But we hope that it what follows helps you understand some of the changes and what it means in practice.</p> 1. Enhanced&nbsp;Security <p>Open Badges 3.0 adopts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) data model, which enhances the security and integrity of credentials. Unlike with previous versions of the specification, the verifiable data that they contain can be validated without having to check back with the issuer each&nbsp;time.</p><p>This matters because organisations go out of business, web pages get taken down, and life moves on. By ensuring that the badge contains everything required, it can be used for truly lifelong learning for decades to&nbsp;come.</p><p>For example, imagine a cooperative that issues digital badges to its members for skills like collaborative decision-making or sustainable practices. When co-op members with these badges present them to, say, a partner organisation, they can trust that the badge is genuine without needing to contact the co-op directly.</p><p>This is particularly useful in large networks like those we support through our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">storytelling and communications work</a>, where verifying a member’s skills quickly and accurately is valuable.</p> 2. Control and&nbsp;Privacy <p>The introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier">Decentralised Identifiers</a> (DIDs) in Open Badges 3.0 gives badge earners more control over their personal data and how it is shared. DIDs are like personal web addresses for people’s digital identities that they can manage independently.</p><p>For community-oriented organisations, DIDs mean that members can manage their own credentials without relying on a central authority. For example, a member of a social enterprise could share their badges with a funder directly from their personal digital wallet, enhancing privacy and&nbsp;control.</p><p>Also, because DIDs are big long strings of numbers you can also use them anonymously. This could be useful for verifying the claims of sources who want to remain unidentified, for example that a whistleblower actually worked at an organisation that they’re reporting. It’s also possible to control multiple DIDs for different facets of your life, should you wish, such as work, activism, and your social&nbsp;life.</p> 3. Richer&nbsp;Metadata <p>Open Badges 3.0 allows for richer metadata within badges, which means more detailed information about achievements, how they were earned, and what they represent. This includes supporting multimedia content, making badges more descriptive and informative.</p><p>Credentials like badges are useful in helping us tell the story of where we’ve been and where we’re going. This is sometimes called the ‘learner journey’. With Open Badges 3.0, a badge can include images, links, videos, and more, to provide a narrative of how the badge was earned. For those that can remember back 20 years to the interest in eportfolios, each badge is essentially a mini-eportfolio, and can also be part of a wider portfolio.</p><p>For example, a badge for a professional development course could include video testimonials, project examples, and peer evaluations directly within the badge. This makes it easier for potential employers or collaborators to get a true sense of what the badge represents, enhancing the value of the credential to all&nbsp;parties.</p> 4. Interoperability <p>It’s one of those words that it’s difficult to avoid when talking about technical systems, and not one that we use in every day conversation. But ‘interoperability’ just means the ability of different systems, organisations, or products to work together effectively without special effort from the user. Various systems and devices can communicate, exchange data, and use the information that has been exchanged.</p><p>That’s might not sound too exciting, but with its alignment to the VC data model, Open Badges 3.0 is designed to work seamlessly with other digital credentials systems, including those used by educational institutions and businesses. For example, we’re working with the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium</a>, and systems can issue all different kinds of achievements, because of the interoperability between Open Badges and&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>For instance, a non-traditional learner who has earned badges as part of their self-taught skills development might want to share these with a university to get onto an MSc course. The university’s system can automatically recognise and understand the badges thanks to the shared VC model. This eases the process of credit recognition and transfer, making it simpler for learners to continue their education or seek job opportunities without so many bureaucratic hurdles.</p> 5. Revocation and Status Management <p>To ‘revoke’ a badge simply means to say that it is no longer valid. There are many reasons why an individual or organisation may wish to do this, and not just because of errors in issuing or poor behaviour by the recipient.</p><p>For example, imagine that an B-Corp has a training programme which they update. While they could simply leave the old badges as-is, to provide less of a headache for people trying to understand the difference between current and previous alumni of the programme, they can now revoke, update, or withdraw badges efficiently.</p><p>With Open Badges 3.0, this process is transparent and straightforward, ensuring that only the most current and accurate badges are in circulation. This helps maintain trust in the badge ecosystem, which is vital for the credibility of our collective efforts in promoting digital credentials.</p> Conclusion <p>I’ve been unreasonably excited about a technical specification for 13 years now, ever since the first MacArthur-funded pilot at Mozilla. This latest update to Open Badges 3.0 is a significant step forward in making digital credentials more secure, user-centered, and meaningful within various communities, including educational institutions, professional networks, and social organisations.</p><p>Along with the work that we’ve been doing around creating <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">plausible utopias for Open Recognition</a>, I’m really looking forward to seeing how this development helps further empower individuals and communities, enhances trust in digital credentials, and supports the broader landscape of lifelong learning.</p><p>If you’d like help with understanding either the basics or the latest developments in credentialing technology, <a href="mailto:hello@weareopen.coop">get in touch</a>! We’ve also got a free email-based course called <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/reframing-recognition/">Reframing Recognition: strategies for success in going beyond microcredentials</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/why-open-badges-3-0-matters-09bb231be864">Why Open Badges 3.0 Matters</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>On April 24, 2024, the FIDO Alliance held its first ever in-person FDO Workshop at the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica Nangang Campus in Taipei. The event attracted over 100 attendees from 30 different organizations. This workshop was dedicated to unveiling the power of the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/device-onboarding-overview/">FIDO Device Onboard</a> (FDO)—a revolutionary open standard that simplifies and secures the device onboarding process by moving away from legacy approaches that often rely on inefficient and insecure passwords and other knowledge-based credentials.</p>







<p>[Pictures from FIDO Taipei Workshop]</p>



<p>The sessions included “FDO 101,” “FDO Certification Programs,” “How to Deploy FDO” and diverse showcases from leaders in edge computing and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/download-iot-specifications/">IoT</a>. Companies including Intel, ASRock, Red Hat, Dell, VinCSS, and Infineon demonstrated how they have developed, applied, and used FDO in their solutions. We are excited to share slides from the workshop:</p>

<p>Traditionally,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager">passwords</a>&nbsp;have served as the primary means of securing digital identities, yet their limitations are becoming increasingly evident. To pave the way for a passwordless future, accessibility is paramount. Any alternative authentication method must be inclusive, catering to users across diverse technological environments.

<p>The Honorable Rohit Chopra<br>Director<br>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&nbsp;<br>1700 G St NW<br>Washington, DC 20552&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="mailto:rohit.chopra@cfpb.gov">rohit.chopra@cfpb.gov</a></p>
<p>May 16, 2024</p>
<p>Director Chopra,</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is a non-profit organization whose mission is to lead the global community in creating open standards that are secure, interoperable and privacy-preserving. As part of that mission, we have worked closely with many ecosystems to advance Open Banking and consumer financial data sharing globally. We hope to be of service to the CFPB as we are to many other government partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are writing to follow up on our <a href="https://openid.net/oidf-comments-cfpb-rule-1033-regarding-open-banking/">letter</a> submitted on December 29, 2023 in response to the CFPB’s NPRM on Personal Financial Data Rights.&nbsp; This letter is written in light of submissions by other commenters and subsequent discussions with parties in the ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As detailed in our original letter, the OpenID Foundation believes that the final rule should include reference to a Qualified Industry Standard (QIS) for a Communication Protocol.&nbsp; More specifically, we believe this QIS should be required and separate from the QIS for “data in a standardized format” (“Data Format”) as proposed in §1033.311(b). We appreciate that such a change will have an impact to the definitions of 1033.131 and 1033.141(a). We respect the baseline included in 1033.421(e), however as security and implementation experts, we believe it would be suitable to address the security and interoperability risks more completely within this ecosystem as advised in this letter. Since the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act was passed in 1999, the domain of cloud based services, the related security risks, and the global standards to address those risks have evolved substantially.</p>
<p>Specifications for a Data Format and a Communication Protocol are critical to the developer interface required in §1033.301(a), as the standards serve two different purposes. A Data Format standard should prescribe, among other things, naming conventions, standard codes and formatting, data models and schema. A standardized Data Format promotes business interoperability, by allowing third-parties to aggregate and analyze high-quality data with ease.</p>
<p>In contrast, a standardized Communication Protocol ensures that data is shared in a manner that ensures security, and enables privacy and technical interoperability.&nbsp; Technical interoperability is a key element to achieve scale in the development and implementation of an Open Banking ecosystem – in particular to ensure that small or new market entrants wishing to receive data are able to easily participate.&nbsp; As mentioned in our original letter, the OpenID Foundation global community has developed a Communication Protocol that has become a de-facto industry standard for API ecosystems in general, and Open Banking / Open Data ecosystems in particular: FAPI – a profile of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.</p>
<p>The FAPI profile has been selected by multiple leading private and public Open Banking ecosystems. The FAPI profile is a security and interoperability enhanced version of OAuth 2.0 which closes critical security gaps that OAuth 2.0 alone does not address. Current global ecosystem adoption of FAPI include:&nbsp;</p>

<p>US FDX&nbsp;</p>


<p>Recommended</p>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;



<p>Beyond the 12 countries above and their milestones, we are seeing tangible growth:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Billions of successful FAPI API calls, with secure, interoperable and consent-based movement of user data or payments&nbsp; 
 2,800 FAPI implementations certified globally (<a href="https://openid.net/certification/">https://openid.net/certification/</a>) 
 44 million active users in Brazil (20% of the population) 
 6.5 million active users in the UK (15% of the UK population) 
 
<p>Given the critical role FAPI is playing in the US and abroad, hope is that the CFPB will explicitly add a requirement for a Communication Protocol and that the OIDF’s FAPI profile will in due course be selected as a QIS to fulfil the proposed requirement for a Communication Protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the rulemaking docket and other discussions, we understand that the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) intends to apply to be a standard setting body (SSB) under proposed §1033.141, and that they would meet the requirements for the Data Format. Were FDX to be designated an SSB, it could select the FAPI profile as a QIS for the Communication Protocol to complete their market offering and help offer a scalable and interoperable solution – this would be the preferred outcome for the OIDF.&nbsp; Alternatively, if FDX were to choose not to specify a Communication Protocol that delivers interoperability and security to the level required for a financial services ecosystem, the OIDF would consider applying to be an SSB so that the FAPI profile could be used as a QIS for the Communication Protocol enabling US ecosystems conform to this critical requirement.</p>
<p>We would also like to make very clear the nature of the risks that arise should the CFPB not modify the requirements to explicitly require a Communications Protocol. These risks are broken down into four categories.</p>
 US Ecosystem Interoperability Risks: 
 
 There will be a diverse set of Communication Protocol variants delivered by data providers as no consistent standard is required. As a result there will be significantly greater complexity for authorized third parties to deal with when integrating with the developer interfaces delivered by the in scope data providers. This results in an increased cost burden on the authorized third parties, and they will be unlikely to all implement to all available interfaces.. 
 This increased cost burden is likely to reduce the likelihood of organisations choosing to become authorized third parties at all, reducing competition and choice for consumers. 
 If authorised third parties cannot easily implement to all data providers, they will build first to the interfaces of the largest data holders. This means consumers with smaller data holders will have reduced choice and services from authorized third party services. 
 The overall result is that the US would end up with one of the world’s worst and most inconsistent user experiences amongst all the current global deployments of Open Banking and Open Data deployed to date. 
 
 Time to Market Risks: 
 
 While it is clear that the CFPB is extremely keen to have an Open Banking ecosystem established in the US market there is a difference between banks having delivered compliant developer interfaces, and authorized third parties and consumers adopting Open Banking. If there is not a defined Communication Protocol market adoption will be slow. A Communication Protocol makes it easier for authorized third parties to deploy by reducing cost and complexity of developing and delivering new product offerings for consumers, and in turn their time to market to deploy and scale. &nbsp; This enhances the ability of the ecosystem to offer fair access to financial services, and treat customers fairly.&nbsp; 
 While adding a Communication Protocol requirement to the rule may seem to make it harder for data providers to deliver compliance on a timely basis, it actually makes it easier because it reduces the optionality available to implementers. In addition, FAPI conformance tests are freely available to implementors to use, software is deployed at scale in other markets, and many service organisations have deployment experience. By leveraging these capabilities, Saudi Arabia deployed FAPI across their ecosystem in less than 12 months, and UAE is likely to launch in less than 12 months later this year.&nbsp; 
 
 US Ecosystem Security Risks: 
 
 It is very likely that many US data providers will take the lowest cost approach to compliance with the regulation (as has been seen in other previous contexts) contributing to undesirable diversity in US implementations. 
 These implementations are unlikely to have all been subject to thorough security assessment, and real “battle testing” that a standardized Communication Protocol like the FAPI security profile has had.&nbsp; This means implementations will not be consistently secure by default. 
 Implementations that have not deployed and certified to the highest security profiles are at risk of being the “weakest links” amongst not just US but global Open Banking and Open Data deployments. That will make the US and these specific implementations attractive to sophisticated attackers, putting US consumers at higher risk. 
 These concerns introduce safety and soundness concerns to Open Banking participants and consumers. 
 
 International Interoperability Risks: 
 
 The diversity of implementations will set-back the US market in its ability to interoperate with other Open Banking implementations around the world. The majority of global ecosystems to date have selected FAPI, explicitly naming it in their regulations, and requiring certification to FAPI.&nbsp; 
 If the US does not choose a Communication Protocol that facilitates global interoperability by default, only the largest entities will have the compliance and technology resources to conduct cross border Open Banking transactions. Small and medium sizes data holders and third party service providers will not have the resources to enable global interoperability at all, or they will be forced to pay premiums to intermediaries that facilitate cross border services. Ultimately this impedes the ability to provide fair access to financial services, and treat customers fairly in the global marketplace.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Presuming that the mission of the CFPB is to protect the interests of American consumers,&nbsp;we strongly encourage the CFPB to reconsider the details and conformance criteria related to QIS, and to consult with NIST on benefits of defining a Communication Protocol as we advise. We also encourage the CFPB to move with speed so that the first data holders (those obliged to be compliant in spring 2025) must update their systems to global standards for a Communications Protocol, like FAPI. If the changes are not put into effect now, it will become materially more difficult to course correct later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also understand from your comments at the recent FDX conference that you are concerned about the governance model of standards bodies and certification providers. The OIDF believes our governance model will meet the CFPB requirements, and if necessary, we would work in good faith to close any gaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that this letter will be submitted into the public docket for further consideration and would welcome meeting with you or your staff to discuss our recommendation in further detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A deep dive on Smartflow by Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p><a href="http://smartflow.org">Smartflow</a> enables enterprises to configure worker nodes — a new technology developed by Energy Web. These nodes comprise distributed computing networks that securely execute sensitive business operations impacting multiple companies. Worker nodes themselves are decentralized nodes controlled by companies or individuals who have staked Energy Web tokens in order to become trusted worker node operators. All nodes are anchored to the Energy Web X parachain, itself a Parachain on the Polkadot&nbsp;network.</p><p>This technology was originally developed to solve a paradox that hinders advanced renewable energy tracking solutions like renewable matching and green electric vehicle charging: credibility relies on accurate, publicly verifiable results (e.g., proof that digital representations of renewables are not double-counted). But inputs from separate organizations, such as granular renewable energy production and electricity demand data, are commercially sensitive and need to remain private. Complex commercial, legal, and technical requirements often make it challenging for a single actor to unilaterally access and process all requisite data. The ability to establish a shared source of truth from segregated, individual information sources has been an ongoing challenge in multilateral settings; the challenge is even greater for energy market participants seeking to exchange and process granular data in order to procure services from distributed energy resources.</p><p>Smartflow solves these challenges by enabling enterprises to configure, launch, and maintain distributed computing networks that ingest data from external sources, execute custom workflows based on business logic, and vote on results in order to establish consensus and trustworthy results without revealing or modifying the underlying data. Worker Nodes apply proven and tested concepts and components from blockchain technology in a novel, enterprise-friendly architecture to provide all stakeholders with cryptographic proof that mutually-agreed rules and and processes are followed correctly, ensure computational outputs from business processes are correct, trustworthy, and preserve the privacy and integrity of underlying data for auditing purposes.</p><p>In addition to Smartflow being used as a generic configuration tool for any enterprise by Energy Web customers, the following are examples of existing worker node networks configured using Smartflow:</p>  <a href="https://rmi.org/press-release/maritime-book-and-claim-system-advances-pilot-study-to-support-first-movers-in-zero-emissions-shipping/">Worker nodes supporting the Maritime Shipping registry</a> supported by the Maersk McKinney Moller center for Zero Carbon&nbsp;Shipping  Worker nodes are also supporting a recently released solution for green electric vehicle charging on Energy Web X, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/introducing-autogreencharge-by-energy-web-a-decentralized-application-for-decarbonizing-electric-995436e8fea8">Autogreencharge</a>  A network of nodes powering the <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">Sustainable Aviation Fuel registry</a> in partnership with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers&nbsp;Alliance  A network of worker nodes is currently powering the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-releases-digital-spine-toolkit-to-the-public-e65847d468dd">Digital Spine solution</a> supporting multiple grid decarbonization projects  <p>How Smartflow and Worker Nodes Work: Worker nodes can be implemented in any development framework, including node.js, python, and rust. Each worker node is programmed to execute a specific conditional logic workflow based on a predefined dataset (i.e. source and schema) and event trigger (e.g. a regular time interval, or a specific external event). Workers are given read-only access to one or more external data sources via API or message broker. When the workflow “event” is triggered, the workers initiate a round of calculation and voting (worker nodes can be configured to either poll an external data source at regular intervals, or “listen” to an external source for a specific trigger).</p><p>In the calculation step, each worker node independently executes the same conditional logic based on the data it received during the trigger. Then, each worker submits its results (i.e. output of the logic workflow) to the smart contract, which collates the worker nodes’ votes into a unique voting round and keeps track of each round to maintain continuity. The smart contract defines a voting threshold (typically a simple majority, such as 2 of 3, or 4 of 7, etc.) that must be reached in order to establish consensus on the results of each voting round. Each voting round is defined by a voting ID, the number of unique votes (from worker nodes), and a consensus result. If the threshold is reached (i.e. a majority of nodes independently reach the same conclusion and submit identical results to the vote), then the voting round is closed and the result is hashed on the Energy Web X Parachain; this creates a connected tree of results that can be queried and validated for auditing purposes. If consensus is not reached in the voting round, the entire process from event trigger through voting is repeated; if a second round fails, a custom workflow is executed (this can include alerts, failover to other nodes, or acceptance of results from a plurality of workers).</p><p>In addition to collating the voting results, the smart contract is configured to issue rewards for workers in the pool based on performance criteria. A base reward can be issued simply for workers being available in the pool, and additional rewards can be issued based on metrics such as consistency (i.e. availability for all voting rounds), accuracy (i.e. being part of the winning consensus), and speed (i.e. being fastest to submit voting results following the event trigger). Workers presenting faulty results are penalized, so the only profitable strategy for a worker is to provide honest, accurate results. This mechanism ensures that the outcome of the process, the consensus reached, can be trusted by everyone, even without knowing all the input&nbsp;data.</p><p>This entire process is now abstracted away via Smartflow which enables enterprises to configure their own Worker Node networks in a no-code environment. Please see <a href="http://www.smartflow.org">smartflow.org</a> for additional information.</p><p>The infographics below summarize the value proposition of Smartflow. The first graphic shows how solutions are typically configured by enterprises without Smartflow before showing what the new process can be leveraging worker nodes and Smartflow.</p><p>Without Smartflow:</p><p>With Smartflow:</p><p>Industry testimonials:</p><p>“As long-time Energy Web supporters, we are excited by the decentralized approach to multi-party computation provided by SmartFlow. It is a digital tool that provides a new kind of trust layer in business relations based on shared information. We are eager to discover how it can be integrated into our processes, and what kind of value it can create,” said Etienne Gehain, New Digital Solutions Director at&nbsp;Engie.</p><p>“Energy Web’s collaboration with Deutsche Telekom shows that Web 3 technology can be an important tool in the fight against climate change,” says Dirk Röder, Head of Deutsche Telekom’s Blockchain Solutions Center. “Deutsche Telekom is not only securing the energy grid, but also accelerating progress towards climate targets while promoting renewable energies.”</p><p>On Smartflow’s embedded self-sovereign identity solution: “To ensure network security and stability, the integration of renewable energy sources into our energy systems will require household and industrial flexibility to be activated. SSI will be an important tool for creating a registry of decentralised and flexible assets that will allow us to monitor the state of the network and steer these decentralised assets.” Kris Laermans, Innovation at Elia&nbsp;Group</p><p>Jasper Verwaal, Digital Assets Manager at Deloitte recently provided the following insights on Energy Web X’s architecture, solutions, and worker nodes: “The architecture Energy Web has already built around asset management, exchanging data, and green proofs…can be seen as public infrastructure. The more standardization that’s in place, the easier it is to adopt common methodologies.” He continued, “Many enterprises find it challenging to put data on-chain. But we hope that Energy Web X will contribute to making it easier to decide what data lives on-chain and what data off-chain.”</p><p>Sahas Katta, CEO at Smartcar, the leading connected car API platform and Autogreencharge partner, said “This partnership will empower EV drivers with the knowledge and confidence to maximize the sustainability of their EV charging experience. With Smartcar, Energy Web can seamlessly integrate across diverse vehicle brands, giving more EV drivers access to accurate insights into charging transparency and renewable energy options,” in reference to the new Autogreencharge solution powered by Smartflow, worker nodes, and Energy Web&nbsp;X.</p><p>Bryan Fisher, Managing Director at the clean energy nonprofit <a href="http://www.rmi.org/">RMI</a> commenting on the SAFc registry deployed on Energy Web X supported by worker nodes, “The SAFc Registry is the culmination of RMI’s ongoing work to catalyze the sustainable aviation fuel market. By creating a throughline from corporate consumers to fuel producers, we can expand investment in SAF infrastructure and increase supply of low-carbon fuels. Voluntary uptake is critical to scaling a burgeoning market, and we hope this registry can serve as an example for other sectors in the&nbsp;future.”</p><p>Frederik Jacobsen, project manager at the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping commenting on the Maritime registry on Energy Web X supported by Smartflow worker nodes: “The collaboration with ZEMBA further strengthens the development of a global Maritime Book and Claim System and underlines how important such a system will be to overcome obstacles to accelerate the adoption of low-emissions fuels at&nbsp;scale.”</p><p>“We’re very interested in driving trust and transparency across the supply chain, which is why we’re so excited to join the Energy Web ecosystem,” said Thatcher Young, CEO of CarbonEnfo. “In addition to supporting the public blockchain, we see tremendous value in leveraging the Energy Web technology stack to advance our own application development.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/case-study-smartflow-3215f32ed2f5">Case Study: Smartflow</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Elastos is teaming up with Conflux, known as the “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/24/chinese-ethereum-conflux-draws-spotlight-as-hong-kong-welcomes-retail-traders/">Chinese Ethereum</a>,” to simplify blockchain interactions globally. This partnership aims to make Bitcoin transactions and exchanges smoother using Conflux’s strong <a href="https://confluxnetwork.org/">infrastructure</a> and Elastos’ advanced <a href="http://Bel2.org">BeL2 technology</a>.</p>
<p>Conflux is special because it’s the only regulatory-compliant, public, and permissionless blockchain in China. This opens up big opportunities, especially in Asia. Conflux processes transactions quickly and securely, supports asset transfers between different blockchains, and can handle a lot of transactions at once without any slowdowns. It also has a built-in system for staking, which rewards users, and a unique fee structure that makes it easy for new users to join. The whole system runs on the CFX token, which is central to its economy.</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Asian Markets and the launch of Hong Kong’s First HKD-Backed Stablecoin 
<p>Conflux is perfectly positioned to open up blockchain adoption in Asia. By complying with Chinese regulations, it can facilitate blockchain growth in this highly potential region. Conflux has partnered with fintech company AnchorX to launch Hong Kong’s <a href="https://coingape.com/conflux-network-announces-first-hong-kong-dollar-backed-stablecoin/">first Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin</a>, called axHKD. This stablecoin integrates traditional finance with blockchain, making cross-border transactions and virtual asset trading easier and more efficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Power of BeL2 
<p>BeL2 technology enables Bitcoin to interact with smart contracts on other blockchains, expanding its use. It allows developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) using Bitcoin’s security and liquidity. BeL2 focuses on making cross-chain interactions and smart contract integrations smoother, enhancing Bitcoin’s capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 New Financial Opportunities 
<p>With the launch of the axHKD stablecoin, new financial opportunities arise. Bitcoin holders will be able to use BeL2 to take out loans in stablecoins, using their BTC as collateral, but without bridging it like traditional wrapped alternatives. This introduces Bitcoin maximalists to traditional finance without selling assets, while allowing lenders to work with Bitcoin holders to offer secure finance services and earn interest.

<p><a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOGN203Z00Q4A420C2000000/">Read on Nikkei’s website</a></p>

<p>【ニューヨーク=川上梓】ホンダや日産自動車、米フォード・モーターなど日米企業120社で構成する企業連合が、電気自動車（EV）電池に関するデータの活用で欧州発の企業連合と連携する。電池の材料やリサイクルにつながる情報を相互に安全に共有・運用できるインフラを企業主体でつくり、EVの普及につなげる。</p>
<p>ホンダや日産、米自動車大手「ビッグ3」、IT（情報技術）企業など120社でEV電池の情報をデジタル上で管理する国際規格づくりを進めている「モビリティ・オープン・ブロックチェーン・イニシアチブ（MOBI）」が、欧州発の企業連合「GAIA-X（ガイアエックス）」と組む。</p>
<p>ガイアエックスは欧州で企業間のデータ連携を推進している。日米中心の企業連合のMOBIと、欧州のガイアエックスが組むことで、日本、米国、欧州の3地域の企業間で、電池の材料や劣化状態、充放電などの情報を相互に共有し、運用できるようにする。</p>
<p>具体的には、暗号技術を使って機密性を保ったうえで企業がデータを記録・管理できる「ブロックチェーン（分散型台帳）」の技術を使う。今後、両者で実証を始める。</p>
<p>相互運用が進めば、企業は利用できるデータの数や範囲が増え、サービスの低コスト化につながる。電池の劣化状態が見える化されれば、将来的に電池の残存価値をEVの中古車価格に反映できるようになる。利用者にとっては1つのアプリケーションから利用できるEVや充電インフラの種類が広がり、EVを利用しやすくなる。</p>
<p>電池の情報を巡っては、日本の経済産業省傘下の団体と欧州の官民データ基盤「カテナX」が連携を決めた。ガイアエックスはカテナXの上部組織にあたり、製品に使う素材や二酸化炭素排出量などのデータを企業間でやりとりする仕組みをつくっている。</p>
<p>電池の情報を管理・共有する仕組みは欧州で先行してきたが、米国企業も導入を検討している。22年に成立したインフレ抑制法でEV補助金を受けるため北米域内で電池材料や部材を調達することが条件になったためだ。</p>
<p>特に電池の材料であるレアメタル（希少金属）は中国への依存度が大きい。米国企業としては、日欧企業と連携することで電池の材料調達に関する情報を透明化したい狙いもある。</p>

<p>Authors: Zaïda Rivai (Danube Tech), Kim Duffy (DIF)</p><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs), offer an often overlooked benefit: they function as an identifier metasystem, enabling future-proofing and interoperability across diverse identity systems. This concept was the central focus of Sam Curren's session at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW), titled "DID or not? The Value of an Identifier Metasystem; Is eIDAS wrong?"</p> What is an Identifier Metasystem? <p>An identifier metasystem intermediates different digital identity systems and mechanisms, promoting interoperability and preventing conflicts. It provides a layer of abstraction above individual identifier systems, enabling them to work together seamlessly.</p><p>Starting with identifiers and identifier systems, examples you may be familiar with include:</p>  National identification systems (e.g., Social Security Numbers, National ID cards)  Domain Name System (DNS) for internet addresses  International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) for books  Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) for software systems  <p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are also identifiers that can further act as an identifier metasystem. The DID spec defines a common structure and syntax for identifiers, along with methods for resolving them to retrieve associated metadata (such as public keys and service endpoints). This allows different DID methods, each with their own specific implementation details, to be used interchangeably within a single system.</p> The Difference Between General Identifiers and DIDs <p>In general, identifiers – often stored in organization or application databases – lack context, making it difficult to determine their scope and uniqueness. In contrast, DIDs are globally unique identifiers that provide clear context. This difference is akin to the distinction between a web page describing content at another page and a hyperlink – with the latter, you are guaranteed to reach the source and obtain the latest information.</p><p>At an IT systems level, the lack of context and uniqueness in general identifiers can cause headaches for companies when merging or migrating systems, as conflicts may arise.</p> Key Benefits of the Identifier Metasystem <p>The identifier metasystem provided by DIDs offers several key benefits:</p>  Interoperability: Different systems using different DID methods can still interact and exchange data without conflicts or the need for extensive customization.  Flexibility: Organizations can choose the DID method that best suits their needs and constraints, while still maintaining compatibility with other systems.&nbsp;  Future-proofing: As new DID methods are developed, they can be easily integrated into existing systems without requiring major changes to the underlying infrastructure.  Normalized and Auditable Data Storage: DIDs enable organizations and applications to store identifiers in a normalized and auditable manner, facilitating easier rotation and updates to identity systems without substantial overhauls.  Enhanced Privacy: DIDs offer a way to bind credentials privately and securely, proving that certain credentials were indeed issued to a specific user without compromising privacy.   Addressing Common Misconceptions <p>Some common hurdles to adopting DIDs result from the following misconceptions:</p>  Belief that you have to support all DID methods: There are numerous DID methods, but implementers can choose which method(s) to support based on their requirements and restrictions.  Uncertainty around which DID method(s) to use and support: Implementers often hesitate because they're unsure which DID method to choose. The straightforward advice is to pick one that's appropriate to your use case, which aids in future-proofing and simplifies integration across diverse systems.  Belief that there are simpler ways to achieve the same results: The benefits of DIDs as an identifier metasystem can be overlooked due to the technical details of DIDs themselves. However, focusing on the benefits of the identifier metasystem provides clearer business value and future-proofing.  <p>Another potential concern around use of DIDs is the lack of an advanced standard (“W3C Recommendation” status or similar) for DID resolution and dereferencing. This is addressed as part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/04/did-wg-charter.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DID WG Charter update, effective 25 April 2024</a>, in which the DID Working Group will take over the DID resolution work currently underway at the W3C Credentials Community Group.</p> DIDs as Future-proofed Variants of Existing Tokens or Identifiers <p>Even if a system is currently required to use JSON Web Keys (JWKs), adopting the `did:jwk` method could serve as a bridge, allowing easier rotation and updates to identity systems without substantial overhauls. This approach enables organizations to store identifiers in a normalized and auditable manner while ensuring compatibility and avoiding potential conflicts in the future.</p> The European Union (EU) Perspective <p>Privacy Concerns</p><p>Some pushback towards DIDs has resulted from the perception that they can contribute to privacy violations and tracking. In some frameworks, this has led to the rejection of DIDs.&nbsp; However, employing DIDs is not inherently riskier than corresponding mechanisms; for example did:jwk offers the same privacy characteristics as JWK. And in the general case, DIDs have the potential to offer significantly improved privacy protection (see point 5 under Key Benefits of the Identifier Metasystem, above). </p><p>Regulatory Challenges and Recommendations</p><p>Regulatory recommendations around traditional identifiers like X.509 certificates are well-established, and moving away from them may not be an option. However, even in this environment, `did:x509` could be used to adhere to the existing requirements while future-proofing through the identifier metasystem and improving the ability to migrate in the future.</p> Implementing DIDs: Decisions Across an Organization <p>The benefits of DIDs as an identifier metasystem sometimes get lost due to the technical details of DIDs themselves. However, focusing on the benefits of the identifier metasystem provides clearer business value and future-proofing.</p>  System architects should view the adoption of DIDs as a strategic decision that aligns with long-term business goals, focusing on the overarching benefits of DIDs.  Product managers need to determine requirements, restrictions, and other characteristics relevant for the use case's regulatory requirements (e.g., inability to use blockchain) or user requirements.  Architects and developers should select the appropriate DID method(s) based on the above requirements, as well as any other operational considerations (tool support).  <p>The choice of DID method is also influenced by the role of participants. For institutions, the `did:x509` or `did:web` method can be preferred, while for individuals, the `did:jwk` method may be more appropriate, allowing for a cycle through various credentials while maintaining privacy and future-proofing.</p><p>Implementers should focus on building technical systems that support DIDs regardless of the environment, ensuring that the broad range of considerations is addressed, such as open standards/source, possible cost to users, whether other elements support DIDs, and whether DIDs are simply stored or if the ecosystem has first-class support for them.</p> Potential Risks and Concerns <p>While DIDs offer significant benefits as an identifier metasystem, there are potential risks and concerns to consider:</p>  Incentive for Migration: While DIDs make sense as a consideration when designing new systems, there may not be enough incentive for organizations to rewrite or migrate existing systems to adopt DIDs, given the potential costs and effort involved.  Control and Governance of DID Methods: There are questions around who gets to determine the "method" part of a DID (e.g., `did:method`), how to ensure there are no collisions or name squatting, and who gets to control and govern the various DID methods.  <p>Organizations should carefully evaluate these risks and concerns alongside the potential benefits of DIDs as an identifier metasystem when making decisions about adoption and implementation.</p><p>While the concerns around migration incentives and control of DID methods are valid, they should not overshadow the significant advantages DIDs offer in terms of interoperability, flexibility, future-proofing, and enhanced privacy.</p><p>To mitigate these risks, organizations can:</p>  Conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis to determine the long-term value of adopting DIDs, considering factors such as reduced integration complexity, improved data normalization, and enhanced privacy capabilities.  Engage with the DID community and participate in the governance processes of relevant DID methods to ensure that their concerns and requirements are addressed.  Develop a phased adoption plan that prioritizes the implementation of DIDs in new systems and gradually migrates existing systems over time, minimizing disruption and spreading out the costs.  Collaborate with industry partners, standards bodies, and regulatory authorities to establish best practices and guidelines for DID adoption and governance, promoting a more stable and predictable ecosystem.  <p>By proactively addressing these risks and concerns, organizations can confidently adopt DIDs as an identifier metasystem, leveraging its benefits to build more resilient, interoperable, and future-proof identity solutions that enhance privacy, simplify integration, and provide a solid foundation for the evolving digital identity landscape.</p> Conclusion <p>As the digital identity landscape continues to evolve, DIDs are well-positioned to play a crucial role in shaping a more connected, secure, and user-centric future. Organizations that recognize the value of an identifier metasystem and embrace DIDs will be at the forefront of building a more resilient and innovative digital identity ecosystem.</p> Thank you <p>We would like to thank Sam Curren for leading this session and all IIW attendees who contributed. Thank you to Damian Glover, Andor Kesselman, and Markus Sabadello for their valuable input to this article.</p>

 Confirming Chicago Title Insurance Company’s VerifID™ service PCTF Verified Person Component conformance 



<p>May 14, 2024 – Toronto –&nbsp; We proudly announce that Chicago Title Insurance Company’s ID verification platform, VerifID™, obtained the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/pctf-verified-person/">Verified Person</a> certification, a massive milestone in becoming a trusted and reliable service in the Canadian ecosystem. DIACC welcomes Chicago Title’s VerifID to the <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/trusted-list/">growing cohort of certified providers</a> in digital identity, particularly in the critical area of real estate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Canada, mortgage and title fraud is a pressing concern, presenting an opportunity for fraudsters. In response, Chicago Title has developed VerifID, an innovative identity verification and fraud solution. VerifID combats fraudulent real estate transactions, demonstrating its proactive approach to addressing industry challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re passionate about stopping fraud; it’s why we developed VerifID,” said John Rider, Senior Vice President of Retail and Commercial Title at Chicago Title Insurance Company. “We wanted to take that passion to the next level by completing our PCTF certification, demonstrating our commitment to being&nbsp;the best in the business. VerifID doesn’t allow users to modify the verification process, which, in our experience, reduces the intake of valuable information; ours is the only solution that will meet DIACC standards 100% of the time.”</p>



<p>VerifID’s journey to DIACC PCTF certification was rigorous, marked by a thorough third-party evaluation that left no room for shortcuts. This evaluation ensured that the service met the stringent requirements of the Verified Person Component at LOA2, which shows Chicago Title’s commitment to leading the fraud and identity industry through continuous innovation and best practices.</p>



<p>The DIACC certification is a standardized process that includes a point-in-time audit conducted by DIACC Accredited Auditor KUMA and an independent committee review for quality assurance. As a result, DIACC has issued a three-year cycle Trustmark, subject to annual surveillance audits, and added Chicago Title’s VerifID to its <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/trusted-list/">Trusted List</a> of certified providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Chicago Title’s VerifID achieved a significant industry milestone and competitive advantage by becoming the first Canadian vendor to earn certification against the PCTF identity proofing requirements,” said Joni Brennan, DIACC President.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PCTF is a comprehensive risk management and assurance framework for validating the design of private-sector digital trust services. Its criteria address aspects of digital trust and verification, including privacy, security, and interoperability, mitigating risks associated with fraud and breaches. This framework supports robust digital verification and enhances user confidence by providing a reliable means to authenticate digital verification across services, fostering a safer and more integrated digital environment. The PCTF helps people and organizations across the public and private sectors to recognize verified trusted services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To explore the benefits of certification, contact <a href="mailto:voila@diacc.ca">voila@diacc.ca</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>About DIACC</p>



<p>Established in 2012, DIACC is a non-profit organization of public and private sector members committed to advancing full and beneficial participation in the global digital economy by promoting design principles, PCTF adoption and conformity assessment. DIACC prioritizes personal data control, privacy, security, accountability, and inclusive people-centered design.</p>

		<p>Dear Edge Community,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well as we continue to adapt to the industry changes brought about by VMware’s acquisition by Broadcom. In our ongoing commitment to transparency and support, I want to share some important updates and reaffirm our dedication to assisting you through these transitions.</p>
<p>Pricing Changes Post-Acquisition:<br>
It has become apparent in our recent assessments and communications with Broadcom that the pricing structure for VMware’s services may undergo changes. At this time, it does not appear that Broadcom intends to maintain or reduce the prices from their current or previous year’s levels, even when considering potential discounts. This development is significant, and we want to ensure it factors into your planning and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>Alternative Solutions and Expert Support:<br>
In light of these potential changes, we believe it is prudent to consider alternative solutions that may better meet your financial and operational needs. We have secured a robust selection of substitute products and services under Edge procurement vehicles. Most of the market available substitutes are available through the EdgeMarket portal, and I am pleased to introduce several key points of contact who can assist you with these options:</p>

 ChatDKG.ai: Driving synergies across the AI solution landscape to tackle hallucinations, bias, and model&nbsp;collapse <p>Abusing social networks for political manipulations may look minuscule compared to a lack of trust in solutions to which we are “outsourcing” our cognition — AI systems. As we would trust them to process large amounts of knowledge and provide us inputs for our actions, or even perform certain actions autonomously, they have the highest possible requirements for transparency and verifiability.</p><p>There should be no compromise in designing AI solutions when it comes to data ownership, information provenance, verifiability of information, or bias that would include any censorship-by-design approach. The risk of this revolution not unfolding in an inclusive way is a societal threat of establishing a monopoly on&nbsp;AI.</p><p>We therefore introduced an effective way of establishing a new paradigm, using a Decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG) framework. dRAG advances the RAG model by organizing external sources in a Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) while introducing incentives to grow a global, crowdsourced network of knowledge made available for AI models to use. See an example of a ChatGPT4 without and with dRAG&nbsp;use:</p><p>The dRAG framework enables a hybrid, decentralized AI system that brings together neural (e.g. LLMs) and symbolic AI (e.g. Knowledge Graph) methodologies. Contrary to using a solely probabilistic neural AI approach, the symbolic AI approach enhances it with the strength of Knowledge Graphs, introducing a more deterministic component.</p>Figure 1: The interplay between neural (LLMs) and symbolic (KGs) AI methodologies. Source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08302.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08302.pdf</a> [4]<p>To harness a harmonious development between Web3 fundamentals and rapidly deployed AI systems, our approach is to integrate the core Web3 technologies such as the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and AI systems (OpenAI, Gemini, Microsoft Co-pilot, xAI’s Grok, and&nbsp;others).</p><p>We believe that we can realize the potential of trusted AI by creating a Verifiable Internet for AI that is founded on principles of neutrality, inclusiveness, and usability, while giving users freedom of choice with a multi-modal and a multi-model AI framework.</p> ChatDKG.ai: neuro-symbolic AI driving synergies across the solution landscape <p>Below, you can find a comparison table of AI types and frameworks with very diverse advantages and disadvantages. The globally most adopted and centralized AI solutions like Google Gemini, OpenAI, xAI, Perplexity deliver an immense value for a spectrum of use cases. Leveraging OriginTrail’s dRAG — brand name ChatDKG.ai, they can improve their shortfalls by harnessing the synergy of neuro-symbolic AI, data ownership, and better cost performance. Therefore, ChatDKG.ai is not competing against any established AI solutions, but rather empowers users to enhance them with its dRAG, driving knowledge verifiability, cost effectiveness, users’ sovereignty in owning their data and freedom of AI model&nbsp;choice.</p><p>The open source and permissionless nature of the OriginTrail DKG, allows for inclusiveness and neutrality, giving users a tremendous level of freedom on all layers — to choose AI models enabled by the DKG data portability, choose knowledge sources discoverable in the DKG, as well as pick AI services, centralized or decentralized on different blockchains.</p><p>The same principles apply to AI agents, search engines, and a growing variety of AI services integrating into every tool in existence — leveraging dRAG they will enable user freedom of choice, AI autonomy and trust, all while leveraging network effects through connectivity.</p><p>As AI becomes the new UI, make sure you are on the right side of history. Let’s build towards a Truly Open AI, together!</p><p>Apply for the <a href="https://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG.ai</a> inception program&nbsp;today!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/chatdkg-ai-driving-synergies-across-the-ai-solution-landscape-to-tackle-hallucinations-bias-and-95afe67aece3">ChatDKG.ai: Driving synergies across the AI solution landscape to tackle hallucinations, bias, and…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>First public review for v1.4 - ends June 12th</p> 


<p>We are pleased to announce that Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) Version 1.4 from the OASIS OpenDocument TC [1] is now available for public review and comment. This is the first public review for OpenDocument v1.4.</p>



<p>The OpenDocument Format (ODF) is an open XML-based document file format for office applications to be used for documents containing text, spreadsheets, charts, and graphical elements. The file format makes transformations to other formats simple by leveraging and reusing existing standards wherever possible. As an open standard under the stewardship of OASIS, OpenDocument also creates the possibility for new types of applications and solutions to be developed other than traditional office productivity applications.</p>



<p>OpenDocument Format v1.4 joins ODF v1.3 (approved as OASIS Standard in 2021) in providing updates to the international standard ODF v1.2, approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO/IEC 26300 (2015). OpenDocument Format v1.4 makes several timely improvements.</p>

<p>With the support of our members, OASIS Open’s initiatives have the potential to help address some of the challenges faced in global trade and logistics, enabling greater interoperability, transparency and efficiency in the supply chain. On a parallel path to de-risking our supply chains, open standards can help to address some of these challenges.</p>



<p>Open standards can facilitate data sharing between different systems and stakeholders, helping to improve supply chain visibility and reduce data silos. This can help to improve efficiency and reduce delays in the supply chain.</p>



<p>Electronic data interchange (EDI) is a standardized electronic format for exchanging business documents. Open standards for EDI can help to improve the accuracy and timeliness of data exchange, reducing errors and delays in the supply chain.</p>



<p>Open standards for blockchain can enable secure and transparent sharing of data between different stakeholders in the supply chain. This can help to improve trust and reduce fraud in international trade.</p>



<p>Open standards for IoT can help to improve supply chain visibility by enabling real-time tracking of goods and assets. This can help to improve efficiency and reduce delays in the supply chain.</p>



<p>Open standards for electronic customs clearance can help to streamline the customs process and reduce delays in the supply chain. This can help to improve efficiency and reduce costs for businesses involved in global trade.</p>



<p>OASIS members are currently forming the Open Supply Chain Information Modeling (OSIM) Technical Committee, which aims to standardize and promote information models for supply chains. Read the latest blog on OSIM <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2024/05/02/introducing-oasis-open-supply-chain-information-modeling/">here</a> and consider <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/join-a-tc/">joining the TC</a> before its first meeting on 4 June.</p>

<p>By Markus Sabadello</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to write a few words about the&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>, which is a group where I have been contributing as co-chair for many years.</p> The fundamental role of the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>DIF was established in 2017, and has grown a lot in terms of members, working groups, and work items. The I&amp;D Working Group is one of the working groups that has existed since the beginning DIF, unlike many others which were added later. The reason for that, I would argue, is the fact that the concepts of “identifiers” and “discovery” are fundamental to pretty much any digital identity system.</p><p>In digital identity, we always need identifiers — digital addresses that we can use to refer to individuals, organizations, and things. Without identifiers for participants of a network, and without the ability to discover metadata about such identifiers, we cannot express connections or relationships, we cannot share data or exchange messages, and without that, we cannot establish higher level concepts such as reputation and trust. Another factor for establishing this working group was the (back then) new technology that became Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and would later be standardized at the W3C. So in the early days of DIF, it was logical to dedicate one of the initial working groups to the topic of identifiers.</p> The scope of the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>The scope of this working group is defined in its&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_ID_WG_charter_v1.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Charter</a>. It includes pretty much any topic related to the specification and implementation of decentralized identifiers (including, but not limited to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">W3C DIDs</a>). For example, topics include the creation and resolution of DIDs, discovery data formats and protocols, relationships between different identifer systems (e.g. DIDs and domain names), the establishment of control authority over an identifier, security and trust in identifier infrastructure, and the work on concrete&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#methods">DID methods</a>.</p><p>Explicitly out-of-scope are complex higher-level topics and protocols that use identifiers but are not primarily about the identifier infrastructure themselves, for example authentication or credential exchange protocols. For those topics, there are other exciting DIF&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#wgs">working groups</a>!</p> Noteworthy work items of the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>The working group maintains a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#work-items">list of work items</a>&nbsp;it has worked on in the past or is currently working on. In general, work items may be specifications or code or anything else that falls withing the working group’s scope. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of our work items:</p>  The&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Universal Resolver</a>&nbsp;is one of the best-known work items that has existed since the beginnings of DIF. It provides resolution capabilities for many DID methods developed by the decentralized identity community.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">.well-known DID Configuration</a>&nbsp;specification provides a way of linking a DID to a web origin.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/did-registration/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DID Registration</a>&nbsp;specification defines functions for creating, updating, and deactivating DIDs in an interoperable way.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/linked-vp/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Linked Verifiable Presentation</a>&nbsp;specification defines how to discover Verifiable Presentations using simple DID Resolution, without requiring more complex protocols such OpenID or DIDComm.  Work items also include various open-source tools and libraries, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did-resolver</a>&nbsp;(JavaScript),&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-jwt?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did-jwt</a>&nbsp;(JavaScript),&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-common-java?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did-common-java</a>&nbsp;(Java),&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-key.rs?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did-key.rs</a>&nbsp;(Rust).  Concrete DID methods&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/index.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did:peer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did:ion</a>&nbsp;have also been developed in this working group.   Interesting topics in the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>Besides “formal” work items such as the ones listed above, our working group also frequently discusses various topics related to decentralized identifiers, or receives guest presentations. In the past, such topics have for example included:</p>  Presentations about new DID methods, e.g. did:dht, did:oyd, did:self, did:webs, did:key, did:bid, did:plc, did:algo, did:polygonid, did:cheqd, and others.  Management of DIDs over time, rotating keys, referencing historical versions of DIDs.  Trust in DIDs and the DID Resolution process, DID document validation, and the relationship between DIDs and existing trusted infrastructures such as domain names or X.509 certificates.  Proposals for new functionalities related to DIDs, such as Linked Resources, service profiles, DID method enumeration, and much more.  <p>We have recently also seen demonstrations of browser plugins, and even a ChatGPT plugin that can resolve DIDs! And we are always happy to receive suggestions for new topics.</p> How to participate in the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>Easy!&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/join/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Join DIF</a>&nbsp;and participate in our working group. We have a Slack channel and bi-weekly meetings where we can discuss any topic related to decentralized identifiers and discovery!</p><p>Our working group page is&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/tree/main?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a>, and our agenda including recordings and notes is&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/blob/main/agenda.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a>.</p><p>We welcome you!</p><p>The activities of the author in the DIF I&amp;D WG are carried out with the support of&nbsp;<a href="https://blockstand.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">BlockStand</a>&nbsp;funds.

 BeL2 Loan App Explained 
<p>The BeL2 Loan App is designed with a specific purpose in mind: to empower Bitcoin maximalists and cryptocurrency users to leverage their BTC holdings as collateral for loans while maintaining full custody of their assets. This addresses the inherent risks of centralisation and security vulnerabilities associated with converting BTC to wrapped versions like WBTC.</p>
 
 BTC Locking: Users lock their Bitcoin through a bespoke transaction script, ensuring that the BTC remains accessible only under predefined conditions within an associated smart contract on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
 Smart Contract Execution: Governed by a smart contract on the EVM, the loan’s terms are laid out, including interest rates and the conditions for collateral access or liquidation. 
 Arbiter or Relayer Function: Acting as a bridge, Arbiters facilitate the communication between the Bitcoin and EVM chains, verifying transaction proofs to ensure all conditions are met for collateral release. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s go through the users journey!</p>
 
 Bob, the Lender: Bob deposits USDT into a BeL2 smart contract on a Bitcoin layer 2 platform, designed to facilitate BTC-backed loans with interest, leveraging the advanced capabilities of both Bitcoin and Ethereum’s EVM chains. 
 Alice, the Borrower: Alice, operating on Bitcoin layer 1, discovers this lending opportunity via BeL2 and locks her 0.2 BTC into a BTC locking script. This script utilises BeL2’s cutting-edge security features, including generating a zero-knowledge proof, to ensure the integrity of the transaction without exposing unnecessary data. 
 The Arbiter: An Arbiter within the BeL2 system, equipped with sophisticated cryptographic tools, reviews and validates Alice’s transaction proof into the Layer 2 smart contract. Upon successful validation, the USDT loan is released to Alice. 
 Transaction Completion: Alice utilises the USDT for various services and repays the loan plus interest through the layer 2 platform. Once the loan is fully repaid, Alice can unlock her BTC from the locking script on layer 1, thereby completing the transaction cycle. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, BeL2 leverages the Elastos SmartWeb to offer significant benefits to Bitcoin users. BeL2 enables direct BTC collateralization without conversion, reducing counterparty risks and preserving the asset’s integrity. It provides fixed interest rates for predictability and protection against interest rate volatility. Additionally, the loan structure is designed to protect users from unexpected liquidations, a frequent issue in traditional decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 So why is BeL2 so unique? 
<p></p>
<p>BeL2 acts as a vital Layer 2+ platform, enabling Bitcoin transactions to trigger and interact with smart contracts on other chains. This interoperability bridges the gap between the robust security of Bitcoin and the dynamic, programmable world of smart contracts, without compromising Bitcoin’s foundational principles.</p>
<p>While traditional Layer 2 solutions like state channels, sidechains, plasma, and rollups focus on transaction efficiency or scalability, BeL2 distinguishes itself by enabling smart contract functionalities and cross-chain interactions for Bitcoin. This not only enhances the utility of Bitcoin but also opens up a myriad of possibilities for decentralised application development using Bitcoin’s liquidity and security as a cornerstone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Next up! 
<p>As BeL2 continues to develop and refine its functionalities, the focus will remain on enhancing the user experience and security of the BeL2 loan app, transforming it into a commercial product. Additionally, BeL2 will allow others to incorporate it’s Bitcoin Oracle into a broader array of blockchain-based applications. The upcoming months are crucial, as the platform will undergo rigorous testing and iterative improvements based on user feedback and technological advancements. Excited to learn more?

<p>Join the Decentralized Identity Foundation community call on 27 May at 09:00 PDT / 12:00 EDT /&nbsp; 18:00 CEST to learn how organizations can leverage&nbsp;the combined capabilities of OpenID4VC and DIDComm through an emerging specification under development at IDunion, opening the door to a myriad of new possibilities in identity-centric applications and services. Moderated by Sam Curren. Register <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZwvf--hrT0tE9D9j2U8BkxzVn8Ogs_iftas?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a></p><p>In the ever-evolving landscape of digital identity and communication protocols, OpenID4VC protocols working in parallel with DIDComm represents a significant opportunity for businesses to bolster security, enhance privacy, and streamline operations. By combining a familiar authentication and access pattern with VCs and augmenting it with secure generalized communication, developers can unlock new functionalities for digital identity while ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks such as the Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS) 2.0 regulation in the European Union.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://openid.net/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">OpenID</a>, renowned for its simplicity and widespread adoption, provides businesses with a standardized framework for user authentication across multiple applications and websites. The OpenID4VCI and OpenID4VP protocols (collectively referred to as OID4VC) follow the familiar pattern and apply it to the exchange of Verifiable Credentials. These verifiable credential protocols were selected by the eIDAS 2.0 effort in Europe as the protocols for VC exchange.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm</a>, built on the principles of self-sovereign identity (SSI), picks up those trusted connections and offers a decentralized and privacy-enhancing protocol for secure communication. DIDComm makes communication between entities using DIDs safe and simple, and easy to use, providing a way to create secure and streamlined communication solutions. DIDComm can accommodate protocols for nearly any purpose, while retaining its properties of privacy and security. Learn more about DIDComm <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/ss/">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://idunion.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">IDunion</a>'s goal is to create an open, global ecosystem for decentralized identity, aligned with European values and regulations. IDunion is leading this important effort to define protocol extensions to allow OpenID and DIDComm interoperability.</p><p>Running side by side, OpenID4VC and DIDComm hold the promise of revolutionizing digital identity management and communication. By incorporating a familiar pattern for the exchange of verifiable credentials alongside a secure communication channel with capabilities that extend beyond verifiable credentials, businesses can benefit from enhanced security and trustworthiness of digital identities while maximizing their benefits.</p><p>This pairing of open protocols also enables businesses to address regulatory requirements more effectively, particularly in the European Union where the eIDAS 2.0 regulation sets the standards for electronic identification and trust services. Businesses operating within the European Union can leverage OpenID4VC protocols for credential issuance and presentation to satisfy the requirements of eIDAS 2.0, while utilizing DIDComm to securely communicate and coordinate with parties for features beyond the scope of the OID4VC protocols. By adopting a decentralized approach to identity and communication, businesses can ensure compliance with eIDAS 2.0 while safeguarding sensitive information and building trust with their customers and stakeholders and growing their services and business opportunities.</p><p>The integration of OpenID VC Protocols and DIDComm opens the door to a myriad of new possibilities in identity-centric applications and services. By leveraging the combined capabilities of these protocols, businesses can easily realize the benefits of verifiable credentials built on direct communication between trusted connections.</p><p></p>

<p>The convergence of Internet, Crypto, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) appears as the antidote to many of the current shortcomings of AI — hallucinations, bias, data ownership challenges, even model collapse. It also holds the key to unlocking AI’s full societal potential by enabling a truly open AI. In a world of AI solutions relying on performance battles of pre-trained AI models, <a href="https://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG</a> stands for freedom of choice. A truly open AI approach allows anyone to define the trusted knowledge as the foundation for their AI solutions. It further extends the freedom of choice from trusted knowledge to multimodal support of a plethora of different AI models. For creators ready to take the plunge into the truly open AI future, an inception program is available to onboard them to&nbsp;ChatDKG.</p> A new paradigm for AI — Your knowledge network is your net&nbsp;worth <p>The currently prevalent approach in creating AI solutions is a siloed one — either in the shackles of a single AI model or a walled garden of external sources provided by a single organization. ChatDKG is breaking down those walls with an inclusive and open approach to creating AI solutions. Leveraging the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), it creates a neutral, inclusive knowledge foundation. As anyone publishes their knowledge to the DKG, their addition gets equipped with a timestamp, their identity, ascribed ownership, and verifiability proofs ensuring their knowledge is kept intact. Through a framework of decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG), such knowledge is made available to any AI model as input to produce outputs that both have information provenance and respect data ownership. As trusted knowledge inputs become mission-critical for AI solutions, it ignites a knowledge economy where your knowledge network is your net&nbsp;worth.</p> Getting involved with Initial Paranet&nbsp;Offering <p>In addition to building trusted AI solutions with ChatDKG, participants in this new knowledge economy can get involved in growing the DKG in knowledge domains important to them. New types of autonomous knowledge networks can appear in any domain, narrow or wide, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Decentralized Science — building a truth layer from existing scientific knowledge to power autonomous AI research and decentralized scientific advancement.  Real World Assets (RWA) — creating tokenized digital twins from any asset that exists outside the digital spectrum, such as real estate, commodities, art, and&nbsp;more.  Industry 4.0 — revolutionizing production processes to achieve the highest safety and efficiency, faster innovation, and tailored customers’ interactions with trusted AI solutions.  <p>Launching an Initial Paranet Offering (IPO) allows anyone to open up their mission to others who would like to join creating a knowledge foundation in that domain. Through an IPO, a paranet operator also ensures incentive rewards for participants that will add useful knowledge — knowledge miners. By accessing <a href="https://neuroweb.ai/">NeuroWeb</a> network incentives for mining new knowledge, the paranet’s trusted knowledge grows in a crowdsourced way.</p> Future-proofing for continuous advancements of&nbsp;AI <p>The ChatDKG’s truly open AI does not only lower dependency on any single AI company, the freedom of choice of AI also ensures that any development in the field of AI models, prompt engineering, agent frameworks, or similar, is making your solution stronger. By putting the trusted knowledge foundation in the driving seat, the tech giants working on advancing AI systems are working in your favor as you are always able to use your knowledge network with the latest AI technologies.</p> Inception program open for application <p>Those looking to build the next big thing with ChatDKG’s trusted AI solution or launch an Initial Paranet Offering can submit their application for the ChatDKG inception program to receive additional support from the OriginTrail team. Applications are open on the&nbsp;<a href="https://chatdkg.ai">website</a>.</p><p>Discover a Truly Open AI &amp; apply for the ChatDKG inception program at: <a href="https://chatdkg.ai.">https://chatdkg.ai.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/powered-by-origintrail-chatdkg-ai-is-unlocking-a-truly-open-artificial-intelligence-f078885acb1c">Powered by OriginTrail, ChatDKG.AI is unlocking a Truly Open Artificial Intelligence</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>by Andy Parsons</p><p>Social media plays a major role in how we see the world and each other. Today’s <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/partnering-with-our-industry-to-advance-ai-transparency-and-literacy">announcement that TikTok</a> is joining our efforts to advance trust and transparency online with <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/">Content Credentials</a> moves the authenticity ecosystem toward the ubiquity of trustworthy context embedded in content. Wider access to verifiable information about the content we create and see online is one step closer today.</p><p>As the newest member of both the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) and the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), TikTok will begin labeling AI-generated content with Content Credentials, with more integration to follow. This makes TikTok the first major social media platform to support the open C2PA standard.</p><p>TikTok has over 1 billion users — a number that includes 170 million just in the US — who use the app to learn, build businesses, and consume news. Reliable, trustworthy content has never been more critical in our connected world, and especially in this unprecedented year of global elections. Identifying and clearly labeling generative AI content is a key component in fulfilling a fundamental right we all have to understand how the content we consume was made.</p><p>With this watershed integration and the broad availability of the CAI’s free <a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/">open-source tools</a>, Content Credentials are now seeing accelerated adoption across industries — including camera makers, news publishers, brand marketers, and creative professionals. What’s been just out of reach on the adoption curve is ready access for everyday consumers, until now.</p>

  <p>Of course, achieving broad availability of Content Credentials is an iterative process that will take time. But as the CAI community grows in size, reach, and diversity, we look forward to engaging with our members to build ever more momentum for these digital “nutrition labels.” We welcome the TikTok team and we’re excited about their ongoing contributions.</p><p>It’s worth remembering that the addition of Content Credentials can happen at any point of the content lifecycle — from creating, editing, or generating content with AI to the various ways we share online. TikTok, and the world of social media more generally, provides ample opportunity for creators and consumers alike to benefit from verifiable media. We’re proud to celebrate this milestone on the path toward Content Credentials ubiquity, and proud to support this ecosystem of implementers who are united in the movement to bring Content Credentials to everyone.</p>

 Exploring the Evolution of Trust in Networks Over the Next&nbsp;Decade <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/towards-a-manifesto-for-open-recognition-07b2606efd81">Previously</a>, we discussed working towards a manifesto for <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>, an initiative which involves envisioning what we might call ‘plausible utopias’. This is work for and on behalf of the Open Recognition is for Everybody (ORE) Community, which is stewarded by <a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> and sponsored by <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>.</p>Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>In this post, we explore these plausible utopias over five-year and ten-year time horizons, bearing in mind the balance between institutional credentials and community-based recognition. It’s not a case of either/or but both-and. We need credentials from institutions to prove everything from our identity to our ability to perform at a high level. But we also need a way of giving and receiving recognition in ways that go beyond credentials. In short, we want to create a world that eliminates unfair hoops and hurdles that go along with systemic injustices and institutional bias. But read on for more specifics.</p> What is Open Recognition? <p>A quick reminder of what we mean by Open Recognition, from <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">this&nbsp;post</a>:</p><blockquote>Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.</blockquote> Open Recognition by 2029: A Five-Year Outlook Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>Considering the significant interest and investment in skills-based hiring, it is likely to fully develop within the next five years. The progress of this trend is likely to be unevenly distributed; the USA, where the bulk of the funding is available, will no doubt lead the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Skills-based hiring is an approach to recruitment that prioritises a candidate’s skills and competencies over traditional credentials. This includes the actual abilities required to perform a job well, and is a combination of technical skills, ‘durable’ (aka ‘soft’) skills, and the ability to problem-solve. The idea is that it widens the talent pool, reduces bias inherent in the hiring process, and aligns candidates more closely with the needs of the&nbsp;job.</p> Going Beyond&nbsp;Work <p>While it can be useful to put people into categories and to match them to jobs, there is more to life than work. So while skills-based hiring is an important step into a plausible utopia for Open Recognition, let’s paint a broader and more holistic&nbsp;picture.</p><p>The definition of Open Recognition used above includes “recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions.” We envisage a continuing focus on the right of self-determination of all people, including within online and offline networks. We also see a world in which peer recognition is valuable and honoured in hiring and acceptance processes. This means, where appropriate, badges for everything from knowledge within indigenous communities to recognition for the determined and resilient person who shows up for others, no matter&nbsp;what.</p><p>CVs and resumes will start to be replaced by digital portfolios which can be shown via mobile devices and shared with others via web links. Whereas CVs and resumes are claim-based, in that the person they represent claims to know or have done a thing, badges are evidence-based, as they provide evidence that the person can do something — or stands in a particular relationship to another individual or organisation. In addition, digital portfolios will begin to hold <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">Verifiable Credentials</a>, both those issued by governments or higher learning institutions, as well as VCs issued in communities and by&nbsp;peers.</p><p>Community learning is particularly well-placed to provide the recognition of talents which are so valuable in all aspects of society. People who participate in communities of practice develop all sorts of skills that often go unrecognised. For example, facilitation skills are useful not only in the world of work, but also in the contexts of family life, sports, and activism. Being able to quickly see what experience and abilities you have within a group of people can be particularly useful, especially in times of&nbsp;need.</p> Open Recognition in 2034: A Ten-Year&nbsp;Vision Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>The next decade could see significant shifts in how we approach education and professional development. There has long been talk about the ‘disruption’ of formal education systems which are (mistakenly) labelled as being fit only for the Industrial Revolution. While teachers do a great job in difficult circumstances, when looking a decade into the future, we can begin to imagine a world where educational journeys are bespoke, mapped out through different forms of recognition.</p><p>Some of this recognition may be through formal institutional credentials, gained as a result of summative assessment. In other words, you are still likely to get credentials for passing exams, but these will increasingly be&nbsp;digital.</p> Innovations in Recognition <p>But there are more ways to prove that you know or can do a thing than through high-stakes examinations. One of our favourite ways of using badges for Open Recognition includes pledging for a badge and then working towards it. Another is self-issuing badges for skills you have taught yourself, and then asking others to endorse those badges. Other approaches include mentorship, participation in community events, and interest-based badges — for example with creative pursuits.</p><p>We expect some strides to be made towards the automation of what is often called APL (Assessing Prior Learning) or RPL (Recognition of Prior Learning). While it will still be useful to keep a human in the loop, AI technology is advancing to help us use Rich Skills Descriptors (RSDs) to help with misunderstandings around semantics.</p><p>Take volunteering, something which is sadly on the decline in the western world. There are many different ways to donate your skills to groups or organisations that need help. With a little help from technology, it will be normal to be matched with opportunities based on the recognition you have received in the form of&nbsp;badges.</p><p>In ten years time, the digital portfolios of credentials, badges and other pieces of recognition will be commonplace. They will be built on top of open technology, like open source wallets, and using W3C standards. The best way to ensure that the ecosystem around Open Recognition flourishes in the future is to build it in the&nbsp;open.</p> Trusting Recognition Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>Both the short term and long term vision described here relies on the evolution of trust within our networks. Luckily, for over a decade, technologists have been working on standards and methods to help people verify their skills through both claims and evidence. Hundreds of millions of digital credentials based on standards-compliant technologies are issued every year. We are no longer working on <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/advocating-for-learner-centric-badge-systems-21a65be4a725">spreading awareness</a> of what digital credentialing is or could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Years ago, we needed to get people to accept the idea of digital credentials as a plausible alternative to physical credentials. What we need now is an ecosystem that places value not only on the reputation of the issuer, but the story the earner wants to tell about themselves. Because this ecosystem is built on open standards and increasingly on top of open technologies, we are building trust into digital credentialing writ&nbsp;large.</p> Conclusion <p>None of this vision is free, cheap or easy. In fact, it’s taken over a decade and millions invested into wide reaching projects and problem spaces. When you’re building an alternative to a system that was built before the invention of the World Wide Web, it can take some time to convince people that a different way is possible. Open Badges, Verifiable Credentials and the people who build and make the projects and ecosystem around these technologies need support to continue advancing a system that is designed to level the playing field for everyday learners and&nbsp;earners.</p><p>If you’re looking to enhance your professional development programme or educational initiative through Open Recognition, get in touch with <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> — we’re here to&nbsp;help!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Plausible Utopias: the future of Open Recognition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 “FIDO Drives Strong&nbsp;&nbsp;Authentication Results&nbsp;&nbsp;for the State of Michigan’s&nbsp;&nbsp;MiLogin” 



<p>The State of Michigan’s Department of Technology, Management &amp;&nbsp; Budget (DTMB) is a principal department of the state’s government&nbsp; responsible for providing a wide range of support functions to other state&nbsp; agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The department’s broad spectrum of responsibilities includes technology&nbsp; services, labor market information, facilities management, financial&nbsp; services, procurement, retirement services, real estate management, the&nbsp; Michigan public safety communication system, fleet and records&nbsp; management, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DTMB also plays a crucial role in cybersecurity for the state,&nbsp; providing resources and tools to protect against cyber threats and&nbsp; manage the State’s IT infrastructure. One of the DTMB’s efforts is the&nbsp; MiLogin digital identity solution, which enables over 10 million users to&nbsp; access state government services securely and conveniently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DTMB was looking to secure MiLogin, Michigan’s application that allows&nbsp; users to access multiple state applications and services with a single user&nbsp; ID, with strong authentication that improves user experience and decided&nbsp; to go with passkeys, based on FIDO authentication.&nbsp;</p>



 Passkeys are a password replacement that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices. Unlike passwords, passkeys are resistant to phishing, are always strong, and are designed so that there are no shared secrets. 



 Key Objectives&nbsp; 



<p>The State of Michigan aimed to address several key objectives with the integration of passkeys:</p>



<p>Enhance the digital user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal was to streamline the digital user experience, particularly in providing users with seamless access to critical state&nbsp; government services. DTMB aimed to simplify the login process, making it more user-friendly and efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reduce help desk support dependency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing the strain on help desk resources due to login access issues, DTMB sought to reduce users’ need to access help desk support. By implementing changes to enhance the login process, the goal was to empower users to navigate.</p>



<p>Fortify security resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no shortage of risk and vulnerabilities associated with traditional username and password authentication. A key&nbsp; objective was to fortify the system against security threats and phishing incidents, by adopting advanced FIDO strong&nbsp; authentication to mitigate the risks commonly exploited by bad actors seeking unauthorized access.</p>



 The Importance of Open Standards and Interoperability&nbsp; 



<p>Before deciding to implement passkeys, the DTMB explored a proprietary passwordless login solution offered by a cloud based identity-as-a-solution (IDaaS) provider. However, the solution lacked the interoperability required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DTMB determined early on in its process that open standard and interoperability were critical and required&nbsp; components of its strong authentication strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A standards-based approach provides interoperability across popular device types and web browsers, maintains vendor&nbsp; neutrality, allows for cost savings through community adoption, and a pathway to adopt future innovations in the FIDO&nbsp; ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 The Solution: FIDO Drives Results&nbsp; 



<p>Passkeys checked all the boxes for the DTMB, utilizing open standards and an interoperable approach for authentication.</p>



<p>The DTMB found that passkeys provide the following advantages:</p>



 
 Passkeys are based on open standards, ensuring interoperability without&nbsp;&nbsp;necessitating additional software for users to download.&nbsp; 



 Multiple vendor support for FIDO standards and the tech’s rapid&nbsp;&nbsp;adoption promotes the long-term continuity of FIDO authentication as a&nbsp;&nbsp;service.&nbsp; 



 FIDO standards accommodate various authenticator types (such as&nbsp;&nbsp;biometric sensors, hardware keys, etc.) across desktop and mobile&nbsp;&nbsp;devices, catering to the DTMB’s user base’s diverse authentication&nbsp;&nbsp;requirements.&nbsp; 



 Prioritizing user and ecosystem partner security, passkeys provide strong&nbsp;&nbsp;phishing resistance.&nbsp; 
 



 MiLogin’s Path to Passkeys&nbsp; 



<p>The DTMB’s passkey rollout involved a meticulous process to ensure a seamless, secure transition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Extensive research on passwordless authentication solutions was conducted, engaging the DTMB’s cybersecurity review&nbsp; board in the evaluation process. Upon selecting passkeys for further exploration, the DTMB delved into the analysis of&nbsp; various FIDO options and sought feedback from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working together with Deloitte, which is the DTMB’s trusted systems integrator for the State’s enterprise digital identity&nbsp; solution, a comprehensive strategy was planned for the design, development, and implementation phases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the design phase, insights from the FIDO Alliance’s usability study results were working into screen and workflow&nbsp; designs. Findings from the DTMB’s MiLogin human-centered design usability study were also used to create a user&nbsp; experience tailored to address the diverse needs of various personas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The development phase focused on integrating MiLogin with FIDO authentication methods, accompanied by the creation&nbsp; of animated user help guides and tutorial videos to drive greater user adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Post-implementation, the DTMB monitored production metrics and gathered feedback from end-users, ensuring the&nbsp; success of the implementation and identifying areas for functionality enhancements in future releases.</p>



 MiLogin’s Impressive Passwordless Results&nbsp; 



<p>Within the first six months of release, MiLogin achieved impressive results for the State of Michigan: </p>



 
 100,000+ customer devices enrolled in passkeys&nbsp; 



 ~18,000 new passkey enrollments per month&nbsp; 



 Increased FIDO-based logins with zero reported issues&nbsp; 



 Decreased help desk initiated password resets with 1,300 fewer calls&nbsp; related to password resets in a single month.&nbsp; 
 



 



<blockquote>
<p>“I am proud that our MiLogin team has brought passwordless authentication to our public&nbsp; digital identities. Passwordless brings additional protections to our public digital identities, and&nbsp; helps protect our systems from account takeover attempts such as brute force and password&nbsp; spray attacks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
– Jayson Cavendish, Chief Security Officer, State of Michigan, DTMB&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>The Road Ahead for Passwordless in the State of Michigan&nbsp;</p>



<p>The State of Michigan anticipates a significant increase in passkey adoption, targeting over 10 million public users.&nbsp; They also plan to implement passwordless authentication for their workforce, integrating with their state directory&nbsp; services solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO authentication is a part of the State of Michigan’s Zero Trust Identity strategy to establish a secure identity in citizen&nbsp; interactions with state services. It will also improve the user experience, generate cost savings for the state, and increase adoption of the State’s digital identity solution by diverse state agency partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what advice does the DTMB have for other other organizations? The State of Michigan recommends understanding&nbsp; diverse user bases and use cases, prioritizing user experience, and incorporating usability studies, clear end-user messaging,&nbsp; and a well-designed communication plan for a successful FIDO authentication implementation.</p>

<p>As mentioned in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/web3-points-library/">post introducing our points library</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Solutions SDK</a> also contains examples (found within the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/demo?ref=blog.ceramic.network">demo directory</a>) designed to help developers understand how to use the libraries within a larger application context. The remainder of this article will walk through a tutorial of the "full-stack app" example. If you prefer to follow a video tutorial, visit our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75IZp2oYncM&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">YouTube video</a> of this tutorial. </p> The Use Case: Rewarding Points for Joining a Community <p>This example offers a simple demonstration of how one could use the points library to reward community members for their engagement such as joining key platforms. To keep things simple, this tutorial will walk through the act of joining a Discord server as the trigger.</p> Getting Started <p>While an identical version of this example lives directly in the SDK repository, we've pulled it into a separate codebase for this walk-through. To get started, clone the code, install your dependencies, and duplicate the example environment file:</p> <code>// if you don't have pnpm installed
npm install -g pnpm@9

// otherwise: 
git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example &amp;&amp; cd points-example
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env</code> <p>Next, we'll need to configure a few environment variables:</p><p>NEXTAUTH_SECRET</p><p>We will be using&nbsp;<a href="https://next-auth.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">NextAuth</a>&nbsp;as our open-source authentication solution (in order to verify Discord server membership). You can create a secret easily by running the following in your terminal:</p> <code>openssl rand -base64 32</code> <p>DISCORD_CLIENT_ID and DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET</p><p>This app will use Discord as the authentication provider (wrapped by NextAuth). To obtain these credentials, navigate to the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Discord Developer Portal</a>&nbsp;and set up a new application. On the left-hand panel, click on "OAuth2" and bring over your Client ID and Client Secret from the "Client Information" box.</p><p>Finally, since you'll be running the application locally, set the following URI value within the "Redirects" box (found under "Client Information"):&nbsp;<code>http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord</code>.</p><p>CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY</p><p>This is the private key your application will use to instantiate a static key:did in order to write points using the library. This DID will act as the identifier for the issuer of points for your application (you).</p><p>If you have the&nbsp;<a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.7.x/api/modules/cli?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB CLI</a>&nbsp;installed globally, you can run the following command in your terminal to create one:</p> <code>composedb did:generate-private-key</code> <p>AGGREGATION_ID</p><p>A default value for this environment variable has been provided for you within the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/.env.example?ref=blog.ceramic.network">.env.example</a>&nbsp;file. Please leave this as-is. You can reference the "extending the default library interfaces" below to learn more about this variable.</p><p>PROJECT_ID</p><p>We will be using&nbsp;<a href="https://walletconnect.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect's</a>&nbsp;Web3Modal for Web3 authentication. In your&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/pages/_app.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">_app.tsx</a>&nbsp;file, you will need to enter an active value for the&nbsp;<code>PROJECT_ID</code>&nbsp;constant defined on line 10.</p><p>You can set up a developer account for free by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">cloud.walletconnect.com</a>. Once authenticated, create a new app and copy over the "Project ID" value (found in the dashboard view for that corresponding app).</p> Extending the Default Library Interfaces <p>For our use case let's assume the following about our point reward structure:</p>  Participants can earn points related to engaging on certain platforms (such as Discord)  There are various ways participants can earn points across each platform (for example, following, posting, liking, and so on)  <p>As such, our application logic has the following requirements:</p>  Our application needs to easily access platform-specific subtotals for each participant  Our application also needs to easily access "global" totals for each participant as a sum of all eligible behavior  <p>The points library's default implementation of the <code>PointsAggregationInterface</code> serves only the second requirement above:</p> <code>type SimplePointsAggregation implements PointsAggregationInterface
  @createModel(
    description: "Simple points aggregation to an account at a specific date"
    accountRelation: SET
    accountRelationFields: ["recipient"]
  ) {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
  date: DateTime!
}</code> <p>This default model defines a <code>SET</code> accountRelation using the "recipient" subfield, which ensures that there can be only 1 model instance document any given account can create that points to a specific recipient. This will be useful for logging the global total for each participant, but would not be ideal for our first requirement.</p><p>Conversely, the <code>SimplePointsAllocation</code> model, the default type implementation of the <code>PointsAllocationInterface</code> (found in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/blob/main/composites/points/schemas/1-init.graphql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">schemas</a>), defines a <code>LIST</code> accountRelation, and is designed to track the history of allocation events rather than the current sum.</p><p>We've therefore chosen this example to show how easily developers can extend the defaults to meet more nuanced use cases. For this example app, we've defined a new type to fit our needs:</p> <code>type ContextPointAggregation implements PointsAggregationInterface
  @createModel(
    description: "A simple context-based point aggregation model"
    accountRelation: SET
    accountRelationFields: ["recipient", "context"]
  ) {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
  date: DateTime!
  context: String! @string(maxLength: 100)
}</code> <p>The extension you'll notice is that our SET relation now sits on two fields - "recipient" and "context". If, for example, we wanted to sum up all Discord-eligible behavior under a "discord" context value, this new accountRelation scheme ensures that our application (as the issuer) can create only 1 model instance per recipient+context combination.</p><p>For this tutorial, we've already pre-deployed this special type to the default node endpoint (if you want to create your own custom extensions, you will need to set up a node first). The model's stream ID is the corresponding value for the <code>AGGREGATION_ID</code> key provided for you in your .env file.</p> Using the Points Library in the Application <p>You can find the points library being used in our app's server logic as API routes and a context utility. If you look at our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/utils/context.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">context.ts</a> file, you can see how we've imported our <code>CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY</code> and <code>AGGREGATION_ID</code> environment variables to instantiate our reader and writer classes:</p> <code>import { PointsWriter, PointsReader } from '@ceramic-solutions/points'
import { getAuthenticatedDID } from '@ceramic-solutions/key-did'
import { fromString } from 'uint8arrays'

const CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY: string = process.env.CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY ?? ''
const aggregationModelID: string | undefined = process.env.AGGREGATION_ID ?? undefined

const seed = fromString(CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY, 'base16') as Uint8Array

// create a context writer
const contextWriter = await PointsWriter.fromSeed({
  aggregationModelID,
  seed,
})

// create a total writer
const writer = await PointsWriter.fromSeed({
  seed,
})

// generate issuer for reader context
const issuer = await getAuthenticatedDID(seed)

//create a context reader
const contextReader = PointsReader.create({
  issuer: issuer.id,
  aggregationModelID,
})

//create a total reader
const reader = PointsReader.create({
  issuer: issuer.id,
})

export { contextWriter, writer, contextReader, reader }</code> <p>We're purposely creating 2 instances of each, one of which is blank and therefore uses the default value  of <code>aggregationModelID</code> (the <code>SimplePointsAggregation</code> discussed above), while the other uses our imported extension.</p><p>In our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/tree/main/src/pages/api?ref=blog.ceramic.network">API routes</a> you'll find simple endpoints for reading and creating points. Notice how we import our writer instances from our context utility in order to mutate or create two separate documents:</p> <code>import { type NextApiRequest, type NextApiResponse } from 'next'
import { contextWriter, writer } from '@/utils/context'
import type { ModelInstanceDocument } from '@composedb/types'
import { type PointsContent, type AggregationContent } from '@/utils/types'

interface Request extends NextApiRequest {
  body: {
    recipient: string
    amount: number
    context: string
  }
}

interface Response extends NextApiResponse {
  status(code: number): Response
  send(data: { contextTotal: number; total: number } | { error: string }): void
}

export default async function handler(req: Request, res: Response) {
  try {
    const { recipient, amount, context } = req.body

    // get context aggregation doc if exists
    const aggregationDoc: ModelInstanceDocument&lt;AggregationContent&gt; | null =
      await contextWriter.loadAggregationDocumentFor([recipient, context])

    // if aggregation doc does not exist for that context, set points aggregation for both context and global total
    if (aggregationDoc === null) {
      // update context-specific aggregation
      const updatedContextAgg: ModelInstanceDocument&lt;AggregationContent&gt; =
        await contextWriter.setPointsAggregationFor([recipient, context], amount, {
          recipient,
          points: amount,
          date: new Date().toISOString(),
          context,
        } as Partial&lt;PointsContent&gt;)

      // update total aggregation
      const updatedTotalAgg: ModelInstanceDocument&lt;AggregationContent&gt; =
        await writer.updatePointsAggregationFor([recipient], (content) =&gt; {
          return {
            points: content ? content.points + amount : amount,
            date: new Date().toISOString(),
            recipient,
          }
        })

      res.status(200).send({
        contextTotal: updatedContextAgg.content ? updatedContextAgg.content.points : 0,
        total: updatedTotalAgg.content ? updatedTotalAgg.content.points : 0,
      })
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    res.status(500).send({ error: 'Internal Server Error' })
  }
}
</code> <p>As you might've noticed, the current logic only issues the points if the recipient has not yet been rewarded for the input context, which makes sense given that the app in its current form only confirms Discord server membership.</p><p>You'll notice that our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/pages/api/readPoints.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">readPoints.ts</a> route is even simpler, making use of the <code>getAggregationPointsFor</code> method our reader instances offer. </p> Requesting to View Users' Servers with NextAuth <p>If you navigate to our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/server/auth.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">auth.ts</a> route you'll notice the inclusion of an authorization URI that specifies the scope of read access we need to view a user's server (or guild) membership:</p> <code>providers: [
    DiscordProvider({
      clientId: env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: env.DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET,
      authorization:
        "https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?scope=identify+email+guilds",
    }),
  ],</code> <p>We use this access within the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">frontend component</a> of our single-page app to request guild membership and determine if one of them is named "Ceramic" (alongside checking the user's points and awarding them if eligible):</p> <code>const checkPoints = async (context: string, recipient: string) =&gt; {

 Introducing AutoGreenCharge by Energy Web: a decentralized application for decarbonizing electric vehicle&nbsp;charging  Mobile app helps automotive companies, charging companies, and EV drivers decarbonize electric&nbsp;mobility <p>Energy Web, a global nonprofit organization that builds open source software to accelerate the energy transition, has announced <a href="http://www.autogreencharge.com">AutoGreenCharge</a> by Energy Web, a new product that makes it simple for electric vehicle drivers, manufacturers, and other electric mobility companies to decarbonize electric vehicle charging. The application is designed to serve both electric vehicle drivers and e-mobility companies while bringing new levels of transparency and verifiability to the electric vehicle charging&nbsp;space.</p><p>In 2023, electric vehicles used approximately 110 terawatt hours of electricity — comparable to the annual electricity consumption of the Netherlands, and this figure is expected to increase tenfold by 2030. And although electric vehicles are far more efficient than gas-powered vehicles, electric vehicle charging in most markets around the world is not fully renewable: in the U.S. approximately 38% of charging is green while in Europe the figure is&nbsp;60%.</p><p><a href="http://www.autogreencharge.com">AutoGreenCharge</a> by Energy Web closes this gap by calculating the sustainability of charging sessions and matching the non-renewable portion with verified energy attribute certificates. These digital tokens represent renewable power generation and have been used by governments and corporations like Google and Microsoft since the 2010s to decarbonize business operations. AutoGreenCharge’s functionality extends to a mobile app, allowing drivers to clean up their charging, and can be integrated into existing apps used by EV manufacturers and charging companies. Over time, users will be able to choose certificates from a variety of power plants with different characteristics, such as solar power plants situated in particularly dirty grids that have a greater impact on decarbonization than renewable energy facilities in renewable-rich areas.</p><p>Currently, Energy Web is partnering with top EV manufacturers and additional partners to test, develop, and release AutoGreenCharge to the&nbsp;public.</p><p>Sign up to become one of the first beta-testers at: www.autogreencharge.com</p><blockquote>Sahas Katta, CEO at Smartcar, the leading connected car API platform and Greencharge partner, said “This partnership will empower EV drivers with the knowledge and confidence to maximize the sustainability of their EV charging experience. With Smartcar, Energy Web can seamlessly integrate across diverse vehicle brands, giving more EV drivers access to accurate insights into charging transparency and renewable energy&nbsp;options.</blockquote><blockquote>We could not be more excited to apply Energy Web technology to electric vehicle charging,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web Foundation. “This is a fast growing sector of electricity demand; pairing demand with high impact renewables from around the globe is a great way to bring more capital into renewable energy&nbsp;markets.</blockquote><p>About Energy Web Foundation:</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading corporates, energy companies, utilities, renewable energy developers, transportation sector majors and telecommunications leaders.

<p>At its pre-IIW workshop on Monday, April 14, the OpenID Foundation convened a panel on Post-Quantum Computing and Identity. The panelists included:</p>
 
 Andrea D’Intino, Dyne.org 
 Nancy Cam-Winget, Cisco 
 John Bradley, Yubico 
 Rick Byers, Google 
 Gail Hodges, OpenID Foundation (moderator) 
 
<p>This summary draws out general themes and comments are not attributed to individuals or their organizations. You can also view this summary by the OpenID Chairman, Nat Sakimura.</p>
<p>  </p>
 Dissecting the Threat 
<p>Traditional public-key cryptography (PKC) will not withstand the code-breaking power of quantum computers. Put simply, today’s encryption methods depend upon complex mathematical problems that conventional computers cannot solve. PKC is used widely: to protect private data at rest, to secure messages (data in transit), to prevent unwanted third parties from hijacking digital sessions, and many other things. In the case of the OpenID Foundation, &nbsp;our standards – from OIDC to OID4VP and Federation – leverage PKC to secure identity data. As an increasingly digital society, it is how we all secure private data, business processes, government secrets, and critical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a world of quantum computing, however, certain algorithms become more feasible to run (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor’s algorithm</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover’s search</a>). With these algorithms in play, those mathematical problems that underpin PKC become breakable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panel discussed several ways in which modern identity infrastructure is vulnerable to these threats.</p>
<p>Tokens – OpenID Connect, Verifiable Credentials, and other standards rely heavily on tokens. The Identity Token at the end of an OIDC flow, for example, is a JSON Web Token (JWT). Tokens depend upon encrypted digital signatures that will come under threat in a post-quantum world.</p>
<p>Certificates and Transport Layer Security – the panel discussed the dependence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) on certificates and digital signatures. Digitally signed certificates come under threat when those signatures can more easily be forged in a post quantum environment.</p>
<p>Hardware Security Modules – create, store, and (ideally) never transmit key material. Today, this irrefutably establishes signature provenance. However, if the key-generation algorithm used by that HSM isn’t quantum-resistant, then any keys generated are vulnerable. Furthermore, there are key transmission and import processes undertaken today by large enterprises who require scalable and resilient signing capabilities: unless those transfer protocols are quantum-resistant, private keys may be intercepted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, quantum threatens not only our data, but also our Roots of Trust: once these systems are broken, how will anyone be able to reliably trust that they know the nature of any entity they are interacting with online?</p>
<p>For more information about the threat of quantum in the context of today’s cryptography, see <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5108747984306176/google-s-threat-model-for-post-quantum-cryptography">Google’s Threat Model for Post-Quantum Cryptography</a>.</p>
 Not a Y2K Event 
<p>When asked whether there were parallels between the quantum threat and Y2K, the panelists agreed that the analogy doesn’t hold: Y2K was a predictable event with a known timeline. The “post-quantum cross-over” is much less clear cut and the threats more insidious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most importantly, the threats of quantum computing actually begin long before the technology is available. While quantum computers do not seem to pose an immediate threat, since they are not readily available, the panelists agreed that much of today’s encrypted data is sill threatened. In part, this is because nation-state actors, in particular, may have these capabilities on the foreseeable horizon.</p>
<p>It is also because data captured today can be stored (and is being stored) with the intent of future decryption. This includes data stored today that could lead to the reverse engineering of signing keys years into the future. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes data stored or transmitted by individuals, companies, governments, and all other actors online. Encrypted digital transactions, like payments and secure messages, intercepted today can be stored and decrypted tomorrow. As such, there are major implications for the way we secure any secrets that will still matter in the future – whether that be state secrets or the private keys of our hardware.</p>
 Preparation is Key 
<p>…no pun intended…</p>
<p>The panelists agreed that, given the recognizable threat, players across the landscape must work to develop and align around quantum-resistant algorithms that can be implemented at scale. This alignment will enable organizations to roll-out future-proofed hardware and protect today’s data against the threats of tomorrow. In the interim, many players are introducing “quantum-safe” solutions and offering guidance as to how organizations can best position themselves today. Some of these solutions involve actively testing and “doubling up” pre/post-quantum controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All panelists agreed that not all safeguards are “post-quantum.” Many best-practices of today will continue to be protective and, as yet, are not sufficiently commonplace (see, for example,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/CSRB_Review_of_the_Summer_2023_MEO_Intrusion_Final_508c.pdf">Cyber Safety Review Board’s recent recommendations</a> to Cloud Service Providers). These include best practices for key storage, key rotation, passkey (or password) management. Today’s essential hygiene remains critical and the ecosystem will continue to be only as protected as its weakest link. The panelists argued that a robust cybersecurity position has dependencies across the whole supply chain. If we want to solve the problems, the industry must continue to advocate for comprehensive standards and controls that protect.</p>
<p>This includes supporting global efforts to find quantum-resistant algorithms that scale and complement existing infrastructures. For example, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms">NIST is in the middle of a six-year competition</a> to standardize algorithms fit for essential use cases. There were four winners of the 2022 competition:</p>
 
 Kyber (a key exchange mechanism) 
 CRYSTALS-Dilithium (signing) 
 Falcon (signing) 
 Sphincs+ (signing) 
 
<p>The panel saw examples of how some of this had been implemented, including dyne.org’s implementation of <a href="https://dyne.org/W3C-DID/">Dilithium-signed Decentralized Identifiers</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 What does this mean for OpenID Foundation? 
<p>Members of the panel and OIDF members in the room reached consensus that, given the post-quantum vulnerabilities to identity tokens, credentials, and trust ecosystems, this is an area that requires immediate attention on behalf of the Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OIDF standards have a role in underpinning trust today. Our standards are designed to mitigate modern security threats. <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI</a>, for example, provides data schemas and security guidance appropriate for use cases requiring financial-grade privacy and security. <a href="https://openid.net/third-implementers-draft-of-openid-connect-federation-specification-approved/">OpenID Federation</a> also has a role underpinning trust between counterparties through cryptographically signed entity statements. Both standards have a place addressing the risks in today’s cybersecurity landscape: broad adoption of these and other emerging standards will reduce risk today.</p>
<p>However, while OIDF standards utilize modern cryptography, all Work Groups&nbsp; need to keep a watchful eye on emerging standards for quantum-resilience. At a point in the not-too-distant future, they will need to bake new cryptographic best practices into the standards. In the mean time, we can increase our advocacy and cross-industry collaborative efforts to test and refine quantum-safe algorithms.</p>

 OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph for trusted cross-organization real-time data integration in EU-funded DMaaST <p>Trace Labs, the core developers of OriginTrail, has joined the European Union’s initiative to foster a resilient and adaptive manufacturing ecosystem through the DMaaST project. Collaborating with partners from Slovenia, Spain, Germany, Portugal, Turkey, Serbia, Belgium, Lithuania, France, Denmark, and Switzerland, the initiative will leverage the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and Knowledge Assets (KA) to encapsulate all pertinent information regarding products, processes, facilities, and human expertise. This comprehensive approach will facilitate the precise mapping of data flows and knowledge interconnections, laying the groundwork for comprehensive information mapping within the manufacturing ecosystem using OriginTrail DKG. Consequently, this will ensure trustworthy cross-organizational real-time data integration.</p><p>Once more, attention has been drawn to challenges within the aeronautic and manufacturing industries following a January incident in which a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/08/boeing-shares-fall-door-plane-mid-flight-spirit-aerosystems-737-max-9">Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plug blew out</a> in the middle of an Alaska Airlines flight. If the company had established reliable cross-organizational communication, it could have prevented this incident. Such communication would enhance the value chain’s responsiveness to external and unforeseen events, as well as improve operability and production planning capacity.</p><p>Effective, transparent, and reliable data exchange are the most important points for fostering sustainability, resilience, and energy efficiency in the manufacturing industry. However, over the past years, various challenges have come to the forefront within this&nbsp;sector.</p>  Supply Chain Disruptions: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted existing vulnerabilities in global supply chains, leading to disruptions in the flow of materials and components. Issues such as raw material shortages, transportation bottlenecks, and labor shortages have persisted, impacting manufacturing operations worldwide.  Cybersecurity Risks: With the increasing digitization of manufacturing processes through technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0, cybersecurity threats have become a significant concern. Manufacturing facilities are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks that can disrupt operations, steal sensitive data, or compromise product quality and&nbsp;safety.  Data Silos: Manufacturing organizations often operate with fragmented data systems, leading to isolated data silos across departments or functions. This fragmentation inhibits seamless data interoperability and hampers comprehensive insights that could drive operational efficiency and innovation.  Lack of Standards: The absence of standardized data formats and protocols complicates data exchange and integration efforts within and across manufacturing enterprises. Without universally accepted standards, interoperability becomes a significant challenge, impeding the flow of data between different systems and stakeholders.  Data Privacy Concerns: With the proliferation of data collection and sharing practices in manufacturing, ensuring data privacy and protection is paramount. Manufacturers must navigate complex regulatory landscapes, safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access or misuse while balancing the need for data-driven decision-making.  Ownership and Control: Determining ownership rights and control over manufacturing data can be contentious, especially in collaborative environments or supply chain networks. Disputes may arise regarding data ownership, usage rights, and intellectual property, complicating data sharing agreements and hindering collaborative initiatives.  Legacy Systems Integration: Many manufacturing facilities still rely on legacy systems that were not designed with interoperability in mind. Integrating these outdated systems with modern data platforms and technologies poses significant challenges, requiring extensive customization, retrofitting, and investments in interoperability solutions.  <p>DMaaST aims to enhance manufacturing ecosystem resilience and adaptability by employing a Smart Manufacturing Platform comprising four layers. The data layer establishes a foundation for real-time data integration across organizations using ontologies and OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph. Following this, a two-level cognitive digital twin is deployed to model both manufacturing services production lines and value chain stages. It incorporates human expertise, data-driven algorithms, and physical modeling. An algorithm for multi-objective distributed decision support systems leverages this data to facilitate optimal production decisions. Outcomes will be communicated via user-friendly interfaces and timely scoreboards, assessing circularity, sustainability, and product traceability. Over the four-year period, DMaaST ensures scalability and innovation by providing insights for replicating and improving manufacturing processes, advancing technologies in aerospace and electronics sectors.</p><p>Trace Labs will lead the data working group to develop and validate technologies aimed at facilitating data understanding, interoperability, and secure cross-organization integration. With integration of OriginTrail DKG for the electronic and aeronautical sector, creating a new powerful knowledge base with artificial intelligence capabilities. The DKG will establish a decentralized database accessible to all participants in a manufacturing value chain, including manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, retailers, regulatory bodies, research institutes, and others. This will enhance the manufacturing ecosystem’s ability to autonomously withstand and adapt to external&nbsp;events.</p><p>OriginTrail DKG has been widely utilized to foster trust and transparency in enterprise knowledge exchange across various industries. Now, it is evolving to facilitate global knowledge connectivity, powering the <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf">Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG) framework</a> for more precise and inclusive AI.

<p>By Duncan Sparrell, sFractal Consulting</p> 


<p>Cybersecurity threats have evolved significantly over the years, with cyber attackers constantly finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in software systems. From worms and viruses to the more recent ransomware attacks, the cost of cybercrime continues to rise. Not only are financial losses mounting, but the potential impact on critical infrastructure such as healthcare systems is also a cause for concern. Recent breaches like Log4Shell, SolarWinds, and XZ underscore the vulnerabilities within our software supply chains. These incidents highlight the critical need for understanding software supply chains, their vulnerabilities, and ways to prevent, detect, mitigate, and recover from attacks. To do this requires understanding the supply chain, which is hard in today’s environment.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2024/04/30/call-for-participation-oasis-osim-tc/">OASIS Open Supply Chain Information Modeling (OSIM)</a> Technical Committee aims to standardize and promote information models for supply chains.</p>



<p>The Role of OSIM</p>



<p>OSIM members will work to standardize the representation of information related to supply chains. Unlike data models, information models operate at a higher level of abstraction. They offer a holistic view of the supply chain ecosystem, facilitating a better understanding of the existing data formats, where similarities exist, where gaps exist, and how to utilize the inherent information in them.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Exploring Information Models</p>



<p>While data modeling focuses on implementing data structures, information modeling provides an abstract model that precedes knowledge modeling. Despite the current emphasis on data modeling, there’s a notable lack of attention given to information modeling, particularly in sectors such as supply chain software and cybersecurity. To address this gap, exploring specific use cases and adopting tools like <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-jadn-im/blob/published/imjadn-v1.0-cn01.md#2-information-modeling-overview">JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN)</a>, an OASIS specification for information modeling, is essential.</p>



<p>Using Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) as an example, the acute need for SBOMs has spurred significant work in recent years, highlighting the value of SBOMs and driving the implementation of several different SBOM data formats (e.g. <a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX</a> and <a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX</a>). And those formats can portray data other than SBOM (e.g. vulnerability exploitability, licensing). So what makes an SBOM an SBOM? That is a question OSIM can answer with an SBOM information model. Besides being used to compare the features of the various data formats, the resulting information model can then be used as input to knowledge model graphs for defining the semantics/knowledge/meaning.</p>



<p>Another example is Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (<a href="https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/vex_one-page_summary_0.pdf">VEX</a>) which is even newer and also has multiple evolving data formats (<a href="https://oasis-open.github.io/csaf-documentation/">CSAF</a>, <a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openvex">OpenVex</a>, <a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX</a>). What makes a VEX a VEX? And what elements are in common with SBOM or have relationships with elements in an SBOM? This question becomes even more important as SBOM and VEX begin to appear in regulations and contractual procurement documents.</p>



<p>Standardizing Supply Chain Information Models</p>



<p>The U.S. government, through agencies like the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (<a href="https://www.ntia.gov/page/software-bill-materials">NTIA</a>) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sbom">CISA</a>), is recognizing the need for transparency and accountability in software procurement. They are requiring vendors to disclose what’s in their software through SBOMs to aid in identifying vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>However, the existence of various competing data models (SPDX, CycloneDX, CSAF, OpenVex) highlights the necessity for creating information models. By establishing a standard framework that sits atop existing data models, it defines the essence of “what is an SBOM?”, “what is a VEX” and it becomes easier to identify commonalities and differences across diverse specifications. Such a model could streamline interoperability and facilitate software conversion processes. While challenges persist, efforts to standardize supply chain information modeling aim to bring clarity and coherence to the complex landscape of software supply chains.</p>



<p>The goal of OSIM isn’t to create yet another competing standard but to provide a unifying framework. By standardizing OSIM, we can bridge the gap between existing data models emphasizing interoperability and collaboration among multiple standards.</p>



<p>Collaboration is Key<br><br>OSIM is paving the way for a safer and more resilient digital future with a secure software supply chain ecosystem. Achieving creation and widespread adoption of OSIM of supply chain information models will require collaboration among stakeholders across industries. Whether you’re a customer, a vendor, or a solution provider, your involvement is crucial.</p>

<p>20% of the world’s top 100 websites now support the password alternative</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., 02 May, 2024 – World Password Day may soon need a rebrand, as the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> survey released today shows that half of people in the US and UK have begun ditching the password in favor of more convenient and secure passwordless alternatives.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/content-ebook-consumer-password-and-passkey-trends-wpd-2024/">independent survey</a> commissioned by the FIDO Alliance found that 53% of people have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts, with 22% enabling them on every account they possibly can. In separate research, the Alliance found that passkeys are now supported by 20% of the world’s top 100 websites and 12% of the top 250.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shift away from passwords toward passkeys is being driven by three key trends; people’s concerns over password security, their frustrations in using them, and the growing availability of passkeys on major websites and services.</p>



<p>The Alliance’s research found that in the last year, 24% of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities, and 26% had to reset or recover at least one password every month. In addition, 45% of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account. This is hugely significant for passkey adoption, as 61% of people familiar with passkeys consider them to be more convenient than passwords, and 58% believe they offer greater security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The availability of passkeys has also increased steadily over the last year, with <a href="https://aka.ms/VasuJoyWPD2024">Microsoft today announcing</a> that Microsoft accounts, including a wide range of services like Bing, Microsoft 365 and Xbox.com – now also support passkeys. This is added to support from large global consumer brands, such as Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Google, Hyatt, Nintendo, PayPal, PlayStation, Shopify and TikTok. In all, more than 13 billion user accounts can now leverage passkeys for sign in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of high-profile passkey deployments like these, awareness of the technology has grown to 62% of people, according to the research. Among people with some knowledge of passkeys, those enabling them on at least one account rises substantially to 74%, while those enabling passkeys on every account possible rises to 32%. This suggests that adoption will only increase as more people become more familiar with passkeys.</p>



<p>“It was just two years ago that FIDO Alliance, alongside the world’s largest platform providers, introduced the vision for passkeys to accelerate the scale and usability of password-free sign-ins. The market’s reaction since then has been nothing short of phenomenal, with hundreds of services enabling billions of consumers to use passkeys,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance. “We expect this trend to accelerate in the months and years ahead, and our research makes it clear that when offered, people prefer the better security and usability of passkeys over passwords.”</p>



<p>Ends</p>



<p>Notes to editors:</p>



 
 The independent survey was conducted by Sapio Research in April 2024 among 2,000 consumers across the UK and US – with 1,000 in each country. Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. In this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 2.2 percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample. 



 To calculate the proportion of the world’s top websites and services that support passkeys, the FIDO Alliance combined publicly available information with its own data on passkey deployments.&nbsp; 
 



<p>About the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.<br>Contact<br><a href="mailto:press@fidoalliance.org">press@fidoalliance.org</a></p>

<p>In our technologically driven world, vulnerabilities in hardware and software are an unavoidable reality. No software or hardware is immune to security vulnerabilities. Addressing these “open wounds” in cybersecurity needs automation. This is where the <a href="https://csaf.io/">Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)</a> emerges as a game-changer.</p>



<p>CSAF is an OASIS open standard designed to streamline the communication and distribution of machine-processable security advisories and mitigation information. It aims to simplify the process by which organizations access and process information about security vulnerabilities and their potential remedies.</p>



<p>As the Chair of CSAF, I have had the honor of working and collaborating with the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and numerous industry and government partners in the development and enhancement of CSAF and VEX. This collaboration has been instrumental in creating the future of vulnerability management.</p>



<p>Recognizing the critical importance of modernized vulnerability management, BSI not only promotes the adoption of CSAF but also actively organizes workshops to educate and enable organizations to utilize this framework effectively. As part of the Alliance for Cyber Security (ACS), BSI has scheduled three free workshops from May 14 to May 16, 2024, aimed at strengthening understanding and implementation of CSAF.</p>



<p>We cordially invite you to join the upcoming CSAF workshops, hosted by BSI. These workshops offer a unique opportunity to deepen your understanding of the future of vulnerability disclosure and its critical role in modern cybersecurity.</p>



<p>Participating in these workshops will empower you and your organization with the knowledge to implement CSAF effectively, enhancing your ability to manage vulnerabilities with precision and efficiency. You’ll gain invaluable insights into automated vulnerability management and how CSAF can streamline the communication of security advisories.</p>



<p>Don’t miss this chance to learn from leading experts and network with peers who are equally dedicated to advancing cybersecurity practices.</p>

<p>For those in our community who have been staying up-to-date on our thoughts and experimenting thus far as they relate to points, you already know why we see points as a logical vehicle for Web3 reputation systems. As our co-founder, Danny importantly points out in his blog post entitled <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/points-how-reputation-tokens-collide-where-it-goes-from-here/">Points: How Reputation &amp; Tokens Collide</a>, points not only align the incentives of the platform and its users, but Web3 enables point systems to be more open and composable by "...making every event driving points both transparent and verifiable..."</p><p>Given Ceramic's native composability, provenance, performance, and flexible-by-design characteristics, "points built on Ceramic" became an obvious idea for a design pattern that would appeal to teams looking to integrate reward systems into their projects. In March, we released a post called <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/points-on-ceramic/">Building Points on Ceramic - an Example and Learnings</a> meant to walk readers through a points proof-of-concept application we deployed for EthDenver '24. Later that month, we also released another post to announce <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/toward-the-first-decentralized-points-system-oamo-becomes-the-first-points-provider-on-ceramic/">Oamo as the first points provider on Ceramic</a>.</p><p>This is all to say - as an organization, we've strived to be thoughtful and deliberate about how we approach the opportunity Web3 points presents while aiming to maintain quick iteration and experimentation as engineering and product norms.</p><p>As such, we've been working on a new experiment that we're excited to share with you - a points library built on Ceramic!</p> Why Develop a Points Library?  <p>Given that we identified points as an ideal use case for Ceramic, building a points library presented an opportunity to help developers start experimenting with and iterating on Ceramic much faster. We also predicted that the approach would accelerate developers' learning rate by packaging Ceramic within an easy-to-understand paradigm. Finally, a use case-specific library allowed us to:</p>  Predefine library interfaces and base models for users, helping them bypass this development stage  Eliminate the friction of compiling and deploying a composite  Enable immediate utility and experimentation by removing the need for node setup  Help developers focus on their core application logic by baking straightforward functionality into the library  <p>...and so on.</p> Which Use Cases is it Built for? <p>Throughout this post, we'll take a high-level walk through the anatomy of the points module (and the broader SDK it lives in) which should reveal how flexible and extendable the library is. However, here are some scenarios we considered that helped inform its design and utility:</p><p>Rewarding Community Engagement</p>  A project wants to incentivize meaningful participation by rewarding points for engagement across key social platforms  The project must track a history of point allocation events per participant, as well as have easy access to a participant's total  <p>Incentivizing Collaboration</p>  A project wants to reward collaborators for contributing to a codebase  Various types of contributions under this system are eligible for point rewards  <p>Quests or Education</p>  An education platform wants to reward students for completing class modules  Points are distributed in correlation to quiz or test scores at the end of each module   What is the Points Library? <p>The points library is the first module within our larger <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Solutions SDK</a>, designed to be the eventual home for any experimental tooling our team creates for certain common patterns or use cases we've identified as priorities. While the individual libraries (points, for example) sit at the core of this SDK, this repository will also contain example applications, API documentation, and other helpful modules to support developers looking to get started.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/libraries/points?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Points Library module</a> (which is now available as an NPM module - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramic-solutions/points?activeTab=readme&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">@ceramic-solutions/points</a>) removes the common points of tension mentioned above by:</p><p>Delivering a hosted node endpoint</p><p>This is the default endpoint if no alternate is provided by the user (for test purposes only - not intended for production). This feature was designed to accelerate developer experimentation. Of course, the library also supports private endpoints as well.</p><p>Predefined Interfaces and Default Models</p><p>The points library relies on two schema interfaces (implemented by two default models) for keeping track of points. These interfaces can easily be extended by developers who desire more complex use cases, or developers can leverage the default models out of the box with no additional configuration.</p> <code>interface PointsAllocationInterface implements PointsInterface
  @createModel(description: "Interface for a single allocation of points to an account") {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
}

interface PointsAggregationInterface implements PointsInterface
  @createModel(description: "Interface for an aggregation of points to an account") {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
  date: DateTime!
}</code> <p>While the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/blob/main/libraries/points/README.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Points Library Readme</a> offers more detail, these interfaces broadly speak to the two primary utilities we anticipate developers will need. Model instances of <code>PointsAllocationInterface</code> will keep track of the history of allocation events (and if extended, can include fields to capture additional details such as when and why points were allocated). Conversely, <code>PointsAggregationInterface</code> is designed to keep track of the sum of points for a recipient at any given time (and like allocation docs, can also be extended to keep track of more nuanced data points like contextual subtotals).</p><p>Built-in Reader and Writer Classes</p><p>The two core library modules consist of a points reader class and a separate writer class, allowing developers multiple ways to instantiate an instance (the easiest of which simply requires a private key if using the default node endpoint and default models). Each class includes built-in methods to read or issue points and can accommodate extensions of the interfaces without the necessity of additional wrapping.</p> What Will You Build with Points? <p>While we covered a few examples of typical use cases for points, there are so many other possibilities out there for developers to explore. Perhaps you want to reward your community for showing up to in-person events or collaborating on projects. Maybe you want to build a service that analyzes on-chain behavior (such as interacting with certain smart contracts or holding certain assets) and uses a framework of weights to award contextual points.</p><p>We'd love to learn how you're using reward systems across your communities and projects, and whether this initial library has what it needs to support your use case. Feel free to contact me directly at <a href="mailto:mzk@3box.io">mzk@3box.io</a>, or start a conversation on the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Forum</a>. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

<p>OASIS Open Supplychain Information Modeling (OSIM) TC</p>



<p>The charter for this TC is as follows:</p>



Section 1: TC Charter1.a. TC Name<br><br>OASIS Open Supplychain Information Modeling (OSIM) TC1.b. Statement of Purpose<br><br>The OASIS Open Supplychain Information Modeling (OSIM) TC aims to standardize and promote information models about all aspects of supply chains.<br><br>An Information Model (IM) defines the essential content of messages used in computing, independently of how those messages are represented (i.e., serialized) for communication or storage. Information models are a means to understand and document the essential information content relevant to a system, application, or protocol exchange without regard to how that information is represented in actual implementations. Having a clear view of the information required provides clarity regarding the goals that the eventual implementation must satisfy.<br>1.c. Business Benefits<br>&nbsp;<br>The establishment of information models and associated explanatory materials will benefit a wide array of stakeholders across the software and hardware industries. The key beneficiaries of this work can be broadly categorized into the following groups:<br><br>Software and Hardware Vendors:&nbsp;Standardized information models will provide clarity acrosssupply chains reducing the confusion and inefficiencies that result from the various diverse implementations of data exchanges across participants in supply chains. It will help vendors plan their product updates, support, and discontinuation more effectively and transparently,thereby improving customer trust and satisfaction. A standardized information model will also help to catalyze and undergird a thriving diverse ISV supply chain solution ecosystem-enabling modularity, extensibility, and a composable approach across vendors.<br><br>Open-Source Maintainers:&nbsp;Both hardware and software open-source maintainers will benefit from standardized supply chain information models, enabling them to make informed decisions about incorporating different software and hardware components into their projects.<br><br>End Users and Enterprises:&nbsp;Both individual end users and enterprises that rely heavily on technology for their operations will benefit significantly. They will receive timely and clear information about the products they use, helping them plan upgrades, replacements, or contingency plans in advance, thereby reducing vulnerabilities, disruptions, and potential security risks.<br><br>Technology Consultants and Service Providers:&nbsp;Consultants and service providers will be able to offer more accurate advice and support to their clients with access to standardized supply chain information.<br><br>Supply Chain Partners:&nbsp;The standardization would increase transparency and predictability in the supply chain, which can help reduce uncertainties and risks, leading to a more secure and resilient supply chain.<br><br>Government:&nbsp;Standardization can assist government agencies and regulatory bodies in overseeing the industry more effectively, ensuring that all players comply with the set guidelines, and promoting fair practices.1.d. Scope<br><br>The OASIS Open Supplychain Information Modeling (OSIM) TC will:<br><br>– Research and survey existing supply chain activities and share with the TC membership. Whenever possible, OSIM TC will reference and reuse existing work.<br><br>– Develop and maintain value propositions and use cases for supply chain information modeling.<br><br>– Develop and maintain supply chain information model standards about all aspects of supply chains, ensuring their relevance and applicability to current industry needs.<br><br>– Develop and maintain conformance supply chain information model standards.<br><br>– Facilitate interoperability and compatibility across different platforms and industries.<br><br>– Promote the widespread adoption of these supply chain information model standards and ensure their broad application to hardware and software from both vendors and open-source maintainers.<br><br>– Provide technical expertise and guidance on the application and evolution of these supply chain information model standards.1.e. Deliverables<br><br>The primary deliverables of the OASIS Open Supplychain Information Modeling (OSIM) TC will be:<br><br>– Value propositions and use cases: Specifications or Committee Notes to explain why the models are needed and how they will be used.<br><br>– Supply chain information model standards: One or more comprehensive specifications detailing the information models.<br><br>– Implementation Guide(s):One or more Committee Notes guiding stakeholders in implementing the information model(s).<br><br>– Open Source Software: One or more software repositories with software, tools, examples, FAQs, and other material supporting awareness and adoption of TC work products.1.f. IPR Mode<br><br>The OASIS Open Supplychain Information Modeling (OSIM) TC will operate in the Non-Assertion Mode, as described in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr/">OASIS IPR Policy</a>.1.g. Audience<br><br>The anticipated audience for this work includes, but is not limited, to:<br><br>– Software and hardware vendors<br>– Software and hardware open-source maintainers<br>– Technology consultants<br>– Business stakeholders reliant on technology products<br>– International, Federal, and local government organizations<br>– Regulatory bodies in the software and hardware industries1.h.

  🚀 Decentralized Identity Foundation News  
<p>The community welcomes Ankur Banerjee to the Helm of DIF TSC</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIF is excited to announce that Ankur Banerjee has been elected as the new co-chair of the DIF Technical Steering Committee (TSC). Ankur plays an increasingly critical role at DIF, and last year he was elected to the DIF Steering Committee. He joins current co-chair Andor Kesselman, and together they are bound to drive DIF's mission forward with renewed vigor and vision.</p>
<p>“We are extremely fortunate to have Ankur join us in a TSC leadership role," said Kim Hamilton Duffy, DIF’s Executive Director. "As decentralized identity technology continues to mature, it finds broader adoption across diverse markets and use cases, making the need for interoperability and compliance with emerging regulations more critical than ever. Ankur’s deep expertise across both consumer and enterprise spheres aligns perfectly with our strategic goals. His leadership will be crucial in navigating these evolving landscapes and ensuring that DIF remains at the forefront of technological innovation and standards development.”</p>
<p>"I am deeply honored to take on the role of co-chair of the DIF Technical Steering Committee. Decentralized identity technology is at an inflection point for adoption, where the basic building blocks of the standards are built and settled. I look forward to supporting DIF member organizations in accelerating their industry-wide efforts to make it easier for developers to build usable, privacy-preserving experiences that give users control of their data,” said Ankur Banerjee.</p>
<p>We encourage all our readers and members to extend their warmest welcome to Ankur. More <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/welcoming-ankur-banerjee-to-the-helm-of-dif-tsc/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Switchchord provides tools for songwriters to document ownership of their creations and connect with music publishers who administer their copyrights. The company is bringing sophisticated digital identity and legal technology solutions to the music industry. DIF recently spoke to Founder and CEO Cole Davis, who shared his insights into the industry's workings, and his approach to modernizing the music supply chain.   </p><p>Where did the idea for Switchchord come from?&nbsp;</p><p>I started playing the bass guitar at 15, and played throughout high school and college. After college I was playing in a band while working at a bank when we received a cease and desist letter telling us we had to change our name. It got me curious about the legal side of music and I decided to go back to school to study law.</p><p>After gaining a foundation in corporate law I switched to entertainment law. While helping ad agencies and filmmakers get the rights to use music in their productions, I was surprised by the lack of operational workflows and communication tools to enable this. In the music industry there are a mass of legal contracts that drive behavior. You need to prove you have the right to take certain actions based on these contracts, like license a certain copyright in a particular media. The identity and communication infrastructure was essentially nonexistent.</p><p>There are two sides to the music industry. The first is music publishing, which involves songwriters who write compositions–think melody, lyrics, and chord progressions. These compositions receive copyright protection, and usually songwriters sell or license these copyrights to music publishers. The music publisher makes money by licensing the composition and then shares the revenue with the songwriter.&nbsp;</p><p>The second part of the industry is recorded music. Recording artists make recordings of compositions, resulting in a sound recording. These sound recordings receive separate copyright protection, and this copyright is usually owned by the record company who “signed” the recording artist. So any time you hear music, there are technically two copyrights involved, and those two copyrights are usually owned by different entities.</p><p>The music publishing side gets very complex. Often songs are written by multiple songwriters who are “signed” to different music publishers, meaning multiple publishers co-own the copyright. Some music publishers then hire publishing administration companies to license their songs for them. And many music publishers hire “sub-publishers” in foreign territories for local administration and licensing . There’s no central record of ownership or administration rights. Instead, you have many third-party databases that have built up over time, all doing relatively the same thing and that are divorced from the legal contracts that actually govern copyright ownership and administration rights. Information relating to these legal relationships is usually delivered via texts and emails, often resulting in inconsistencies across the entire supply chain. The transaction costs are enormous.&nbsp;</p><p>I started researching the problem intensively, eventually quitting my job as a lawyer to study technology full time.&nbsp; I was originally focused on blockchain but eventually migrated to the W3C’s emerging decentralized identity framework.&nbsp;</p><p>How do these problems affect songwriters and recording artists?&nbsp;</p><p>Streaming fraud is a really big issue — there are estimates that 10% or more of all streams are fraudulent in some way. There are bad actors who try to “game” the system of common royalty pools. Sometimes they will hijack existing legitimate streaming accounts and turn them into a bot farm to stream the bad actor’s music. Or the bad actor will upload music they don’t own and hope to make money before the music is taken down.</p><p>Then there are ‘black box’ royalties that are unallocated, and can’t be distributed due to incomplete or incorrectly registered information. This is a global phenomenon in the music industry. In the US, these are often held in escrow by collective licensing agencies&nbsp;like the Mechanical Licensing Collective, which licenses certain music publishing rights to streaming platforms in the US — their unallocated royalty pool&nbsp;is estimated at $500M or more — who collectively try to figure it out. Eventually, after years, this money gets paid out based on market share.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also ramifications for attribution. If you’re not credited correctly, it can be a career killer for a songwriter.&nbsp;</p><p>Generative AI is the new big problem. Everything will need digital signatures at source, or you’re not sure whether it’s human or AI created.&nbsp;</p><p>What approach have you taken to address these challenges?&nbsp;</p><p>All these issues are identity problems in disguise. We need digital signatures on everything, and data supply chains based on machine-readable data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first requirement was to represent a copyright in a digital form so that it could interact with existing copyright management platforms, effectively turning the copyright itself into a messaging hub that can connect different systems.</p><p>The second requirement was an identity system that can map contractual relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>With these in place, you can build verifiable data “pipes” between different industry databases, creating a routing system to pass data relating to verifiable identities and verifiable legal relationships. That helps keep ownership and administration rights in sync across the supply chain.&nbsp;</p><p>Our first product is designed to move data from the point of origin, such as a recording studio, into various copyright management platforms as quickly and easily as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Where does decentralized identity come in?&nbsp;</p><p>All our products rely on decentralized identity. It’s the key technology to make everything work.&nbsp;</p><p>The music industry uses lots of different types of identifiers. Some are ISO standards and others are proprietary. To get paid, you need to be identified correctly by the supply chain, which relies on getting these different identifiers into downstream databases.&nbsp;</p><p>We verify and bind all these identifiers to a single Decentralized Identifier (DID), enabling you to bring all of your identifiers with you without any manual data entry. In addition, these DIDs are able to make statements about their legal relationships and contractual authorizations, in the form of verifiable credentials, that can be proven to other parts of the supply chain. This enables everyone in the music industry to stay in sync, with a single identity for all their identifiers, industry memberships, and legal relationships.</p><p>With an open-source identity system at the foundation, we make data supply chains between songwriters, publishers, copyright management systems and the recorded music side of the industry, with protocols for sending metadata around the system.&nbsp;</p><p>What lessons have you learned during the development of Switchchord?&nbsp;</p><p>The key is to integrate with what already exists. We see decentralization as extremely powerful but it’s a process, it doesn’t just magically happen.&nbsp;</p><p>How do you babystep people into this new world? If you’re modeling legal relationships or an identity for a copyright, you can get into tricky issues with governance. For example, if you have four writers, each with a different publisher, and you want to represent the copyright with a DID, who acts as the DID controller?</p><p>There are usually two roots of trust in each of these situations: a legal root of trust and a cryptographic root of trust. You have to marry all these worlds. We’re working with the industry on that.&nbsp;</p><p>We use did:web for now as it’s easy. We don’t want to force songwriters to have their own wallet, or to use the same infrastructure to manage their keys. We’re realistic about that.&nbsp;</p><p>What is your vision for the future?&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, we want everyone to be able to bring their own identity. You’ll be able to insert these DIDs directly into legal workflows, with agents controlling the data flows. The copyright itself can have a Decentralized Web Node (DWN) where data can be written to and shared. Any time you see a statement being made about copyright ownership or administration rights, we see an opportunity to present that statement as a verifiable credential. That will be very helpful at getting to the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>Because we see decentralization as a spectrum that can occur over time, we closely follow some of the recent upgrades to did:web that extend things like key management. So DID methods like did:plc, did:webplus, did:tdw, or did:webs, which uses KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure). Until the infrastructure exists to let people BYOI (bring your own identity), we’ve left our DID method selection purposefully modular.</p><p>DIDComm is also great. If you need to contact people, we’d like to enable that within the framework of decentralized identifiers. That goes back to my original frustrations with licensing music into things like movies and the complete lack of communication infrastructure.</p><p>What do you see as the wider significance of these new types of decentralized approaches?</p><p>In my previous careers I’ve worked with other industries such as oil and gas and real estate. The basic questions are the same: how to map legal relationships within a complex supply chain, and how to represent assets as digital versions that are intrinsically tied to the legal system.</p><p>The decentralized identity framework is the future of commercial transactions. It’s the most important thing out there. There’s cool stuff you can do with blockchain and payments, but that’s not everything. You don’t need blockchain for the vast majority of these use cases, just digital signatures and verifiable data.&nbsp;</p><p>What value do you get from DIF membership?&nbsp;</p><p>DIF is a really good rallying point for people who are trying to tackle these kinds of hard problems using decentralized technology. It’s the body I’m most involved in, though I’m also involved with ToIP, W3C, and C2PA. The community is really approachable.&nbsp;</p><p>I was a judge on the DIF hackathon. It was so cool to see people start to use this stuff. I was really happy to be involved.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually it would be great to introduce DIF to some of the music industry standards bodies we participate in, like DDEX and ISNI. I think DIF could play a role as this connective layer across different industries who are all tackling similar problems.&nbsp;</p>

 Welcome to the future of AI: Building a verifiable Internet with&nbsp;ChatDKG <p>We are excited to announce the launch of a pioneering educational course, “<a href="https://alliance-academy.origintrail.io/course/origintrail-ai-builders">ChatDKG for AI Builders</a>” at <a href="https://alliance-academy.origintrail.io/home">Trace Alliance Academy</a>. This course is designed for forward-thinking artificial intelligence (AI) developers, data scientists, and technology innovators who aim to enhance the fidelity and integrity of their AI solutions through the Verifiable Internet for AI powered by the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph&nbsp;(DKG).</p> Why OriginTrail-powered verifiable Internet for&nbsp;AI? <p>Verifiable Internet for AI leverages the synergies of crypto, the Internet, and AI technologies (read more in in the <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf">OriginTrail Whitepaper 3.0</a>). With the novel Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) approach it ensures the provenance, integrity, and verifiability of information utilized by AI systems. It aims to address the challenges posed by misinformation, data ownership, intellectual property rights, and biases inherent in AI technologies, by synergizing neural and symbolic AI approaches with Web3 technologies.</p><p>In an era marked by abundant connectivity and, unfortunately, abundant misinformation, the need for reliable data has never been more crucial. The OriginTrail DKG stands out as an open-source, trusted knowledge infrastructure that leverages blockchain and knowledge graph technologies and is founded on the principles of neutrality, inclusiveness, and usability.</p><p>As Dr. Bob Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet and an Internet pioneer, notes, knowledge graphs are critical in improving the fidelity of artificial intelligence. By leveraging the synergies of knowledge graph and blockchain technologies, OriginTrail DKG enables structuring and connecting data, making it discoverable, verifiable, and ownable in the form of knowledge assets, and, as such, usable for verifiable AI solutions employing the innovative Decentralized Augmented Generation (dRAG) framework.</p><p>By introducing the dRAG framework, the OriginTrail-powered verifiable Internet for AI builds on and expands the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a key paradigm for builders in the AI space looking to feed large language models (LLMs) with specific context and datasets. Besides empowering builders to develop verifiable AI solutions based on trusted knowledge, the dRAG framework also opens up a tremendous opportunity for connecting individual knowledge bases that AI builders are creating and curating for their RAG pipelines, enabling the sharing of knowledge and value between AI systems in a decentralized way.</p><p>Builders can leverage all of these capabilities of the verifiable Internet for AI through <a href="https://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG</a> — a launchpad for trusted AI. Through ChatDKG, they can create predictable AI agents to execute tasks based on trusted data stored in the OriginTrail DKG. Their AI agents benefit from information provenance and data ownership, while the builders enjoy the freedom to choose between multiple AI&nbsp;models.</p><p>Learning to build and leverage a verifiable Internet for AI with ChatDKG, therefore, allows AI pioneers to seize the opportunities analogous to those previously seized by advances in networking that early computer networks such as Ethernet and the Internet brought about. Opportunities that have demonstrated tremendous value generation through network effects famously articulated in Metcalfe’s law.</p> What will you learn in the ChatDKG for AI builders&nbsp;course? <p>The course covers a range of crucial topics and tools essential for building and leveraging verifiable Internet for&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Here is what you can expect to&nbsp;learn:</p>  Verifiable Internet for AI: Understand the foundational concepts and key properties of verifiable Internet for AI like clear information provenance, verifiable information, and incentivization for high-quality knowledge production.  OriginTrail enablement: Explore how OriginTrail DKG facilitates a verifiable Internet for AI, including its structure and operational dynamics.  Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG) framework: Dive into the dRAG framework and learn how it ensures knowledge provenance and aids in the accurate retrieval of information to build verifiable AI applications.  ChatDKG launchpad: With ChatDKG as a launchpad for trusted AI solutions, you can turn your data into Knowledge Assets and create predictable AI agents to execute tasks using your data. Because Knowledge Assets are created on the OriginTrail DKG, your AI agents benefit from information provenance and data ownership and you have the freedom to choose between multiple AI&nbsp;models.  Integration techniques: Learn to integrate different LLMs and other tools with OriginTrail DKG to build robust and verifiable AI solutions. Start with exploring integrations with the Google Gemini, NVIDIA Build ecosystem, and Chainlink Oracle capabilities and expect new tutorials to be added subsequently.   Join us to shape the future of&nbsp;AI <p>This course is a unique opportunity to be at the forefront of creating safer, verifiable, and more reliable AI solutions. Whether you are an AI enthusiast, a seasoned developer, or a curious learner, “ChatDKG for AI builders” offers valuable insights and practical skills to navigate and shape the future of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Enroll today at <a href="https://alliance-academy.origintrail.io">Trace Alliance Academy</a> and join us in pioneering the verifiable Internet for AI.

Once created, the connection enables ongoing secure communication along the channel where the connection was established.</p><p>DIDComm is more than just a mechanism for an individual message, it’s a framework for safe, structured interactions built on decentralization technology. DIDComm connections benefit from the built-in features of DIDComm technology, including message encryption, mutual authentication, and message routing (adapted from <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-is-didcomm-with-pictures/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">this article</a> on the Indicio blog). </p><p>Why DIDComm matters</p>  Trusted communication  <p>Trustworthy communication is foundational for parties on the internet to quickly establish trust. Yet this is still not widely available today, due to a lack of mutual authentication and/or end-to-end encryption in prevalent communication channels.&nbsp;</p><p>APIs enable business applications to securely exchange information in a prescribed format, but they need to be hosted and maintained, requiring infrastructure such as servers or cloud-based storage, as well as technical skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Like APIs, DIDComm can be used to securely pass rich information. Unlike APIs, it’s designed to work with the devices and services people use in their daily lives, like smartphones, tablets and laptops, without the need to host (or download) anything.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, while online services require us to authenticate ourselves, we are rarely given the option to authenticate them. Automatic mutual authentication is a core feature of DIDComm, greatly reducing the risk of falling prey to online scams.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“DIDComm is not anti-business, it’s pro-people, as it works brilliantly with the tech individuals and small businesses already use,” comments Sam Curren, Deputy CTO of Indicio and DIF Steering Committee member.&nbsp;</p>  Unmediated relationships  <p>During the Web2 era, people lost their first class citizenship of the internet as communication was mostly consolidated into social media platform silos. Today, we depend on third parties such as tech companies and social media websites for our digital activities and online presence. As a result, we have little choice but to trust these providers with our information — trust that’s eroded a little further with each new database security breach.&nbsp;</p><p>DIDComm restores agency to individuals and organizations by enabling us to interact and share our information directly with the recipient, without needing to entrust it to centralized services and databases. </p>  Persistent connections&nbsp;  <p>Once established, a DIDComm connection lasts for as long as it is not canceled by either party.</p><p>Currently, when a user visits a website, they use a shared secret to prove who they are. The user’s interactions are generally limited to their browser, meaning the website can no longer communicate with them once they leave the site. A DIDComm channel to the user’s phone becomes an excellent out-of-band channel that persists after the user has left the site. </p>  Flexible use cases and applications&nbsp;  <p>DIDComm is widely used to exchange Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Verifiable Presentations (VPs) — files containing verifiable information derived from one or more VCs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, this is just one of many potential applications of DIDComm, a generalized protocol that enables diverse use cases to benefit from the security and decentralization of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).&nbsp;</p><p>“DIDComm is fully capable of working in this way, but it can enable so much more. Once two parties have used VCs to establish trust, what’s next?” says Sam Curren.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of Verifiable Credential-based services regulate people back into the client / server model. The vision of DIDComm is to enable VCs and all sorts of other interactions that can better our lives on the internet, with browsers, email, video calls and a host of other channels.</p><p>“There’s no need to create a dedicated app in order to leverage DIDComm — developers can enable users to have a trusted relationship through any existing app,” he adds.&nbsp;</p><p>A selection of current use cases</p><p>Following is a selection of some of the many compelling use cases where DIDComm is used.&nbsp;</p>  The Government of British Columbia has been actively involved in the development of decentralized identity technology, including DIDComm Messaging.  The Department of Homeland Security’s Silicon Valley Innovation Program is piloting use of DIDComm to enable trusted interactions and verifiable document exchange for international trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;  DIDComm is used to exchange Verifiable Credentials between issuers, citizens’ National Digital Identity wallets and verifiers in Bhutan.&nbsp;  DIDComm is being used by the IDUnion consortium to enable users of digital identity wallets in the EU to establish secure communication channels with businesses and other users.&nbsp;  DIDComm is being piloted within the travel sector to enable secure exchange of verifiable credentials between IATA (International Air Transport Association) as issuer, travel agencies as holders and airline booking systems as verifiers. It is also used in production to enable seamless presentation of travel credentials and entry to the island of Aruba (Indicio).&nbsp;  DIDComm is used by Entidad to enable farm workers to conduct routine tasks digitally (Entidad.io).  DIDComm is being used to enable users to secure files uploaded to cloud storage (Anonyome).  <p>“This is a technology that not only Americans are using. There’s broad interest, including within the EU and across Asia,” Sam Curren concludes.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

 PolkaBotAI — decentralizing AI with OriginTrail and&nbsp;Polkadot <p>The explosive rise of Artificial Intelligence has sparked the first stages of a new knowledge revolution, comparable historically with the invention of the printing press or the world wide web. Its sudden growth also pointed at some of the threats and shortfalls such as hallucinations, bias, mishandling of intellectual property rights and even potential AI model collapses. Both the opportunities and challenges of this knowledge revolution are showing the need for convergence between Crypto, Internet and AI in a Verifiable Internet for AI proposed by OriginTrail. The Verifiable Internet for AI is effectively addressing AI’s shortfalls by decentralizing knowledge that AI systems use in their solutions. One of the pioneering implementations of the approach is <a href="http://polkabot.ai">Polkabot.AI</a> — a Decentralized AI education hub on Polkadot which will see its full release in the coming months after receiving support from the Polkadot Treasury.</p><p>Spearheading the development of Polkabot.ai is Trace Alliance, a collaborative hub that builds partnerships for creating and leveraging trusted knowledge in the age of AI. The solution is bringing the vision of decentralized AI to reality as it revolutionizes how anyone can interact and learn about the Polkadot ecosystem whether they are a novice getting through the first steps or a seasoned user looking for the latest updates. It achieves that by allowing a wider Polkadot ecosystem to get involved in creating a trusted knowledge base that Polkabot’s AI system will use to construct its responses. Unlike the solutions using solely generative AI, Polkabot is implementing a novel decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG) approach leveraging the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). Instead of Polkabot solely relying on AI to produce a generated response, it uses AI to construct a response using trusted inputs from the DKG populated by the wider Polkadot community. This gives the solution information provenance, respect for data ownership and gives the user a chance to verify each source and its issuer used in the final response. The trusted knowledge Polkabot’s AI systems access will be continuously expanded through community curation and knowledge publishing process called knowledge mining.</p><p>The Polkabot.ai initiative received backing through an <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/617">OpenGov treasury proposal</a>, which was approved on April 23, 2024. As an AI-powered educational platform that tailors learning to each user, PolkaBot.AI represents a significant leap forward in how we interact with Polkadot’s diverse content — whether within the ecosystem or in outward communications — enabling users to access trusted knowledge and get precise responses online.</p><p>Stay updated with the latest developments by following <a href="https://twitter.com/PolkabotAI">PolkaBotAI on&nbsp;X</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/polkabotai-decentralizing-ai-with-origintrail-and-polkadot-48a696a3ddb2">PolkaBotAI — decentralizing AI with OriginTrail and Polkadot</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

This included <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2024/02/unifying-efforts-amplifying-security-shared-signals-interoperability/">Okta</a>, SailPoint, and <a href="https://sharedsignals.guide/#aboutssf">Cisco</a> as well as security startups <a href="https://sgnl.ai/2024/03/biggest-insights-for-identity-professionals-from-the-gartner-iam-summit-in-london/">SGNL</a>, VeriClouds, and Helisoft. &nbsp;The SSF suite of standards underpins Zero-Trust architectures and promises to enable a more secure digital future for everyone.</p>
<p></p>
 The Shared Signals Framework is a Game Changer 
<p>Today’s businesses and their users demand seamless access to services. Often, this involves many concurrent logged in sessions to countless applications – and these sessions can last days or even weeks at a time. Over the course of the session, plenty can change:</p>
 
 A user may change their location 
 A malicious application may be found on a device 
 Users may be granted new privileges (or privileges may have been revoked) 
 
<p>Furthermore, there may be suspicious activity on user accounts that have meaningful implications for other dependent services – like an email address that is used to login to many other online services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The industry has worked hard over the last decade to make single sign-on and federated identity possible. This greatly improved the experience for users and opened many doors to make adoption of SaaS widespread. However, closing doors when needed was more of an afterthought, and hasn’t been fully solved.</p>
<p>While many security solutions now exist, a lot of actionable data sits siloed within individual tools, applications, and dashboards—and it hasn’t historically traveled across service providers. This lack of data sharing constrains the implementation of a Zero Trust security posture.</p>
 Enter SSF: the Solution 
<p>The Shared Signals Framework is an open API built upon a suite of protocols that enable applications and service providers to communicate about security events in order to make dynamic access and authorization decisions. It acts as a signaling layer on a back channel that helps to secure sessions at near real-time. </p>
<p>Back in 2019, Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/re-thinking-federated-identity-with-the-continuous-access-evaluation-protocol">introduced</a> a standards-based approach to continuously evaluating access authorization. The Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (<a href="https://caep.dev/learn">CAEP</a>) created a simpler way for IdPs and services to convey information about a given session. Meanwhile, the OpenID Foundation published the Risk &amp; Incident Sharing and Collaboration (RISC) specification to define a standardized way to communicate account-level risk events. The two initiatives merged within the OpenID Foundation and formed the Shared Signals working group. CAEP and RISC are now profiles on top of the Shared Signals Framework (SSF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now a maturing standard, SSF is an API with a standard format for expressing both account-level and session-level Security Events. It offers seamless, privacy-preserving data-sharing about security events between service providers. Organizations can easily integrate SSF into their security infrastructure and begin sending and receiving Security Events across an ecosystem. This enables organizations to deliver Zero Trust security underpinned by continuous risk assessment efficiently and at scale.</p>
 Security through Collaboration 
<p>In a <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/04/2003313510/-1/-1/0/ESF%20CTR%20IAM%20MFA%20SSO%20CHALLENGES.PDF">recent report by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a>, the authors note that the Shared Signals Framework is an emerging, promising standard gaining traction in the industry. They state “support for and the development of these standards in the enterprise ecosystem will enable a variety of security use cases, ranging from limiting access to managed devices to quickly revoking access when accounts are compromised.” They further recommend broader support for the development and implementation of identity standards as a crucial underpinning of security.</p>
<p>The interoperability session held at the Gartner IAM Summit in London demonstrates, not only the latest in security protocols, but also the industry’s shift towards collaborative security enabled by Open Standards. By sharing these security events across an ecosystem of trusted parties, organizations have more informed Zero Trust implementations and are empowered to mitigate threats more effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Input to the Work Group 
<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">OIDF Shared Signals Work Group</a> is very active and welcomes a wider set of requirements from implementors. For example, implementors at April’s Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) discussed the possibility of using the Shared Signals Framework to communicate lifecycle and security signals between participants (issuers, wallets, etc.) in mobile driving license (mDL) and other digital identity ecosystems. Such an approach would lower the burden on issuing authorities to deploy across wallets and ensure their policies are enforced consistently.</p>

<p></p><p>The functionality of Ceramic and ComposeDB has been recently enhanced by a number of new features that give developers more control over account relation  definitions and data accessibility. More specifically, you can now use the following tools to enhance your applications:</p>  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/relations?ref=blog.ceramic.network#model-to-model">SET account relation</a> - enabling users to enforce a constraint where each user account (or DID) can create only one instance of a model for a specific record of another model.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/schemas?ref=blog.ceramic.network#type-validation-directives">Immutable fields</a> - allow specific data to be prevented from being altered.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/interact-with-data?ref=blog.ceramic.network#removerestore-record-from-index">shouldIndex flag</a> - gives developers an option to manage the data visibility by choosing which fields should be indexed.  <p>In this blog post, we are going to dive into these features in more detail. For a video walkthrough, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2BRQqPI354&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">this video tutorial</a>.</p> SET account relations <p>SET relations in ComposeDB enable developers to define relations between the data models that follow specific constraints and include the user as part of the relationship. SET account relation allows users to enforce the constraint that a specific account (DID) can have only one instance of a model for a specific record of another model.</p><p>The best example to illustrate the “like” feature of a social media application. SET relation can be utilized to make sure that the user (DID) can “like” a specific post only once, while at the same time allowing the user to like multiple posts.</p><p>Let’s have a look at how SET Relations can be used in practice.</p> Ceramic Layer <p>To use SET account relation in Ceramic, you will first have to define a SET <code>accountRelation</code> in your model definition. An example below consists of two simple models - <code>POST_MODEL</code> representing the model definition for social media posts, and <code>LIKE_MODEL</code> representing the model definition for users liking the posts.</p><p>The model definition for <code>POST_MODEL</code> has the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/relations?ref=blog.ceramic.network#types-of-relations">accountRelation</a> as a list, meaning that one user account will be allowed to create multiple posts.</p><p>The model definition for <code>LIKE_MODEL</code> has a <code>SET</code> accountRelation and includes the fields which should be used to create the unique relation - <code>postID</code> and <code>userID</code>. This defines that a specific user can create only one "like" record for a specific post.</p><p></p> <code>const POST_MODEL: ModelDefinition = {
  name: 'Post',
  version: '2.0',
  interface: false,
  implements: [],
  accountRelation: {type: 'list'},
  schema: {
    $schema: '&lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema&gt;',
    type: 'object',
    additionalProperties: false,
    properties: {
      content: {type: 'string', maxLength: 500},
      author: {type: 'string'},
    },
    required: ['content', 'author'],
  },
}

const LIKE_MODEL: ModelDefinition = {
  name: 'Like',
  version: '2.0',
  interface: false,
  implements: [],
  accountRelation: {type: 'set', fields: ['postID', 'userID']},
  schema: {
    $schema: '&lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema&gt;',
    type: 'object',
    additionalProperties: false,
    properties: {
      postID: {type: 'string'},
      userID: {type: 'string'},
    },
    required: ['postID', 'userID'],
  },
}

</code>  ComposeDB Layer <p>Now let's see an example of how you can use SET account relations in ComposeDB. Similar to the example above, the key component that allows you to define the SET account relation for a specific model is the <code>accountRelation</code> scalar alongside the fields that should be used to define the unique relation.</p><p>Take the example below. Here we have two models defined using GraphQL schema definition language. The first model is a model for storing data about a Picture - the source and the dimensions of the image. The model definition Favourite implements the behavior of the user setting a picture as a favorite. Note that this model has an <code>accountRelation</code> defined as SET. The field that is used to define the relation is <code>docID</code>, which refers to the document ID of the picture record.</p> <code>type Picture @createModel(description: "A model for pictures", accountRelation: SINGLE) {
  src: String! @string(maxLength: 150),
  mimeType: String! @string(maxLength: 50),
  width: Int! @int(min:1),
  height: Int! @int(min:1),
  size: Int! @int(min:1),
}

type Favourite @createModel(description: "A set of favourite documents", accountRelation: SET, accountRelationFields: ["docID"]){
  docID: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "Picture")
  doc: Node @relationDocument(property: "docID")
  note: String @string(maxLength: 500)
}

</code> <p>All this means that the user will be able to set only one image as a favorite. They can set different pictures as favorites, but only one record per picture.</p> Immutable Fields <p>Another feature that has been recently added to Ceramic is Immutable Fields. With Immutable Fields, you are able to define which fields (for example, some critical data) should remain unchangeable no matter what and be accessible as read-only data. Any attempt to alter the data set as immutable would result in an error message.</p> Ceramic Layer <p>Defining specific fields as immutable is pretty simple. Below we have an example of a simple model defining a Person - their address, name, and other details. To make these fields immutable you simply need to include them into the <code>immutableFields</code> array. In the example below, fields like <code>address</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>myArray</code>, and <code>myMultipleType</code> will be set as immutable, meaning that once this data is created, it will be unchangeable:</p> <code>const example_model : ModelDefinition = {
  name : 'Person',
  views : {},
  schema : {
    type : 'object',
    $defs : {
      Address : {
        type : 'object',
        title : 'Address',
        required : [ 'street', 'city', 'zipCode' ],
        properties : {
          city : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 5},
          street : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 5},
          zipCode : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 5},
        },
        additionalProperties : false,
      },
    },
    $schema : '&lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema&gt;',
    required : [ 'name', 'address' ],
    properties : {
      name : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 10},
      address : {$ref : '#/$defs/Address'},
      myArray : {type : 'array', maxItems : 3, items : {type : 'integer'}},
      myMultipleType : {oneOf : [ {type : 'integer'}, {type : 'string'} ]},
    },
    additionalProperties : false,
  },
  version : '2.0',
  interface : false,
  relations : {},
  implements : [],
  description : 'Simple person with immutable field',
  accountRelation : {type : 'list'},
  immutableFields : [ 'address', 'name', 'myArray', 'myMultipleType' ],
}</code>  ComposeDB Layer <p>In ComposeDB, a specific field can be set as immutable by adding a directive <code>@immutable</code> to the fields that should remain unchangeable. For example:</p> <code>type ModelWithImmutableProp@createModel(
  accountRelation: SINGLE, 
  description: "Test model with an immutable int property"
  ) {
    uniqueValue: Int @immutable 
    uniqueValue2: Int @immutable
  }
}</code> <p></p><p>Here, we set that fields <code>uniqueValue</code> and <code>uniqueValue2</code> are going to be immutable.</p> shouldIndex Flag <p>Last but not least, let’s talk about the shouldIndex Flag available in Ceramic and ComposeDB. shouldIndex Flag allows you to control the stream indexing by toggling a boolean metadata flag. It enables you to manage data visibility and indexing. By setting the shouldIndex Flag to <code>false</code>, you can disable the stream from being indexed, making it “invisible” for indexing operations. Let’s take a look at how you can use this feature.</p> Ceramic Layer <p>When working with model documents, <code>ModelInstanceDocument</code>, there is a new method called <code>shouldIndex(boolean-value)</code> where false would indicate the stream corresponding to this model should not be indexed, and can be called with value = true to reindex an existing document, e.g.:</p> <code>const document = await ModelInstanceDocument.create(ceramic, CONTENT0, midMetadata)
// Unindex
await document.shouldIndex(false)
</code>  ComposeDB Layer <p>There are two ways to signal that a stream shouldn’t be indexed using ComposeDB. The first one is by including the <code>shouldIndex</code>option in a mutation query, setting it to <code>true</code> if it should be indexed and set to <code>false</code> in the contrary:</p> <code>const runtime = new ComposeRuntime({ ceramic, context, definition: composite.toRuntime() })
await runtime.executeQuery&lt;{
updateProfile: { viewer: { profile: { name: string } } }
}&gt;(`
  mutation UpdateProfile($input: UpdateProfileInput!) {
    updateProfile(input: $input) {
      viewer {
        profile {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
`, { input: { id: profileID, content: {}, options: { shouldIndex: false } } },
)</code> <p>The second way is to use a mutation type called enableIndexing, just like a create or update mutation, it should be paired with the model’s name, sending the streamId and shouldIndex value as part of the input, e.g.:</p> <code>const enableIndexingPostMutation = `mutation EnableIndexingPost($input: EnableIndexingPostInput!) {
  enableIndexingPost(input: $input) {
    document {
      id
    }
  }
}`

await runtime.executeQuery&lt;{ enableIndexingPost: { document: { id: string } } }&gt;
enableIndexingPostMutation, { input: { id, shouldIndex: false } },)
</code> <p>Note that the shouldIndex flag doesn’t delete the data. If set to <code>false</code>, the stream will still exist on the network; however, it will not be indexed and will not be available for data interactions.</p>  Summary <p>The powerful new features in Ceramic and ComposeDB offer users a sophisticated toolkit for data management. From enforcing unique constraints with SET account relations to securing key data with immutable fields and controlling indexing operations using the shouldIndex flag, these features empower developers to build robust and efficient data models for their applications.

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>April brings change in many forms – not just shorter days and falling leaves from our deciduous trees. For business it’s not only a new trading quarter and for some a new financial year, but also the arrival of policy exposure drafts from Government agencies that sometimes stack three, four or five deep. This is hard enough for people or organisations, but for consensus-driven community/industry groups it is quite daunting. I’ve always found it strange that while agencies recognise the value of group responses, additional time for the process is not afforded to them by default. However, it’s great that most agencies do so when approached. You know who you are, so thank you!</p>

<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to reliability, scalability, and performance, the Ceramic core developers have spent a lot of the last year making significant architectural improvements to our Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS). To further advance the goal of a reliable and performant anchoring system, the CAS is moving away from IPFS. This change requires developers to upgrade their Ceramic nodes to v5.3+ by 6th of May, 2024 to avoid potential data loss.</p> About the change <p>The Ceramic team is getting closer to releasing Ceramic’s Recon protocol, intended to dramatically improve the performance, scalability, and reliability of cross-node data synchronization. Utilizing our new custom Recon protocol requires moving away from IPFS pubsub as the mechanism for synchronizing Streams in Ceramic. In preparation for this change, the Ceramic team has built a new direct HTTP-based mechanism for sharing Time Events from the CAS to Ceramic nodes. This means that newer Ceramic nodes no longer have any dependency on IPFS pubsub to learn about Time Events from the CAS. Older Ceramic nodes, however, may still be relying on pubsub to learn about Time Events. Since the correct delivery of Time Events is a requirement to avoid data loss, it is important that all Ceramic nodes on the network be upgraded to at least v5.3 by the 6th of May, 2024, to avoid potential data loss.</p> What does this mean to Ceramic developers? <p>Developers must upgrade their Ceramic nodes to v5.3+ by the 6th of May, 2024. After the 6th of May, the CAS will no longer publish Time Events to IPFS pubsub which means that if you don’t upgrade to v5.3+, your node won’t get notifications about anchor successes, which in turn may result in data loss.</p> How to get support? <p>If you need support regarding the upgrade or choosing the best path forward for your project, please create a post on <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/upgrade-your-ceramic-node-to-v5-3-before-the-6th-of-may/1563?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic developer forum</a> with your project details and the core Ceramic team members will reach out to you.</p>

 An innovative approach to support Bitcoin’s decarbonization by financially rewarding miners who use clean&nbsp;energy <p>One of the most pervasive conversations surrounding blockchain technology is sustainability. Blockchain networks — specifically proof-of-work (PoW) networks like Bitcoin — can consume large amounts of energy. Recent estimates suggest that Bitcoin mining is currently responsible annually for an estimated 85 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (<a href="https://filecache.mediaroom.com/mr5mr_paypal/186970/Green_Mining_Initiative_2024.pdf">as of April 02, 2024</a>). Even with new blockchain consensus mechanisms proliferating rapidly, Bitcoin’s PoW architecture is likely to&nbsp;persist.</p><p>PayPal’s Blockchain Research Group, in a strategic collaboration with Energy Web and DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (“DMG”), presents an opportunity to accelerate the clean energy transition for Bitcoin mining. Just like so many other mechanisms throughout web3, we propose the use of cryptoeconomic incentives to encourage desired behavior: Bitcoin miners using low-carbon energy sources in their mining operations. The full research paper, linked below, outlines an opportunity that not only rewards Bitcoin miners for operating with sustainable energy, but also increases the likelihood of participating entities to route on-chain transactions to these specific&nbsp;miners.</p><p>Read the full paper from the <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.paypal-corp.com%2Fimage%2FGreen_Mining_Initiative_2024.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cwilburns%40paypal.com%7Cd2510d3722fc4939429608dc622c4164%7Cfb00791460204374977e21bac5f3f4c8%7C0%7C0%7C638493189460006661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=eCx%2Fu0p3a6TNK7Y0VpN3x0W%2FMl9e8ZHGEcGnVo3IRGo%3D&amp;reserved=0">PayPal Blockchain Research&nbsp;Group</a>.</p> Incentivizing desired activity with cryptoeconomics <p>Rational miners are driven by cryptoeconomic incentives. They expect to be rewarded with an asset (bitcoin BTC) that is more valuable than the resources they expended to acquire that reward. Much of blockchain’s history has focused on how to get a group of disparate, individual miners to all perform honestly and responsibly in the maintenance of a decentralized ledger.</p><p>Since 2008, Bitcoin has achieved the robust, secure, decentralized, and censorship-resistant maintenance of the ledger with its decentralized miner community. In other words, the fundamental cryptoeconomic structure of Bitcoin and its PoW consensus mechanism has proven successful. Now, the question is whether additional cryptoeconomic incentives can be layered on top of the fundamental PoW mechanism thereby allowing us to encourage more environmentally sustainable actions that we desire as a community.</p><p>PayPal’s Blockchain Research Group’s partner EnergyWeb has developed a clean energy validation platform to permit Bitcoin miners to obtain low-carbon accreditation for their mining operations. These green miners are associated with public keys (which we refer to as green keys), to which rewards can be distributed. On-chain transactions are preferentially routed to green miners by being broadcasted with low transaction fees, but with some BTC reward “locked” in a multisig payout address.

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CEO</p>



<p>Adoption of passkeys has grown rapidly since the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">introduction</a> of sync capabilities less than two years ago, with passkeys being offered by a large and growing proportion of the world’s most visited websites and services. This adoption has come in large part because passkeys offer a true password replacement, helping address the well-known security and user experience weaknesses of knowledge-based authentication like passwords and even other second-factor methods like SMS OTPs.</p>



<p>Market adoption of new technology naturally moves faster than the associated policy and regulatory guidance – which for user authentication still generally reflects the password-centric worldview from when such guidance was developed. This is why we are excited that NIST has taken a lead amongst government agencies and moved quickly to provide <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/giving-nist-digital-identity-guidelines-boost-supplement-incorporating">new supplemental guidance</a> confirming that synced passkeys meet Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2).</p>



<p>This new NIST guidance makes clear that passkeys – like other FIDO authenticators – can support both AAL2 and AAL3 requirements. Synced passkeys can be AAL2 and device-bound passkeys can be AAL3.</p>



<p>Crucially, the NIST supplement also cites that synced passkeys deployed in a manner consistent with the guidelines as being phishing resistant. This has obvious benefits in a world where 87% of hacking-related breaches are caused by weak or stolen passwords and where there has been a 967% rise in credential phishing since 2022.</p>



<p>Passkey adoption to be boosted by the ‘reassurance of assurance’</p>



<p>While the rate of passkey adoption to date has been nothing short of phenomenal, some organizations – particularly those in regulated industries – understandably want to see that key government bodies accept and recommend new technologies like passkeys before supporting them at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have heard this from our partners and constituents across the globe about NIST in particular, whose digital identity guidelines are a global gold standard that are frequently cited by other countries. Today’s supplemental guidance from NIST stands to remove a critical barrier to passkey adoption, which now stands to be further accelerated.</p>



<p>However, there is still work to do. We are working closely with other agencies across the globe to educate them about passkeys and the importance of phishing-resistant authentication, and are encouraging them to update legacy policies, guidelines, and regulations to ultimately allow all organizations, wherever they are, to confidently provide more secure and more convenient authentication to their users and customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building NIST guidance into business best practices</p>



<p>Identity and authentication architects should contemplate NIST’s supplemental guidance as part of their broader digital identity strategy. For example, for every use case where password + OTP was used in the past, a synced passkey deployed in accordance with the new NIST guidance is not only sufficient to meet AAL2 requirements, but also more effective. In the vast majority of deployment scenarios, synced passkeys will provide a significant security and UX improvement over today’s authentication patterns – almost all of which are susceptible to phishing.</p>



<p>If organizations have specific business, regulatory, or other security requirements, they can choose whether to accept a synced passkey as the primary authentication method, a second factor, pair it with a risk engine, or require a device-bound key. Today’s guidance frees architects up from thinking about authentication layers and to instead focus on business requirements and related threat models. And today’s primary threat model of phishing and social engineering can be directly addressed by utilization of passkeys.</p>

<p></p>      MOBI and Gaia-X 4 moveID Web3 Interoperability Initiative           <p>Global Consortia Collaborate to Implement Trusted Self-Sovereign Identities and Verifiable Credentials for Vehicles and Batteries Enabling Circular Economy</p>
          <p>Los Angeles, 22 April 2024 — <a href="https://dlt.mobi/">MOBI</a> and <a href="https://www.gaia-x4futuremobility.de/en/projects/moveid">Gaia-X 4 moveID</a> proudly announce a joint initiative aimed to advance cross-industry interoperability. The initiative focuses on the joint implementation of two pioneering <a href="https://dlt.mobi/standards/">MOBI standards</a> — <a href="https://dlt.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MOBI-VID0002TS2024-Version-2.0.pdf">MOBI Vehicle Identity</a> (VID) and <a href="https://dlt.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2024/4/MOBI-BBC0001TS2024">MOBI Battery Birth Certificate</a> (BBC). More specifically, the initiative centers around linking physical objects — e.g., vehicles and their parts such as batteries — to Web3 digital identities and credentials. The goal is to demonstrate technical interoperability using <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) open-standards to establish a secure Self-Sovereign Data and Identities framework. The collaboration builds upon W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) to manage identities of vehicles and vehicle parts along with their credentials for transactions and claims, foundational for a circular economy.</p>
<p>Gaia-X 4 moveID is set to fundamentally reshape the landscape of mobility and vehicle services, fostering a unified digital ecosystem with <a href="https://www.51nodes.io/en/ssi-self-sovereign-identities/">Self-Sovereign Identities</a> (SSI) for all traffic participants. By crafting the essential technical and economic foundations, moveID is leading the charge toward a decentralized, user-focused mobility service ecosystem, leveraging SSI and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) alongside open-source software and standards. This pioneering ecosystem is designed to support a wide range of applications, including peer-to-peer parking and charging infrastructures, ensuring seamless data availability for smart mobility services, and creating open markets for data providers, AI applications, and mobility infrastructure services.</p>
<p>MOBI, a global nonprofit Web3 consortium, unites public and private sector efforts to create cross-industry interoperability through the creation of standards and building of critical infrastructure for Self-Sovereign Data (SSD), SSI, and verifiable transactions. This infrastructure comprises two federated networks: <a href="https://citopia.global/">Citopia</a>, a decentralized marketplace leveraging VCs, and the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/">Integrated Trust Network </a>(ITN), a DIDs Registry. Citopia and the ITN work together to deliver regulatory-compliant and standardized communication protocols for near-real-time transactions. Implemented in tandem, MOBI VID and MOBI BBC standards form the groundwork for a globally interoperable, open, and connected ecosystem; critical to unlocking a vast array of new applications for a resilient and circular economy.</p>
<p>Within the circular economy value chain, countless public and private stakeholders operate with distinct processes for managing sensitive business and consumer data. In complex, connected networks where trust incurs significant frictional costs, current centralized solutions are unable to provide adequate interoperability and extensibility needed to enable secure data exchange and authentication between stakeholders. The initiative will demonstrate the effectiveness of a Web3-enabled approach rooted in global standards by equipping vehicles and vehicle parts — such as batteries — with trusted self-sovereign identities for verifiable claims and transactions.</p>
<p>The initiative’s future potential is promising, with plans to explore standardized know-your-business (KYB) and know-your-customer (KYC) processes for Phase II. While Phase I focuses on testing technical interoperability, Phase II will involve testing business interoperability, a more complex endeavor that necessitates the creation of shared standards for the onboarding of consumers, businesses, and regulators’ trusted identities and credentials.</p>
<p>“A <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/bad-bots-account-for-73-of-internet-traffic-analysis/#:~:text=Bad%20Bots%20are%20increasing%20dramatically,%2C%20and%20in%2Dproduct%20abuse.">recent study</a> estimates that 73% of all internet traffic comprises bad bots and fraud farm traffic. Generative AI increases these risks dramatically. Today, approximately 20 billion IoT-connected devices lack trusted, verifiable identities and credentials, rendering them unable to securely engage in eCommerce,” said Tram Vo, MOBI CEO and Co-Founder. “With trusted and verifiable identities and claims, IoT devices — such as vehicles and batteries — can act as autonomous economic agents to securely share and authenticate data for every transaction, ensuring regulatory compliance and a higher degree of trust throughout the entire value chain.”</p>
<p>“A holistic, transparent system architecture for the exchange of data in road traffic which meets the new data sovereignty needs is not available today. There are individual companies that already offer services. But these services are tailored to specific applications, vehicles, or customer groups. With its open and EU compliant digital identity architecture, moveID helps to solve that challenge in the future markets,” explains Peter Busch, project manager at Gaia-X 4 moveID consortium lead Bosch.</p>

<p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has established itself as a key paradigm for builders in the AI space looking to feed LLMs with a specific context and datasets. The term RAG was coined by Patrick Lewis in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401">Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks</a> paper, introducing it as a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of GenAI models with facts fetched from external sources. It allows AI solutions to dynamically fetch relevant information before the generation process, enhancing the accuracy of responses by limiting the generation to re-working the retrieved inputs.</p><p>As a growing number of AI systems are driven to utilize RAG, their builders are creating and curating valuable knowledge bases for their RAG pipelines. This opens up a tremendous opportunity for connecting these individual knowledge bases, enabling the sharing of knowledge and value between AI systems in a decentralized way. The opportunity is analogous to those previously seized by advances in networking, with early computer networks such as Ethernet and the Internet brought about, which have demonstrated tremendous value generation through network effects famously articulated in Metcalfe’s law.</p><p>This vision, embodied in the concept of the Verifiable Internet for AI has been articulated in the <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf">recent white paper</a>. It is centered around the paradigm of Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG) as a way to publish and retrieve structured knowledge from multiple sources for AI systems. DRAG focuses on the discoverability of knowledge across knowledge bases, cryptographic verifiability of data, and maintaining ownership of knowledge assets with user-defined access&nbsp;control.</p><p>In this blog post we will showcase how to implement a basic Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation system using Google Gemini and OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph. This approach was recently showcased at the Google + OriginTrail meetup in Google Amsterdam offices, with the full recording available below, including a special appearance from Dr Bob Metcalfe himself who joined <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1780536690379280829">to offer his perspective</a>.</p> Enter Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG) <p>The dRAG framework advances the RAG approach by leveraging the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), organizing knowledge in a network of <a href="https://docs.origintrail.io/decentralized-knowledge-graph/dkg-basic-concepts">Knowledge Assets</a>. Each Knowledge Asset contains graph data and/or vector embeddings, immutability proofs, a Decentralized Identifier (DID), and the ownership NFT. When connected in the permission-less DKG, the following capabilities are&nbsp;enabled:</p>  Knowledge Graphs — structural knowledge in knowledge graphs allows a hybrid of neural and symbolic AI methodologies, enhancing the GenAI models with deterministic inputs.  Ownership — dRAG uses input from Knowledge Assets that have an owner that can manage access to the data contained in the Knowledge Asset.  Verifiability — every piece of knowledge on the DKG has cryptographic proofs published ensuring that no tampering has occurred since it was published.  dRAG framework Application architecture DRAG with Google Gemini and OriginTrail DKG <p>Today we will focus our DRAG example on art assets, using Google Gemini via the Google Vertex platform. We will query data from the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), which contains easily discoverable and verifiable <a href="https://docs.origintrail.io/decentralized-knowledge-graph/dkg-basic-concepts">Knowledge Assets</a>. Each Knowledge Asset contains graph data, immutability proofs, a Decentralized Identifier (DID), and the NFT, which means that you can track the complete history of a Knowledge Asset on the blockchain. Once we retrieve relevant knowledge assets from the DKG, we will feed them to Google Gemini LLM to generate a response.</p> Prerequisites   A GCP/Google Vertex AI&nbsp;account.  Access to an OriginTrail DKG node. Please visit the <a href="https://docs.origintrail.io/decentralized-knowledge-graph/node-setup-instructions">official docs</a> to learn how to run&nbsp;one.

Step 1 — Setting up a Python&nbsp;Project <p>In this step, assuming you have an empty Python project ready, as well as an empty Google Cloud project, you’ll install the necessary packages using pip and set up the credentials for Google&nbsp;Cloud.</p><p>Navigate to your Python project’s environment and run the following command to install the packages:</p> pip install dkg requests google-cloud-aiplatform python-dotenv <p>You’ll then need to authenticate with Google Cloud. Run the following commands in your shell, replacing the value with your project&nbsp;ID:</p> gcloud config set project "your-project-goes-here"<br>gcloud auth application-default login<br>gcloud init <p>You will be required to choose the Google Vertex project you want to use and authenticate that you do have the required permissions in it. The roles you need&nbsp;are:</p>  AI Platform&nbsp;Admin  Vertex AI Administrator  <p>You can now move on to setting up dkg.py, the Python SDK for connecting to the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph.</p> Step 2 — Connecting to the DKG using&nbsp;dkg.py <p>In this step, you’ll set up the environment variables which will hold the necessary keys for connecting to the OriginTrail DKG using dkg.py. Then, you’ll connect to the DKG and print the version of the node you’re connected to.</p><p>Create a.env file and add the following lines:</p> JWT_TOKEN="your_jwt_token"<br>OT_NODE_HOSTNAME="your_ot_node_hostname"<br>PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key" <p>The JWT_TOKEN is used to authenticate to your DKG node, the OT_NODE_HOSTNAME is the API endpoint for the node, and the PRIVATE_KEY represents the private key of a blockchain address that is equipped with TRAC tokens and appropriate gas tokens (NEURO for Neuroweb, xDAI for Gnosis, etc). For more information on how to obtain tokens, refer to the <a href="https://docs.origintrail.io/">documentation</a>.</p><p>Replace the values with your own, which you can find in the configuration file of your OT Node, as well as your wallet’s private key in order to publish knowledge assets. Keep in mind that this file should be kept private as it contains private keys. When you’re done, save and close the&nbsp;file.</p><p>Then, create a Python file and add the following code to connect to the&nbsp;DKG:</p> from dkg import DKG<br>from dkg.providers import BlockchainProvider, NodeHTTPProvider<br>from dotenv import load_dotenv<br>import os<br>import json<br><br>dotenv_path = './.env' # Update if placed somewhere else<br>load_dotenv(dotenv_path)<br>jwt_token = os.getenv('JWT_TOKEN')<br>ot_node_hostname = os.getenv('OT_NODE_HOSTNAME')<br>private_key = os.getenv('PRIVATE_KEY')<br><br>node_provider = NodeHTTPProvider(ot_node_hostname, jwt_token)<br>blockchain_provider = BlockchainProvider("mainnet", "otp:2043", private_key=private_key)<br><br>dkg = DKG(node_provider, blockchain_provider)<br>print(dkg.node.info) <p>Here, you first import the required classes and packages. Then, you load the values from&nbsp;.env and instantiate a NodeHTTPProvider and BlockchainProvider with those values, which you pass into the DKG constructor, creating the dkg object for communicating with the&nbsp;graph.</p><p>If all credentials and values are correct, the output will show you the version that your OT Node is running&nbsp;on:</p> {'version': '6.2.3'} <p>If you see such a version response, that means you have successfully connected to the&nbsp;DKG!</p> Step 3 — Making a retrieval query with&nbsp;Gemini <p>For this dRAG example we will use the Google Gemini LLM to generate a SPARQL query for retrieving relevant knowledge from the DKG. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql12-query/">SPARQL</a> is a standardized query language for knowledge graphs and is very similar to SQL, and you can use it to query connected public data across all the nodes on the DKG. Just like SQL, it has a SELECT and a WHERE clause, so as long as you’re familiar with SQL you should be able to understand the structure of the queries pretty&nbsp;well.</p><p>The data that you’ll be querying is related to artworks, stored in the DKG as Knowledge Assets. Each Knowledge Asset contains information such as name, description, artform, and&nbsp;author.</p><p>First, you’ll need to instruct the Google Gemini LLM on what to&nbsp;do:</p> instruction_message = '''<br>I am working on a project involving artworks and their related data. I have a schema in JSON-LD format that outlines the structure and relationships of the data I am dealing with. Based on this schema, I need to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve specific information from a dataset that follows this schema.<br><br>The schema is focused on artworks and includes various properties such as the artist, description, artform and author among others. My goal with the SPARQL queries is to retrieve data from the graph about the artworks, based on the natural language question that the user posed.<br><br>Here's an example of an artwork the JSON-LD format: {<br>  "@context": "http://schema.org",<br>  "@type": "VisualArtwork",<br>  "@id": "https://origintrail.io/images/otworld/1fc7cb79f299ee4.jpg",<br>  "name": "The Last Supper",<br>  "description": "The Last Supper is an iconic Renaissance fresco by Leonardo Da Vinci.",<br>  "artform": "Painting",<br>  "author": {<br>    "@type": "Person",<br>    "name": "Leonardo da Vinci"<br>  },<br>  "image": "https://origintrail.io/images/otworld/1fc7cb79f299ee4.jpg",<br>  "keywords": [<br>    "The Last Supper",<br>    "Leonardo da Vinci",<br>    "Renaissance",<br>    "fresco",<br>    "religious art"<br>  ],<br>  "publisher": {<br>    "@type": "Person",<br>    "name": "dkgbrka"<br>  }<br>}<br><br>Here's an example of a query to find artworks from publisher "BranaRakic":<br><br>```sparql<br>PREFIX schema: &lt;http://schema.org/&gt;<br><br>SELECT ?artwork ?name ?ual<br><br>WHERE { ?artwork a schema:VisualArtwork ;<br>GRAPH ?g<br>{ ?artwork schema:publisher/schema:name "BranaRakic" ; schema:name ?name . }<br><br>?ual schema:assertion ?g<br>FILTER(CONTAINS(str(?ual), "2043")) }```<br><br>Pay attention to retrieving the UAL, this is a mandatory step of all your queries. After getting the artwork with '?artwork a schema:VisualArtwork ;' you should wrap the next conditions around GRAPH ?g { }, and later use the graph retrieved (g) to get the UAL like in the example above.<br><br>Make sure you ALWAYS retrieve the UAL no matter what the user asks for and filter whether it contains "2043".<br><br>Make sure you ONLY return the SPARQL query without any extra output.<br><br>If you understood the assignment, say 'Yes' and I will proceed with a natural language question which you should convert to a SPARQL query.'''<br><br>instruction_understood_message = "Yes." <p>The instruction_message prompt contains the instructions in natural language. We here provide the model with an expected schema of an artwork object (in <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD notation</a>, based on Schema.org) and an example SPARQL query. We also order it to pay attention to the examples and to return nothing else except the SPARQL query. Feel free to try out other examples of queries on your own and apply filtering on any property, including the identity of the owner of the knowledge asset, it’s publisher, etc</p><p>You can now define the chat history to let Gemini know that the instructions precede the actual&nbsp;prompts:</p> from vertexai.preview.generative_models import GenerativeModel, ChatSession, Content, Part, GenerationConfig<br><br>chat_history = [<br>    Content(parts=[Part.from_text(instruction_message)], role="user"),<br>    Content(parts=[Part.from_text(instruction_understood_message)], role="model"),<br>] <p>Then, instantiate the Gemini model with the chat history. Temperature is set to 0 to reduce the creativity of the LLM model to minimize hallucination:</p> def get_chat_response(chat: ChatSession, prompt: str) -&gt; str:<br>    response = chat.send_message(prompt, generation_config=GenerationConfig(temperature=0))<br>    print(response)<br><br>    return response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text<br><br>def clean_sparql_query(input_string):<br>    if input_string.startswith("```sparql") and input_string.endswith("```"):<br>        cleaned_query = input_string[9:-3].strip()<br>        return cleaned_query<br>    elif input_string.startswith("```") and input_string.endswith("```"):<br>        cleaned_query = input_string[3:-3].strip()<br>    else:<br>        return input_string<br><br>gemini_pro_model = GenerativeModel("gemini-1.0-pro-001", generation_config=GenerationConfig(temperature=0))<br>chat = gemini_pro_model.start_chat(history=chat_history) <p>The clean_sparql_query() function will remove erroneous backticks that may be returned in the&nbsp;result.</p><p>You can now generate SPARQL for searching the DKG using natural language&nbsp;prompts:</p> question = "Provide me with all the artworks published by Google Demo Amsterdam"<br>print(get_chat_response(chat, question))<br><br>query = clean_sparql_query(get_chat_response(chat, question))<br>print(query) <p>Now that you have a query, you can get results from the DKG. An example query that would be returned for the shown prompt looks like&nbsp;this:</p> PREFIX schema: &lt;http://schema.org/&gt;<br><br>SELECT ?artwork ?name ?ual<br>WHERE { ?artwork a schema:VisualArtwork ;<br>GRAPH ?g<br>{ ?artwork schema:publisher/schema:name "Google Demo Amsterdam" ; schema:name ?name . }<br><br>?ual schema:assertion ?g<br>FILTER(CONTAINS(str(?ual), "2043")) }  Step 4 — Retrieval from the DKG with the generated query <p>Querying the DKG is very easy with SPARQL. You only need to specify the query and the <a href="https://docs.origintrail.io/decentralized-knowledge-graph/dkg-sdk/dkg-v6-py-client#querying-knowledge-asset-data-with-sparql">repository to&nbsp;search</a>:</p> query_result = dkg.graph.query(query, "privateCurrent")<br>print(query_result) <p>For completeness we use the privateCurrent repository, as it ensures that the SPARQL query retrieves both the public and private data (if any is present on our node) from Knowledge assets in the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>An example result for the above query, which is looking for artworks published in the DKG by “Google Demo Amsterdam” publisher, looks like&nbsp;this:</p> [{<br> 'artwork': 'https://i.gyazo.com/a59c65f0a0dde03314d6ebcedec008cb.jpg',<br> 'ual': 'did:dkg:otp:2043/0x5cac41237127f94c2d21dae0b14bfefa99880630/4606152',<br> 'name': '"NeuroWeb Logo"'<br>}, {<br> 'artwork': 'https://cryptologos.cc/logos/origintrail-trac-logo.png',<br> 'ual': 'did:dkg:otp:2043/0x5cac41237127f94c2d21dae0b14bfefa99880630/4606876',<br> 'name': '"OriginTrail Logo"'<br>}, {<br> 'artwork': 'https://i.gyazo.com/72b6cd16e0d5b2e131b0311456dcdefc.png',<br> 'ual': 'did:dkg:otp:2043/0x5cac41237127f94c2d21dae0b14bfefa99880630/4608743',<br> 'name': '"Decentralized Hexagon"'<br>}] <p>Each of the entries above is a Knowledge asset with its UAL (Uniform Asset Locator), which presents its unique, dereferencable address in the Decentralized Knowledge Graph. These knowledge assets can be crowdsourced from different individual knowledge bases — effectively querying the DKG is equivalent to executing a search over the different data sources (e.g. RAG backends).</p> Step 5 — Augmented Generation with&nbsp;Gemini <p>We will now feed the extracted knowledge assets to Gemini for answering our questions, providing it with the data about artworks that you’ve queried from the DKG. First, preprocess the data so that Gemini understands it&nbsp;easier:</p> formatted_results = "\n".join([f"- Title: {artwork['name']}, UAL: {artwork['ual']}" for artwork in query_result]) <p>Then, define the prompt which is asking the model to answer artwork-related questions based on the knowledge you passed&nbsp;in:</p> prompt = (<br>  f"I have retrieved the following information from the Decentralized Knowledge Graph based on the query '{query}':\n"<br>  f"{formatted_results}\n\n"<br>  "Imagine you're guiding a tour through a virtual gallery featuring some of the most iconic artworks linked to detailed records in the Decentralized Knowledge Graph.\n"<br>  "As you introduce these artworks to the audience, delve into the stories behind them. What inspired these pieces? How do they reflect the emotions and techniques of the artist?\n"<br>  f"Question: {question}\n"<br>  "Answer:"<br>) <p>Finally, run the prompt and get back the&nbsp;answer:</p> llm_response = gemini_pro_model.generate_content(prompt)<br>print(llm_response) <p>Gemini’s response will look similar to&nbsp;this:</p> candidates {<br>  content {<br>    role: "model"<br>    parts {<br>      text: "**Artwork 1:**\n\n* **Title:** NeuroWeb Logo\n* **UAL:** did:dkg:otp:2043/0x5cac41237127f94c2d21dae0b14bfefa99880630/4606152\n\nThis striking logo captures the essence of NeuroWeb, a cutting-edge platform that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionize the way we interact with the digital world. The vibrant colors and intricate design evoke a sense of innovation and boundless possibilities.\n\n**Artwork 2:**\n\n* **Title:** OriginTrail Logo\n* **UAL:** did:dkg:otp:2043/0x5cac41237127f94c2d21dae0b14bfefa99880630/4606876\n\nOriginTrail\'s logo is a testament to the company\'s mission of bringing transparency and traceability to global supply chains. The interlocking circles symbolize the interconnectedness of the world, while the vibrant green hue represents growth and sustainability.\n\n**Artwork 3:**\n\n* **Title:** Decentralized Hexagon\n* **UAL:** did:dkg:otp:2043/0x5cac41237127f94c2d21dae0b14bfefa99880630/4608743\n\nThis abstract artwork embodies the spirit of decentralization, a fundamental principle of the blockchain revolution.

<p>OASIS and the OASIS Energy Interoperation TC are pleased to announce that Energy Interoperation Common Transactive Services (CTS) v1.0 is now available for public review and comment. This is the third public review of this draft specification.</p>
<p>Common Transactive Services (CTS) permits energy consumers and producers to interact through energy markets by simplifying actor interaction with any market. CTS is a streamlined and simplified profile of the OASIS Energy Interoperation (EI) specification, which describes an information and communication model to coordinate the exchange of energy between any two Parties that consume or supply energy, such as energy suppliers and customers, markets and service providers.</p>

<p>The upcoming Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) V8 update represents a significant advancement in Decentralized AI, building on the achievements of previous innovations brought by V6. The DKG V6 materialized knowledge as a new asset class, with its core AI-ready Knowledge Assets setting the stage for advanced AI applications in the domains of real-world assets (RWAs), decentralized science (DeSci), industry 4.0, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Moving forward, DKG V8 introduces autonomous DKG growth, support for Initial Paranet Offerings (IPOs), and also significantly increases scalability. With this, the Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG) becomes a foundational framework instilled in the DKG V8, significantly advancing a spectrum of large language model (LLM) applications.</p><p>DKG V8 is tailored to drive the next generation of AI through multi-modal content, which is crucial for a diversified and robust AI ecosystem. The integration of dRAG and other decentralized AI functionalities allows for a more verifiable and secure application of AI technologies, addressing challenges such as misinformation, data bias, and model collapse.</p><p>The present roadmap update focuses on DKG V8 catalysts designed to bootstrap and accelerate these advancements, including enhanced knowledge mining processes, integration across multiple blockchain ecosystems, and scalability improvements aimed at supporting an expansive growth of knowledge assets. These initiatives ensure that DKG V8 not only extends its foundational network effects but also reinforces its position as a cornerstone of future AI developments.</p><p>The entire roadmap can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://origintrail.io/ecosystem/roadmap">here</a>.</p> DKG V8 — Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation at&nbsp;scale <p>“…it (LLM) unfortunately hallucinates most when you least want it to hallucinate. When you’re asking the important and difficult questions that’s where it tends to be confidently wrong. So we’re really trying hard to say how do we be as grounded as possible so you can count on the results?” Elon Musk <a href="https://youtu.be/JN3KPFbWCy8">at Lex Fridman&nbsp;podcast</a></p><p>The truth, however, is an elusive concept, especially if attempted to be captured by a single organization/product. A better approach is through connectivity and transparency achieved by leveraging multiple open-source technologies. Turing Award winner Dr. Bob Metcalfe explained this idea,&nbsp;saying,</p><p>“… through connectivity, decentralized knowledge graphs, blockchains and AI are converging — and it’s an important convergence, because it is going to help us with one of the biggest problems we have nowadays, which is the&nbsp;truth.”</p><p>Inspired by Turing award winner Dr Bob Metcalfe and his pioneering work, including “Metcalfe’s Law” and the creation of the first computer network, <a href="https://origintrail.io/blog/initiating-metcalfe-phase-verifiable-web-for-decentralized-ai">the OriginTrail Metcalfe phase</a> aims to leverage network effects through building a web of verifiable Knowledge Assets for decentralized AI.</p><p>The Genesis period of the Metcalfe phase bootstraps the growth of the AI-native V8 Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG V8), driving the verifiability of AI via Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG). Supported by a unique knowledge mining system through the NeuroWeb blockchain, the Genesis period is followed by a “Convergence” period, which further leverages network effects via autonomous knowledge inferencing. The DKG V8 aims to offer a user-centric, trusted knowledge foundation with decentralized AI functionalities, enabling individuals and organizations to participate in a knowledge economy based on neutrality, inclusiveness, and usability — the core principles of the OriginTrail ecosystem.</p> Genesis — The V8 Foundation (Q4 2023–2025) <p>“When you connect things together, the value rises really fast because of all the possible connections that can be made, and the friction that’s reduced, and the collaboration that’s enhanced. So it’s good to bet on connectivity.” — Dr Bob&nbsp;Metcalfe</p><p>The Genesis period leverages connectivity to achieve network effects across the multi-chain OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph to reach a growth target of 1B Knowledge Assets. With the introduction of the community-driven NeuroWeb blockchain supporting DKG growth, Genesis bootstraps the OriginTrail AI-Native version 8 for Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG), introduced to drive a multi-modal ecosystem of AI solutions.

 Specifications 

<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/christophera@lifewithalacrity.com"></a></p>

<p>One of Blockchain Commons biggest priorities is producing interoperable specifications that can be used by principals in the digital asset &amp; identity field to create apps and hardware devices that support independence, privacy, resilience, and openness for users. In Q1, we worked to advance some of our specifications into true standards and also interacted with  standards being developed by the rest of the field.</p>

<p>dCBOR. Our <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/">Internet-Draft for Decentralized CBOR (dCBOR)</a> went through drafts 6, 7, and 8 this quarter. CBOR expert Carten Bormann joined us as a co-author and we continued to make tweaks based on expertise from the CBOR community, most recently revising how we defined leaves (“enclosed CBOR”). dCBOR is crucial for deterministic data formats such as <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a> because it ensures that data is always encoded in the same way, no matter when or where the encoding is done. We have high hopes that dCBOR will be an IETF standard soon.</p>

<p>Hashed Data Elision. We previously authored an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-envelope/">Internet-Draft for Gordian Envelope</a>, which we’ve continued to update in connection with our dCBOR updates. We’ve been getting less traction here, so we supplemented it this quarter with a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-appelcline-hashed-elision/">problem statement on Deterministic Hashed Data Elision Internet-Draft</a>. We also presented on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soI-j6LF4Xg">hashed data elision at IETF 119 Dispatch</a>. Our core premise was that privacy and human-rights needs are not well supported in IETF standards. We believe that hashed data elision (including Gordian Envelope) should be used as an easy method to address those needs. Unfortunately, the IETF hasn’t been strong on privacy concerns. Previous RFCs on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6973">Privacy</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6973">Humans Rights Considerations</a> are mere recommendations with no weight. The bottom line seems to be that unless an existing protocol expresses a desire for privacy standards, there’s no place for hashed data elision in the IETF, though the <a href="https://www.irtf.org/">IRTF</a>, which focuses on “Research” instead of “Engineering”, might be a home for it.</p>


<p><br><br></p>

<p>FROST. FROST, a <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">threshold scheme for Schnorr signatures</a>, originated with a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852">paper</a> in 2020. We’ve been looking forward to its deployment in wallets because of its improved resilience and privacy, plus other advantages such as being able to change thresholds offline. See <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">our FROST page</a> and <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">Layperson’s introduction to Schnorr</a> for some foundational info. In the last six months, we’ve been doing our share to help FROST become a reality. In Q4, we held an <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">implementer’s round table</a> to allow people working on FROST to talk to each other. This quarter, one of those implementers, Jesse Posner, gave a presentation at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCM8dDql6oo">most recent Gordian Developers meeting</a> to help to introduce developers to the powers of Schnorr and FROST. Dare we say: winter is coming? At least, FROST is.</p>

 Specification Docs 

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/images/2024-Q1-Research.jpg">
    
</a></p>

<p>We want to make sure that our specifications are easily adaptable, especially to developers who might want to implement them. As a result, in Q1, we added two new implementation guides and revised how we flag the status of our specifications.</p>

<p>Multipart UR Implementation Guide. Multipart Uniform Resources (MURs) are Blockchain Commons’ biggest success because they allow for the interoperable and efficient creation of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/animated-qrs/">Animated QRs</a>. They’ve been adopted by over a dozen wallets, mainly to pass PSBTs, but they can also pass other large data sets over an <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/airgap/">airgap</a>: we’ve even <a href="https://youtu.be/t-GGZ9FyuT8">tested megabytes!</a> (video link). The pioneering MUR developers based their implementations on our reference code. This quarter we supplemented that with a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-001-multipart-ur.md">MUR Implementation Guide</a> that still focuses on our code, but offers explanations of how MURs work and precise instructions on how to make them work for you. Also see our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRYgEczhekg&amp;list=PLCkrqxOY1Fbp-P1Yv-7gmu75i2QS2Z6vk">January Gordian Developers Meeting</a> for a walk-through of the Implementation Guide.</p>

<p>Request &amp; Response Implementation Guide. The heart of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a> is its ability to elide information while still allowing both certification and verification of that data. That’s the Hashed Data Elision concept that we presented at IETF. However, Gordian Envelope has much more functionality than just hashed data elision, including literal functions, which can be used in a request-response system where one interoperable system asks for something and another provides it. Our request/response docs were spread across a variety of smaller docs such as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-012-envelope-expression.md">Expressions Research doc</a> and our source code, so we conslidated it all into a single <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-004-request.md">Gordian Transport Protocol Implementation Guide</a>, which describes the layers that build up to GTP and how to do requests and responses with Gordian Envelope. As for why you might want to, our new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig-RR.md">Improving Multisigs with Request/Reponse</a> document presents an important case study on the usage of this system: it makes very difficult processes, like creating a multisig with multiple devices, much more accessiblem by reducing decision, research, and human-initiated actions, and thus much more likely to be used.</p>


  <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig-RR.md">
    
  </a>

<p><br></p>

<p>Updated Research List. All of our specifications can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/research/?tab=readme-ov-file#blockchain-commons-research">Research list</a>. Since we have specifications at a variety of levels of development, from pure investigation on our part to implementation by multiple partners, we introduced a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/research/?tab=readme-ov-file#status">status listing</a> that tells developers exactly how mature each specification is.</p>

 Reference Releases 

<p>Specifications are just one step in creating interoperability. We also produce reference apps and libraries that demonstrate how to use our specifications and how to incorporate best practices.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">
  
</a></p>

<p>Gordian SeedTool 1.6. Our top reference app has long been Gordian SeedTool, which demonstrates specifications like <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a>, <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR</a>, and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">URs</a> as well as best practices for safe and resilient digital-asset holding. We’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/releases/tag/releases%2Funiversal%2F1.6">version 1.6</a> for a long time, but it’s now finally out, through GitHub and the Apple App Store. It includes updates to our newest specifications, new best-practices for UIs, and integration of Tezos assets.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases/tag/v1.1.0">
  
</a></p>

<p>Gordian Server 1.1. Our oldest supported reference app is Gordian Server, a Macintosh app that installs, maintains, and run Bitcoin Core. It demonstrates our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/quickconnect/">Quick Connect</a> URI, but more importantly it shows off some of our architectural fundamentals, such as maintaining partitioned services that are separated from each other by a <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/torgap/">TorGap</a>. The new 1.1.0 release of Gordian Server updates for Apple’s native Arm64 (M1+) chips and also works with newer version of Bitcoin Core, up to and including the newly released <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/26.1/">Bitcoin Core 26.1</a>. It also contains a major update that’s been a few years coming that replaces the older RPC password files with the much more secure <code>rpcauth</code> system. (Thanks to Peter Denton for this update and check out his <a href="https://fonta1n3.github.io/FullyNoded/">Fully Noded</a> for a wallet that integrates with Gordian Server!)</p>

<p>Rust Crate Updates. Over recent quarters, we converted our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/libraries/">fundamental crypto libraries</a>  to Rust. We are continuing to keep them updated with our newest specifications and continuing to polish them, such as our recent work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-rust"><code>bc-envelope-rust</code></a> to streamline the API and reduce calls to <code>clone()</code>.</p>

 Constrained Devices Research 

<p>Specifications, reference apps, and reference libraries represent some of our more mature work, but we’re also constantly researching other fields that might improve the management and usage of digital assets and identity online. One of our fields of research recently has been on constrained devices.</p>

<p>JavaCards. Could we hold assets or private keys on NFCs or JavaCards? We’ve discussed the topic at some of our recent Gordian meetings and have a <a href="https://signal.group/#CjQKIHy0JTnKLDSbMmtRXANQt4It6SwWTf65TXO-ZXtfV037EhBAYMV-y5nb7sxiEAJSBVC_">Signal group</a> dedicated to the topic, which you’re welcome to join. We’re hoping to do more with it in 2024.</p>

<p><code>no_std</code> in Rust. Our Rust crate for <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-dcbor-rust"><code>bc-dcbor-rust</code></a> now supports <a href="https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html"><code>no_std</code></a>. The <code>no_std</code> crate attribute allows Rust code to run on embedded systems and other constrained environments that don’t have access to the standard library. This means that dCBOR can now be used to serialize and deserialize data in firmware for IoT devices, microcontrollers, and smart cards. It’s another step forward in our support of constrained environments.</p>

 Provenance Research 

<p>How can you validate the provenance of data or identity? This is a natural expansion of our work with Gordian Envelope, which allows validation of data even when it’s been elided, so it’s been another source of research in the last quarter.</p>

<p><a href="https://c2pa.org/">
  
</a></p>

<p>C2PA. We have joined the <a href="https://c2pa.org/">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA</a>, which is focused on developing standards for certifying the provenance of media content. We’ve talked with them some about Gordian Envelope as a possible tool for this purpose.</p>

<p>Source-Code Provenance. We’ve long been thinking about source-code provenance and the validation of software developers, going back to our support for Joe Andrieu’s <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf">Amira Use Case</a>, which grew out of <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">RWOT5</a>. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/blob/master/_pages/envelope-usecases-software.md">software release use cases</a> discuss many of the issues and how to resolve them with Gordian Envelope. More recently, we’ve been investigating SSH signing, which is now <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-23-ssh-commit-verification-now-supported/">supported at GitHub</a>. We’re working on a doc of best practices and also an SSH tool that will link up the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust"><code>envelope-cli</code></a> with <code>ssh-keygen</code>. We’ve got a working prototype and expect to be able to talk more about the project, and the issues with software-release provenance, next quarter.</p>

 Identity Research 

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9KuIlAg4wg"></a></p>

<p>Work on identity, ultimately stemming from Christopher Allen’s <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>, and continued work on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">VCs</a> at <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, was one of the things that got Blockchain Commons going in the first place. However, our partners and patrons have all been focused more on digital assets, so that’s where most of our work has been concentrated over the last five years. Nonetheless, we keep our foot in the identity pond, particularly for some of our <a href="https://advocacy.blockchaincommons.com/">Advocacy work</a>.</p>

<p>eIDAS Dangers. Late in 2023, Christopher published an article on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/eidas/">“The Dangers of eIDAS”</a>, which is Europe’s new European Digital Identity regulation. Unfortunately, besides having some deeply flawed security models, it also ignores many of the dangers of the past.</p>

<p>Identity Dangers. What are those dangers? That’s the topic of “Foremembrance”, a book that Christopher been working on for a few years that remembers how overidentification led to genocide during World War II. On March 27, which is Foremembrance Day, Christopher gave a talk on the topic on Twitter. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9KuIlAg4wg">YouTube video</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/2024/03-27/foremembrance-presentation.pdf">presentation</a> are both available.</p>

 The Future 

<p>Many of these topics will continue onward, especially our more research-focused projects, such as our look at SSH signing and software provenance. We’re also hoping to do some major work with one or more of our partners to turn many of our specifications into deployed reality.</p>

<p>Our next Gordian Meeting, on May 1st, will have another feature presentation: Dan Gould will talk about <a href="https://payjoin.org/">PayJoin</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, our <a href="https://advocacy.blockchaincommons.com/">advocacy</a> is heating up again as the Wyoming legislature prepares for its meetings in May through September. We are engaged in discussions and early agenda setting with the co-chairs of the Wyoming Select Committe on Blockchain. We are hoping to see topics such as digital attestations from the Secretary of State, best practices for data minimization, and duties of care and best practices for digital identity on the agenda, as well as topics that we’ve pushed in the past such as Wyoming eResidency.</p>

 

<p>Blockchain Commons needs funding to continue its work as an architect for interoperable specifications and a central forum for their discussion because many of our funding sources dried up due to the economic conditions of recent years. If you’re a developer, please consider becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Benefactor</a> to lend your name to our efforts, and if you’re a company, especially one using our work, please consider becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Sustaining Sponsor</a>.  We’re also open to working with partners on special projects that are open-source and aligned with our objectives, or that accelerate the deployment of our specs in your products. If sponsorship or a special project interest you, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a> for more information.</p>

<p>We have further been seeking grants to continue our work. If you have the inside track on any grants that you think would be well-aligned with our work, or just want to make suggestions, again <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a>.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons is literally a commons: we are producing work that we hope is useful for the rest of the community, some of which is now widely deployed. But, the name might have been too apt, because the <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/tragedy-of-the-commons-impact-on-sustainability-issues">Tragedy of the Commons</a> has long said that public resources of this sort are depleted. Help us replenish our resources to make sure the Commons continues!</p>

With a goal of promoting learner-centered teaching, this theory can help students actively build new knowledge by experiencing and integrating new information with their prior knowledge. McKeown explored the concept of visual thinking by delving into the cognitive psychology behind media-based instructions and their role in humanizing digital learning and fostering stronger teacher-student relationships.</p>
<p>Keeping Up with GenAI at Montclair State University<br>
In January 2023, the instructional design team at Montclair State University began ideating a response to the advances in artificial intelligence, which broke headlines in late 2022. Since then, Instructional Technology and Design Services (ITDS) has produced a suite of web-based resources, workshops and training, and consultations to guide University faculty through discovery and exploration of GenAI to be leveraged pedagogically and mitigate misuse. Instructional Designers from Montclair State University, Joseph Yankus and Gina Policastro, shared their experience composing these resources, facilitating small and large-group faculty development, the lessons learned, and the goals for the upcoming year.</p>
<p>Tips for Accessible Digital Media<br>
From presentation slide decks and word-processed documents to PDFs and videos, these resources can be important tools for student learning. Ann Oro, Senior Instructional Designer, Seton Hall University, shared ten easy tips for improving the user experience of a course’s digital documents and discussed the importance of headings, alternative text for images, tables, accessibility checkers, lists, font selection and color, slide titles, saving files as PDFs, reading order, and captioning.</p>
<p>Implementing Dual Rubrics<br>
Simple Rubrics support learning by offering a checklist of expectations, a mechanism for delivering formative/summative evaluation, and a framework for learner reflection and self-remediation. Dual Rubrics go further to also support teaching by offering a means for making an inference about students’ mastery of learning outcomes/competencies. Karen Harris, Senior Instructional Designer and Assessment Specialist, Rutgers University, explored how implementing Dual Rubrics in the Canvas LMS, at the course or program level, can offer a data-driven opportunity to incorporate learning insights that support quality improvement in instructional effectiveness and curricular design.</p>

		 Announcing EdgeCon Spring 2024 Keynote Speaker 
<p>Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others, have had an astonishing impact on the ways we learn, work, and think over the past year.&nbsp; Initially, the concern for many in higher education was how students might use these tools to complete assignments; however, a much more complex and daunting challenge has emerged.&nbsp; A 2023 Goldman Sachs report analyzed tasks versus jobs and concluded that two-thirds of current occupations could be partially automated by AI. This doesn’t mean that two-thirds of jobs will be replaced by AI, though some positions will indeed be lost to the new technology; rather, most of our graduates will soon be asked to collaborate with AI to complete significant portions of their work each week.</p>
<p>Drawing from the presenter’s new book, Teaching with AI: A Practical Guide to a New Era of Human Learning (Johns Hopkins University Press), this keynote will explore the evolving AI landscape and detail the companion challenges and opportunities that are emerging for higher education.&nbsp; While academic integrity and AI detection will be discussed, the core focus of this keynote will be on concrete approaches and strategies higher education can adopt, both within the classroom and across larger curricular structures, to best prepare students for the life that awaits them after graduation.</p>

					 Enhancing Creative Workflows with Generative AI in Adobe Photoshop
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Hall Multipurpose Room A</p>
<p>Explore the transformative impact of Generative AI tools in Adobe Photoshop during this presentation. With two decades of Photoshop experience, I have witnessed numerous advancements from Adobe. What I was originally doing by hand with the primitive lasso tool of Photoshop 7.0 in 2002 (has it been that long?)…can now be done at the click of one button in the latest Creative Suite.</p>
<p>This technology has enhanced both the creative/editing applications within higher education, specifically at Seton Hall University’s Teaching, Learning and Technology Center.</p>
<p>The introduction of Generative AI into Adobe Photoshop has revolutionized our Digital Media Team’s workflow by automating routine tasks such as image corrections and creations. These advancements have not only accelerated our project timelines but also expanded our creative possibilities. This session will provide an in-depth look at how these AI tools have altered our digital workflows, improving efficiency and allowing for the production of more complex and creative outputs.</p>
<p>The presentation will include a live demonstration of key Generative AI features within Adobe Photoshop, illustrating their practical applications which have been instrumental in enhancing our workflow at the TLTC. Attendees will see how AI-enhanced tools are used in real-world scenarios to fix, create, and enhance images, useful for producing high-quality content and marketing materials.</p>
<p>This session is tailored for individuals eager to learn about the potential of AI in enhancing digital media production, specifically within the Adobe Creative Suite. By sharing practical examples and personal insights from years of experience, I aim to inspire attendees to integrate these innovative tools into their own workflows, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in educational technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also just really cool to digitally insert a T-Rex in the middle of the campus green at the press of a button.</p>

					 Integrating Generative AI in Higher Education Learning Environments: Opportunities and Challenges
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room A</p>
<p>This presentation explores the transformative potential of Generative AI (GenAI) in higher education. It will address how GenAI can enhance learning environments, the importance of guiding students in its use, and best practices for its integration into university courses. The presentation will provide a comprehensive overview of the benefits and challenges of incorporating GenAI in higher education.</p>
<p>This presentation will examine the importance of integrating GenAI in modern teaching and learning; enhance of personalized learning, including critical thinking and digital literacy; facilitate the development of innovative teaching methods; improve student engagement and outcomes; provide students with guidance on the use of GenAI ethically and effectively including academic integrity and plagiarism concerns, issues related to transparency, privacy, accessibility, bias, accuracy, security, and regulatory challenges. Our presentation will also discuss the need for students to understand that “AI fluency” is as important as reading, writing, and arithmetic. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has grown tremendously since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022.&nbsp; The daily avalanche of announced improvements to AI platforms increases the need for higher education to address these issues. These trends demand that we develop clear policies and guidelines encouraging student awareness, education, and fluency.</p>

					 Centering Students and Using AI within Meaningful Learning Environments
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room B</p>
<p>“How can AI be used to enhance meaningful learning environments in culturally responsive ways? This session focuses on innovative ways AI tools can be used in the classroom to support meaningful learning experiences and culturally responsive teaching. When designing meaningful learning experiences, teachers use AI to engage students in activities that are active, collaborative, constructive, authentic, and goal directed. Culturally responsive teaching is a student centered approach that enriches how AI tools are used within meaningful learning experiences.This happens when teachers situate students’ lived experiences, frames of reference, and ways of being as resources for learning. Participants will be provided a process for designing meaningful learning experiences, a list of AI tools that promote meaningful engagement, and a culturally responsive framework that advances meaningful technology integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session also addresses educational inequities that surface when learning experiences lack meaningfulness. Teacher centered practices have historically been related to passive technology use, deficit based beliefs about students’ potential, “one size fits all” instruction, and curricular choices that do not account for diversity. As a result, teacher centered approaches have and continue to perpetuate opportunity gaps that disproportionately impact students from historically marginalized communities. To bridge digital divides and fill opportunity gaps, participants will be exposed to the strategies, beliefs, conditions, and tools that support the shift towards student centeredness. “</p>

		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room B</p>
<p>In today’s rapidly evolving educational landscape, harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents unparalleled opportunities to enhance learning experiences in the classroom. AI offers many tools and technologies that can dynamically adapt to students’ learning styles, preferences, and abilities. AI-powered platforms can personalize learning content, recommend supplementary materials, and facilitate real-time feedback. AI fosters an interactive and immersive learning environment that promotes active engagement and participation among students. AI presents a transformative way to enable the curation of unique assessments tailored to individual learning objectives and contexts. AI algorithms can analyze students’ performance data and preferences to design more relevant, relatable, and reflective assessments of real-world scenarios. Assessments developed using AI can incorporate multimedia elements, simulations, and gamification techniques to create interactive and engaging assessment experiences. By embracing AI in assessment design, educators can cultivate critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills while providing students with meaningful feedback and evaluation metrics.</p>

					 Lessons Learned, Actions Unleashed: Unlocking Our Potential
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room C</p>
<p>Let’s reflect on our AI work together. We’ll use a ‘retrospective’ (a project management tool) to candidly discuss what worked well and where we can grow. We’ll focus on solutions we can control and make this a fun, collaborative conversation. We’re looking for real solutions for real people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some questions to get us started…</p>
 
  What were the outcomes of new teaching methods, tools, etc. used? Are there opportunities to refine or expand?&nbsp; 
  Let’s talk silver linings. What wisdom can we extract from decisions that didn’t quite work out? 
  Describe something you crushed! What made it a success? 
  What action items can we identify to address challenges and improve the learning environment for ourselves and our students? 
 
<p>Even if you haven’t made any groundbreaking discoveries, join us anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The session lead will share anonymized responses compiled into a toolkit after the conference.&nbsp;</p>

					 Using AI Avatar Patients to Increase Student Readiness
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room A</p>
<p>Educators need to prepare students to enter the workforce post-graduation. Student’s readiness, which includes perceptions of knowledge, attitude, and ability, manifests in one’s sense of self-efficacy and is influenced by experiences. Additionally, experiences are impacted by context-specific readiness. The Context and Implementation of Complex Interventions framework defines context as a set of characteristics and circumstances that are active, unique, and embedded in the experience. Contextual readiness includes socio-political, community, organization, financial, and learning resources and opportunities that influence the experience. Experiences should promote active learning and simulate real-world scenarios to foster student readiness appropriately. Developing and delivering real-world learning experiences presents many challenges, including contextual characteristics, limited space for hands-on engagement, increased staffing needs, scheduling conflicts, and costs associated with patient actors or experiential opportunities. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) can address these challenges. AI is a computing system that can engage in human-like processes such as learning, synthesizing, self-correction, and data integration for complex processing tasks. AI technologies generate human-like content in response to complex and varied prompts and, blended with VR, immerse the user in simulated environments to make the experience more thoughtful and interactive, allowing for repeated practice to enhance skill development, conservation of resources, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>This panel presentation will describe the pedological design and implementation of AI avatar patients into healthcare interprofessional curricula. It will present data on financial impact and students’ perceived readiness post-AI-VR experiences and offer recommendations for future integration into the broader educational curriculum.&nbsp;</p>

 Why do we need a Trust Spanning Protocol? 



<p>No one would question that the Internet has completely transformed the global information economy. It has become indispensable for connectivity and reliable content delivery. But as it has grown, so have the threats against it and the vexing challenges in deciding what to trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, AI is pushing those concerns into overdrive. A <a href="https://www.cyberark.com/press/cyberark-establishes-artificial-intelligence-center-of-excellence-to-combat-attacker-innovation-with-identity-security-innovation/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20recently%2Dpublished,cited%20as%20the%20%231%20concern.">2023 study by CyberArk</a> found that 93% of security professionals expect AI-enabled threats to affect their organization in 2023—with AI-powered malware cited as the #1 concern. No less an industry luminary than Marc Andreessen recently said that <a href="https://twitter.com/tsarnick/status/1775332956447674633">the war against detecting AI fakes was unwinnable</a>—our only solution was to find a way to “invert the problem” by being able to prove <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">content authenticity</a>.</p>



<p>Why, after 30 years of steadily compounding security issues, does industry not yet have a fix? Why, with technologies like <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en">DNSSEC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>, and industry bodies like <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA/Browser_Forum">CA/Browser Forum</a>, do we still have daily headlines about data breaches, ransomware attacks, identity theft, and malware infestations? Why, with the explosive interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence">generative AI</a>, are many experts more worried about it being used to attack us than to protect us?</p>



<p>The answer is the reason the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation</a> was founded four years ago. In short, authenticity, confidentiality, and metadata privacy features were never built into the core fabric of the Internet. To solve the root of this problem and not the symptoms, we need a next-generation trust layer on top of the existing Internet.</p>



<p>The heart of this layer is a protocol that is to digital trust what the Internet Protocol (IP) is to digital data. That is the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification">ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol</a> (TSP).</p>



 Where can I get a high-level overview of TSP? 



<p>First, start with <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">this blog post</a> we published in January 2023 when we launched the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force (TSPTF). It explains the overall purpose of the TSP and where it fits in the ToIP stack.</p>



<p>Second, read the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/08/31/mid-year-progress-report-on-the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">Mid-Year Progress Report on the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol</a>, published last August 2023 to summarize the seven pillars of the TSP design. With the exception of some terminology evolution, these seven pillars have not changed as we worked through multiple stages of Working Drafts over the past seven months.</p>



<p>Today we are pleased to announce the release of the first <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification">Implementers Draft</a>.</p>



 What does the Implementers Draft cover? 



<p>This table summarizes the 10 major sections of the specification:</p>



Verifiable Identifiers (VIDs)VIDs are the first of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/08/31/mid-year-progress-report-on-the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">seven pillars</a> — cryptographically-verifiable identifiers that provide technical trust in the TSP. Covers: why they are necessary, how they provide access to public keys and ToIP endpoint addresses, how they are verified, and how keys can be rotated.MessagesTSP is a message-based asynchronous communication protocol. Covers: message envelopes, payloads (confidential, non-confidential, headers), signatures, relationship setup and out-of-band introductions.Nested MessagesTSP messages can be nested one or two layers to achieve metadata privacy. Covers: payload nesting, nested relationship VIDs.Messages Routed through IntermediariesTSP messages can be routed through intermediaries for several reasons, e.g., asynchronous delivery, reliability, and performance. However the primary focus is metadata privacy protection. Covers: message routing, direct neighbor relationships, endpoint-to-endpoint (“tunneled”) messages, private VIDs, single intermediaries, two-or-more intermediaries.Multi-Recipient CommunicationsTSP messages may be sent to multiple recipients. Covers: multi-recipient lists and anycast intermediaries.Control Payload FieldsTSP messages can be multi-purpose, so rather than dedicated control messages, the specification defines control payloads. Covers: relationship formation (parallel, nested, third-party introductions), relationship events (key updates, routing info, and relationship cancellation).Cryptographic AlgorithmsThe authenticity and confidentiality properties of TSP relies on public/private key cryptography. Covers: public key signatures, public key authenticated encryption, encryption and decryption primitives, Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE), Libsodium Sealed Box.Serialization and EncodingTSP uses <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">Composable Event Streaming Representation</a> (CESR) for message serialization and encoding. CESR supports popular data encoding formats including JSON, CBOR, MsgPak, and others. Covers: envelope encoding, payload encoding (non-confidential, confidential, nested), signature encoding.TransportsTSP’s authenticity, confidentiality and metadata privacy properties are designed to be independent of the choice of transport protocol. Covers: transport service interface, transport mechanism examples.Appendix A: <br>Test Vectors(Still being completed) Test vectors for common use cases. Covers: direct mode messages, direct mode nested messages, routed model messages.



 How does TSP differ from other trust protocols? 



<p>Proposing a fundamental new Internet-scale protocol for digital trust is an ambitious undertaking. Why did the ToIP Foundation take this path? Let’s start by looking at related efforts in this area.</p>



 Related protocols 



<p>This table summaries other well-known protocols that address various facets of digital trust:</p>



OpenID Connect (OIDC)An authentication layer on top of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth#OAuth_2.0">OAuth 2.0</a> authorization framework specified by the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> as a RESTful HTTP API using JSON as a data format. Supports basic user profile information access; optionalYeahHighlight features include encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID providers, and session management.OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VC)A family of protocols from the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">OpenID Connect Working Group</a> built on top of OIDC for issuance (OID4VCI) and presentation (OID4VP) of verifiable digital credentials, plus a wallet-based user authentication protocol (SIOP).DIDCommSpecified by the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm Working Group</a> of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF), DIDComm is a peer-to-peer secure messaging protocol in which the endpoints are specified by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> (decentralized identifiers).TLS (Transport Layer Security)A cryptographic protocol from the IETF best known for enabling secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> browser connections; also widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP. Provides security, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity through the use of X.509 digital certificates.MLS (Message Layer Security)Specified by the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/">MLS Working Group</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">IETF</a>, MLS is a security layer for end-to-end encrypted messages in arbitrarily sized groups. Its security properties include message confidentiality, message integrity and authentication, membership authentication, asynchronicity, forward secrecy, post-compromise security, and scalability.RCS (Rich Communications Services)A text-based mobile messaging protocol specified by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSMA">GSMA</a> to replace SMS messages with a richer feature set including in-call multimedia. RCS does not natively support end-to-end encryption; Google added it using the Signal Protocol in their own implementation. Apple has said it will support RCS once GSMA standardizes end-to-end encryption.Signal ProtocolA non-federated cryptographic protocol specified by the <a href="https://signalfoundation.org/">Signal Foundation</a> that provides end-to-end encryption for voice and instant messaging conversations. The protocol combines the Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and a triple Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (3-DH) handshake.Matrix ProtocolAn application layer communication protocol for federated real-time communication specified by the <a href="https://matrix.org/about/">Matrix Foundation</a>, it provides HTTP APIs for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers. It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC to facilitate browser-to-browser applications.DNSSECA suite of extension specifications from the IETF for securing data exchanged in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System</a> (DNS). The protocol provides cryptographic authentication of data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality.ISO/IEC 14443-4:2018A half-duplex block transmission protocol designed for a contactless environment, it defines the activation and deactivation sequence of the protocol. It is intended for use with other parts of ISO/IEC 14443 and is applicable to proximity cards or objects of Type A and Type B.



 Related cryptographic data structures 



<p>Protocols are not the only ingredient required for Internet-scale digital trust. This table summarizes some of the standard cryptographic data structures that have been developed:</p>



X.509 digital certificatesAn ITU standard defining the format of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate">public key certificates</a> used in many Internet protocols, including TLS, as well as&nbsp; digital signatures. An X.509 certificate binds an identity (a hostname, or an organization, or an individual) to a public key using a digital signature. A certificate is signed either by a certificate authority (CA) or self-signed. X.509 also defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">certificate revocation lists</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification_path_validation_algorithm">certification path validation algorithm</a>.Encrypted/signed PDF filesPortable Document Format, originally developed by Adobe, became an ISO standard in 2008. A PDF file may be encrypted; PDF 2.0 defines 256-bit AES encryption as the standard but also defines how third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF. ISO 32000-2 defines how PDF files may be digitally signed for secure authentication.Verifiable digital credentialsWith the emergence of digital wallets, multiple formats for cryptographically verifiable digital credentials have been developed, including the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a>; <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#!iso:std:69084:en">ISO mDL/mDOC</a>; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">IETF SD-JWTs</a>; <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/anoncreds">Hyperledger AnonCreds</a>; and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2024/03/21/authentic-chained-data-containers-acdc-task-force-announces-public-review/">ToIP Authentic Chained Data Container (ACDC)</a>.C2PA content credentialsThe <a href="https://c2pa.org/">C2PA</a> standards define a model for binding cryptographically verifiable provenance information to digital media content together with a model for evaluating the trustworthiness of that information.



 How and why is TSP different? 



<p>As the sections above show, many thousands of person-hours have been invested in protocols and cryptographic data structures designed to address the Internet’s multitude of security, confidentiality, and privacy issues. So why have the members of the ToIP Foundation spent four years developing TSP?</p>



<p>The fundamental reasons are summarized in this table:</p>



Minimalist design as a spanning layer for higher-layer protocolsThe single most important design goal for the TSP—and the biggest differentiator from the protocols listed above (with the possible exception of DIDComm)—is the critical role of a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050415042854/http://www.csd.uch.gr/~hy490-05/lectures/Clark_interoperation.htm">spanning layer</a> in a protocol stack. The reasons it must be “as simple as possible but no simpler” is explained at length in Principle #3 of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a>. The TSP does not include many of the features of the protocols above precisely because it is designed so those features can be provided in higher-level protocols. The benefit is that all of those higher-level protocols can be much simpler and more future-proof because they automatically inherit all the technical trust features achieved at the TSP layer.Decentralized peer-to-peer architectureBy building on HTTP and RESTful APIs, the OpenID family of protocols are inherently Web-centric (client/server). The TSP does not make that architectural assumption. Like the IP protocol, it can work between any two peers across any kind of network or software architecture.VIDs &amp; DIDsLike DIDComm, all TSP endpoints use cryptographically verifiable identifiers (VIDs) such as those defined by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) specification. VIDs not only support full decentralization, but they provide portability and cryptographic agility for lifetime relationship management.Public Key Authenticated Encryption and SignatureTSP combines modern Public Key Authenticated Encryption and Public Key Signature to provide the strongest protection against both key compromise impersonation and sender impersonation. This is achieved by using either IETF RFC9180 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9180/">HPKE</a> (Hypbrid Public Key Encryption) defined Auth Mode primitives, or HPKE Base Mode or Libsodium Sealed Box primitives enhanced with an <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2001/079">ESSR</a> (Encrypt Sender Sign Receiver) pattern.Payload agilityTSP uses the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR</a> text-binary dual encoding format that supports composability of both text and binary primitives—including JSON, CBOR, and MsgPak—in the same message.Cryptographic agilityAnother key feature of <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR</a> is code tables for all types of cryptographic primitives. For example, it can transmit any of the cryptographic data structures listed above. This enables TSP ecosystems to standardize on precise signature and encryption algorithms yet still evolve them over time.Transport independenceAlthough the name “Trust Over IP” suggests a dependence on the TCP/IP stack for transport, in fact a core design goal of TSP is to provide end-to-end authenticity, confidentiality, and metadata privacy entirely independent of the underlying transport protocol.



 What implementation projects have been announced? 



<p>In parallel with the first Implementers Draft, at next week’s <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> #38 we will be announcing the first two TSP implementation projects—each one led by one of the primary authors of the TSP specification:</p>



 
 A Rust open source implementation led by co-author Wenjing Chu is being proposed as a new project at the <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">OpenWallet Foundation</a> (OWF) sponsored by OWF Premier members Futurewei, Gen, and Accenture. 



 A Python open source implementation is being developed by co-author Sam Smith and his colleagues at the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust">Web of Trust GitHub community project</a>. 
 



<p>If you are interested in contributing to either of these projects or starting your own, we welcome your collaboration. Just contact us via the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/contact/">ToIP contact page</a> or <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-tsp-specification?tab=readme-ov-file">GitHub</a>.</p>



 What kind of feedback are we seeking on this draft? 



<p>As always, we would like feedback on the usual questions about any new protocol specification:</p>



 
 Is the spec clear and understandable?&nbsp; 



 Are there any missing sections?&nbsp; 



 Are there places where more examples or illustrations would be helpful? 



 Are there specific test vectors you would like to see added? 
 



<p>In addition, we are specifically looking for your feedback in the following areas:</p>



 
 How would you imagine using the TSP? How can it enhance what you already have? What types of trust task protocols are you most interested in layering over the TSP? 



 Does the TSP provide the baseline capabilities you need to support your planned trust task protocol(s)? 



 Does the TSP enable your solution to be more decentralized? 



 What types of VIDs do you plan to implement support for? 



 What types of transport protocols do you intend to bind to? 



 What cryptographic algorithms do you want or need to use? 



 What problems are you trying to solve in your tech stack that are not addressed by existing solutions and can or should be addressed by TSP? 



 Are there other protocols in development that we are not aware of that may conflict or complement TSP? 
 



 How can you provide feedback?

		<p>Featuring a keynote speech titled Re-imagining American Innovation: Bridging the Gap to Unlock America’s Stranded Brilliance presented by Dr. James Martin, NSF Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering Committee member, and Vice Chancellor for STEM Research and Innovation at the University of Pittsburgh, the two-day summit will also include domain researchers and CI professionals at smaller institutions about the successes and challenges related to leveraging&nbsp; local, regional, and national resources for projects, and learn about funding resources and partnership opportunities, as well as regional and national communities. In addition to representation from small schools, HBCU’s, and MSI’s, we are grateful to National Science Foundation ( NSF) colleagues who will also be in attendance, providing opportunities for interaction between attendees and the NSF program directors. The full Summit agenda is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sQif6TaQmB8wEFprHWWn26NU_fFXK6Xd/edit">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Elaborates Dr. Barr von Oehsen, Director of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, “Scientific discoveries have always been driven by advances in instruments of observation. Today, experimental tools are more advanced and more costly to construct and maintain, and the interpretation and simulation of data is more dependent on the use of cutting-edge computing resources, services, and knowledge. Consequently, many academic institutions lack access to these facilities. Our aim is to democratize access to research instruments, and the ERN Summit provides a platform for devising strategies to achieve this objective.”</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>The role of audit and assurance in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting is crucial for enhancing the credibility, reliability, and accuracy of ESG disclosures. As investors, regulators, and other stakeholders increasingly rely on ESG information to make informed decisions, the demand for high-quality, verifiable ESG data grows. </p>



<p>Auditors and assurance providers play a key role in verifying ESG reports, ensuring they meet established standards and guidelines, and providing stakeholders with confidence in the reported information. Integrating OASIS Open standards such as UBL, OData, ebXML or STIX/TAXII can significantly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of audit and assurance processes in ESG reporting.</p>



<p>Enhanced Data Exchange and Interoperability</p>



 
 UBL and ebXML facilitate standardized electronic business document exchange. 



 AS4, a standard for secure document exchange, ensures that ESG data and reports transmitted between entities are done securely and reliably. 
 



<p>Secure Data Access and Authentication</p>



 
 SAML can be used to secure access to ESG reporting and data systems, ensuring that only authorized individuals and entities can view or modify sensitive ESG data. 
 



<p>Standardization of Codes and Terms</p>



 
 Genericode and Code List Representation standards help in defining and using standardized codes and terminologies in ESG reporting. 
 



<p>Efficient Data Querying and Management</p>



 
 OData facilitates simple and standardized queries for data, including ESG information stored across different databases and systems. 



 BDXR standards can be used to discover and connect with ESG reporting entities and systems, streamlining the process of obtaining necessary reports and data for auditing purposes. 
 



<p>Cybersecurity and Information Sharing</p>



 
 STIX/TAXII standards for cybersecurity threat information sharing can help auditors and assurance providers stay informed about potential cyber threats to ESG reporting systems. 
 



<p>Blockchain-based Verification</p>



 
 The Baseline Protocol offers a framework for establishing verifiable, consistent records of ESG data and transactions on public blockchains without exposing sensitive information. 
 



<p>By leveraging these OASIS Open standards, auditors and assurance providers can ensure that ESG reporting is not only consistent and reliable but also meets the high standards of data security, integrity, and accessibility demanded by stakeholders. These technologies enable more efficient audit processes, reduce the risk of errors, and increase the overall trust in ESG reporting.</p>

 Unpacking the foundations of Verifiable Credentials Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Did you ever consider that looking at a tree only reveals half of its story? Much like a tree’s roots, which stretch as a wide and deep as its branches, the visible aspect of technology barely scratches the&nbsp;surface.</p><p>In this post, we’re going to look at the the underpinnings to technologies such as microcredentials, particularly those based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a>. We share two crucial insights: the importance of understanding the ideological foundations we use, and how seemingly-similar technologies can differ significantly beneath the&nbsp;surface.</p><p>The old adage ‘technology is not neutral’ may be true but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Technologies achieve widespread use do so because of rich, complex backgrounds.</p> The Role of Standards <p>In our everyday lives, we interact seamlessly with technologies that allow us to pay for a coffee with our smartphones using Apple or Google Wallet. We scan QR codes to find a link to websites. We use digital boarding&nbsp;passes.</p><p>All of these examples are built upon standards — agreements on how technologies should operate, which are developed collaboratively by individuals and organisations. These people either have a deep interest in the topic, work on it professionally, or&nbsp;both!</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>The aim behind Verifiable Credentials is for them to be integrated into society to the same extent as payment methods and boarding passes. The difference is that they help us prove our identity and our achievements.</p><p>As we highlighted in a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-to-find-the-right-mental-models-for-your-audience-c68097a7f0ed">previous post</a>, standards ensure consistency:</p><blockquote>A standard can be just the usual way of doing something. A standard can also be a reference to make sure things can be understood in the same way, no matter where or what is referencing the standard.</blockquote><blockquote>For example a kilogram in France is the same as kilogram in Germany, and a kilogram of feathers weighs the same as a kilogram of bricks. The kilogram is the standard, but where it is applied or what it is used for is up to whoever is using&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>This consistency is of critical importance for credentials to remain valid and recognised, long outliving the organisations that initially adopt&nbsp;them.</p> Community Interaction <p>Standards don’t spontaneously arrive, but are rather the fruits of community interaction. This collaboration happens in formal settings such as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> or the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>, or through more informal groups, as was the case with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>. The latter laid the foundation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a> apps such as <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>.</p><p>The drive to develop Verifiable Credentials has been fueled by various needs, from decentralising proof of identity, to enable the issuing of trusted documents such as passports and degrees at scale. There are also those who looking to Verifiable Credentials to finally deliver on the dream of <a href="https://badges.community">Open Recognition</a>.</p><p>Diversity within communities developing standards is vital. Without a range of perspectives, there is the risk that the resulting technologies serve only a fraction of its potential users. When we’re talking about proof of identity and achievement, this is an important consideration.</p> The Importance of&nbsp;Ideology <p>Ideologies shape the vision and goals of a community, and encompass systems of beliefs and values. In the context of Verifiable Credentials, ‘Open’ (or openness) is a key ideology. This is not just in the sense of Open Source code but in terms of broader principles around transparency, inclusivity, adapability, collaboration, and the importance of community.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Going back to the tree analogy at the top of this post, a microcredential issued using the Verifiable Credentials standard is deeply rooted in community consensus and open standards. This contrasts with other credentialing methods which may use proprietary technologies, lack adherence to standards, and ignore the broader ethos of openness.</p><p>So, to embrace the full potential of technologies built on Verifiable Credentials, we need to dig beneath the surface. We must understand and appreciate that complex supporting structure of community, standards, and ideology. This understanding helps guide us towards contributing to a more just, inclusive, secure, and adaptable digital ecosystem.</p> Conclusion <p>In examining the foundations of Verifiable Credentials, we uncover a complex blend of ideology, standards, and community collaboration. These core elements go beyond mere technical specifications, and help define the technology’s purpose and potential.</p><p>As we explore the underlying principles of technologies such as microcredentials, it’s evident that our interaction with these technologies should extend deeper than their surface-level function. Embracing values of openness, inclusivity, and collective effort, we can contribute to a digital landscape that safeguards individual rights while promoting innovation and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>We all need to dig deeper, explore the ideological foundations, understand the importance of standards, and actively participate in the communities that build our world. <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact">Reach out to us</a> and let’s work together to help steer towards a future where digital credentials support and empower everyone.</p><p><a href="https://dajbelshaw.medium.com/">Doug Belshaw</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@LauraHilliger">Laura Hilliger</a> collaborated closely, as they tend to do, on this&nbsp;post.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">Examining the Roots</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>by Andy Parsons, Sr. Director, Content Authenticity Initiative </p><p>Faced with a newly chaotic media landscape made up of generative AI and other heavily manipulated content, alongside authentic real photographs, video, and audio it is becoming increasingly difficult to know what to trust. &nbsp;</p><p>Understanding the origins of digital media and if/how it was manipulated - as well as sharing that information with the consumer is now possible through Content Credentials, the global open technical specification developed by the&nbsp;<a href="https://c2pa.org/">C2PA</a>, a consortium of over 100 companies working together within the Linux Foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>Implementation of Content Credentials is on the rise with in-product support released and soon-to-be released by Adobe, Open&nbsp;AI, Meta, Google, Sony, Leica, Microsoft, Truepic, and many other companies. &nbsp;</p><p>As this technology becomes increasingly commonplace, we’re seeing criticism circulating that relying solely on Content Credentials’ secure metadata, or solely on invisible watermarking to label generative AI content, may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of misinformation.&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, we agree.&nbsp;</p><p>That is why, since its founding in 2021, the C2PA has been hard at work creating a robust and secure open standard in Content Credentials. While the standard focuses on a new kind of “signed” metadata, it also specifies measures to make the metadata durable,&nbsp;or able to persist in the face of screenshots and rebroadcast attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>Content Credentials are sometimes confusingly described as a type of watermark, but watermarking has a specific meaning in this context and is only one piece in the three-pronged approach represented by Content Credentials. Let’s clarify all of this.&nbsp;</p><p>The promise of Content Credentials is that they can combine secure metadata, undetectable watermarks, and content fingerprinting to offer the most comprehensive solution available for expressing content provenance for audio, video, and images.</p>  <p>Secure metadata: This is verifiable information about how content was made that is baked into the content itself, in a way that cannot be altered without leaving evidence of alteration. A Content Credential can tell us about the provenance of any media or composite. It can tell us whether a video, image, or sound file was created with AI or captured in the real world with a device like a camera or audio recorder. Because Content Credentials are designed to be chained together, they can indicate how content may have been altered, what content was combined to produce the final content, and even what device or software was involved in each stage of production. The various provenance bits can be combined in ways that preserve privacy and enable creators, fact checkers, and information consumers to decide what’s trustworthy, what’s not, and what may be satirical or purely creative. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Watermarking: This term is often used in a generic way to refer to data that is permanently attached to content and hard or impossible to remove. For our purposes here, I specifically refer to watermarking as a kind of hidden information that is not detectable by humans. It embeds a small amount of information in content that can be decoded using a watermark detector. State-of-the-art watermarks can be impervious to alterations such as the cropping or rotating of images or the addition of noise to video and audio. Importantly, the strength of a watermark is that it can survive rebroadcasting efforts like screenshotting, pictures of pictures, or re-recording of media, which effectively remove secure metadata.</p>  <p>Fingerprinting: This is a way to create a unique code based on pixels, frames, or audio waveforms that can be computed and matched against other instances of the same content, even if there has been some degree of alteration. Think of the way your favorite music-matching service works, locating a specific song from an audio sample you provide. The fingerprint can be stored separately from the content as part of the Content Credential. When someone encounters the content, the fingerprint can be re-computed on the fly and matched against a database of Content Credentials and its associated stored fingerprints. The advantage of this technique is it does not require the embedding of any information in the media itself. It is immune to information removal because there is no information to remove.</p>  <p>So, we have three techniques that can be used to inform consumers about how media came to be. If each of these techniques were robust enough to ensure the availability of rich provenance no matter where the content goes, we would have a versatile set of measures, each of which could be applied where optimal and as appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, none of these techniques is durable enough in isolation to be effective on its own. Consider:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Even if Content Credentials metadata cannot be tampered with without detection, metadata of any kind can be removed deliberately or accidentally.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Watermarking is limited by the amount data that can be encoded without visibly or audibly degrading the content, and even then, watermarks can be removed or spoofed.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Fingerprint retrieval is fuzzy. Matches cannot be made with perfect certainty, meaning that while useful as a perceptual check, they are not exact enough to ensure that a fingerprint matches stored provenance with full confidence.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But combined into a single approach, the three form a unified solution that is robust and secure enough to ensure that reliable provenance information is available no matter where a piece of content goes. This single, harmonized approach is the essence of durable Content Credentials. &nbsp;</p><p>Here is a deeper dive into how C2PA metadata, watermarks, and fingerprints are bound to the content to achieve permanent, immutable provenance. The thoughtful combination of these techniques&nbsp;leverages the strengths of each to mitigate the shortcomings of the others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Let’s look at how this works. First, the content is watermarked using a mode-specific technique purpose-built for audio, video, or images. Since a watermark can only contain an extremely limited amount of data, it is important to make the most of the bandwidth it affords. We therefore encode a short identifier and an indicator of where the C2PA manifest, or the signed metadata, can be retrieved. This could be a Content Credentials cloud host or a distributed ledger/blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, we compute a fingerprint of the media, essentially another short numerical descriptor. The descriptor represents a perceptual key that can be used later to match the content to its Content Credentials, albeit in an inexact way as described earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, the identifier in the watermark and the fingerprint are added to the Content Credential, which already includes data pertaining to the origin of the content and the ingredients and tools that were used to make it. Now we digitally sign the entire package, so that it is uniquely connected to this content and tamper evident. And finally, the Content Credential is injected into the content and stored remotely. And just like that, in a few milliseconds, we have created a durable Content Credential.&nbsp;</p><p>When a consumer of this media wishes to check the provenance, the process is reversed. If the provenance and content are intact, we need only verify the signed manifest and display the data. However, if the metadata has been removed, we make use of durability as follows:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Decode the watermark, retrieving the identifier it stores.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Use the identifier to look up the stored Content Credential on the appropriate Content Credentials cloud or distributed ledger.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Check that the manifest and the content match by using the fingerprint to verify that there is a perceptual match, and the watermark has not been spoofed or incorrectly decoded.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Verify the cryptographic integrity of the manifest and its provenance data.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Again, within a few milliseconds we can fetch and verify information about how this content was made, even if the metadata was removed maliciously or accidentally.&nbsp;</p><p>This approach to durability is not appropriate for every use case. For example, if a photojournalist wishes to focus primarily on privacy, they may not wish to store anything related to their photos and videos on any server or blockchain. Instead, they would ensure that the chain of custody between the camera and the publisher is carefully maintained so that provenance is kept connected and intact, but not stored remotely.&nbsp;</p><p>However, in many cases, durable Content Credentials provide an essential balance between performance and permanence. And although technology providers are just beginning to implement the durability approach now, this idea is nothing new. The C2PA specification has always had the facility under its affordances for “soft bindings.” &nbsp;</p><p>We recognize that although Content Credentials are an important part of the ultimate solution to help address the problem of deepfakes, they are not a silver bullet. For the Content Credentials solution to work, we need it everywhere — across devices and platforms — and we need to invest in education so people can be on the lookout for Content Credentials, feeling empowered to interpret the trust signals of provenance while maintaining a healthy skepticism toward what they see and hear online. &nbsp;</p><p>Malicious parties will always find novel ways to exploit technology like generative AI for deceptive purposes. Content Credentials can be a crucial tool for good actors to prove the authenticity of their content, providing consumers with a verifiable means to differentiate fact from fiction. &nbsp;</p><p>As the adoption of Content Credentials increases and availability grows quickly across news, social media, and creative outlets, durable Content Credentials will become as expected as secure connections in web browsers. Content without provenance will become the exception, provenance with privacy preservation will be a norm, and durability will ensure that everyone has the fundamental right to understand what content is and how it was made.&nbsp;</p>

 Using a design workshop to jump start your&nbsp;CoP <p>At the end of the month, we’ll be gathering a number of community-based organisations, interns and faculty in an online design workshop to jump start a Community of Practice together with Cal State University and <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>. This community, supported through the <a href="https://www.internetforall.gov/funding-recipients/california-state-university-dominguez-hills">Internet for All</a> programme, will provide an online space for those promoting access and training in digital technologies in the CSUDH community.</p><p>We know that building a thriving and supportive online community requires some deliberate efforts. In this blog post, we explore the idea of a “minimum viable community of practice” (MVCoP). Once again, we dive into our Architecture of Participation (AoP) framework, and discuss running design workshops to empower individuals to co-design their community.</p>header in the budding CoP on <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a> What is a&nbsp;MVCoP? cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Let’s start with the value of a Community of Practice. Communities of Practice (CoPs) are important for people to network, share knowledge, and learn from each other. They play a vital role in supporting lifelong learning and helping people level up throughout their careers. By connecting with like-minded peers who share similar interests and expertise, people can tap into a vast pool of collective wisdom and experience. Through active participation in discussions, collaborative projects, and sharing of best practices, community members continuously learn from each other, gaining new insights, perspectives, and opportunities.</p><p>Communities of practice not only foster professional growth but also create opportunities for personal development, encouraging individuals to stay curious, adapt to change, and embrace a lifelong learning mindset. We develop real relationships in these communities, and we learn about belonging and acceptance.</p><p>But before all of that, we have to design spaces that are supportive, interesting, engaging and inclusive. This takes intention. A MVCoP is a community set up to encourage organic and collaborative growth and belonging.</p> The Bare Minimum&nbsp;AoP AoP from&nbsp;WAO<p>We’ve written extensively about one of the tools, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop">the Architecture of Participation (AoP)</a>, that we use to help us build thoughtful, inclusive and empowering communities. Briefly, because we really have written about this all over the internet, the AoP is 8 steps to help people cover all their bases when thinking about volunteering, contributing and facilitating communities.</p><p>But what are the key steps for building a Minimum Viable Community of Practice? Well, we think that the most important to start with&nbsp;are:</p>  Ways of working openly — Even at the very beginning, people need to see what’s happening within the community and how they can get involved. The open principles of transparency, inclusivity, collaboration and adaptability underpin community. Does the project have secret areas, or is everything out in the&nbsp;open?  Backchannels and watercoolers — We need places to share memes, make jokes and chat about the weather. These evolve organically, but including them in your MVCoP design suggests understanding of the social dynamics within groups of people. Are there ‘social’ spaces for members of the project to interact over and above those focused on project&nbsp;aims?  Celebration of milestones — Building a space where people belong means thinking of them as, you know, people. We need motivation and recognition. Does the MVCoP recognise the efforts and input of the community members?   Empowering Co-Design cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Running a design workshop is a great way to empower co-design within a community. By bringing together individuals with diverse perspectives, skills, and experiences, a design workshop creates a collaborative space where participants can actively contribute to shaping the emerging community.</p><p>We facilitate such workshops to encourage open dialogue, brainstorming, and hands-on activities. We aim to help people feel a sense of ownership and engagement because, after all, this is a community. This inclusive approach means that we can work together on the community’s mission, invitations and onboarding. Our intentions and goals are co-created and reflect the collective aspirations and needs of the&nbsp;group.</p><p>By actively involving community members in the design process, a design workshop not only strengthens the sense of belonging but also ensures that the resulting community is truly representative of its members’ interests, resulting in a more vibrant and sustainable community of practice.</p> Conclusion <p>Building a minimum viable community of practice (MVCoP) is a dynamic and iterative process that requires active involvement from community members. Empowering people to co-design their community will help that community evolve. The journey to a thriving community starts with small steps, but with dedication and collective effort, it can lead to a flourishing network of professionals supporting each other’s growth and&nbsp;success.</p><p>Need some community help?

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">Trust Registry Task Force</a> (TRTF) at the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation has released a new version of its ToIP <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-trust-registry-protocol/">Trust Registry Protocol Specification</a> as an Implementers Draft. This draft aims to elicit open public feedback from implementers of any type of online registry service or client software. Instructions for providing feedback are at the end of this post.</p>



 Background 



<p>The TRTF was established in the summer of 2021 in response to the sudden demand for cross-jurisdiction verification of digital health credentials during the COVID crisis. In the fall of 2021, the TRTF produced a preliminary version of the ToIP Trust Registry Protocol Specification to begin public experimentation with the protocol.</p>



<p>As the adoption of digital wallets and verifiable digital credentials has grown, so has the challenge for relying parties to verify the authorized issuers of those credentials. The same applies to credential holders, who need to judge which relying parties they can safely trust with their credential data.</p>



<p>These digital trust decisions are complicated—in both directions. To make them more accessible, participants need trusted sources of information. That’s the job of trust registries. A trust registry is a system of record that contains answers to questions that help drive trust decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of these systems of record already exist. For example, almost any legal jurisdiction has a method of registering and licensing all types of businesses and professionals (CPAs, lawyers, doctors, professional engineers, etc.) And there are hundreds of registries of accredited institutions—universities, hospitals, insurance companies, nursing homes, etc.</p>



<p>New trust registries are also emerging for new online communities, including social networks, blockchains, and peer-to-peer networks. The challenge is that the methods of accessing the information across all these different registries are wildly inconsistent—if such information is available online.</p>



 The Trust Registry Protocol V2.0 



<p>The ToIP Trust Registry Protocol (TRP) V2.0 aims to solve this problem by providing a simple and consistent way to discover who is authorized to do what within a specific digital trust ecosystem. In short, it enables parties to ask programmatically:</p>



<p>Does entity X hold authorization Y under ecosystem governance framework Z?</p>



<p>In addition to that core query type, the TRP V2 also supports queries to:</p>



 
 Assist integrators in retrieving information critical to interacting with the trust registry (e.g. get a list of supported authorizations, namespaces, or resources). 



 Assert the relationships of the queried trust registry with other trust registries, allowing the development of a registry-of-registries capability. 
 



<p>Currently, in this Implementers Draft stage, this question can be asked via a RESTful (OpenAPI Specification 3.1.0) protocol query. Future versions of the TRP may support other underlying protocol specifications (e.g. DIDComm co-protocols, ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is important to note that in V2, the TRP does not manage information inside the trust registry (i.e., the system-of-record). It is a read-only query protocol. Create, update, or delete operations may be specified in future protocol versions if demand exists.</p>



<p>To be clear, a trust registry does not create trust in itself. Your decision to trust the outputs from a trust registry is entirely yours. However, the information provided by trust registries is often required to build trust—especially between parties with no previous relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A trust registry does not create authority. The authority of a trust registry is an outcome of governance.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;– <a href="mailto:Jacques.Latour@cira.ca">Jacques Latour</a>, CTO, CIRA.ca (.ca top-level domain registry)</p>



 How to Provide Feedback

<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Issuer-Requirements-Guide-V0.01-2024-01-30.pdf"></a>



<p>ToIP invites the public to comment on their newly released document, Issuers Requirements Guide for Governance Framework of Verifiable Credentials.</p>



<p>The mission of the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation is to define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that combines cryptographic assurance at the machine layer with human accountability at the business, legal, and social layers.&nbsp; Part of that mission is to define generally accepted requirements for standard roles that play a critical part in accountability for digital trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Governance Stack Working Group has completed a new deliverable, the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Issuer-Requirements-Guide-V0.01-2024-01-30.pdf">Issuer Requirements Guide for Governance Frameworks of Verifiable Credentials (PDF)</a> and is soliciting public comment using our <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/public-review-process/">public review process</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/PDF-Deliverable-Review/issues/new/choose">this GitHub link</a>. While many schemes in the US, UK and Canada have focused on elements of identity credential issuance and verification, this is the first effort to define standard requirements for issuers of verifiable credential to ensure that their processes are transparent and consistent and meet the needs of relying parties and ecosystem governing bodies.</p>



<p>Verifiable credential ecosystems require both technical trust and human trust where the core requirements for the corresponding issuance processes are captured in this newly released document being circulated for public review and comment. Verifiable credentials are a type of digital representation of claims or attributes about a subject, which can be an individual, organization, or thing. These credentials are tamper-evident, cryptographically secure, and can be verified by relying parties without the need for a central authority.</p>



<p>The Governance requirements of an issuer in a verifiable credential ecosystem can be summarized as follows:</p>



 
 Issuance of Credentials: The issuer is responsible for creating and issuing verifiable credentials to subjects based on certain claims or attributes. These credentials are digitally signed by the issuer using their private key, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the information. 



 Trust and Reputation: The issuer’s reputation and trustworthiness are crucial in the verifiable credential ecosystem. Relying parties (such as service providers or verifiers) rely on the credentials being issued by reputable and trusted issuers. The credibility of the issuer is established through various mechanisms, such as being a well-known organization, being part of a recognized authority, or holding themselves accountable to the requirements of a governing authority. 



 Validation of Claims: Before issuing credentials, the issuer does its due diligence to validate the claims made in the credential. This validation process ensures that the information presented in the credential is accurate and can be trusted by relying parties. 



 Verification of Issuer and Holder: Issued credentials that contain links to the issuer and/or holder should be engineered so they can be cryptographically verified. 



 Privacy Considerations: Issuers need to handle personal data responsibly and in compliance with privacy regulations. They should only collect and use the minimum necessary data required to issue the credentials and should obtain explicit consent from the subjects. 



 Revocation and Expiry: For credentials that require expiration or revocation, issuers must have mechanisms in place to revoke or expire credentials if the claims become invalid or if the credentials are compromised. This is essential to maintain the trustworthiness of the digital trust ecosystem. 



 Interoperability: Issuers need to follow standardized formats and protocols to ensure that the issued credentials are interoperable and can be easily understood and verified by different relying parties. 



 Auditability and Accountability: Issuers should keep records of issued credentials for audit purposes, &nbsp;lifecycle maintenance, including updates to claims, or re-issuance for any reason and revocation. This enables traceability and accountability in case of disputes or issues with the credentials.

<p>On a scale of one to ten, how do you rate the&nbsp; <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=customer+experience+management">Customer Experience Management</a> (CEM) business?</p>
<p>I give it a zero.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that every service comes with a bonus survey—one you answer on a phone or fill out on a Web page? And that every one of those surveys is about rating the poor soul you spoke to or chatted with, rather than the company’s own crappy CEM system?</p>
<p>I always say yes to the question “Was your problem resolved?” because I know the human I spoke to will be punished if I say no.&nbsp; Saying yes to that question complies with <a href="https://twitter.com/dmarti/status/1702719520790479099">Don Marti</a>‘s tweeted advice: “5 stars for everyone always—never betray a human to the machines.”</p>
<p>The main problem with CEM is that it’s all about getting service to scale across populations by faking interest in human contact. You can see it all through McKinsey’s <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/the-ceo-guide-to-customer-experience">The CEO Guide to Customer Experience</a>. The customer is always on a “journey” through which a company has “touchpoints.”</p>
<p>Oh please.</p>
<p><a href="https://iuhealth.org/">IU Health</a>, my primary provider of health services, does a good job on the whole, but one downside is the phone survey that follows up seemingly every interaction I have with a doctor or an assistant of some kind. The survey is always from a robot that says it “will only take a few minutes.” I haven’t counted, but I am sure some of those surveys last longer than the interaction I had with the human who provided the service: an annoyingly looooong touchpoint.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2007/06/13/why-surveys-suck/">Why Surveys Suck</a> here, way back in 2007. In it, I wrote,&nbsp; “One way we can gauge the success of VRM is by watching the number of surveys decline.”</p>
<p>Makes me cringe a bit, but I think it’s still true.</p>

  <p>by Hany Farid, UC Berkeley Professor, CAI Advisor</p><p>News and trends shaping our understanding of generative AI technology and its applications.</p><p>Generative AI embodies a class of techniques for creating audio, image, or video content that mimics the human content creation process. Starting in 2018 and continuing through today, techniques to generate highly realistic content have continued their impressive trajectory. In this post, I will discuss some recent breakthroughs in a category of techniques that generate images, audio, and video from a simple text prompt.</p><p>Faces</p><p>A common computational technique for synthesizing images involves the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN). <a href="https://nvlabs.github.io/stylegan3/">StyleGAN</a> is, for example, one of the earliest successful systems for generating realistic human faces. When tasked with generating a face, the generator starts by laying down a random array of pixels and feeding this first guess to the discriminator. If the discriminator, equipped with a large database of real faces, can distinguish the generated image from the real faces, the discriminator provides this feedback to the generator. The generator then updates its initial guess and feeds this update to the discriminator in a second round. This process continues with the generator and discriminator competing in an adversarial game until an equilibrium is reached when the generator produces an image that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real faces.</p><p>Below are representative examples of GAN-generated faces. In two earlier posts, I discussed <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">how photorealistic these faces are</a> and some techniques for <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">distinguishing real from GAN-generated faces</a>.</p>

  <p>Text-to-image</p><p>Although they produce highly realistic results, GANs do not afford much control over the appearance or surroundings of the synthesized face. By comparison, text-to-image (or diffusion-based) synthesis affords more rendering control. Models are trained on billions of images that are&nbsp; accompanied by descriptive captions, and each training image is progressively corrupted until only visual noise remains. The model then learns to denoise each image by reversing this corruption. This model can then be conditioned to generate an image that is semantically consistent with a text prompt like “Pope Francis in a white Balenciaga coat.”&nbsp;</p><p>From Adobe Firefly to OpenAI's DALL-E, Midjourney to Stable Diffusion, text-to-image generation is capable of generating highly photorealistic images with increasingly fewer obvious visual artifacts (like hands with too many or too few fingers).</p>





















  
  



<blockquote><p>You probably saw on the news A.I. generations of Pope Francis wearing a white cozy jacket. I’d love to see your generations inspired by it. <br><br>Here’s a prompt by the original creator Guerrero Art (Pablo Xavier): <br><br>Catholic Pope Francis wearing Balenciaga puffy jacket in drill rap… <a href="https://t.co/5WA2UTYG7b">pic.twitter.com/5WA2UTYG7b</a></p>— Kris Kashtanova (@icreatelife) <a href="https://twitter.com/icreatelife/status/1640583106255003650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2023</a></blockquote>



  <p>Text-to-audio</p><p>In 2019, researchers were able to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/the-weekly/deepfake-joe-rogan.html">clone the voice of Joe Rogan</a> from eight hours of voice recordings. Today, from only one minute of audio, anyone can clone any voice. What is most striking about this advance is that unlike the Rogan example, in which a model was trained to generate only Rogan's voice, today's zero-shot, multi-speaker text-to-speech can clone a voice not seen during training. Also striking is the easy access to these voice-cloning technologies through low-cost commercial or free open-source services. Once a voice is cloned, text-to-audio systems can convert any text input into a highly compelling audio clip that is difficult to distinguish from an authentic audio clip. Such fake clips are being used for everything from <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/january-2024-this-month-in-generative-ai-frauds-and-scams">scams and fraud</a> to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/fake-joe-biden-robocall-tells-new-hampshire-democrats-not-vote-tuesday-rcna134984">election interference</a>.</p><p>Text-to-video</p><p>A year ago, text-to-video systems tasked with creating short video clips from a text prompt like "Pope Francis walking in Times Square wearing a white Balanciaga coat" or "Will Smith eating spaghetti'' yielded <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/will-smith-parodies-viral-ai-generated-video-by-actually-eating-spaghetti/">videos of which nightmares are made</a>. A typical video consists of 24 to 30 still images per second. Generating many realistic still images, however, is not enough to create a coherent video. These earlier systems struggled to create temporally coherent and physically plausible videos in which the inter-frame motion was convincing.&nbsp;</p><p>However, just this month researchers from <a href="https://imagen.research.google/video/">Google</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/sora">OpenAI</a> released a sneak peek into their latest efforts. While not perfect, the resulting videos are stunning in their realism and temporal consistency. One of the major breakthroughs in this work is the ability to generalize existing text-conditional image models to train on entire video sequences in which the characteristics of a full space-time video sequence can be learned.</p><p>In the same way that text-to-image models extend the range of what is possible as compared to GANs, these text-to-video models extend the ability to create realistic videos beyond existing <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2315678121">lip-sync and face-swap</a> models that are designed specifically to manipulate a video of a person talking.</p><p>Text-to-audio-to-video</p><p>Researchers from the Alibaba Group released an impressive new tool for generating a video of a person talking or singing. Unlike earlier lip-sync models, this technique requires only a single image as input, and the image is then fully animated to be consistent with any audio track. The results are remarkable, including a video of <a href="https://humanaigc.github.io/emote-portrait-alive/">Mona Lisa reading a Shakespearean sonnet</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>When paired with text-to-audio, this technology can generate, from a single image, a video of a person saying (or singing) anything the creator wishes.</p><p>Looking ahead</p><p>I've come to learn not to make bold predictions about when and what will come next in the space of generative AI. I am, however, comfortable predicting that full-blown text-to-movie (combined audio and video) will soon be here, allowing for the generation of video clips from text such as: "A video of a couple walking down a busy New York City street with background traffic sounds as they sing Frank Sinatra's New York, New York." While there is much to be excited about on the content creation and creativity side, legitimate concerns persist and need to be addressed.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are clear and compelling positive use cases of generative AI, we are already seeing troubling examples in the form of people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/01/tech-bros-nonconsensual-sexual-deepfakes-videos-porn-law-taylor-swift">creating non-consensual sexual imagery</a>, <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/january-2024-this-month-in-generative-ai-frauds-and-scams">scams and frauds</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/fake-joe-biden-robocall-tells-new-hampshire-democrats-not-vote-tuesday-rcna134984">disinformation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Some generative AI systems have been accused of infringing on the rights of creators whose content has been ingested into large training data sets. As we move forward, we need to find an equitable way to compensate creators and to give them the ability to opt in to or out of being part of training future generative AI models.</p><p>Relatedly, last summer saw a historic strike in Hollywood by writers and performers. A particularly contentious issue centered around <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2315678121">the use (or not) of AI</a> and how workers would be protected. The writers’ settlement requires that AI-generated material cannot be used to undermine a writer’s credit, and its use must be disclosed to writers. Protections for performers include that studios give fair compensation to performers for the use of digital replicas, and for the labor unions and studios to meet twice a year to assess developments and implications of generative AI. This latter agreement is particularly important given the pace of progress in this space.</p>

<p>We are witnessing an important convergence of technologies of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet, and Crypto promising to reshape our digital landscape. This convergence enables a Verifiable Internet for AI, unlocking AI solutions without hallucinations and ensuring full respect for data ownership and Intellectual Property&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Trillion-dollar industries spanning from tokenization of real world assets (RWAs), supply chains, metaverse, construction, life sciences and healthcare, among others, require AI systems to use verifiable information to deliver the multiplication effect to the benefit of users in a safe&nbsp;manner.</p><p>A modular and collaborative approach is necessary to achieve that. OriginTrail and Chainlink are working together to bring the vision of the Verifiable Internet for AI to reality, allowing the transformation of real world asset (RWA) tokenization.</p><p>OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) is already powering trusted AI solutions across multiple RWA industries, such as protecting whisky authenticity with trusted AI and DNA tagging techniques, helping Swiss Federal Railways increase rail travel safety with cross-border rail operator connectivity, increasing EU build environment sustainability with trusted AI, supporting representatives of over 40% of US imports to safeguard data on security audits for overseas factories, etc.</p><p>Expanding the OriginTrail decentralized AI framework with Chainlink oracle capability further extends the strength of RWA solutions by giving them access to real-time real world data. By synergizing the power of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph and Chainlink Data feeds, the capabilities of AI to retrieve verifiable information on RWAs can be applied across any&nbsp;domain.</p> Integrating Chainlink Data Feeds with OriginTrail DKG to create a Trusted AI&nbsp;solution <p>Each knowledge resource on the OriginTrail DKG is created as a Knowledge Asset consisting of knowledge content, cryptographic proofs for immutability, and NFT for ownership. For our example, we will create a Knowledge Asset for Chainlink Data Feed. Once created, Knowledge Assets can be used in <a href="https://x.com/DrevZiga/status/1755625036486988174?s=20">decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG) AI applications</a>. For our showcase, we will use an existing DOT/USD data feed in an AI application using the DKG and dRAG in 3 simple&nbsp;steps.</p> Step 1: Create a Knowledge Asset on the&nbsp;DKG <p>Since we wish to retrieve DOT/USD data feed in our AI application, we need to start by creating a Knowledge Asset linking to the data feed which we will use to retrieve the live&nbsp;price:</p> {<br>  "@context": "http://schema.org/",<br>  "@type": "ChainlinkDataFeed",<br>  "@id": "https://data.chain.link/feeds/moonbeam/mainnet/dot-usd",<br>  "description": "Chainlink DataFeed providing real-time DOT/USD price information on the Moonbeam network.",<br>  "baseAsset": {<br>    "@id": "urn:chainlink:base-asset:dot",<br>    "@type": "ChainlinkBaseAsset",<br>    "name": "DOT_CR",<br>    "description": "Polkadot cryptocurrency (DOT)"<br>  },<br>  "quoteAsset": {<br>    "@id": "urn:chainlink:quote-asset:usd",<br>    "@type": "ChainlinkQuoteAsset",<br>    "name": "USD_FX",<br>    "description": "United States Dollar (USD)"<br>  },<br>  "productType": "price",<br>  "productSubType": "reference",<br>  "productName": "DOT/USD-RefPrice-DF-Moonbeam-001",<br>  "contractAddress": "0x1466b4bD0C4B6B8e1164991909961e0EE6a66d8c",<br>  "network": "moonbeam",<br>  "rpcProvider": "https://rpc.api.moonbeam.network"<br>} <p>The main entities represented in the Knowledge Asset&nbsp;are:</p>  Base asset (DOT_CR) — the first asset listed in a trading pair, this is the asset that is being&nbsp;priced  Quote asset (USD_FX) — the second asset listed in a trading pair, this is the currency the base asset is priced&nbsp;in  <p>Necessary fields for DOT/USD value retrieval:</p>  Contract address (contractAddress)  RPC Provider (rpcProvider)  <p>This Knowledge Asset content can also be visualized in the DKG Explorer:</p> Step 2: Use AI to query the&nbsp;DKG <p>From your application, you can use an LLM to generate DKG queries based on the user prompts. This step can have different degrees of complexity, so for this showcase, we will use the selected LLM&nbsp;to:</p>  Determine if the prompt is relevant for the data feed (in our case, is the user’s question mentioning DOT&nbsp;token)  Use the LLM to structure a SPARQL query for the OriginTrail DKG to retrieve the Data Feed&nbsp;URL  <p>An example of an engineered prompt to determine the relevance of the question for DOT&nbsp;token:</p> Given that the chatbot primarily responds to inquiries about the Polkadot ecosystem, including its native token, DOT, analyze the provided question to determine if there's a direct or indirect reference to DOT. Provide a response indicating 'true' if the question pertains to the value, function, or any aspect of DOT, within the context of discussions related to Polkadot ecosystem, either explicitly or implicitly, and 'false' if it does not. Question: {question} <p>If the above prompt determines the question as relevant (returns true), we proceed with a SPARQL query for the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph. There are various techniques to obtain a SPARQL query with the LLM you’re using. In our case, we seek ChainlinkDataFeed type entities (Knowledge Assets) with DOT as the BaseAsset. The query result in our case will be a single Knowledge Asset containing information about the DOT/USD value. The SPARQL query should look like&nbsp;this:</p> PREFIX schema: &lt;http://schema.org/&gt;<br>SELECT ?dataFeed ?contractAddress ?rpcProvider<br>WHERE {<br>  ?dataFeed a schema:ChainlinkDataFeed ;<br>            schema:baseAsset ?baseAsset ;<br>            schema:contractAddress ?contractAddress ;<br>            schema:rpcProvider ?rpcProvider .<br>  ?baseAsset a schema:ChainlinkBaseAsset ;<br>             schema:name "DOT_CR" .<br>}  Step 3: Retrieve the data and display it in your application <p>Retrieve all the necessary information from the Knowledge Assets obtained through the SPARQL query. Essential information includes the contract address and RPC endpoint, as they are required to execute the code fetching price information from Chainlink. In our case, we are fetching the DOT/USD&nbsp;price.</p> Code execution <p>The following code uses ethers.js to fetch the requested value from the retrieved Data Feed. Here’s a simple&nbsp;example:</p> const { ethers } = require('ethers');<br><br>//Your code that executes SPARQL queries.<br><br>const rpcProvider = sparqlResult.data[0].rpcProvider;<br>const contractAddress = sparqlResult.data[0].contractAddress;<br><br>const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcProvider);<br>const abi = [{<br>    inputs: [],<br>    name: "latestRoundData",<br>    outputs: [<br>      { internalType: "uint80", name: "roundId", type: "uint80" },<br>      { internalType: "int256", name: "answer", type: "int256" },<br>      { internalType: "uint256", name: "startedAt", type: "uint256" },<br>      { internalType: "uint256", name: "updatedAt", type: "uint256" },<br>      { internalType: "uint80", name: "answeredInRound", type: "uint80" },<br>    ],<br>    stateMutability: "view",<br>    type: "function",<br>  }<br>];<br>async function getDOTUSDPrice() {<br>  const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, provider);<br>  const [ , price] = await contract.latestRoundData();<br>  <br>  console.log(`DOT/USD Price: ${ethers.utils.formatUnits(price, 8)}`);<br>}<br>getDOTUSDPrice();  Include Chainlink Data feed into the final&nbsp;response <p>You can modify how the LLM will perform the decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation and include the data feed as a part of the response by engineering the prompt based on your requirements. Here’s one example that appends it at the end of the generated response.</p><p>The next generation RWA solutions will be using the best of what the Internet, Crypto and AI have to offer. Combining the power of OriginTrail DKG and Chainlink unlocks avenues of value in the RWA industries that can disrupt the way those industries operate today.

 Advocating for a more diverse future for the recognition of talents, skills, and aspirations CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Back in 2016, the Open Recognition Alliance created the <a href="https://openrecognition.org/bord/">Bologna Open Recogition Declaration</a> (BORD). This has helped the community organise around principles relating to the concept of Open Recognition for all. It emphasises the importance of building out technologies and infrastructure to enable Open Recognition, as well as advocating for policies which foster its development.</p><p>Eight years later, the <a href="https://badges.community">Open Recognition is for Everybody</a> (ORE) community has started work on a manifesto for Open Recognition. This will be part of the <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/Open_Recognition_Toolkit">Open Recognition Toolkit</a> and extends the BORD to help people envision and advocate for a future where Open Recognition is commonplace.</p> Unpacking Open Recognition <p>Let’s begin with defining&nbsp;terms:</p><blockquote>Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.</blockquote><blockquote>(<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">What is Open Recognition, anyway?</a>)</blockquote><p>We want to help people understand that traditional approaches to credentialing, while important for unlocking opportunities, are just one part of a wider recognition landscape.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>For example, you could think of traditional credentialing — with courses, modules, and diplomas as like a greenhouse where growth conditions are carefully controlled. Only certain plants thrive in this environment, and they are pre-selected to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Open Recognition, on the other hand, is more like the garden that surrounds the greenhouse where a diverse array of plants grow naturally, adapt to their environment, and flourish in unique ways. Not only that, but there are many different gardens with different types of soil and varying atmospheric conditions.</p> Getting started with a manifesto <p>A manifesto is a call to action. It’s a way of allowing people to sign up to implement specific principles in order to work towards a better&nbsp;future.</p><p>To get started on that road, in a recent <a href="https://lu.ma/ore-community-calls">ORE community call</a> we asked two questions:</p>  What sucks that we want to do the opposite&nbsp;of?  What doesn’t exist that we want to bring into&nbsp;being?  <p>While these are only our first steps towards a manifesto with a subset of the community, we’re keen to share what we’ve discussed so&nbsp;far.</p> What sucks?   Simplifying complex systems — our digital landscape is cluttered with overly complex technologies and terminology. We aim to streamline these technologies, making open recognition accessible to everyone, not just the tech-savvy.  Clearing confusion and enhancing communication — there’s a tendency to overlook past contributions in the field, creating a cycle where new initiatives ignore the groundwork laid by predecessors. We want to provide clear, accurate information about Open Recognition to varied audiences.  Dismantling exclusivity — some forms of recognition and credentials are guarded as if they’re an exclusive membership available only to a select few. It’s important that we break down these barriers to create a more inclusive environment where everyone’s achievements are acknowledged.   What doesn’t&nbsp;exist?   Streamlined badge creation — we want to make creating badges for Open Recognition as easy as filling out a social media profile. This would encourage wider adoption and creativity in badge design/issuing.  Stories of success —examples and case studies help guide and inspire others. This could be part of the Open Recognition Toolkit, allowing stories to be shared and help provide practical and conceptual guidance to&nbsp;others.  Bridging spheres of learning — different forms of learning, for example formal and informal, tend to be siloed. As we know valuable skills can be acquired outside of traditional educational settings, we want to build a bridge to recognise the worth of both formal training and self-taught expertise.   Next steps <p>Creating a manifesto for Open Recognition involves creating something that resonates with a broad audience. It needs to be informative and upbeat, and have an ideological stance which advocates for a better future&nbsp;world.</p><p>Our next community call will continue the work we started this week, helping us work towards a plausible utopia for Open Recognition. If this is something which resonates with you, and you’d like to get involved, <a href="https://lu.ma/ORE-community">join&nbsp;us!</a></p> Related posts   <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">How badges can change the world — Part 1: The Two Loops Model for Open Recognition advocacy</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-65395581f90c">How badges can change the world — Part 2: Why we need to transition</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/advocating-for-learner-centric-badge-systems-21a65be4a725">Advocating for learner-centric badge systems: Some thoughts on campaigning for the right&nbsp;things</a>   <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/towards-a-manifesto-for-open-recognition-07b2606efd81">Towards a manifesto for Open Recognition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By: FIDO staff</p>



<p>Passkeys hold the promise of enabling simpler, strong authentication. But first organizations, governments and individuals will have to adopt the technology – and some of them have questions.</p>



<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Demystifying Passkey Implementation on March 13, speakers from the FIDO Alliance, Intercede, IDEMIA, Yubico, Dashlane and 1Password as well as implementers including Amazon and Target, presented on their experiences implementing and working with passkeys. The virtual summit covered the technical perspective on passkeys from the FIDO Alliance, as well as use cases for passkeys in the enterprise, consumer authentication, and the U.S. government. Along the way, attendees asked lots of questions and got lots of insightful answers.</p>







<p>Fundamentally a key theme that resonated throughout the virtual summit was that passkeys are a password replacement – and it’s a replacement that can’t come soon enough.</p>



<p>“Passwords are still the primary way for logging on and they are still easily phished through social engineering and they tend to be very difficult to use and to maintain,” David Turner, senior director of standards development at the FIDO Alliance said. “The consequences are real and the impact is real to the world at large.”</p>



 Passkeys 101 



<p>During his session, Turner provided a high-level overview on what passkeys are and how they work.</p>







<p>Passkeys build upon existing FIDO authentication protocols and simplify the user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys can now be synchronized across devices through the use of passkey providers, removing the need for separate credentials on each device. Passkeys also enable new capabilities like cross-device authentication. Turner demonstrated how a QR code scanned on one device can securely connect to credentials stored on another nearby device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to synced passkeys there are also device-bound passkeys, that rely on technologies like a security key to provide the required credentials.</p>



 The State of Passkeys 



<p>The current and future state of passkey adoption was the topic tackled by</p>



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance.</p>



<p>There are now hundreds of services, including the major platform vendors Microsoft, Apple and Google, representing billions of users, that support passkeys at this point in 2024.</p>







<p>“If you are a service provider and you wish to deploy passkeys, you can do so with high confidence that your consumers will be able to leverage them,” he said.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance aims to drive passkey support over the coming years, in part by sharing best practices and success stories, which is a core part of what the virtual summit was all about.</p>



<p>Usability was emphasized as a key factor for widespread adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Usability is paramount. It must be front and center in what you do,” said Shikiar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance has released user experience guidelines and a design system to help companies implement passkeys in a user-friendly way. Future guidelines will address additional use cases. </p>







<p></p>



<p>Shikiar emphasized that passkeys are not about being a new addition to improve the security of passwords. His expectation is that passkeys will be seen as a true password replacement rather than just an attempt at bolstering existing authentication methods. He emphasized that the fundamental problem is passwords, and the goal should be replacing them, not just adding extra security layers on top of passwords. Shikiar wants people to stop thinking about multi-factor authentication factors and instead think about enabling phishing resistant identities.&nbsp;</p>



 Passkeys are on Target at Target 



<p>Passkeys are already in use at retail giant Target, helping to improve security and optimize authentication for its employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tom Sheffield, senior director cybersecurity at Target, said that the company has been leveraging FIDO for workforce authentication since 2018 and adopted it as a primary authenticator in 2021.</p>







<p>One of the ways that Target has been able to more easily enable passkey support across its platforms is via Single Sign On (SSO).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have a very robust SSO environment across our web application suite,” Sheffield said. “So for us, that made it very easy to integrate FIDO into the SSO platform, and then therefore every application behind SSO automatically got the benefit of it.”</p>



<p>In terms of how Target was able to get its users to adopt passkeys quickly, Sheffield said that the option was communicated to users in the login flow, rather than trying to explain to users what they should do in an email.</p>



<p>Overall, Sheffield emphasized that if an organization is using OTP (one time passwords) today for multi-factor authentication (MFA), any form of FIDO will provide significantly better user experience and security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There have not been many security programs that I’ve been part of in my 25-year career in this space that offer you security and user experience simultaneously,” he said. “So if you’re using anything other than FIDO you’ve got a great opportunity to up your game and provide a great experience for users which should make you a hero.”</p>



 Authenticating a Billion Customers with Passkeys at Amazon 



<p>Among the biggest consumer-facing websites that supports passkeys today is online giant Amazon.</p>







<p>Yash Patodia, senior manager of product management at Amazon, detailed how passkeys were rolled out to hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide. Patodia explained Amazon’s motivation noting that passwords are relatively easy for a bad actor to crack. He noted that passkeys help customers to authenticate more easily than other methods with a better user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amazon implemented passkeys using different APIs for web, iOS, and Android platforms. Now available across devices, Amazon’s goal is to drive awareness and increase passkey adoption among its customer base over the next year. In his view, passkeys are well suited for mass adoption and early indications from Amazon’s user base are very encouraging.</p>



<p>“If you’re a consumer facing company who has a big customer base, definitely explore this option,” he said.</p>



 Considerations for FIDO and Passkeys in the US Government&nbsp; 



<p>The U.S. Government is no stranger to the world of strong authentication, with many staffers already using PIV (Personal Identity Verification) smart card credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teresa Wu from IDEMIA and Joe Scalone from Yubico, who both serve on the FIDO Alliance’s Government Deployment Working Group (GDWG), provided an overview of how passkeys can complement PIV credentials and support a zero trust security model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As government agencies work to implement phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication, passkeys are an option that could provide a more seamless user experience than one-time passwords or hardware tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are not here to replace PIV, we are here to supplement and use FIDO where PIV is not covered,” said Wu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One area they see opportunities for FIDO is for federal contractors and employees who are not eligible for a PIV card due to their job functions. Currently these individuals rely on passwords for system access.</p>







<p></p>



 State of Passkey Portability Set to Improve 



<p>A critical aspect of user experience is the ability to change passkey providers and move from one provider to another, if that’s what the user wants to do.</p>



<p>With existing password managers and legacy passwords, the process of moving credentials isn’t particularly efficient or secure, according to Rew Islam from Dashlane and Nick Steele from 1Password. It’s a situation that the Credential Provider Special Interest Group within the FIDO Alliance is looking to solve with a new standard for securely porting passwords between different password/passkey management applications.</p>



<p>The group is developing a new Credential Exchange Protocol that will use hybrid public key encryption to securely transfer credentials; the effort also includes the development of a standardized data format for credential information.</p>



<p>“By having the standard credential format, it will allow for interoperability of sharing credentials between two different providers in different organizations,” Steele said.</p>



<p>A proof of concept demo for the credential exchange is currently set for May, during the FIDO Member Plenary in Osaka, Japan. Islam noted that the effort represents a real triumph for the power of FIDO to bring different competitive vendors together for common purpose.</p>



 Common Questions about Passkeys&nbsp; 



<p>The virtual summit was concluded with an ‘Ask Me Anything’ (AMA) session where attendees asked their most pressing questions on passkeys.</p>



<p>Among the big questions asked:</p>



<p>How should organizations consider choosing synced passkeys or device-bound passkeys from a security and usability perspective?</p>



<p>Turner answered that the first thing to make really clear is that synced passkeys are probably the right answer for the majority of use cases. That said, he noted that FIDO recognizes that there are some areas where people have a much higher risk profile, and in those cases the device- bound passkeys can provide an extra level of trust.</p>



<p>Can passkeys play a role in transaction signing?</p>



<p>Pedro Martinez from Thales responded that yes, passkeys can be used to sign transactions. He explained that the beauty of the FIDO protocol is that it is based on the signature of a challenge. As such, it’s possible to adjust the challenge in order to contain data related to a transaction that needs to be digitally signed.</p>



<p>When will passkeys be the default mode of authentication?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar said that he doesn’t think that all passwords will go away, but he is hopeful for a passwordless future.</p>



<p>“Sophisticated risk engines and anomaly detectors don’t really think twice about accepting a password,” he said. “But as passkeys become more prevalent and become the default all of a sudden using a password will be anomalous in and of itself.and I think that’s when we’ll be in the fabulous future when using a password is rightfully seen as a high risk and anomalous action.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON,&nbsp;March 22, 2024&nbsp;/PRNewswire/ — World Identity Network (WIN), the leading nonprofit organization advocating for universal identity rights, has released its groundbreaking documentary, Shadows in the Dark: Our Global Identity Crisis, exclusively on Amazon.</p>



<p>“Releasing this film to the public is a moment of great triumph for our organization,”&nbsp;says WIN Founder and CEO,&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Mariana Dahan. “We spent years interviewing undocumented persons and refugees. Telling their stories with the utmost care, precision, and nuance was a tremendous responsibility, and we could not be happier with the final result.”</p>



<p>Shadows in the Dark&nbsp;is a sprawling saga following the stories of undocumented individuals across&nbsp;the United States, the&nbsp;Middle East, and refugee camps in&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;and beyond. The documentary shines a light on those born in the shadows of the formal economy, at the margins of society, lacking common identity documents, such as birth certificates and passports.</p>



<p>The movie highlights the work that Dr.&nbsp;Mariana Dahan&nbsp;has conducted at The World Bank, as the initiator and first global coordinator of the Identification for Development (ID4D) agenda, which celebrates its 10-years anniversary this year.&nbsp;Shadows in the Dark&nbsp;offers a compelling analysis of the successes and the risks associated with this multi-billion dollars program.</p>



<p>The Emmy Award – winning film crew has interviewed decision-makers, technologists and human rights activists, advocating for universal identification and responsible use of digital technologies, such as biometrics, facial recognition and AI.</p>



<p>“Identity is at the heart of many of today’s global challenges,” says&nbsp;Shadows in the Dark Co-director,&nbsp;Brad Kremer. “It is the common thread in immigration and many of the conflict zones existing throughout the world. When Dr.&nbsp;Mariana Dahan&nbsp;approached me to do this film together, I knew it would be a journey of immense meaning. But directing this narration, and telling the stories of everyone this issue impacts, has exceeded all our expectations.”</p>



<p>Produced in partnership with the&nbsp;United Nations, the&nbsp;Human Rights Foundation&nbsp;and&nbsp;Singularity University,&nbsp;Shadows in the Dark&nbsp;features extensive interviews with displaced Ukrainian and Syrian refugees recounting their experiences with the asylum process, along with leading officials at the World Bank and the United Nations, and the founders building new digital identity solutions. The film likewise explores nuances surrounding surveillance, authoritarian regimes, and biometric systems, as well as a dialogue with a group of far-right border advocates in the United States.</p>



<p>“In many ways, this film is a culmination of my life’s work,”&nbsp;continues Dr. Dahan. “Having been born without a birth certificate in Soviet-era&nbsp;Moldova, at the border with&nbsp;Ukraine, I know firsthand how crucial identity is to the preservation of human rights. I encourage everyone to watch the film and learn more about this global issue impacting millions. Identity is the cornerstone of human civilization”.</p>

     <p>To enhance the Swiss e-ID framework with selective disclosure while ensuring unlinkability, it’s imperative to incorporate advanced digital signature technologies such as BBS+ signatures. These technologies not only fortify the security of digital credentials but also significantly enhance user privacy. Such capabilities are crucial in minimizing the risk of personal data exposure and ensuring that users retain control over their information. It’s essential to continuously align our Trust Infrastructure with international cryptographic standards while remaining adaptable to emerging norms. This approach will facilitate interoperability across borders and sectors, ensuring that e-ID systems are both secure and universally recognized.</p>
<p>The parallel signatures model involves attaching multiple digital signatures to a single document or payload, with each signature providing different security or privacy features. This approach allows for a flexible and robust security framework, accommodating various cryptographic standards and privacy needs without compromising the integrity of the original document. It’s particularly useful in environments requiring adherence to diverse regulatory standards or in scenarios where resilience and both, high security and privacy are paramount. Cryptographic layering supports adaptiveness by incorporating multiple layers of cryptographic techniques within a system. This approach allows for the seamless integration and removal of cryptographic methods as needed by the Trust Ecosystem governance, enabling the system to adapt to evolving security threats and advancements in cryptographic research. It ensures long-term resilience and flexibility, allowing systems to maintain security without complete overhauls. Applying cryptographic schemes always mandates careful handling of private keys. Preventing their exposure is vital, even more so when using advanced schemes supporting derivative keys, as possible with BBS+. This underscores the need for strict security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the system’s integrity.</p>
<p>Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) represent a proven strategic model to operationalize digital trust and -identity solutions, combining public oversight with private sector efficiency and innovation. Such partnerships should be structured to encourage shared investment and risk, with a clear focus on public interest, global standards and local governance, protection of digital sovereignty and value-based adoption. These initiatives should be complemented by ongoing research into cryptographic innovations, preparing the ground for future advancements in e-ID security and privacy.</p>
<p>To address the challenges comprehensively and to build a continuously improving framework that is not only secure and compliant but also resilient and forward-looking, we must evaluate to invest in an independent body that accompanies the further progress in technology, governance and supports public and private sector adoption – to benefit from the opportunities of a trusted digital economy in the long term.</p>

<p>Marli Lichtman is Managing Director and Head, Digital Strategy and Controls at BMO Financial Group, <a href="https://www.bmo.com/">BMO</a>.</p>



<p>Follow Marli on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marli-lichtman/">LinkedIn</a></p>


 
 


<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>Let me work backwards, starting with my current role as Head of Digital Strategy and Controls at BMO. In this role, I lead two teams accountable for: (1) Strategy: defining and executing BMO’s “Digital First” agenda and (2) Controls: working in partnership with the Financial Crimes Unit to build and enhance digital controls to protect our customers against fraud. </p>



<p>I initially joined BMO’s Corporate Strategy Team in 2013 and since then have worked in progressively senior roles across Finance, Risk, Transformation and Business Operations. </p>



<p>Before joining BMO, I was a consultant in Oliver Wyman’s Finance and Risk Practice and prior to that, I worked in wealth management and earned my CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) designation. My first job out of school was at a boutique investment advisory firm. I graduated from Ivey at Western University with an Honours Business Administration (HBA) degree.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, did you visualize a dream job and if so, why?</p>



<p>I didn’t really know what I wanted to do when I was 20! I focused the early days of my career on finding opportunities where I could be challenged, learn as much as possible, maintain optionality to transition to other industries or career paths, and work with great people who would champion my career.</p>



<p>Have you encountered significant barriers in your career as a woman in leadership, and if so, what were they?</p>



<p>I have experienced many of the usual challenges you hear about concerning women in the workplace. However, my biggest barrier has been getting into my own head and thinking that I don’t deserve the positions I’ve been given (I mean, earned 😊). Through executive coaching, mentors, sponsors, and simply the experience of failing and rebounding, I’ve been able to overcome this (although I would be lying if I said I don’t experience imposter syndrome from time to time!).</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>It’s a constant juggling act, but I try to focus on 5 things: </p>



 
 Regular calendar reviews to “optimize” my time (e.g., which calls can I take from the car on my way to / from the office?)  



 Learning to say “no” and setting clear boundaries (applies to both work and personal life). 



 Finding time for self-care. 



 Working as a team with my partner who is also balancing a demanding schedule.  



 Living my values and knowing what’s important in life. 
 



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue digital trust and identity careers?</p>



<p>We need to start with education – What is Digital ID? What skillsets do you need to enter the space? Why is diversity so important? Who are female trailblazers in the space, and what has their career path looked like? Early exposure, encouragement, and mentorship are key to increasing female representation in this space.</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Build meaningful relationships. Earn the trust of your colleagues. Network within and outside of your industry. Ensure you have a mentor and a sponsor at your organization. Most importantly, stay true to yourself.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>While women have made considerable progress over the past decade, there is still more work to do. The next generation will continue to face the same challenges (e.g., gender bias, pay inequality, balancing personal life) but will benefit from increased female representation and sponsorship at Senior levels.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Be confident – you are in the field for a reason! Trust your instincts, and don’t be too hard on yourself.</p>

<p>We're thrilled to announce that <a href="https://oamo.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">Oamo</a> is partnering with <a href="https://ceramic.network/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">Ceramic</a> as a data provider on the platform. Oamo will issue tens of millions of publicly available credentials based on wallets’ on-chain activity and holdings. This is the first step in a broader initiative to develop and standardize the first decentralized point system, powered by Ceramic and Oamo’s credential models.</p><p>Oamo has been a big supporter of the Ceramic ecosystem from day one. By harnessing Ceramic's innovative DID (Decentralized Identifier) infrastructure and <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">ComposeDB</a> for zero-party data storage, they’re setting the foundation for a future where user data is private by design, perishable at will, and accessible only with explicit permission. Oamo and Ceramic are crafting a path toward a consensual and rewarding digital ecosystem.</p> The partnership so far <p>Since launching on Ceramic in Q3 2023, Oamo has witnessed remarkable results – over 65,000 Oamo Profiles have been created, with more than 200,000 Ceramic documents generated. Additionally, Oamo has distributed over 400,000 credentials spanning Web2 and on-chain behaviors, enriching the digital identity and access privileges of Oamo Profile users across various platforms.</p><p>Oamo credentials cover:</p>  On-chain activity across DeFi, NFTs, staking and gaming;  Wallet holdings including major ERC-20s and NFT collections; and  Social activity across Web2 platforms like Discord, Youtube and X.   Supercharging the Ceramic ecosystem <p>With this partnership and announcement, Oamo aims to enhance digital identity and engagement through:</p>  Credential Distribution <br>Oamo has indexed millions of EVM wallets’ behaviors and holdings, and will be distributing tens of millions of publicly available credentials to enrich user identities across platforms, ensuring the security and verification of online activities. These credentials can then be used to:Credentials issued will be maintained and updated monthly to include time decay and ensure they always represent the latest behaviors of the indexed wallets. Feedback from the community is welcome to develop new credentials that track the most relevant on-chain behaviors for builders in the ecosystem.  Compile specific wallet lists for airdrops.  Establish reputation frameworks based on behavioral data points.  Launch strategic user acquisition campaigns by identifying wallets in a specific target audience and contacting them via XMTP for example.    Decentralized Point System <br>Oamo will leverage its credential models to develop the first standardized decentralized point system on Ceramic, with each indexed wallet receiving its own scorecard based on its on-chain activity and holdings. Builders in the ecosystem will be able to leverage these scorecards and customize their own points system with their own credentials and Oamo’s.  Credential &amp; Points Management SDK<br>Oamo will release an SDK to allow any builder to search and leverage Oamo’s credentials and points system easily. This middleware will also allow builders to issue their own credentials and points based on their own models and app activity.   What’s in it for users <p>Anyone creating their Decentralized Identifier (DID) on the Ceramic Network (by creating an Oamo Profile, for instance) will be able to claim their credentials and scorecards seamlessly. This open and inclusive approach democratizes access to digital credentials, ensuring users from all backgrounds and levels of onchain experience can benefit from Ceramic’s ecosystem of builders.</p> What’s in it for developers <p>Oamo's vision includes diverse use cases, transforming how developers interact with consumers. The Oamo platform offers endless opportunities for various types of protocols and apps:</p>  DeFi Protocols<br>Easily find wallets matching their target audience, such as active liquidity providers on leading AMMs or active traders on DEXes across major EVM chains.  NFT Projects<br>Identify potential collectors based on their NFT holdings and distribute collections to the right user base.  Wallet Providers<br>Identify and reach whales holding specific token amounts across multiple chains.  Liquid Staking Projects<br>Identify wallets holding significant ETH amounts and generating yield via lending protocols as high-value acquisition targets.  Game Developers<br>Find gamers in Web3 that hold specific NFTs or have engaged with similar on-chain games.  <p>While the Oamo app provides a hub for user acquisition and relationship development, this publicly available tooling and data will allow anyone to craft their own strategies.</p><p>Builders on the Ceramic Network will have the capability to query, consume, and customize issued credentials and points to power new data-rich use cases, such as targeted airdrops, credential-gated experiences, loyalty programs, and more. To streamline integrations, Oamo will be launching an SDK, making it easier for developers to incorporate these capabilities into their own projects.</p><p>Join the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/+cFzcrY5DZuRhNGNh?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Oamo’s Telegram channel for builders</a> to contribute or be notified about updates and releases.</p> <p>About <a href="https://ceramic.network/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">Ceramic</a></p><p>Ceramic is a decentralized data network for managing verifiable data at scale, combining the trust and composability of a blockchain with the flexibility of an event-driven architecture to help organizations get more value from their data. Thousands of developers use it to manage reputation data, store attestations, log user activity, and build novel data infrastructure. Ceramic frees entrepreneurs from the constraints of traditional siloed infrastructure, letting them tap into a vibrant data ecosystem to bring their unique vision to life faster.</p><p>About <a href="https://oamo.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">Oamo</a></p><p>Oamo allows consumers to discover and match with their favorite brands based on their online activity.

<p>The Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC) Task Force at the Trust Over IP Foundation is pleased to request public review of the following deliverables:</p>



 
 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) specification</a>&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/">Authentic Chained Data Containers specification</a>&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">Composable Event Streaming Representation specification</a>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Together, this suite of specifications provides a blueprint for creating truly decentralized, authentic, and verifiable ecosystems of identifiers, “credentials” [see footnote], and attestations.</p>



<p>The specifications describe a series of unique, innovative features:</p>



 
 Pre-rotation of keys, enabling truly unbounded term identifiers; 



 Cryptographic root-of-trust; 



 Chained “credentials” [see footnote] with fully verifiable proof of ownership and proof of authorship; 



 A serialization format that is optimized for both text and binary representations equally with unique properties that support lookahead streaming for uncompromised scalability. 
 



<p>This suite of specifications contains additional sub-specifications including Out-Of-Band Introductions, Self-Addressing Identifiers and a revolutionary “path signature’ approach for signed containers required to provide a comprehensive solution for <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-1-identifiers-ffb9091fd47a">Organizational Identity</a>.</p>



<p>With the launch of the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">vLEI Root of Official Trust</a> this suite of specifications saw its first production deployment through the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy">Python reference implementation</a> in 2022.</p>



<p>The Task Force expects feedback to be provided by April 20, 2024 via GitHub issues on the following repositories using the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/public-review-process/">ToIP Public Review Process</a>:</p>

  Most AI news is about what the giants (OpenAI/Microsoft, Meta, Google/Apple, Amazon, Adobe, Nvidia) are doing (seven $trillion, anyone?), or what AI is doing for business (all of Forbes’ AI 50). Against all that, personal AI appears to be about where personal computing was in 1974: no longer an oxymoron but discussed more than delivered. […]

 <p>Prompt: A woman uses personal AI to know, get control of, and put to better use all available data about her property, health, finances, contacts, calendar, subscriptions, shopping, travel, and work. Via Microsoft Copilot Designer, with spelling corrections by the author.</p> 
<p>Most AI news is about what the giants (<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/">OpenAI/Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://ai.meta.com/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/technology/apple-google-ai-iphone.html">Google/Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-launches-ai-tools-to-rival-chatgpt-microsoft-and-google/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly.html">Adobe</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/">Nvidia</a>) are doing (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/09/openai-ceo-sam-altman-reportedly-seeking-trillions-of-dollars-for-ai-chip-project.html">seven $trillion</a>, anyone?), or what AI is doing for business (all of Forbes’ <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/?sh=68b7d3fa290f">AI 50</a>). Against all that, personal AI appears to be about where personal computing was in 1974: no longer an oxymoron but discussed more than delivered.</p>
<p>For evidence, look up “personal AI.” All the results will be about business (see <a href="http://Personal%20AI:%20The%20Technology%20Has%20Hit%20Its%20‘High-Tech%20High-Touch’%20Stage">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/public-ai-vs-private-ai-vs-personal-ai-whats-the-difference/">here</a>) or “assistants” that are just suction cups on the tentacles of giants (Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, Bixby), or wannabes that do the same kind of thing (Lindy, Hound, DataBot).</p>
<p>There may be others, but three exceptions I know are <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a>, <a href="https://www.personal.ai/">Personal AI</a> and <a href="https://pi.ai/talk">Pi</a>.</p>
<p>Personal AI is finding its most promoted early uses on the side of business more than the side of customers. <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/personal-ai/">Zapier</a>, for example, explains that Personal AI “can be used as a productivity or business tool.”</p>
<p>Kin and Pi are personal assistants that help you with your life by surveilling your activities for your own benefit. I’ve signed up for both, but have only experienced Pit,” or “just vent,” when I ask it to help me with the stuff outlined in (and under) the AI-generated image above, it wants to hook me up with a bunch of siloed platforms that cost money, or to do geeky things (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Python on my own computer. Provisional conclusion: Pi means well, but the tools aren’t there yet. [Later… <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2024/03/19/inflection-abandons-chatgpt-challenger-ceo-suleyman-joins-microsoft/">Looks like it’s going to morph into some kind of B2B thing</a>, or be abandoned outright, now that Inflection AI’s CEO, Mustafa Suleyman is gone to Microsoft. Hmm… will Microsoft do what we’d like in this space?]</p>
<p>Open source approaches are out there: <a href="https://www.opendan.ai/">OpenDAN</a>, <a href="https://khoj.dev/">Khoj</a>, <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/">Kwaai</a> , and <a href="https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/build-your-own-ai/">Llama</a> are four, and I know at least one will be at VRM Day and IIW.</p>
<p>So, since personal AI may finally be what pushes VRM into becoming a Real Thing, we’ll make it the focus of our next VRM Day.</p>
<p>As always, VRM Day will precede <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a> in the same location: the Boole Room of the <a href="https://computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a> in Mountain View, just off Highway 101 in the heart of Silicon Valley. It’ll be on Monday, 15 April, and start at 9am. There’s a Starbucks across the street and ample parking because the museum is officially closed on Mondays, but the door is open. We lunch outdoors (it’s always clear) at the sports bar on the other corner.</p>
<p>Registration is open now at <a href="https://vrmday2024a.eventbrite.com">this Eventbrite link</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://vrmday2024a.eventbrite.com">https://vrmday2024a.eventbrite.com</a></p>
<p>You can also just show up, but registering gives us a rough headcount, which is helpful for bringing in the right number of chairs and stuff like that.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>If the first two months of 2024 for Digital Identity NZ are anything to go by, this year is certainly turning out to be every bit as busy as 2023. It is a different kind of busy, with more collaboration and partnership engagement needed to ‘get things done’ in the digital identity domain, against a backdrop of regulation and economic headwinds.</p>



<p>A couple of weeks ago, the year’s first Coffee Chat saw good attendance as did last month’s Air New Zealand and Authsignal sponsored webinar on passkeys. This exclusive member-only event shared how DINZ members, Authsignal and Air New Zealand worked together to deliver a world class implementation of passkeys to secure Air New Zealand’s customers accounts. Speaking of Authsignal, founder and DINZ Executive Council Member Justin Soong wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/08/generative-ai-and-the-risk-around-digital-trust/?sh=69e6817c6dcf">this exceptional thought piece on AI published in Forbes last month</a>.&nbsp;And DINZ member SSS – IT Security Specialists&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reseller.co.nz/article/1355990/att-crowns-sss-it-security-specialists-as-its-apac-partner-of-the-year.html">received this accolade</a>!</p>



<p>Next week, members will receive a personal email from me seeking expressions of interest, particularly from digital ID service and attribute providers, to participate in an investigative sprint early next month from DINZ member PaymentsNZ’s. The aim is to surface the digital identity-related issues that people encounter in the payments industry, and develop best practice requirements to overcome them as part of PaymentsNZ’s Next Generation Payments programme. Stay tuned.</p>



<p>We kick off April with a lunchtime fireside chat; Digital Health Identity: History, current state and the future with two Te Whatu Ora specialists. There’s so much happening in this space. You can find out more and register&nbsp;<a href="https://events.humanitix.com/fireside-chat-digital-health-identity-history-current-state-and-the-future">here</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re getting the impression that April is the month for digital identity, you’re correct! Tuesday 9 April is World&nbsp;<a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/identity-management-day/">Identity Management Day</a>! While co-founded by the Identity Defined Security Alliance and the National Cybersecurity Alliance in the US in 2021, the day is recognised in many countries globally. In its fourth year, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/event/identity-management-day-2024/">2024 Virtual Conference</a>&nbsp;brings together identity and security leaders and practitioners from all over the world to learn and engage.</p>



<p>April is also a favourite time of year to publish research that helps to level-set our own strategies and plans, as DINZ did last year. This&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/70-of-australians-dont-feel-in-control-of-their-data-as-companies-hide-behind-meaningless-privacy-terms-224072">Australian research</a>&nbsp;forwarded by a public sector member, would probably show similar results in NZ, as reflected in DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://internetnz.nz/news-and-articles/internet-insights/">InternetNZ’s insights research</a>. And the<a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/.github/blob/main/profile/reference-implementation.md">&nbsp;EU digital wallet is taking shape</a>&nbsp;as it aims to showcase a robust and interoperable platform for digital identification, authentication and electronic signatures based on common standards across the European Union. We hope to continue our research and additional initiatives for 2024, and we’re continually looking for support in the way of sponsorship from our members. <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/01/18/sponsorship-opportunities-for-a-thriving-future/">Click here to find out how you can support DINZ’s research, and future ambitions</a>.</p>

<p>The next pandemic response must respect user preferences or risk low&nbsp;adoption</p><p>By Elissa M. Redmiles and Oshrat&nbsp;Ayalon</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@kommumikation?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Mika Baumeister</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-black-android-smartphone-PfMXXv8XXgs?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a><p>Four years after <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html">COVID-19 was first declared a pandemic</a>, policy makers, companies and citizens alike have moved on. The CDC no longer <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p0301-respiratory-virus.html">offers separate guidance for COVID-19</a>. Apple and Google have <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/exposure-notifications">shut down their exposure notification infrastructure</a>, which was used heavily in the US and Europe. As COVID-19 spread, technologists were called to serve by building and deploying exposure notification apps to scale parts of the <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2022.306949">contact tracing</a> process. These apps allowed users to report when they tested positive for COVID-19 and to notify other users when they had been in the vicinity of an infected user. But getting people to use exposure notification apps during the pandemic proved challenging.</p><p><a href="https://www.who.int/data/stories/the-true-death-toll-of-covid-19-estimating-global-excess-mortality">More than three million</a> lives have been lost to COVID-19 over the past four years. Any hope of losing fewer lives during the next pandemic rests on reflection: what did we do, what can we learn from it, and what can we do better next time? Here, we offer five key lessons-learned from research on COVID-19 apps in the US and Europe that can help us prepare for the next pandemic.</p><p>Privacy is important, but accuracy also&nbsp;matters</p><p>Privacy was the primary focus in early exposure notification apps, and rightfully so. The apps all trace their users’ medical information and movements in various ways, and may store some or all of that information in a central database in order to inform other users of potential infection. The misuse of this information could easily result in unintentional, or even intentional, harm.</p><p>However, research into whether (and how) people used exposure notification apps during the pandemic showed that <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/28/quality-issues-stumbling-block-contact-tracing-apps/">privacy might not be</a> the most important factor. People care about <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3488307">accuracy</a>, or an app’s rate of incorrect reports of COVID-19 exposure (both false positives and false negatives), which may have also influenced rates of public app adoption. Yet, <a href="https://europeanaifund.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/European-AI-Fund-Tech-and-Covid-grants-synthesis-1.pdf">we still know little</a> about how effective the deployed exposure notification apps were. Future apps will need to have measurement tools and methods designed into them before they are released to accurately track their usefulness.</p><p>We need to better understand the role of incentives</p><p>Researchers discovered that using direct incentives, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258945">such as monetary compensation</a>, to get people to install exposure notification apps worked at first, but had little effect in the long term. In fact, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3786245">one field study</a> found that people who received money were less likely to still be using the app eight months later than those who didn’t. Paying people to download a contact tracing app is <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/ayalon">even less effective</a> when the app is perceived to be bad quality or inaccurate. However, monetary incentives may be able to “compensate” when the app is perceived to be costly in other ways, such as eating up mobile&nbsp;data.</p><p>Given the ethical problems and lack of success with direct incentives, focusing on indirect incentives, such as functionality, may be key to increasing adoption. Exposure notification apps have the potential to serve a greater purpose during pandemics than merely exposure notification. Our research found that people using exposure notification apps wanted them to <a href="https://medium.com/ubicomp-iswc-2023/how-people-used-covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-and-why-insights-from-belgiums-coronalert-48e57c1a0fe1">serve as a “one-stop-shop”</a> for quick receipt of test results, information on the state of public health in their region, and assistance finding testing&nbsp;centers.</p><p>Future app design needs to examine user wants and expectations to ensure widespread adoption. This is hardly a new concept — every successful “fun” app begins with this user-centered model. Apps that provide these extra benefits to users will not only be better adopted, they will also see more frequent and prolonged use.</p><blockquote>…Over a third of the Coronalert app users we interviewed believed that it tracked their location, despite repeated communications over the course of a year that it used proximity rather than location to detect possible exposures.</blockquote><p>Honesty is the most effective communication strategy</p><p>Exposure notification apps are often framed to the public as having inherent individual benefits: if you use this app, you’ll be able to tell when you’ve been exposed to a disease. In reality, exposure notification apps have a stronger collective benefit of preventing the overall spread of disease in communities. Being honest with potential users about the true benefits is more effective than playing up the less significant individual benefit. When examining <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501869">how to best advertise</a> Louisiana’s exposure notification app, we found that people were most receptive to the app when its collectivistic benefits were centered.</p><p>Honesty and openness in privacy is also essential, especially when it comes to data collection and storage. Despite this transparency, however, people may still make assumptions based on false preconceptions or logic. For example, over a third of the Coronalert app users we interviewed believed that it tracked their location, despite repeated communications over the course of a year that it used proximity rather than location to detect possible exposures.</p><p>Integration with existing health systems is essential</p><p>There was a disconnect between COVID-19 exposure notification apps and public healthcare systems, even in countries with universal healthcare and government-supported apps. <a href="https://medium.com/ubicomp-iswc-2023/how-people-used-covid-19-contact-tracing-apps-and-why-insights-from-belgiums-coronalert-48e57c1a0fe1">Belgium’s Coronalert app</a>, for example, allowed users to receive their test results faster by linking their test to their app using a unique code. But, testing center staff were not trained on the app and failed to prompt users for that code. Not only was receiving test results a primary motivator in getting people to use the app; failing to link positive results to specific app users reduced the app’s efficacy.</p><p>This disconnect may be far greater in countries without universal healthcare or where exposure notification apps are privately created. In order for these apps to be effective, developers must collaborate with public health workers to develop a shared understanding of how testing centers operate, determine the information needed to provide accurate tracking, and decide on the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-fix-covid-contact-tracing/">best way to follow up</a> on potential infections.</p><p>Resourcing technical capacity is&nbsp;critical</p><p>A wide range of exposure notification apps were developed to combat COVID-19, and by many different organizations. In the absence of immediate government action, many of the earliest efforts were led by universities or volunteer efforts. Academics developed the <a href="https://fortune.com/40-under-40/2020/carmela-troncoso/">DP3T proximity tracing protocol, which guided </a>Google and Apple’s development of exposure notification infrastructure for Android and iOS&nbsp;phones.</p><p>However, privatization of exposure notification infrastructure created an enormous potential for private medical and other information to fall into the hands of corporations who are in the business of big data. It also subjected exposure notification technology to private company’s rules (and&nbsp;whims).</p><p>Google and Apple released exposure notification infrastructure in April 2020 but did not release direct-to-user exposure notification functionality <a href="https://www.pathcheck.org/en/blog/pathcheck-launches-solutions-for-en-express-unveiled-by-google-apple">until later in the pandemic</a>. This decision left the development of exposure notification apps to public health agencies that lacked the resources and technical capacity to do so. Volunteers stepped in to fill this void. For example, the PathCheck foundation developed exposure notification apps for <a href="https://www.pathcheck.org/en/impact">7 states and countries</a> on top of the Google-Apple Exposure Notification infrastructure.</p><blockquote>“…We need to eliminate these scattered responses, align incentives, and integrate the strengths and perspectives of public, private, and academic bodies to develop protocols, models, and best practices.”</blockquote><p>While it is natural for universities to support the public good, and encouraging that private citizens volunteered so much of their time and resources to do so, they should not have to in the next pandemic. To respond to future pandemics, we need to eliminate these scattered responses, align incentives, and integrate the strengths and perspectives of public, private, and academic bodies to develop protocols, models, and best practices.</p><p>Applying the lessons&nbsp;learned</p><p>Building tech responsibly means not just considering privacy, but providing <a href="https://dighum.ec.tuwien.ac.at/perspectives-on-digital-humanism/the-need-for-respectful-technologies-going-beyond-privacy/">technology that respects user preferences</a>. When people give up their data, they expect a benefit — be that a collective benefit, such as fighting a pandemic or helping cancer research, or an individual one. They likewise expect utility: apps that are accurate, achieve their goals, and provide an holistic set of features.</p><p>If we continue to build tech based on our assumptions of what users want, we risk low adoption of these technologies. And during times of crisis, such as this still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the consequences of low adoption are&nbsp;dire.</p><p><a href="https://elissaredmiles.com/">Elissa M.
