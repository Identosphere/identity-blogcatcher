<p>The OpenID Foundation is excited to announce a new collaboration agreement with <a href="https://cloudsignatureconsortium.org/">the Cloud Signature Consortium (CSC)</a>, marking a significant step forward in the standardization of digital credentials and cloud based signatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation leads the global community in creating identity standards that are secure, interoperable and privacy-preserving, while the Cloud Signature Consortium builds standards for cloud based digital signatures that support web and mobile applications while complying with demanding electronic signature regulations worldwide.</p>
<p>This partnership brings together two leading organizations to create unified, interoperable standards that will support critical initiatives, like <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home">the EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet) project</a>.</p>
 Strengthening the foundation for digital identity 
<p>As digital identity solutions become increasingly central to both public and private sector operations, the need for cohesive, interoperable standards has become essential for successful implementation.</p>
<p>This collaboration between the OpenID Foundation’s <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/">Digital Credentials Protocols (DCP) Working Group</a> and the CSC Technical Committee ensures that cloud based digital signatures and credential presentation protocols will work seamlessly together.</p>
<p>The partnership is particularly timely as European governments advance the EUDI Wallet initiative, which requires robust, standardized approaches to digital identity verification and electronic signatures. By aligning technical specifications, a stronger foundation is being created for these next generation identity solutions.</p>
 Avoiding fragmentation, maximizing impact 
<p>Rather than developing competing standards in parallel, both organizations recognized the value of coordinated development. This collaboration will prevent technical duplication while ensuring comprehensive coverage of digital identity use cases, from credential issuance and verification to secure electronic signatures in cloud environments.</p>
<p>“The synergy between OpenID Foundation’s credential presentation protocols and CSC’s cloud signature standards creates powerful possibilities for the digital identity ecosystem,” said Luigi Rizzo, Chair of the CSC Technical Committee. “This partnership ensures that organizations implementing EUDI Wallet and similar initiatives will have access to mature, interoperable standards that work together seamlessly.”</p>
 What this means for the industry 
<p>Both specifications developed through this collaboration will be made freely available for reference in government legislation, regulations, and private sector policies. This open approach supports the shared vision of establishing truly global digital infrastructure that serves users, businesses, and governments alike.</p>
<p>The partnership represents a new model for standards development in the identity space, one that prioritizes interoperability and user experience over organizational boundaries. As the two organisations work together on these critical specifications, they are building the technical foundation for a more connected, secure digital future.</p>
<p>For identity professionals working on digital wallet implementations, credential management systems, or electronic signature solutions, this collaboration signals a maturing ecosystem where standards work together rather than compete. The result will be more robust, interoperable solutions that can scale globally while meeting the most demanding regulatory requirements.</p>
 About the CSC 
<p>The Cloud Signature Consortium is a global group of industry, government, and academic organizations committed to driving standardization of highly secure and compliant digital signatures in the cloud. Inspired by the rigorous requirements of the European Union’s Regulation on Identification and Trust Services (eIDAS), our common technical specification helps ease solution interoperability, streamlines compliance with e-signature regulations, and opens the market for uniform adoption of cloud-based digital signatures around&nbsp; the world.</p>
 About the OpenID Foundation 
<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate.

 Briefing Document: India’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) 
<p>Date: June 26, 2025<br>
Source: Excerpts from Trust over IP Ecosystems and Governance Working Group Meeting<br>
Presenter: Aakash Guglani from the <a href="https://digitalindiafoundation.org/">Digital India Foundation</a>.<br>
Topic: Enhancing Trust using Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)<br>
Excerpt: India’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and Unified Payment Interface (UPI) revolutionize financial inclusion, bringing over 500 million people into the digital economy. This open-source, mobile-first system builds trust and breaks traditional payment monopolies.</p>
 
 Executive Summary 
<p>This briefing document provides an overview of India’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), focusing on its development, impact, and future direction as presented by Aakash Guglani from the Digital India Foundation. The DPI, particularly the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Aadhaar, has been instrumental in formalizing India’s economy, empowering its vast and diverse population, and challenging traditional payment monopolies. It represents a unique, policy-driven approach that blends public and private sector participation, aiming for broad inclusivity rather than just serving the affluent.</p>
 I. Core Philosophy and Context 
 
 Addressing India’s Unique Challenges: India’s DPI was developed to address the needs of its “100 million plus” households, representing “500 million people” who were largely deprived and excluded from the burgeoning digital economy. Traditional private platforms primarily targeted the “top 1%,” while public approaches lacked state capacity and risked centralization. (00:07:39, 00:10:50) 
 A “Digital Public Infrastructure” Approach: India adopted a “distro public infrastructure” model, which emphasizes diversity, choice, openness, and sovereignty. It’s a collaborative effort involving both public and private sectors. (00:11:08) 
 Contrast with Other Models: Unlike purely private platforms or a “totally state-led model” like China’s, India’s DPI is designed to be a democratic solution. “We could not go with private platforms, and we never had the state capacity like China to go for a totally state-led model.” (00:09:30, 00:16:40) 
 
 II. Key Components and Their Impact 
 A. Aadhaar: Unique Digital Identity 
 
 Foundation of DPI: Over the last 10 to 15 years, India has established “more than 1.3 billion Aadhaar,” a unique digital identity based on 10 biometrics (fingerprints and iris scan) for “99% of Indians.” (00:11:37, 00:11:50) 
 Enabled EKYC: Aadhaar facilitated “EKYC (Know Your Customer),” drastically reducing the cost of customer acquisition for banks. The cost of KYC dropped from “$25 to $1.” (00:12:02, 00:21:16, 00:21:21) This cost reduction made it economically viable for banks, previously reluctant due to high offline verification costs, to open “zero-cost accounts” for the rural and unbanked population. (00:21:21, 00:21:29) 
 Broad Financial Inclusion: This initiative, known as “JanDhan Yojna,” led to “more than 500 million people [having] bank accounts, which is totally zero cost.” (00:19:53, 00:21:10) 
 
 B. Unified Payments Interface (UPI) 
 
 Solution to Payment Friction: UPI addressed significant problems in India’s financial landscape, including limited digital transactions, high costs for credit card usage, reliance on paper receipts, and lack of “information collateral” for poor individuals seeking credit. (00:15:08, 00:16:56) 
 Massive Adoption and Interoperability: As of March 2025, UPI recorded “more than 18 billion transactions.” (00:18:30) 
 Over 200 banks are integrated, and it’s “totally interoperable.” A payment between a customer from Bank A and a merchant from Bank B takes “less than 10 seconds” via a QR code scan. (00:18:37, 00:18:42, 00:18:54) 
 There is “no MDR (Merchant Discount Rate)” for most transactions, which incentivizes small vendors like vegetable sellers to adopt digital payments. (00:19:04, 00:19:15) 
 “Every part of the country is using UPI,” demonstrating “deeper usage” even in poorer regions. (00:31:47, 00:31:52) 
 Economic Empowerment: For retailers, UPI reduces the “cost of business” by allowing them to “service 3-4 people at a time” without handling cash and change. (00:29:21) 
 It empowered women by ensuring that earnings from their stores went directly to their bank accounts, preventing misuse of physical cash. (00:30:13, 00:30:24) 
 Challenging Global Monopolies: UPI has fundamentally reshaped the global payment landscape. It involves a diverse range of participants including “Visa, Mastercard, Google Pay, Phone Pay, American Express.” (00:33:45, 00:33:50) 
 “It is not dominant by two major players,” effectively “break[ing] monopoly of private players.” (00:33:50, 00:33:58) 
 UPI has “crossed the transaction volumes of Visa and Mastercard combined.” (00:34:14) 
 “46% of real-time payments across the world happen out of India.” (00:34:21) 
 Beyond the “Bottom of the Pyramid”: DPI, including UPI and EKYC, has also benefited the middle and upper-middle classes. The reduced KYC cost facilitated the opening of “more than 190 million DMAT accounts” (online stockbroking accounts) between 2016 and 2024, many for “first-time users.” (00:34:43, 00:35:08, 00:35:14, 00:35:52) This formalizes the economy and encourages savings. 
 
 III. Enablers and Policy Framework 
 
 Government Subsidies: An ongoing annual government subsidy of “$0.2 billion for MDR” (Merchant Discount Rate) for UPI usage is in place. This is viewed as an investment in “public railroad” or “public highway” infrastructure due to its immense “inclusion value.” (00:40:41, 00:40:54, 00:41:09) 
 Agile Policy: The success of DPI is underpinned by “agile policies.” Examples include: 
 The central bank’s allowance for EKYC (2012-2013). (00:45:04) 
 An IT Act making “digital documents equivalent to offline documents” for digital locker services. (00:45:21) 
 The RBI’s Digital Payments Committee recommending UPI. (00:45:49) 
 Government procurement shifting to “totally digitally” platforms using UPI. (00:46:39) 
 Leadership and Trust: The Prime Minister’s public use of UPI and foreign leaders using it in India “enhances trust in people,” creating a “virtuous cycle.” (00:47:01) 
 Mobile-First, Low-Tech, Multilingual: The platforms are designed to be mobile-first, multilingual, and low-tech, supporting feature phones and even “offline availability.” (00:39:31, 00:39:38) 
 Internet Penetration: Government efforts to provide “free internet” increased coverage from 25% to 48%, a “major contributor for UPI.” (00:33:11) 
 Indigenous Development: All platforms are “indigenously made,” addressing specific Indian problems. (00:39:38) 
 
 IV. Future Directions and Challenges 
 
 Next Stage: Credit Enablement: With 500 million bank accounts and 1.2 billion digital identities, the focus shifts to empowering users by providing credit. (00:36:00, 00:36:26) 
 Account Aggregator: A framework allowing individuals to consent to share their financial data between banks, mutual funds, insurance providers, etc., using the EKYC framework, to facilitate consumer and business loans. (00:36:41, 00:36:53) 
 Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN): This leverages the transaction data from informal vendors (e.g., vegetable sellers) who now have “information collateral” on their transaction frequency and average ticket size, making it “easier for banks to also financialize them.” (00:37:29, 00:37:35, 00:37:49) This moves DPI beyond just a base to “formalize the economy.” (00:37:49) 
 Global Export of DPI: India aims to share its open-source DPI frameworks, including UPI APIs on GitHub, “freely to anyone around the world.” This includes cross-border payment solutions and sharing its vaccination system. (00:38:16, 00:38:34, 00:38:42) 
 Future Open Data Platforms: The “India Stack was the beginning,” with future initiatives including digital commerce, online financial information sharing, online credit availability, digitization of health records, AI-based voice, and digital skills. (00:38:54, 00:39:04) 
 Tech Sovereignty: India advocates for “tech sovereignty” to avoid reliance on foreign private entities that could “cut off my access” due to geopolitical tensions, as seen in the Russia-Ukraine war. The aim is to prevent private companies from engaging in “geopolitical positioning.” (00:48:14, 00:49:06, 00:49:32, 00:49:45) 
 Fraud and Cybersecurity: With massive scale, the system faces “more than a million cyberattacks” annually, including those from state and non-state actors. (00:51:38, 00:51:49, 00:51:53) 
 Common frauds include “digital arrest” scams using AI-based voice to demand UPI transfers. (00:53:00, 00:53:07) 
 RBI is implementing measures like mandating brokers to use “authenticated UPI IDs,” displaying the recipient’s name before transfer, and nudging users not to pay while on a call. (00:55:54, 00:56:03, 00:56:10) 
 The direct debit nature of UPI makes reversing fraudulent transactions difficult once money is transferred. (00:54:47) 
 Ongoing efforts include public advisories and potential future escrow services. (00:53:23, 00:57:00) 
 
 V. Conclusion 
<p>India’s DPI journey, marked by the success of Aadhaar and UPI, demonstrates a powerful model for digital inclusion and economic formalization in a democratic context. By leveraging agile policy-making, strategic government investment, and open-source technology, India has built a robust digital public good that empowers its citizens and offers significant lessons for the Global South. The ongoing challenge lies in mitigating fraud and expanding the system to foster greater financial empowerment through credit, while maintaining technological sovereignty.</p>

 OIDF leads critical discussion on digital identity futures 
<p></p>
<p>IGF 2025 explores pathways for developing and least developed countries to achieve inclusive digital transformation</p>
<p>At the recent<a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/dashboard/igf-2025"> Internet Governance Forum (IGF) 2025 in Lillestrøm</a>, a pivotal conversation about one of the most pressing challenges facing developing and least developed countries (DLDCs) took place – <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2025-ws-290-sovereignty-and-interoperable-digital-identity-in-dldcs">how can digital identity interoperability be balanced with national sovereignty?</a></p>
<p>Co-hosted by<a href="https://www.aficta.africa/"> AfICTA</a>, <a href="https://sidi-hub.community/">the Sustainable and Interoperable Digital Identity (SIDI) Hub</a>, <a href="https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/foreign/">the Norwegian Tax Agency</a> and the <a href="https://www.digdir.no/digdir/about-norwegian-digitalisation-agency/887">Norwegian Digitalization Agency,</a> the workshop brought together policymakers, technical experts, and civil society actors from across Africa, Asia, and Europe to unpack what sovereignty truly means today, and how digital identity systems can be designed to respect it.</p>
<p>Through both moderating and contributing to this discussion, the OpenID Foundation demonstrated its dedication to advancing inclusive digital identity solutions globally.</p>
 From global principles to regional practice 
<p>The workshop was moderated by Gail Hodges, Executive Director of the OpenID Foundation and Co-Organizer of the SIDI Hub. She opened with an emphasis on the critical need for digital identity systems that enable cross border functionality, while reinforcing national autonomy over data, infrastructure, and policies.</p>
<p>Complementing this role, Naohiro Fujie, Chair of<a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/"> OpenID Foundation Japan</a>, provided substantial technical insights from Japan’s experience with <a href="https://openid.net/oidf-oidf-j-welcome-the-japanese-digital-agency-west-japan-railway-company-and-the-national-institute-of-informatics-student-vc-project/">cross border educational credentials</a> using open standards like<a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/"> OID4VCI/VP</a>. He also commented on Japan’s recent enablement of My Number Card with Apple ID in Wallet, Japan’s bilateral relationships with the European Union and Asian countries to advance interoperability across borders. Fujie-san’s contributions demonstrated how Japan’s approach to knowledge transfer, implementations with standards, and bilateral relationships can offer replicable models for African nations seeking to implement interoperable digital identity systems as well.</p>
<p>Similarly, Tor Alvik, Subject Director for Digital from the Norwegian government, elaborated on the learnings from both the Nordic and the Baltic countries participating in the Nobid alliance for cross border digital identity, and the practical challenges faced as early adopters of digital identity. Their pragmatic regional approach and learnings could also be of value to African peers seeking to accomplish similar objectives.</p>
 Digital identity as the foundation for inclusion 
<p>The session reinforced several fundamental principles that emerged from the expert panel discussions:</p>
 Digital identity serves as the gateway to inclusion 
<p>Without recognized digital identities, individuals remain digitally invisible and economically marginalized, unable to access essential services, including banking, education, healthcare, and mobility. Countries implementing early enrolment strategies, such as Nigeria’s National Identification Number (NIN) issuance at birth, demonstrate how to establish robust citizen registries that ensure long term inclusion and help bridge Africa’s digital divide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Successes in digital identity are not evenly distributed across countries or regions, so sharing best practices from leading countries, leading regions, and leading multi-stakeholder projects like Nigeria and the Sustainable and Interoperable Digital Identity (SIDI) Hub, can help close the gaps to benefit all jurisdictions and their residents.</p>
 Cross border interoperability is essential for regional economic integration 
<p>Interoperability of digital identity within a country, region or globally is not inevitable. It will require consistent, concentrated effort by stakeholders within jurisdictions and across jurisdictions to realize sustainable, and scalable outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to reach its full potential, seamless identity verification across borders must facilitate the free movement of people, goods, and services. Digital identity systems, therefore, need to be embedded within AfCFTA’s digital trade protocols, with successful national models providing blueprints for regional scaling. Learnings can be gleaned from within Africa like the ECOWAS project, as well as from outside Africa like the Nordic and the Baltic states Nobid project, the EU Digital Identity Wallet, and Japan’s bilateral relationships.&nbsp;</p>
 National sovereignty must be preserved within interoperable frameworks 
<p>Countries require strong data protection laws, robust trust frameworks, and regulatory alignment to maintain control over their citizens’ data. This balance demands sustained political will, institutional commitment, and tailored support that recognizes varying levels of digital readiness across African countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Efforts like SIDI Hub can help jurisdictions identify, and easily close, gaps in their policies compared to global best practices. Through careful and consistent approaches to policy and technology stacks, all jurisdictions, including those in Africa, can meet their domestic sovereignty goals, and their ambitions for pan-African and global trade.&nbsp;</p>
 Regional models and global lessons 
<p>The workshop highlighted successful implementations across different regions:</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.aficta.africa/about-us/aficta-board/100-dr-jimson-olufuye-profile">Dr. Jimson Olufuye of AfICTA</a> emphasized Africa’s strategic role in shaping the<a href="https://www.un.org/digital-emerging-technologies/global-digital-compact"> UN Global Digital Compact</a>, noting how principles of sovereignty and inclusiveness must be central to digital identity deployment under the AfCFTA framework.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amessinoukossi/">Dr. Kossi Amessinou from Benin’s Ministry of Economy and Finance</a> presented the ‘C’est Moi’ initiative, a government issued identity card offered free to citizens, as a concrete example of nationally led innovation that serves both policy objectives and inclusion goals while maintaining interoperability within the<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=ECOWAS%20region&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;ghc=1&amp;lq=0&amp;pq=ecowas%20region&amp;sc=12-13&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=BEDC9DDA939A4A238C2C9A01D855E5B9"> ECOWAS</a> region.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://nimc.gov.ng/nimc-management/director-general">Abisoye Coker-Adusote, Director General of Nigeria’s NIMC</a>, detailed the country’s integrated NIN ecosystem and its push toward digital ID interoperability at national, regional, and global levels, highlighting the importance of initiatives like the SIDI Hub’s trust framework mapping efforts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tor-alvik/">Tor Alvik Subject Director from Norway’s Agency for Public Management and eGovernment</a> contributed Nordic perspectives, sharing lessons from regional digital identity cooperation across the Baltics and Scandinavia. This included successful trust based models that maintain legal independence, while enabling shared infrastructure collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
 The SIDI Hub’s global impact 
<p><a href="https://sidi-hub.community/team/">Debora Comparin from the Secure Identity Alliance</a> outlined the SIDI Hub’s mission to co-develop sustainable, open, and interoperable digital ID solutions in collaboration with over 45 countries. The Hub’s work on<a href="https://sidi-hub.community/publications/#Topical%20reports"> use cases</a>, including refugee identification, digital education credentials, and opening a bank account, demonstrates how practical implementations can span continents, while embedding sovereignty by design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debora highlighted the work delivered to date (published at <a href="http://sidi-hub.community">here</a>) and the plan ahead, including a reference architecture to deliver digital identity interoperability for the African Cup/ Olympics ‘champion use case’, and a tool for scaling digital identity trust framework mapping.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Actionable pathways forward 
<p>The workshop identified concrete steps for accelerating progress:</p>
 
 Regional interoperability pilots could be encouraged between states with advanced systems, such as Nigeria and neighbouring countries, to provide practical insights into cross border functionality and identify implementation gaps. All panelists saw the value of a bias to concrete action like this by countries and regions.&nbsp; 
 National policies and implementations that leverage international standards will be on a fasttrack to enable domestic, regional and global interoperability while respecting sovereignty, trust framework mapping and compatibility with regional and global identity protocols. 
 Trust framework mapping within jurisdictions, and across regions and globally, is vital for cross border movement of people and trade. The efforts by SIDI Hub to study 10 jurisdictions’ trust frameworks and map them into shared values and characteristics can help not only align existing digital identity implementations, but the next wave of jurisdictions to map their own policies, identify gaps, and remediate those gaps with insights into current best practices. 
 Public and private collaboration, combined with citizen education campaigns, will build trust and demonstrate real world value through practical applications, like transportation discounts, healthcare access, and financial services. 
 
 Sustaining momentum through standards leadership 
<p>The session concluded with strong support for continuing SIDI Hub’s work, particularly in advancing open standards, reference architecture to enable interoperability, mapping trust frameworks, and multi-stakeholder engagement. The OpenID Foundation’s involvement, both as a convening force and technical contributor, demonstrates how standards organizations can drive meaningful progress in global digital identity adoption and interoperability.</p>
<p>As digital identity systems become foundational infrastructure for cross border trade, education, and financial inclusion, the collaborative approach demonstrated at IGF 2025 provides a blueprint for ensuring that interoperability and sovereignty work hand in hand. With appropriate standards, governance, and partnerships, developing and least developed countries can shape digital identity systems that are both globally connected and locally controlled.</p>
<p>Plans are afoot to continue the work between SIDI Hub and our Norwegian, Japanese and African partners&nbsp; to identify ways in which we might jointly address friction points in progress towards the introduction of an African Free Trade Area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workshop’s outcomes will inform ongoing policy and technical implementation across Africa and beyond, with the OpenID Foundation continuing to play a crucial role in facilitating the standards development and international cooperation necessary for inclusive digital transformation.</p>
<p>This blog post will be updated with the full rapporteur’s report shortly.&nbsp;</p><p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/balancing-sovereignty-and-interoperability/">Balancing sovereignty and interoperability</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID Foundation</a>.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to announce that Human Colossus Foundation (HCF) will participate in <a href="https://globaldigitalcollaboration.org/">GC25: Global Digital Collaboration on Wallets &amp; Credentials</a>, taking place on July 2, 2025. This important event, hosted by the Swiss Confederation, brings together leading organizations and innovators to shape the future of digital wallets, credentials, and interoperable identity systems.</p><p>At HCF, we believe that empowering individuals to control their own digital space is foundational to building a sustainable and trustworthy digital society. This vision is captured in our ongoing work around the concept of the Digital Self, as discussed in our blog post <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/digital-self-part-1">Self Actioning System, a preferred systematic embodiment of “Digital Self”</a>. Central to this idea is the belief that enabling global digital collaboration can only emerge when individuals have sovereignty over their credentials and interactions.</p> HCF on Governance in Digital Trade <p>As part of GC25, HCF will also participate in the panel discussion "Governance in Digital Trade – Decentralization as Response to Challenges in a Multi-Polar World." moderated by Stephan Wolf from the Verifiable.Trade Foundation and including the Digital Governance Institute, FIWARE, and the Asia PKI Consortium, we will bring forward the necessity of a digital governance able to consider the sovreignty of peer-to-peer connections in a multi-polar world. </p><p>The world is changing rapidly, placing supply chains and financial systems under increasing pressure. In a multi-polar landscape shaped by shifting tariffs and transformative AI, flexibility and speed have become essential. Digitalisation and open networks provide a clear path to inclusive global market participation. However, governance remains a largely overlooked but crucial topic.</p><p>This session will explore current initiatives but also deal with challenging questions. By examining these questions from different perspectives, the panel aims to bridge public and private demand to address the complexities of modern global trade.</p><p>HCF will contribute its perspective on how decentralized governance models, such as those enabled by the Dynamic Data Economy, can empower organizations and individuals alike.</p> Digital Self: Enabling Individual Agency <p>The Digital Self represents a shift from centralized data control to individual empowerment, allowing each person to define, manage, and protect their digital identity and data assets. Events like GC25 are critical because they convene diverse stakeholders to co-create frameworks and standards that make this shift possible — from verifiable credentials to interoperable wallets.</p> Introducing the Dynamic Data Economy <p>HCF is contributing to this discussion through the introduction of the Dynamic Data Economy (DDE), a groundbreaking approach outlined in our <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/dde-launch">launch announcement</a>. The DDE offers an infrastructure where data is not merely a static asset but a dynamic, contextual element that individuals can control and share on their terms.</p><p>This model supports privacy, promotes innovation, and opens the door to new economic models centered around consent and transparency — all essential ingredients for a human-centric digital future.</p> Looking Ahead <p>Our participation in GC25 aligns with our mission to advance data governance standards that prioritize individual autonomy. By collaborating with global leaders at this event, we aim to further the conversation on building infrastructures that respect and reinforce the Digital Self.</p><p>We invite all who share this vision to join us in exploring how we can collectively build a more equitable, dynamic, and user-controlled digital ecosystem.</p>





















  
  






  <p>Stay tuned for more updates from GC25 and beyond!</p>

<p>Apple this week provided a glimpse into a feature that solves one of the biggest drawbacks of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, the industry-wide standard for website and app authentication that isn’t susceptible to credential phishing and other attacks targeting passwords.</p>



<p>The import/export feature, which Apple&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/279/?time=1152">demonstrated</a>&nbsp;at this week’s Worldwide Developers Conference, will be available in the next major releases of iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and visionOS. It aims to solve one of the biggest shortcomings of passkeys as they have existed to date. Passkeys created on one operating system or credential manager are largely bound to those environments. A passkey created on a Mac, for instance, can sync easily enough with other Apple devices connected to the same iCloud account. Transferring them to a Windows device or even a dedicated credential manager installed on the same Apple device has been impossible.</p>

This plugin, developed by DSR Corporation, has been open sourced under the OpenWallet Foundation and extends ACA-Py with support for the Hedera network. Complementing this, a new Python SDK, now part of the LFDT-hosted Hiero project, provides developers with tools to manage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Hyperledger AnonCreds Verifiable Credentials on Hedera using the Hedera Consensus Service. Together, these contributions—spanning both the OpenWallet and Hiero ecosystems—anchor critical identity metadata to Hedera’s high-throughput, public distributed ledger and expand the reach of open source digital identity tooling.</p>

<p>The FIDO Alliance hosted its annual India Working Group (FIWG) Member Meetup &amp; Workshop on June 6, 2025, at Google’s Ananta campus in Bengaluru. With over 100 attendees representing leading technology companies, financial service providers, telecom operators, government agencies, retailers, and platform providers, the event served as an important forum for advancing phishing-resistant, passwordless authentication efforts in India.</p>



<p>The program began with welcome remarks from FIWG Chair Niharika Arora (Google) and Vice Chair Tapesh Bhatnagar (G+D), followed by a keynote address from FIDO Alliance President Sam Srinivas. Sam’s session offered a forward-looking overview of the global FIDO roadmap, covering recent progress in passkey adoption, certification, and platform interoperability, highlighted by many attendees as one of the most valuable sessions of the day.</p>







<p>Throughout the morning, FIWG member organizations shared implementation case studies drawn from real-world deployments. Christopher Clement Soris of Zoho Corporation presented lessons from integrating passkeys into enterprise workflows, emphasizing developer enablement and user trust. Vishu Gupta, Piyush Ranjan, and Deepak Singal of Times Internet shared insights into their journey deploying passkeys across consumer media platforms, with a focus on UX challenges and account recovery design. Shantanu Shirke of Mastercard showcased its Global Financial Framework (GFF) through a live demo of its FIDO-enabled authentication solution, and Simon Trac Do of VinCSS introduced applications of the FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) protocol for secure and scalable onboarding of IoT devices.</p>



<p>The Google Android and Chrome teams, including Niharika Arora, Eiji Kitamura, and Neelansh Sahai, provided updates on platform support for passkeys, highlighting recent enhancements to Android APIs, Chrome UX flows, and best practices for relying parties. These updates offered implementers concrete guidance on leveraging native OS features to enable seamless, secure sign-ins.</p>



<p>The event concluded with a panel discussion titled “Modern Authentication Meets Legacy Systems,” moderated by Niharika Arora and featuring Amit Mathur (Ensurity), Rooparsh Kalia (Mercari), Rahul Dani (Yubico), Tom Sheffield (Target), and Sam Srinivas (Google). The discussion addressed practical challenges in deploying FIDO-based authentication in environments with legacy infrastructure, including backward compatibility, account recovery, and risk trade-offs. Panelists shared candid reflections and emphasized the importance of phased integration strategies and cross-industry collaboration.</p>



<p>Compared to the 2024 edition, this year’s workshop reflected a clear evolution, from awareness-building to implementation maturity. While last year’s focus was largely on introducing the promise of passkeys and FIDO standards, the 2025 program emphasized operational insights, technical execution, and collaborative solutions.</p>







 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBxWnxt91Uw"></a>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBxWnxt91Uw">Watch the Highlight Video</a>] 



<p>Through post-event surveys, participants expressed strong appreciation for the event’s practical focus, noting the value of detailed case studies, direct access to platform teams, and the opportunity to connect with peers tackling similar challenges. Many described the in-person format as especially effective for fostering shared understanding and building momentum.</p>



<p>As passkey adoption continues to accelerate across India, the India Working Group remains a vital platform for aligning implementation efforts, exchanging knowledge, and enabling long-term deployment success. Sincere thanks to all speakers, panelists, and attendees for their contributions, and to Google for hosting us in Bengaluru. We look forward to continuing this important work together throughout 2025 and beyond.<br>*Read last year’s recap: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/recap-fido-alliance-india-working-group-meetup-workshop-joon-hyuk-lee-chc6c/?trackingId=jedKrY5JSmqNxKk9RSU9xA%3D%3D">2024 FIDO Alliance India Working Group Meetup and Workshop</a></p>

<p>The new implementation will enable seamless and secure transfer of passkeys across platforms, addressing previous limitations in transferring credentials between devices and applications. The system uses a standardized data schema developed by the FIDO Alliance to ensure compatibility between different credential manager apps across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS 26. The standardization is particularly significant as&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/google-urges-switch-to-passkeys-as-password-attacks-surge/">password-based attacks continue to rise</a>, pushing the industry toward more secure authentication methods.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34783/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a>&nbsp;has picked up in recent years. But the method drawing the most interest in security circles is physical security keys based on the FIDO2 standard.</p>



<p>These USB or NFC keys offer something beyond the usual passwordless methods, like synced device&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/passkey-passkey-authentication">passkeys</a>&nbsp;or biometric logins. Here, you’re not relying on cloud-stored credentials or browser memory. Instead, everything depends on holding the key and verifying it with something only you know, like a PIN or fingerprint.</p>



<p>This shift to hardware security keys is gaining momentum across industries. Dashlane, for instance, has just rolled out an update that enables users to make a FIDO2 key their main passwordless login for unlocking credential vaults.</p>



<p>In this article, we explore where <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passwordless authentication</a> stands today, what makes physical keys different, and how platforms are handling the hard parts like recovery, usability, and long-term security.</p>

<p>By co-chairs: Atul Tulshibagwale, <a href="https://sgnl.ai/">SGNL</a>, Tobin South, <a href="https://workos.com/">WorkOS</a> and <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a>, and Jeff Lombardo, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a></p>
<p>At the recently concluded Identiverse conference, prompted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jflombardo/">Jeff Lombardo</a> of AWS, a few of the attendees got together to discuss various security proposals relating to AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was clear that AI and identity communities have been developing in silos. Such disconnect risks repeating known pitfalls around privacy, security, and interoperability, and may delay the adoption of critical standards that could otherwise accelerate safe and trusted AI deployments. Existing standards only partially cover the emerging needs of AI agents, particularly around delegated authority, agent authentication, propagation and delegation of authorization between agents, and agent discovery and governance.</p>
<p>We realized that we needed a proper forum to discuss the rapidly changing landscape where existing standards, like OAuth 2.0, can help accelerate the AI community’s objectives, what use cases are critical paths, and how to close gaps in the current de facto standard and standards landscape standing at the intersection of AI and identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea of an OpenID Foundation Community Group was born there, not with the intent to control the narrative in a single standards body, but as a credible and open forum to bring conversations already happening and triage where to progress them further. To that end, it was agreed that discussions and deliverables from these conversations should lead to a shared roadmap and deliverables that progress in AI and identity forums, and within de facto standards efforts as well as open standards bodies like OIDF and its peers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together we hope to accelerate the delivery of critical paths and a consensus-based roadmap that helps accelerate the AI community, while leveraging the expertise of identity experts, averting known pitfalls and finding the shared path to ‘safe pastures.’</p>
<p>To say that there are a huge number of AI security proposals that touch upon identity in some way, is an understatement. A place where interested parties can freely discuss these proposals and ideas without having to worry about intellectual property concerns has, however, been missing – until now. Recognizing this, the OpenID Foundation Board approved the creation of a community group, named ‘Artificial Intelligence Identity Management’ (AIIM) following the <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/OIDF_CG-Operating-Rules_Final_2024-11-12.pdf">OIDF Community Group policy</a>.</p>
 What is a Community Group? 
<p>A Working Group (WG) in the OpenID Foundation tackles specific problem areas and delivers an output in the form of a specification, or series of specifications or documents. Community Groups (CGs) in the OpenID Foundation, on the other hand, are explicitly designed not to produce specifications, but to create a safe space to convene.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To progress discussions that can identify ecosystem gaps, adoption gaps, or that operate across working groups where all discussions and deliverables are protected by a mutually agreed CG Charter and Participation Agreement. If gaps in standards are identified they are brought to the relevant OIDF WG or liaison partner standards body. Because of the participation agreement requirement, participants can freely discuss ideas with work products protected by <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/OIDF-Policy_IPR-Policy_Final_2024-10-19.pdf">OIDF Intellectual Property</a> so the work is freely available to all. You can find the website for the website for the AIIM Community Group <a href="https://openid.net/cg/artificial-intelligence-identity-management-community-group/">here</a> with the link to the calls 9am Pacific Time Thursdays, and the Participation Agreement for the new AIIM CG <a href="https://openid.net/cg/artificial-intelligence-identity-management-community-group/artificial-intelligence-identity-management-participation-agreements/">here</a>.</p>
<p>There is no fee to participate in an OIDF CG, reducing the barriers for AI and identity experts to take part in the CG conversations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Aims of the AIIM CG 
<p>“AI is disrupting many dimensions of the internet…” So begins <a href="https://openid.net/cg/artificial-intelligence-identity-management-community-group/">the charter</a> of the AIIM CG.</p>
<p>This disruption spans social interactions, digital commerce, financial services, and the broader human/digital interface. However, as AI systems scale rapidly, a critical challenge is emerging. The AI and identity communities are largely developing in silos. This disconnect risks repeating known pitfalls around privacy, security, and interoperability, and may delay the adoption of critical standards that could otherwise accelerate safe and trusted AI deployments.</p>
<p>We will work to:</p>
 
 Identify areas that are not currently addressed by standards, but which need to be addressed and where the identity community needs to focus 
 Arrive at a consensus on terminology 
 Engage with the industry stakeholders, including major platform vendors 
 Define ‘Agentic AI champion use cases’ that trusted partner organizations can refer to or leverage in their work 
 Monitor government regulations regarding AI that impact identity 
 
<p>And work on an AI white paper, which the co-chairs are committed to authoring.</p>
<p>The AIIM CG will operate under the core principles of respect, privacy through consent, and interoperability, aiming to support scalable, inclusive, and trusted AI solutions. While it will not develop standards protocols directly, it will lay the essential groundwork for future standards development within OIDF or through liaison partnerships.</p>
 Proposers of the AIIM CG 
<p>Many thought leaders in the first Identiverse meeting and those working on the OIDF AI and Identity whitepaper have already signed up under their own initiative to support this CG formation. No commitment by their current employer should be assumed based on the proposed support by the individuals. The proposers include:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Gail Hodges&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Atul Tulshibagwale&nbsp; 
 George Fletcher&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Jeff Lombardo&nbsp; 
 Tobin South&nbsp; 
 Naveen CM&nbsp; 
 Aaron Parecki&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Sean O’Dell&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Nancy Cam-Winget&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Mike Kiser&nbsp; 
 Alexandre Babeanu&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 Why you should participate 
<p>If you need a safe space to discuss ideas related to AI and identity, this is it. Since the pace of development here is furious, we expect there to be a lot of noise, and as co-chairs, our job is to make sure we don’t lose focus on what really matters to the identity community. Join the AIIM CG by signing the participation agreement <a href="https://openid.net/cg/artificial-intelligence-identity-management-community-group/artificial-intelligence-identity-management-participation-agreements/">linked to here</a>.</p>
<p>We welcome everyone to join the regular weekly calls on Thursdays at 9 AM PT. See the <a href="https://openid.net/cg/artificial-intelligence-identity-management-community-group/">AIIM community group home page</a> to get the details. You can also subscribe to <a href="https://lists.openid.net/mailman/listinfo/openid-aiim">the AIIM CG mail list</a>, and if you are a contributor, post to it to discuss ideas. The OpenID Slack also has a channel for the AIIM CG.</p>
<p>Looking forward to amazing discussions here!</p>
 
 About the OpenID Foundation 
<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy-preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate.

<p>For modern IT or Internet users, logging in to a website or app using a password is all too familiar. Increasingly, however, passwords create security concerns as they can be easily cracked or stolen. This is where passwordless authentication provides a more secure and convenient alternative.</p>



<p>“Password fatigue is real. Users demand faster, frictionless ways to authenticate without remembering complex strings,” said Edwardcher Monreal, Principal Solutions Architect for IAM Consumer Authentication Solutions at HID.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is proud to spotlight a significant achievement in secure healthcare ecosystems: the implementation of the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/fapi-security-profile-2_0.html">FAPI 2.0</a> security profile across the entire <a href="https://www.nhn.no/">Norwegian Health Network (NHN)</a> via the new <a href="https://www.nhn.no/tjenester/helseid">HelseID</a> service. The OpenID Foundation is also very pleased to share that the NHN has decided to become a member of its community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owned by the Norwegian state under the Ministry of Health and Care Services, NHN is a national service provider within e-health, responsible for ensuring a secure and appropriate infrastructure for efficient interaction between all areas of the health and care services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never before has FAPI been adopted at such scale or outside of financial services. HelseID’s journey, from bespoke security requirements toward a unified, mandatory FAPI 2.0 profile for all participants, offers invaluable lessons for any sector grappling with large-scale API security and standardization.</p>
 HelseID and why it matters 
<p>HelseID is the central identity and access management platform operated by NHN, the organization that unites every healthcare provider in Norway, from the country’s largest hospitals to single-practitioner clinics, pharmacies, dental offices, and municipal health services. The use of any national e-health service requires membership to NHN, ensuring universal coverage. At full rollout, HelseID will support secure access across Norway’s healthcare system, enabling scalable authentication for solutions used by up to 50,000 healthcare organizations and approximately six million Norwegians.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically, various projects within Norway’s health sector had developed their own security profiles, resulting in fragmented requirements and costly, duplicated effort by vendors. HelseID replaces these disparate solutions with the FAPI 2.0 profile, a robust OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect-based standard. By aligning on FAPI 2.0, HelseID not only raises the bar for confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, but also taps into a mature ecosystem of libraries, conformance tools, and global best practices.</p>
 From custom profiles to mandatory FAPI 2.0 
<p>The transition began with NHN recognizing the unsustainable burden its proprietary security profiles placed on implementers and vendors. Rather than continue with a variety of incompatible implementations, NHN elected to adopt FAPI 2.0 wholesale, knowing that standardization would ultimately streamline development and maintenance, improve confidence in security controls and reduce the challenges of integrating so many organisations . This strategic shift required significant upfront work, rewriting internal guidance, training both NHN staff and external implementers, and developing client libraries tailored to HelseID’s specific needs. Despite these challenges, the NHN team remained steadfast in their belief that a shared standard would yield long-term benefits far exceeding the cost.</p>
<p>Understanding that an abrupt change could disrupt critical healthcare services, NHN is rolling out FAPI 2.0 in phases. All new APIs are required to support the profile from day one. Existing services are being migrated over time, often triggered by vendors releasing new feature versions or responding to deprecation notices. Importantly, NHN has adopted a firm ‘no-exceptions’ policy. Carve-outs were not permitted, and vendors were informed that any non-compliant services would eventually be phased out. This approach ensured momentum and kept security top-of-mind for implementers, while avoiding the chaos of a ‘big-bang’ switchover.</p>
 Scaling security and realizing the power of automated conformance testing 
<p>With 100 APIs in its view and 1800 clients that can access them, NHN faced a daunting challenge. They needed to verify that every relying party and identity provider adhered to FAPI 2.0’s exacting requirements. Manual testing, previously the norm, is time-consuming, costly, and unable to keep pace with the network’s expansion. The introduction of an automated conformance testing tool is transforming NHN’s security operations.</p>
<p>Implementers and vendors will receive immediate feedback on pass/fail criteria, drastically shortening development cycles. NHN’s own team uses the tooling to test its identity provider, uncovering minor gaps and collaborating with software providers and library maintainers to enhance compliance. As the network grows, the testing infrastructure needs to scale eliminating the need for proportional increases in security personnel. This automated approach not only accelerates the journey to full compliance, but also empowers implementers to build higher-quality, interoperable FAPI 2.0 implementations.</p>
<p>Importantly, while NHN’s current approach through automated testing has already elevated the quality of its implementations, there is a forward looking ambition. Both the OpenID Foundation and NHN team see additional opportunities to collaborate on certification and self-certification. By exploring and potentially adopting the OpenID Foundation’s conformance capabilities, NHN aims to further lower compliance burdens while aligning with global best practices and strengthening its security framework.</p>
 Real-world security gains and a transformative ‘aha’ moment 
<p>Perhaps the most compelling testament to FAPI 2.0’s value came from NHN’s own risk assessments. In one parallel health service project, the team conducted an initial assessment before implementing <a href="https://openid.net/fapi-2-0-conformance-tests-support-dpop/">FAPI 2.0’s DPoP</a> option and associated measures, and then repeated the assessment afterward.</p>
<p>The results were striking. Both the probability of token theft and the potential impact of any breach dropped dramatically. With DPoP, a stolen token becomes entirely unusable. It does not grant any access to data at all, rather than merely restricting access to a limited subset. This complete neutralization of the threat provided a transformative ‘aha’ moment, powerfully demonstrating to technical teams and organizational leadership that the investment in FAPI 2.0 was more valuable than originally anticipated.</p>
<p>In a system that handles such sensitive data and serves six million citizens, even modest decreases in breach likelihood and impact translate into significant real-world benefits.</p>
 The strategic value of standardization 
<p>Custom security profiles can offer early gains, but at scale they fragment ecosystems and multiply costs. By anchoring on FAPI 2.0, NHN has enabled its implementer community to leverage existing open-source and commercial client/server libraries, avoiding the need to build bespoke code for every new deployment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More significantly, HelseID benefits from the collective vigilance of the global OpenID Foundation&nbsp; community. This means that vulnerabilities discovered in similar implementations regardless of&nbsp; sector are disclosed and patched, alerting NHN to potential risks before they become public crises. This shared responsibility, underpinned by responsible disclosure procedures, reinforces HelseID’s resilience and reduces the burden on NHN to independently uncover every possible threat.</p>
 Building community and capacity 
<p>Security is not a one-off project, but an ongoing journey requiring people, process, and technology. NHN has cultivated a vibrant community around HelseID. A dedicated Slack channel offers real time support, enabling vendors to ask questions, share solutions, and learn from one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Academic partnerships have brought fresh talent and research into the fold, with two master’s students having contributed to library development and documentation, bolstering NHN’s capacity. A concerted effort to involve diverse voices, particularly women product owners and implementers, has ensured broad representation in decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, NHN has already held meetings with the Brazilian banking ecosystem to share experiences, and it collaborates closely with other public agencies in Norway. These interactions ensure that security, especially the use of OpenID Connect and OAuth2, is approached in a unified manner and that best practices are exchanged across borders.</p>
<p>The decision for NHN to join the OpenID Foundation is a further development of the effort to build community and capacity and will give the Norwegian Healthcare community greater access to the OpenID Foundation’s international community allowing the NHN team to benefit from that, and to give the benefit of their experiences back to the OpenID Foundation membership and contributors – essentially building a much bigger team.&nbsp;</p>
 Preparing for the next vulnerability 
<p>In late 2024, security researchers involved with the OpenID Foundation uncovered a theoretical vulnerability that presented a potential risk in HelseID’s DPoP implementation. Although no exploitation occurred, NHN seized the opportunity to refine its processes. By transparently communicating the issue, coordinating mitigating changes with clients, and documenting lessons learned, NHN practiced the procedures required for more urgent future fixes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This proactive stance underscores a critical truth: an ecosystem must be ready to respond swiftly. Because HelseID adheres to a standardized profile, coordinated upgrades are not just possible, they become routine exercises.</p>
 From HelseID to other ecosystems – lessons learned 
<p>HelseID’s full-scale adoption of FAPI 2.0 offers a roadmap for any sector seeking robust, scalable API security. The keys to success include selecting a mature, community-backed profile; planning a phased migration with clear, enforceable mandates; investing in automated conformance testing; and measuring tangible security gains to secure stakeholder buy-in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fostering a collaborative community through support channels, academic partnerships, and cross-sector dialogues, also builds the capacity and resilience required for ongoing improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A final lesson in this journey has been to embrace transparency around vulnerabilities and response preparations, in order to turn potential crises into opportunities for collective learning.</p>
<p>HelseID’s pioneering journey demonstrates that, with thoughtful planning, shared tooling, and an unwavering commitment to open standards, ecosystems of any size can achieve remarkable security improvements. The Norwegian Health Network’s embrace of FAPI 2.0 proves that the FAPI 2.0 profile is ready to safeguard patient records, emergency services, and every corner of a nationwide health system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation congratulates NHN on this achievement and looks forward to supporting other ecosystems as they follow in HelseID’s footsteps toward stronger, more interoperable API security whatever the sector they are in.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Matariki is a time for remembrance, celebration, and looking toward the future. Traditionally, Matariki was a time to honour ancestors, celebrate the harvest, and acknowledge the changing seasons.</p>



<p>Today, we stand at a pivotal moment where two transformative technologies – digital identity and artificial intelligence – are reshaping the fabric of society.&nbsp; As the marginal cost of knowledge approaches zero, decentralised systems offer abundance creation through co-operation, as opposed to sticking with a more traditional scarcity-based approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For DINZ members, the adoption playbook demands conscious choices: about focus, trade-offs, standards, and sovereignty. As local momentum builds around the world’s first decentralised credential identity ecosystem, the question is no longer whether disruption will occur – but how we collectively shape it, and who it serves. Perhaps Moby put it best in his 2002 song&nbsp;<a href="https://genius.com/Moby-we-are-all-made-of-stars-lyrics">“We are all made of stars.”</a></p>



<p>It is hard to believe we are still using multi-password sign-on and facsimiles of identity proofs in an era where nearly everything we do is online. For those frustrated by the pace of change, it is important to remember we’re building a system for 30 years, of which the past five years has been very much design and build. The next five years will be about driving adoption.</p>



<p>With a tsunami of digital credentials hitting global markets, the race to be “first to issue” DISTF accredited credentials is on!&nbsp; At the starting line are the DIA,<a href="https://nzta.govt.nz/about-us/app/">&nbsp;NZTA</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anthony-kemp-1823a833_digitalidentity-decentralizedid-airnewzealand-activity-7331960356912721920-xYEI?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAHxKLgBrtQdrwLhAiLxm2nGUcgL8XDyPu4">&nbsp;Air NZ</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/helen-littlewood-18b76b62_kiwiaccesscard-activity-7338074511315038209-Qhav?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAHxKLgBrtQdrwLhAiLxm2nGUcgL8XDyPu4">&nbsp;Hospitality NZ</a>, alongside other go-to-market models such as&nbsp;<a href="https://mattr.global/article/the-future-of-identity-is-interoperable-and-apple-just-stepped-in">Apple and Google’s online proxies.</a></p>

<p>Those fortunate enough to attend&nbsp;<a href="https://techweek.co.nz/news/digital-public-infrastructure-the-invisible-foundation-for-new-zealands-digital-future">Digital Public Infrastructure: The Invisible Foundation for NZ’s Digital Future</a>&nbsp;in the General Assembly room in Parliament would have heard Minister Collins deliver the powerful message that “digital identity is the key to unlocking productivity in New Zealand.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Minister’s call to action was compelling, raising the question of whether centralised apps are the answer for a citizen-centric experience at this particular technology inflection point still open for debate.</p>



<p>It is encouraging to see a shared understanding that the implementation of<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202504/new-zealand-issues-tender-for-digital-id-services-accreditation-infrastructure">&nbsp;digital public infrastructure</a>&nbsp;(DPI) will provide New Zealanders with an inclusive,<a href="https://unifysolutions.net/news/the-future-is-verifiable-rethinking-digital-identity-connected-nation/">&nbsp;future-ready trust layer</a>&nbsp;that enhances privacy, security, provenance and fraud prevention, while preserving Aotearoa’s economic sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, an interoperable<a href="https://mattr.global/article/the-benefits-of-decentralised-identity-for-your-organisation">&nbsp;decentralised identity ecosystem</a>&nbsp;will support the profound productivity improvements presented by hyperscale AI, without diminishing human agency by moving our data (and your soul) into someone else’s “cloud”.</p>



<p>Digital Trust Hui Taumata – Update<br><br>We have secured the world’s foremost native digital credential architect and builder James Monaghan to deliver the international keynote and host roundtable discussions at the Digital Trust Hui at Te Papa on 12 August, 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>This must-attend identity conference promises to be more “Doey” than Hui. Our valued sponsors will showcase the most exciting identity projects in this space, and show how accelerating adoption of Trust Technology can help mitigate concerns around AI-related risks.<br><br>Roundtable discussions are currently being shaped around four key focus areas:</p>



 
 Regulatory barriers to change&nbsp;(public policy enablers such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/document/00HOHPBReferenceStOrdersChapter5BOmnibus1">omnibus bills&nbsp;</a>to allow digital identity implementation)

<p>The Census Goes Digital: A Shift Towards Data-Driven Public Infrastructure</p>



<p>Stats NZ has officially retired the traditional census, opting instead for a new approach that leverages integrated administrative data. This marks a significant shift in how the government collects and uses trusted digital information – reinforcing the need for secure, privacy-preserving identity systems to ensure accuracy, inclusion, and transparency. It’s a timely reminder of the critical role digital identity plays in building smarter, citizen-centric public services.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in-depth/564560/the-traditional-census-has-been-switched-off-what-happens-now">Read the full RNZ article</a>.</p>

<p>As the new Chair of the Executive Council of Digital Identity NZ, I am looking forward to leading a passionate and future-focused community working to build a trusted, inclusive, and interoperable digital identity ecosystem for New Zealand, building on the impressive work the Executive Council has done over the past few years&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a background in executive leadership across public service and advisory roles I have advocated for and delivered the transformative potential of digital identity as public infrastructure. Whether enabling seamless access to services, supporting mobility and consent, or underlining trust in our digital economy, identity – in all of its forms – is foundational to a modern, resilient society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DINZ plays a crucial convening role across government, iwi, industry, and civil society. As Chair, my focus is to champion practical progress: supporting policy and technical frameworks that uphold te ao Māori perspectives on identity, ensuring identity solutions reflect the needs of all New Zealanders, and advocating for interoperability that positions us as globally connected and locally grounded.</p>



<p>Our mission is urgent and clear: to enable every person in Aotearoa to participate safely and confidently in the digital world. I look forward to working with all our members to realise that vision.</p>

<p>In a world where AI can create photos, videos, and even voices that look and sound&nbsp;real, how do we know what to trust?</p>
<p>Every day, more content we see online is generated or altered by AI. That’s not always a bad thing. AI can help us create amazing art, get work done faster, or imagine new possibilities. But it also opens the door to misinformation, impersonation, and confusion. When anyone can create content that looks authentic, how do we tell what’s&nbsp;actually&nbsp;real?</p>
<p>To enhance human trust in AI systems and explore how AI itself can be used to address complex trust challenges in digital ecosystems, Trust over IP (ToIP), a project of LF Foundation Decentralized Trust, has launched a new&nbsp;<a href="https://lf-toip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/22982892/AI+Human+Trust+Working+Group">AI and Human Trust (AIM) Working Group</a>. It builds on the work done over the past three years by ToIP’s AIM task force.</p>
<p>The recently released white paper from the working group,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/insights">ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP): Strengthening Trust in Human and AI Interactions</a>, offers a way forward for building, maintaining and verifying interactions involving AI technologies. It brings together three powerful tools, the&nbsp;Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP)1, the C2PA Specification2, and the work of the&nbsp;Creator Assertion Working Group (CAWG)3,&nbsp;to build a system of&nbsp;authenticity&nbsp;for the digital world.</p>
<p>The key components include:</p>
 
 TSP (Trust Spanning Protocol)&nbsp;provides a strong foundation for&nbsp;online&nbsp;trust&nbsp;between people, platforms, and tools—making sure that when something claims to come from someone, it actually does. (The “Connector”) 
 The&nbsp;C2PA Specification&nbsp;is a growing standard that helps attach a digital “nutrition label” to content—showing when it was made, how it was edited, and by what capture devices or software. (The “How” and the “What”) 
 CAWG (Creator Assertion Working Group at DIF)&nbsp;focuses on making sure that individual and organizational content creators can identify themselves with their content and provide additional information for their audience to understand their content. (The “Who”) 
 
<p>Why do we need all three? Because content authenticity isn’t just about how something is created. It’s also about who made it, and how it gets communicated through public networks while retaining the integrity of actions made to it. C2PA gives us technical metadata about tools and edits. CAWG ensures the&nbsp;human&nbsp;creator is identified and attributed. And TSP makes the entire chain, from camera or AI tool to multiple individual human collaborators to final distribution platform,&nbsp;trustworthy at every step. Together, they provide a complete system covering creation, collaboration, and distribution.</p>
<p>All put together, these can help us answer the most important question about this digital artifact:&nbsp;Can I trust this?</p>
<p>This isn’t just a technical fix. It’s a new way to think about digital truth. And the paper lays out a path toward a future where users can more confidently trust the source and actions made to digital content in a way that’s accountable, verifiable, and respectful of creators.</p>
<p>Read the full white paper&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/TSP_-Strengthening-Trust-in-Human-and-AI-Interactions.pdf?__hstc=120149271.6fc006fbce007331eaf097b0a04878d3.1750343514535.1750343514535.1750343514535.1&amp;__hssc=120149271.7.1750343514535&amp;__hsfp=934097154">here</a>.</p>
<p>We invite technologists, developers, artists, policy makers, and everyday internet users to take a look. It’s about restoring trust in a world where AI has blurred the lines of what is real and what is artificially generated.</p>
 
<p>1.&nbsp;Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP) is an ongoing work by Trust over IP (ToIP), a project of LFDT:&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification/">https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification</a><br>
2.&nbsp;The C2PA Specification is an ongoing work by The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA):&nbsp;<a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/index.html?__hstc=120149271.6fc006fbce007331eaf097b0a04878d3.1750343514535.1750343514535.1750343514535.1&amp;__hssc=120149271.7.1750343514535&amp;__hsfp=934097154">https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/index.html</a><br>

So it’s serious stuff.</p>
 
 Here’s one graphic from the piece, with its caption: 
 
 
 
 <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/research/envisioning-recommendations-on-an-llm-based-agent-platform/"></a><p>Illustration of the Rec4Agentverse. The left side depicts three roles in the RecAgentverse: the user, the Agent Recommender, and Item Agents, along with their interconnected relationships. In contrast to traditional recommender systems, the Rec4Agentverse has more intimate relationships among the three roles. For instance, there are multi-round interactions between 1) users and Item Agents and 2) the Agent Recommender and Item Agents. The right side demonstrates how the Agent Recommender can collaborate with Item Agents to affect the information flow of users and offer personalized information services.</p> 
 
 
 With VRM, however, we need our own personal AI agents, and useful data that’s not limited to what’s gathered by surveillance (which we can assume is most if not all of the Information layer). 
 
 So I started a conversation with ChatGPT. I’ll divide it into sections: 
 
 Who wrote the CACM piece 
 The state of recommendation science 
 Who is working on personal AI 
 How one can get started 
 Forms of personal data to manage 
 
<p>There’s a lot here. The meat of it, for ProjectVRM purposes, starts in section 3. (The first two are more about what we’re up against.) Please read the whole thing and help us think through where to go with the challenge facing us. As we see in section 3, we do have&nbsp;some stuff on our side.</p>
 1. Who wrote the CACM piece 
 
 Me: 
 
 Can you tell me more about the authors here: https://cacm.acm.org/research/envisioning-recommendations-on-an-llm-based-agent-platform/? 
 
 ChatGPT: 
<blockquote>
 
 &nbsp;Jizhi Zhang 
 
<p>Affiliation: University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Data Science Lab (inferred from USTC page)&nbsp;<a href="https://data-science.ustc.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/15/04/5380/template5380/publication/cacm-zjz.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cacm.acm.org+14data-science.ustc.edu.cn+14x.com+14</a>.<br>
Research Interests: Recommendation systems, LLM-based agent platforms, and interactive intelligent systems—his lead authorship and continued work on Prospect Personalized Recommendation on LLM-Based Agent Platform&nbsp;(arXiv Feb 2024) reinforce this&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18240?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>.</p>

Expertise: A mix of recommender system design, LLM-agent evaluation, multimedia analysis, and human-AI interaction—reflecting a blend of USTC’s strengths and CACM relevance&nbsp;<a href="https://cacm.acm.org/section/research/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">data-science.ustc.edu.cn+8cacm.acm.org+8data-science.ustc.edu.cn+8</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18240?utm_source=chatgpt.com">linkedin.com+4arxiv.org+4researchgate.net+4</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 &nbsp;Wanhong Xu 
 
<p>Affiliation: USTC Data Science Lab (USTC LDS), contributor to the same article&nbsp;.<br>
Role: Emerging researcher whose latest publication is this Rec4Agentverse article, indicating an early-career focus in LLM-based recommender systems&nbsp;<a href="https://data-science.ustc.edu.cn/_upload/tpl/15/04/5380/template5380/publication/cacm-zjz.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">linkedin.com+8data-science.ustc.edu.cn+8linkedin.com+8</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
  Broader Context &amp; Contributions 
 
<p>The group operates at the intersection of&nbsp;Large Language Models, agent-oriented systems, and recommender systems, pioneering a&nbsp;Rec4Agentverse paradigm&nbsp;that treats LLM-powered agents as “recommendable” items collaborating with one another—an evolution of traditional recommendation frameworks<a href="https://cacm.acm.org/research/envisioning-recommendations-on-an-llm-based-agent-platform/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cacm.acm.org+5cacm.acm.org+5cacm.acm.org+5</a>.<br>
Their work continues earlier research (e.g.,&nbsp;Prospect Personalized Recommendation…&nbsp;in Feb 2024), solidifying their ongoing commitment to expanding intelligent, conversational recommendation platforms&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18240?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
  Why This Matters 
 
<p>Academic Thought Leadership: Jizhi Zhang and colleagues are pushing forward thinking about how recommendations can evolve when&nbsp;agents—not passive items—are central.<br>
Institutional Backing: All deeply connected to&nbsp;USTC’s Data Science Lab, underscoring strong Chinese academic investment in AI-driven recommender innovation.<br>
Collaborative Reach: Including scholars like Tat‑Seng Chua broadens the research to include international perspectives in multimedia and retrieval systems.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In summary: This team is a multidisciplinary cohort—centered at USTC with international collaboration—who are pioneering the idea that&nbsp;LLM agents can become interactive, dynamic items in recommender systems. Their work positions them at the forefront of intelligent agent systems and could reshape how platforms personalize experiences in the future.</p>
 
 
<p>If you’re curious about any individual’s past publications, citation impact, or related work (e.g., on Agent4Rec), I’d be happy to dive deeper!</p>

<p>ChatGPT:</p>
 
<blockquote>
 
<p>The&nbsp;science of recommendations, particularly within the AI field, is not just&nbsp;emerging—it’s a&nbsp;massive, rapidly evolving subfield&nbsp;that is both academically rich and commercially dominant. That said, it’s also entering a&nbsp;new phase, driven by the rise of&nbsp;large language models (LLMs),&nbsp;interactive agents, and&nbsp;multimodal platforms.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
  Academic Scope 
 
 
 1.&nbsp;Established Field: Recommender Systems 
 
<p>Recommender systems (RecSys) are a well-developed domain within AI and machine learning, with roots in the&nbsp;1990s.<br>
Annual conferences like:<br>
ACM RecSys&nbsp;(since 2007)<br>
SIGIR,&nbsp;KDD,&nbsp;WSDM, and&nbsp;NeurIPS&nbsp;regularly feature recommendation research.<br>
Thousands of papers annually on topics like:<br>
Collaborative filtering<br>
Matrix/tensor factorization<br>
Deep learning for recommendation<br>
Fairness, transparency, and explainability in RecSys<br>
Reinforcement learning and bandit algorithms for personalization</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p> As of 2024, over&nbsp;60,000 papers&nbsp;in academic databases (e.g., Google Scholar) are tagged or indexed under “recommender systems”.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
 
 
 
  Current Trends &amp; Expanding Frontiers 
 
 
 2.&nbsp;LLMs + Recommendation = New Subfield 
 
<p>A&nbsp;major shift&nbsp;is underway: integrating&nbsp;Large Language Models (LLMs)&nbsp;into recommendation systems.<br>
These go beyond “you may also like” to:<br>
Use&nbsp;natural language context&nbsp;and dialogue<br>
Generate&nbsp;explanations, not just rankings<br>
Support&nbsp;conversational recommendation<br>
Coordinate&nbsp;agent ecosystems, e.g., multi-agent reasoning environments</p>
 
<p>Example paradigms:</p>
 
<p>RecMind&nbsp;– reasoning-aware recommendation agents<br>
Rec4Agentverse&nbsp;– treating agents as recommendable entities<br>
ChatRecs&nbsp;– integrating LLMs into live user conversations</p>
 
 
 
 
 3.&nbsp;Multimodal &amp; Multitask Integration 
 
<p>Systems increasingly blend&nbsp;text, image, video, behavior, and&nbsp;user feedback.<br>
LLMs allow richer personalization using&nbsp;complex user intent&nbsp;derived from unstructured data.</p>
 
 
 
 
 4.&nbsp;Industry Investment 
 
<p>FAANG companies (especially YouTube, Netflix, Amazon, TikTok, and Spotify) base their core user experience on&nbsp;AI-driven recommendation.<br>
Billions of dollars are spent optimizing:<br>
Ranking quality<br>
Engagement prediction<br>
Real-time inference<br>
Federated and privacy-preserving personalization</p>

  In Summary 
 
 
<p>The&nbsp;science of recommendation&nbsp;is:</p>
 
<p>Not new, but rapidly&nbsp;evolving<br>
Core to AI applications, especially with LLMs and agents<br>
One of the most commercially and socially impactful domains&nbsp;in modern AI<br>
Growing into new subfields&nbsp;(e.g. Rec4Agentverse, LLM Rec, multi-agent Rec)</p>

 3. Who is working on personal AI 
 
 Me: 
 
 And who, if anyone, is working to provide customers with their own personal AI tools: ones that work for them, to empower their own agency in the marketplace? By which I mean truly personal AI, and not the kind personalized by some external LLM (or similar) system. 
 
 ChatGPT: 
<blockquote>
 
<p>That’s an essential and forward-looking question—especially as most “AI for you” today really means&nbsp;“AI about you, for someone else.”</p>
 
 
<p>While Big Tech firms dominate&nbsp;personalized AI, a growing ecosystem is focused on&nbsp;truly personal AI—that is,&nbsp;AI you own, that&nbsp;works&nbsp;for you&nbsp;(not advertisers or platforms), and that&nbsp;enhances your agency&nbsp;in the marketplace and your life.</p>
 
 
<p>Here are the most notable&nbsp;people, projects, and initiatives&nbsp;advancing&nbsp;truly personal AI&nbsp;today:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
  1.&nbsp;Kwaai and pAI-OS&nbsp;(South Africa / Global) 
 
<p>Kwaai&nbsp;is building an open-source, user-sovereign personal AI OS called&nbsp;pAI-OS.<br>
Designed to&nbsp;run locally or at user discretion, with full&nbsp;data ownership,&nbsp;modular agent systems, and&nbsp;plugin capability.<br>
Aligns with&nbsp;IEEE P7012 (“MyTerms”)&nbsp;privacy standards (see below).<br>
Actively exploring&nbsp;intentcasting,&nbsp;customer signaling, and&nbsp;VRM&nbsp;(Vendor Relationship Management).<br>
Site:&nbsp;<a href="https://kwaai.ai/">https://kwaai.ai</a></p>
 
 
 
 
  2.&nbsp;Indie AI and Personal Agent projects 
 
 
<p>Several smaller open-source initiatives are trying to build&nbsp;personal agent toolkits&nbsp;that you can host and configure:</p>
 
 
 Examples: 
 
<p>AutoGen Studio (Microsoft)&nbsp;– allows building agent workflows, some of which can be user-defined.&nbsp;But it’s not yet fully personal or private.<br>
Langroid&nbsp;– open-source framework for local agent-based LLM systems. Designed for extensibility, can be made personal with effort.<br>
OpenDevin,&nbsp;Superagent,&nbsp;Auto-GPT&nbsp;– can be self-hosted, though most are still tool-centric rather than user-centric.<br>
Personal.ai&nbsp;– A commercial startup that&nbsp;says&nbsp;it is personal, but uses centralized storage and fine-tuning, so actual user control is limited.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;Reality check: Most of these still rely on external LLMs (like OpenAI or Anthropic), even if they&nbsp;claim&nbsp;to be “your AI”.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
  3.&nbsp;Solid Project&nbsp;(by Tim Berners-Lee) 
 
<p>While not AI per se,&nbsp;Solid&nbsp;is a&nbsp;decentralized identity and data storage architecture&nbsp;that allows individuals to store their own data in&nbsp;personal data pods.<br>
AI tools can be layered on top to access only the data you choose to share.<br>
Foundation for&nbsp;personal AI assistants&nbsp;that can work&nbsp;with your data, not on others’ clouds.<br>
<a href="https://solidproject.org/">https://solidproject.org</a></p>
 
 
 
 
  4.&nbsp;IEEE P7012 – MyTerms 
 
<p>A standard being developed to&nbsp;flip the notice-and-consent regime—so individuals, not companies, dictate the terms of data use.<br>
Backed by&nbsp;Customer Commons&nbsp;and designed to support&nbsp;intentcasting&nbsp;and&nbsp;personal marketplace signaling.<br>
This enables&nbsp;a personal AI to serve as your agent, enforcing your terms and engaging the marketplace on your behalf.</p>
 
 
 
 
  5.&nbsp;Project VRM&nbsp;(Vendor Relationship Management) 
 
<p>Initiated by&nbsp;<a href="https://projectvrm.org/">Doc Searls</a>&nbsp;to empower&nbsp;customers with tools to manage vendors, not just the reverse.<br>
Envisions&nbsp;personal tools (including AI)&nbsp;to:<br>
Signal intent<br>
Manage service contracts<br>
Retain records of offers, purchases, warranties<br>
Avoid manipulation, surveillance, and lock-in</p>
 
<p>Project VRM is not a software project per se, but a&nbsp;framework&nbsp;guiding developers to build personal tools that support individual autonomy.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
  6.&nbsp;Open-source LLM stacks for local use 
 
 
<p>Several local LLM projects can be&nbsp;combined with personal data layers&nbsp;to build truly personal AI:</p>
 
<p>LM Studio&nbsp;– runs local models on desktop<br>
PrivateGPT&nbsp;– local inference + local documents<br>
Ollama&nbsp;– macOS-native interface for fast-running models like LLaMA, Mistral<br>
LangChain / LlamaIndex&nbsp;– frameworks for building RAG systems with local documents</p>
 
<p>These aren’t personal AI&nbsp;systems&nbsp;yet—but they are&nbsp;key ingredients.</p>

  The Gap 
 
 
<p>Despite this promising landscape,&nbsp;no major platform today delivers a fully integrated, easy-to-use personal AI&nbsp;that you own, configure, and direct—yet. But:</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
<p>A personal AI revolution is underway, led by privacy advocates, open-source communities, and a few visionary developers—not Big Tech.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Would you like help putting together a DIY stack for your own personal AI toolkit based on this landscape?</p>
 
</blockquote>
 Me: 
 
 Can you name some of the people in the personal AI revolution, and tell me what that DIY stack would contain? 
 
 ChatGPT:

</blockquote>
 
 
 4. How can I get started?  
 
 Me: 
 
 Yes. My technical skill level is modest at best. I can write HTML and do very basic stuff in the command line. I have an extra laptop I can devote to solo work, and Ethernet to a 2.1GB/s symmetrical fiber connection to the Internet with no data limits. 
 
 
 ChatGPT: 
<blockquote>
 
 
<p>Great — with your setup (modest technical skills, spare laptop, blazing-fast fiber), you’re in an excellent position to begin building a&nbsp;practical personal AI system&nbsp;without diving too deep into complex dev work. Here’s a recommended stack tailored to&nbsp;your current skills and goals:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  YOUR PERSONAL AI STARTER STACK (2025) 
 
 
 
 
  1.&nbsp;Platform Base 
 
 
 
 
<p>Use a&nbsp;Linux distribution&nbsp;designed for ease of use and AI tinkering:</p>
 
 
<p>Recommended:&nbsp;<a>Pop!_OS</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 24.04<br>
</a>Easy GUI, good hardware compatibility, lots of online support<br>
Optional: Use your laptop in&nbsp;“air-gapped” mode&nbsp;for privacy and full local control</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  2.&nbsp;Run a Local LLM with LM Studio 
 
 
<p><a href="https://lmstudio.ai/">LM Studio</a>&nbsp;(macOS/Windows/Linux) lets you&nbsp;run LLaMA 3,&nbsp;Mistral,&nbsp;Phi-3, and others&nbsp;without coding.<br>
Built-in UI — chat with models locally, no internet required after download.<br>
You can download 7B or 13B models based on your hardware.<br>
Best for: private journaling, summarizing files, answering questions.</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;Why it’s ideal for you:</p>
 
 
<p>GUI-based<br>
Just click and download models<br>
No API keys or command-line needed once installed</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  3.&nbsp;Chat with Your Files (PrivateGPT / LlamaIndex) 
 
 
<p>PrivateGPT&nbsp;or&nbsp;GPTPilot&nbsp;can let you ask questions across PDFs, emails, and notes stored on your machine.<br>
Start simple: drop files into a folder, let the AI index them.<br>
Optionally install via Docker&nbsp;(one command), or use their prebuilt apps.</p>
 
 
<p> Use case:</p>
 
 
<p>“Summarize this research PDF”<br>
“What did I write about project X last month?”<br>
“Find the email where someone mentioned a refund”</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  4.&nbsp;Knowledge Base + Journaling with Obsidian 
 
 
<p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>&nbsp;= Markdown-based knowledge base.<br>
Everything you write stays local.<br>
You can point LM Studio to your notes to&nbsp;query your own memory.</p>
 
 
<p> Easy way to:</p>
 
 
<p>Keep private journals<br>
Index your life<br>
Ask your AI things like “What are my goals for June?”</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  5.&nbsp;Personal Data Management with Datasette 
 
 
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>&nbsp;by Simon Willison lets you&nbsp;browse and query your own data&nbsp;with simple SQL and CSV files.<br>
Feeds AI with structured personal info (purchases, inventory, plans, etc.)<br>
You can install it with a single terminal command:<br>
bash<br>
CopyEdit<br>
<code>pip install datasette datasette serve your-data.db<br>
</code><code>datasette serve your-data.db</code></p>
 
 
<p> Combine with LM Studio to get responses like:</p>
 
 
<p>“What subscriptions do I need to cancel?”<br>
“When did I last back up my photos?”</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  6.&nbsp;Optional: Browser Helper Agent (Local, Simple) 
 
 
<p>Use&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT">AutoBrowser</a>&nbsp;or a simpler Puppeteer script to&nbsp;automate browsing tasks&nbsp;(like checking prices, news, account activity).<br>
Start with prebuilt scripts. No coding needed if you copy/paste working examples.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  7.&nbsp;Privacy Boosters 
 
 
<p>Run&nbsp;Tailscale&nbsp;or&nbsp;WireGuard&nbsp;to access your AI remotely if needed.<br>
Use&nbsp;LocalAI&nbsp;or&nbsp;Ollama&nbsp;if you later want to run everything without GUI (more advanced).</p>

 5. Forms of personal data to manage 
 
 Me: 
 
 The personal data I need to manage are health records (from 20-plus providers), financial records (fewer than health), travel records (including the kind kept by apps that watch my movements), subscriptions and other recurring payments, shows I have watched and on what channels or services (data gathered by my Samsung and Roku TVs and presumably shared with others but to which I don’t yet have access), continuing work and work history with various clients and employers, contacts, archival and current calendars, real estate, personal items bought or acquired from various sources and where they are kept or stored, and business dealings. What would be the file structure for all that, and how would I manage it? Note that I am not talking about shopping yet; that’s a separate concern. 
 
 ChatGPT: 
 
<p>Thanks for the detailed breakdown — you’re describing the foundation of a&nbsp;true personal data architecture: structured, queryable, and under your control. Let’s build you a&nbsp;file structure and management strategy&nbsp;that matches your needs&nbsp;without overcomplicating the tech.</p>
 
  Recommended Top-Level Folder Structure 
<p>This folder structure is designed to be&nbsp;future-proof,&nbsp;machine-readable, and&nbsp;human-usable. Use&nbsp;plain folders,&nbsp;CSV/JSON/Markdown files, and optional&nbsp;SQLite databases&nbsp;to store structured data. You can later layer tools (like LLMs or Datasette) on top.</p>

  Strategy for Managing It All 
 1.&nbsp;Use Consistent File Types 
 
 



Data Type
File Format




Structured entries
<code>.csv</code>,&nbsp;<code>.json</code>,&nbsp;<code>.sqlite</code>


Notes or logs
<code>.md</code>&nbsp;(markdown)


Documents
<code>.pdf</code>,&nbsp;<code>.docx</code>,&nbsp;<code>.txt</code>


Images/attachments
store in&nbsp;<code>attachments/</code>&nbsp;subfolder per topic



 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.&nbsp;Naming Conventions (Machine + Human Friendly) 
<p>Use ISO-like formats to make things sortable and parseable:</p>
 
 yaml 
 
 
 CopyEdit 
 
 
 <code>2024-06-16_labresults_providerX.csv<br>
2023_Q4_taxes_federal.pdf<br>
clientA_2022-11_contract.pdf</code> 
 
 
 3.&nbsp;Data Capture Tools 
<p>You don’t need to build it all manually:</p>
 
 
<p>Use&nbsp;Obsidian&nbsp;for ongoing notes (e.g. travel journal, work logs)</p>
 
 
<p>Use&nbsp;Paperless-ngx&nbsp;(optional) to OCR and tag your scanned PDFs (health, finance)</p>
 
 
<p>Use&nbsp;GPS History Export&nbsp;from Google and Apple for travel/locations</p>
 
 
<p>Use&nbsp;email filters or Zapier&nbsp;to auto-download bills, statements, confirmations</p>
 
 
 
 4.&nbsp;Querying and Reviewing 
<p>Add one or more of these later:</p>
 
 
<p>Datasette&nbsp;→ browse and search CSVs/SQLite locally</p>
 
 
<p>LM Studio&nbsp;+ PrivateGPT → ask, “When did I last visit Dr. Chen?” or “What devices are in storage?”</p>
 
 
<p>LlamaIndex&nbsp;→ index your file tree and let AI search/summarize it</p>
 
 
 
  Summary of Benefits

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, June 18, 2025 –&nbsp;A shared commitment to community and service led to a meaningful partnership between Edge, a nonprofit organization that recently transitioned to a fully virtual workforce, and MENTOR Newark, a local organization dedicated to supporting youth through mentoring and empowerment programs.</p>
<p>When Edge found itself with available office space, it began the search for a subtenant. A mutual business contact introduced Edge’s Executive Director of Human Resources and Administration, Amy Olavarria, to Thomas Owens, Executive Director of MENTOR Newark. Olavarria elaborates, “We had been working with a realtor to sublease the space but couldn’t find a good match, until we were introduced to Thomas and learned about his organization’s mission and their need for a new headquarters,” said Olavarria. “I’ve met several of the young adults in the program, and they’re all so mature, motivated, and well-mannered. It’s inspiring to see, and MENTOR Newark is truly an incredible organization.”</p>
<p>Previously located in a lower-level space in the same building, MENTOR Newark had involved its students in renovating their former office, so the move came with some uncertainty. “Our students were deeply involved in creating the previous space, so I wasn’t sure how they would connect with the new one,” admitted Owens. “But when they walked in, they immediately saw the possibilities and were genuinely excited. They appreciated the new amenities, including the kitchen, private bathrooms, and most importantly, their own dedicated area called the Student Office.”</p>
<p>That sense of ownership was on full display during an open house in April 2025, where community members gathered to tour the space and meet the young leaders of MENTOR Newark. “People were moved, and saw the students taking responsibility for the space, engaging with guests, and leading parts of the event,” shares Owens. “There was dancing, laughter, and a strong sense of pride. When people learned it all came together through a partnership between two nonprofits, it left a lasting impression.”</p>
<p>For Edge, the partnership with MENTOR Newark was a natural extension of its mission and community commitment. “Edge is honored to have Thomas and his organization in this space,” adds Olavarria. “Even though MENTOR Newark and Edge are two nonprofits in different industries, we share a common goal: to help and serve the people in our communities and beyond. Working with MENTOR Newark is perfectly aligned with Edge’s brand promise of CONNECTED. COMMITTED. COMMUNITY. I attended their grand opening, and the atmosphere was one of home, community, and acceptance—regardless of age or background. It was a powerful feeling of unity and peace.”</p>

  v1.1 specification integrates the novel Identity Aggregator mechanism

<div class='wrap'>

<p>v1.1 of the 3 specifications includes one powerful new moving part</p> <p>As CAWG activity picks up steam at DIF, there are a few details the rest of DIF and the broader community of decentralizers might want to be tracking: </p>  The specification includes a powerful new indirection called an Identity Aggregator, which designates an external authority to translate a long-lived identifier embedded in signed credentials (at time of publication) to one or more identifiers with local significance anywhere an asset is used (at time of republication or consumption).  Industry-specific identifier schemes are being researched by a distinct task force within the group for prototyping and getting adoption in media verticals.  Registering/organizing external metadata standards and DID interop are on-going discussions.   Wait, what Working Group is this? <p>If you're following from a distance, you have a vague sense that CAWG is a DIF working group doing something-something C2PA. If that distance is a long distance, you might know C2PA is a big-name, media-authenticity initiative with many mega-corporations signed on. The reality is actually more decentralized than meets the eye: CAWG is specifying open-world extension points that use Verifiable Credentials to let all kinds of claims and all kinds of actors embed metadata and rights declarations in C2PA documents, not just the big boys. </p><p>As the name would imply, "creators" is a capacious term which includes influencers, independents, rights-holders unions, creative agencies, freelancers, and even anonymous social media microcelebrities alike. The extension points and interoperability mechanisms this group is working on bring verifiability at various scales at once, and to various kinds of ecosystems and markets. The "Assertions" that these creators are inserting into signed C2PA manifests embedded in professional media assets are the open-world extension point that let C2PA manifests contain arbitrary metadata (treated in a separate specification being iterated by the group), arbitrary trust signals, and arbitrary attached credentials. </p> Enter the Aggregator <p>The Identity Claims Aggregator (often referred to as "aggregator" in the group) names a piece of software (which can be internal or external to an authoring tool) that tracks multiple identifiers enabling verifiable credentials (issued against them) to be inserted meaningfully. It also witnesses proofs of (and later attests to) control of many kinds of external identifiers, and generally organizes the chaos of the world's many overlapping identifier schemes and attestation formats. To the outside observer, this might seem a very complicated translation mechanism, but to the decentralized identity veteran, this is a familiar necessity. Every verifiable credential scheme eventually needs this kind of translator/aggregator role, if it is to be an open system or even if it is "only" going to federate across the tech stacks of multiple existing systems. </p>Taken from section 8.1.1.2 of the v1.1 Identity Assertion specification<p>The conversation so far in the working group has been working its way from the general to the concrete: do aggregators only aggregate identifiers and information sources known at the time of authoring/inserting, or can an aggregator add on new attestations at a later time? Must aggregators limit themselves to public identifiers, or can they use an internal/aggregator-specific one? Can an aggregator host a live API for post-facto information to be passed out-of-band, like additional credentials or updated credentials? How tightly, if at all, should this group specify such an API, if so? These are the high-level questions being debated on the back-burner of CAWG meetings this summer.</p> The Aggregator-Indirection Question <p>Zooming in a little more, there are further questions being tackled. Aggregators model a great happy-path solution for embedding declarations and strong identifications into each asset, but what about the many unhappy paths? For example, what if a creator’s assertions are scattered across many identifiers and credential types, and embedding those assertions requires all kinds translations and metadata to be legible? What if identifiers change, or new assertions become relevant after publishing– can “placeholder” or indirection identifiers be used to query data sources that continue receiving assertions after publication? Can an indirection or service be used to display more or less assertions depending on audience, or changeable-over-time consent policies? Can assertions and identities be “self-custodied”? What is the “account recovery” story for these increasingly complex use-cases?</p><p>While adding the aggregator was the biggest change in v1.1, it will be a long while until the exact scope and limits of this role are decided. It may well be that some advanced features get postponed to a later stage in the roadmap, because of the sheer complexity they entail, but it will definitely be an ongoing topic simmering in the background whenever smaller debates come up.</p> Separate Work Stream: Industry-Specific Identifiers <p>In parallel, a subgroup is meeting separately to research and sanity-check the integration of major media-industry identifier schemes and metadata schemes, looking for interop corner-cases and relevant prior art.<br><br>Interested parties are encouraged to pop into the subgroup's github issues and meetings if they are working on (or just curious about, or experienced with) industry associations and media archiving best practices. The usual IP caveats apply: if joining a live call as a non-DIF member or commenting on github issues, refrain from going into concrete detail on anything "patentable" like implementation details or solutions.</p> Other Big Questions between V1.1 and v2.0 <p>These advanced features of the aggregator aren’t the only big questions that we can expect to simmer and percolate across the next few "minor versions". Additionally, the interop issues around existing metadata standards (not just major W3C standards, but real-world ones from industry and library sciences) are potentially inexhaustible, as the group's Metadata specification gives scaffolding for inserting any structured metadata into assertions.</p><p>A slightly less vast but still very open-ended interoperability question is which DID methods to recommend or even require of all implementers, and how to manage or triage the remainder of the list of possible current (and future!) DID methods. Intersecting with the ongoing work of the DID Method Standardization Working Group, and older efforts like DID Traits to define equivalence or translatability between DID methods with similar architectures, semantics and guarantees, there is something of a simmering backlog-debate about which forms of DID make how much sense for the CAWG use-cases.</p><p>Of course, the evaluation of DID methods for these tiered-accreditation and decentralized reputation use-cases necessarily includes more than just technical analysis; legal and business readiness factor in as well, including competitiveness and market health/structure considerations to keep media authenticity from being a perk in closed ecosystems. Luckily, the new co-chair Scott Perry brings much experience and open lines of dialogue with multiple working groups at the Trust-over-IP Foundation which work on exactly these aspects of DID technology and business processes. In particular, agentic identity is a topic that ToIP generally, and Scott specifically, are bringing into the scope of the WG, so keep an eye out for issues and PRs along those lines in the coming months as well.</p>

<p>At this year’s Identiverse conference, the OpenID Foundation and SIDI Hub were proud to present: “<a href="https://identiverse.com/idv25/session/?idvid=2835428">Building a Digital Commons for Identity</a>.” The session outlined what has been achieved so far by the <a href="https://sidi-hub.community/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20building%20a%20%E2%80%9CDigital%20Commons%E2%80%9D%20for%20safe%2C%20interoperable,and%20academic%20organizations%20collaborate%20following%20a%20shared%20roadmap.">Sustainable and Interoperable Digital Identity Hub project</a> (SIDI Hub) – a global initiative dedicated to advancing safe, interoperable digital identity systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>As co-organizer and co-funder of SIDI Hub, the OpenID Foundation has played a central role in this ambitious effort to deliver cross border interoperability of digital identity in the same seamless way that a phone call, email, or passport is expected to work internationally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>OIDF’s <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/leadership/">Executive Director, Gail Hodges, took the stage at Identiverse alongside Elizabeth Garber, OIDF’s Strategy &amp; Marketing Director</a> and <a href="https://sidi-hub.community/team/">SIDI Hub’s Programme Lead</a>,&nbsp; to share the story of how SIDI Hub has grown into a movement spanning over 45 countries and over 25 organizations in just 18 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Digital identity should ‘just work’ globally 
<p>As Gail Hodges explained during the session, the core challenge is that over 30 countries have already launched national digital identity systems and, according to the <a href="https://dpimap.org/data-exchange-systems">Judge School of Business</a>, another 30 plan to enable one. Yet unlike global communication technologies, such as phone networks, email, or passports, these digital identities are not inherently interoperable.</p>
<p>There is a growing global consensus that interoperability must be treated as a strategic priority. But achieving it requires more than policy alignment. It needs concrete technical and governance deliverables developed through coordinated global action and shared infrastructure. SIDI Hub exists to spur this action.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So far, SIDI Hub has catalysed engagement from public and private sector organizations that include non-profits, academic institutions, international governmental organizations (IGOs), development organizations, governments, and private entities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2023, SIDI Hub has hosted six major convenings across four continents, reflecting a truly global effort to build trust and interoperability into the next generation of digital identity systems.</p>
 Supporting global policy objectives 
<p>The work of the SIDI Hub is built to align with established principles and support a number of global initiatives promoting the need for safe, interoperable digital identity systems. These include the:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.un.org/digital-emerging-technologies/global-digital-compact">UN Global Digital Compact</a>, which outlines principles for an open, safe, and equitable digital future 
 <a href="https://www.dpi-safeguards.org">United Nation’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) Safeguards</a>, which aim to ensure that foundational digital systems, including identity, are built responsibly, inclusively, and with the public interest in mind. 
 <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org">World Bank’s ID4D</a>, which aims to help countries realize the benefits of ID systems in support of Sustainable Development Goals. 
 <a href="https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0491/">OECD’s Digital Identity Recommendations</a>, which call for cross border alignment and trust 
 <a href="https://au.int/sites/default/files/documents/43393-doc-AU_Interoperability_framework_for_D_ID_English.pdf">African Union’s Interoperability Framework</a>, which promotes regional integration and digital cooperation, especially in cross-border trade and travel 
 <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home">European Union’s Digital Identity Wallet</a>, which the European Commission intends to provide a safe and reliable way for everyone in Europe to identify themselves and maintain control of their data. 
 
<p>This alignment with major global priorities has helped forge a shared sense of urgency.</p>
  
 Deliverables – what the SIDI Hub has achieved 
<p>Elizabeth Garber highlighted the significant achievements of the SIDI Hub since its inception. One of the key accomplishments has been the granular mapping of 10 domestic Trust Frameworks, incorporating overlays from various international guidelines and recommendations. These overlays from IGOs include the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Financialinclusionandnpoissues/Digital-identity-guidance.html">FATF Digital Identity Guidelines</a>, <a href="https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0491/">OECD Digital Identity Recommendations</a>, and the <a href="https://www.governance4id.org">UNDP Framework for Legal Digital ID</a>. This mapping has helped establish a comprehensive understanding of identity systems across different jurisdictions, and insights on how jurisdictions can layer their trust frameworks policy by policy and ensure those policies can be ‘translated’ by implementers within and across jurisdictions. SIDI Hub has already achieved many great insights, such as the ‘5 Things We’re Learning’ below.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, the SIDI Hub has conducted an evaluation of over 35 potential cross border use cases, with an emphasis on three critical areas identified as ‘champion’ initiatives. These include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://sidi-hub.community/publication/sidi-use-case-analysis-refugees/">refugee identity portability</a>, which aims to ensure individuals maintain access to their identity records across borders&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://sidi-hub.community/publication/sidi-use-case-analysis-open-a-bank-account/">opening a bank account internationally</a>, which seeks to streamline financial inclusion efforts 
 and <a href="https://sidi-hub.community/publication/sidi-use-case-education/">cross-border education credentialing</a>, which focuses on enabling individuals to validate their qualifications in different countries. 
 
<p></p>
<p>The SIDI Hub community is in the process of elaborating on three new champion use cases, with the strong support of government representatives and development organizations:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Age Assurance and Child Protection online 
 Agentic AI &amp; Identity 
 Olympics (2028-32) &amp; the African Cup (2027 &amp; 2029) 
 
<p>Furthermore, SIDI Hub is building on the great work of the OpenID Foundation’s GAIN POC Community Group to develop a reference architecture and proof-of-concept scoping to demonstrate how technical systems can align across jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>
 A global effort fuelled by volunteers 
<p>Despite the scale of the initiative, this work has been delivered on a surprisingly small budget. It has been made possible, thanks to the passion and expertise of volunteer contributors, and the support of a coalition of funders and partners, including the OpenID Foundation. Others included:</p>
  
 
 <a href="https://ngisargasso.eu/">EU NGI Sargasso Program</a> 
 <a href="https://secureidentityalliance.org/osia/">Secure Identity Alliance &amp; OSIA</a> 
 <a href="https://globalplatform.org/">GlobalPlatform</a> 
 <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">The Turing Institute</a> 
 In kind support from governments and coalitions, including the German Government, Japanese Government, <a href="http://id4africa.org">ID4Africa</a>, and the <a href="https://www.betteridentity.org/">Better Identity Coalition</a>.

 A values-based list of barriers faced by 14–19 year olds in the&nbsp;UK <p>In this post, we continuing to share outputs from a project we’re working with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/responsible-innovation-centre">Responsible Innovation Centre for Public Media Futures</a> (RIC), hosted by the BBC. We’ve already published:</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-does-ai-literacy-look-like-for-young-people-aged-14-19-8b4d798eb369">What does AI Literacy look like for young people aged&nbsp;14–19?</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-makes-for-a-good-ai-literacy-framework-423c57f01e9a">What makes for a good AI Literacy framework?</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/core-values-for-ai-literacy-0dfb0ce5145f">Core Values for AI&nbsp;Literacy</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/ai-literacy-or-ai-literacies-52d3c58f8b7e">AI Literacy or AI Literacies?</a>  Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>This project has involved both desk research and input from experts in the form of a survey, individual interviews, and a roundtable which we hosted a couple of weeks ago. One area we wanted to ensure we understood were gaps in existing provision around AI Literacies for young&nbsp;people.</p><p>The gaps we identified were focused on the 14–19 age range in the UK, with a long list of areas with many themes. We have organised and summarised these around the core values identified in a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/core-values-for-ai-literacy-0dfb0ce5145f">previous&nbsp;post</a>.</p><p>The gaps reflect a pattern seen across education, media, and wider society: provision is uneven. It is often shaped by short-term thinking and competing interests. Overall, it is limited by a lack of clear leadership or coordination.</p><p>Unfortunately, many interventions around AI Literacies are focused on technical skills or compliance. These do not connect with young people’s real interests or lived experiences, nor do they address the deeper ethical, social, and cultural questions raised by&nbsp;AI.</p><p>As a result of this, many learners — especially those already facing disadvantage — are left with fragmented support and few opportunities to develop genuine agency or critical judgement.</p> Human Agency and Informed Participation   Lack of systemic, rights-based frameworks: There is little structured provision to help young people shape, question, or influence AI, with most education focused on adapting to technology rather than encouraging agency or clarifying institutional responsibilities.  Dominance of industry narratives: Commercial interests and tech industry funding often drive the agenda, narrowing the conversation and limiting opportunities for young people to challenge prevailing narratives or understand the political dimensions of&nbsp;AI.  Insufficient progression and curriculum integration: There is no standardised, dynamic curriculum or progression framework for AI Literacies, especially for post-16 learners, and limited integration across subjects beyond computing or digital&nbsp;studies.  Teacher confidence and support gaps: Many teachers lack confidence, training, and adaptable resources to support the development of AI Literacies, resulting in inconsistent, sometimes contradictory, messaging and limited support for critical engagement.  Disconnect between knowledge and action: Awareness of AI bias, manipulation, or power structures does not reliably translate into agency or behavioural change, with motivation and broader social context often overlooked.   Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion   Persistent digital and social divides: Access to tools and resources to develop AI Literacies is highly unequal, shaped by school policies, family resources, and broader digital divides, with privileged students often able to bypass restrictions.  Lack of cultural and global adaptation: Most resources are developed in the global north and do not reflect the needs or realities of diverse cultural, socioeconomic, or linguistic backgrounds, including those from in the global&nbsp;south.  Barriers for marginalised groups: AI tools and resources can disadvantage non-native English speakers, students with disabilities, and those with limited digital access, reinforcing existing inequalities.  Neglect of visual and multimodal literacy: There is insufficient focus on images, deepfakes, and multimodal content, despite their growing importance for misinformation and manipulation.  Resource design and authenticity: Overly polished, anthropomorphised, or inaccessible resources can alienate young people; there is a need to co-design authentic, relatable, and context-driven materials that reflect lived experiences with young people from a range of background   Creativity, Participation, and Lifelong&nbsp;Learning   Short-termism and lack of sustainability: Funding and interventions are often short-lived, with little focus on long-term, joined-up strategies or progression frameworks.  Imbalance between creativity and consumption: Most young people are consumers, not creators, of AI content; there is insufficient emphasis on participatory, creative, and hands-on engagement with&nbsp;AI.  Restrictive and risk-averse policies: Overly strict barriers on access to AI tools in schools can limit meaningful learning opportunities and create anxiety or underground use.  Missed opportunities for experiential and peer learning: There is underuse of hands-on, constructionist, and peer-led approaches, which are effective for this age group and for a rapidly evolving field like&nbsp;AI.  Failure to address entrenched digital habits: Many interventions come too late to shift established digital habits; young people may have high digital skill but lack guidance on purposeful, critical, or participatory use.   Critical Thinking and Responsible Use   Overemphasis on technical skills: Current provision is skewed towards prompt engineering and functional tool use, with insufficient attention to understanding different kinds of AI, ethical reasoning, systemic impacts, and critical engagement.  Insufficient ethical, environmental, and societal focus: Real-world harms, environmental costs, and the broader impact of AI are rarely discussed, leaving gaps in understanding responsible use.  Media and information literacy gaps: Algorithmic and data literacy gaps: Young people struggle to understand how data shapes AI outputs, how to assess real versus fake (including deepfakes), and how to evaluate, challenge or seek redress for algorithmic decisions or AI-generated content.  Anthropomorphism and mental models: Many young people, particularly younger teens, misattribute human-like qualities to AI, affecting their critical judgement and ability to interrogate outputs.  Lack of robust assessment and evidence: There is a shortage of baseline data on AI literacy levels and limited frameworks for evaluating the effectiveness and impact of interventions, especially in terms of behavioural change.   Upholding Human Rights and Wellbeing   Disconnection from youth interests and lived experience: AI Literacy resources often fail to connect to young people’s real interests (creativity, sports, mental health), focusing instead on employability or compliance.  Socio-emotional and privacy risks: Young people may use AI for companionship or advice, sharing sensitive information without understanding privacy or data risks; frameworks rarely address identity, trust, or changing markers of adulthood.  Confusion and inconsistency in terminology: There is no consensus on what “AI literacy” means, and inconsistent definitions can intimidate learners or place excessive responsibility on individuals.  Unclear responsibility and leadership: It remains unclear who should lead on the development of AI Literacies. Schools, parents, government, industry, and third sector bodies all have a role to play, but the current situation leads to fragmented provision and a lack of accountability.  Neglect of digital relationships and boundaries: The role of AI as an “invisible third party” in relationships, and the shifting boundaries of privacy and identity, are rarely addressed in current resources.

<p>At <a href="https://globaldigitalcollaboration.org/">Global Digital Collaboration</a> on July 2nd, a full day of sessions co-curated by DIDAS and partners will address how privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) and trustworthy governance models can become core enablers of digital trust across sectors and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The day begins with a&nbsp;high-level update session&nbsp;featuring SPRIND, Google, EPFL, Johannes Kepler University, and others. It will explore the current maturity, post-quantum readiness, and practical deployment of PETs such as BBS+, SD-JWT, and ZK-mDoc. The session aims to establish shared terminology and frameworks for unlinkability and selective disclosure across global credential ecosystems.</p>
<p>In parallel, the&nbsp;e-democracy workshop series&nbsp;(Part 1 &amp; 2), led by the Center for Digital Trust (C4DT) at EPFL, DIDAS, the Human Colossus Foundation, and other civil society actors, will explore how digital services like e-ID and e-collecting e-voting and related challenges which must be redesigned for resilience to protect public trust, prevent fraud, and ensure accountability. The sessions aim to define foundational principles for a trustworthy digital democracy, co-created by experts in law, governance, cryptography, and policy.</p>
<p>Running alongside, a&nbsp;collaborative mapping session&nbsp;by Johannes Kepler University, Orange, Ethereum researchers, DIDAS, EUDI and other Global Ecosystems and pilot teams are invited to identify and classify global use cases where PETs-particularly zero-knowledge proofs-are essential. The session will help align performance and privacy requirements across deployment contexts, feeding into implementation roadmaps and standards discussions.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a&nbsp;deep dive on unlinkability&nbsp;will be led by experts from Google, SPRIND, EPFL and the Linux Foundation’s decentralized trust initiatives. This session will focus on the risks of issuer–relying party collusion in credential ecosystems, and why unlinkability is non-negotiable for use cases like transport and location-sensitive infrastructure.</p>
<p>Later, a technically grounded session titled&nbsp;“ZKProofs: From Crypto Potential to Regulatory Acceptance”&nbsp;will bring together Google, ETSI, and NIST to map out viable ZKP schemes, their mobile-readiness, and interoperability features. The goal is to bridge the gap between cryptographic innovation and institutional trust, and to align stakeholders around a roadmap for responsible, cross-border adoption and acceptance.</p>
<p>The day concludes with a&nbsp;multi-stakeholder roundtable&nbsp;moderated by DIDAS with invitees from the ITU, the OpenWallet Foundation, LF Decentralized Trust, OECD, UNHCR the Swiss confederation, the EU Commission and other country delegates and potential funding partners to explore long-term collaboration structures. This final session will address how to sustain PET development through ongoing working groups, interoperable governance, and shared funding models.</p>

 Scaling interop, tackling delegated authority, and expanding global reach 
<p>The OpenID Foundation Board was proud to present its ‘Take on the Landscape’ session on June 2, 2025, at Identiverse. Moderated by Executive Director Gail Hodges, the panel explored the OpenID Foundation’s rapidly expanding impact across the identity ecosystem, from scaled up interoperability testing to critical new specifications supporting use cases like Agentic AI, age assurance, and digital estate planning.</p>
 Scaling interoperability – 15 hackathons in 8 Months 
<p>The session opened with a focus on the momentum behind interoperability events and proving out the effectiveness of several families of OIDF specs. In just eight months, the OpenID Foundation has supported 15 interop events and hackathons globally. These efforts are accelerating the adoption and testing of OpenID specs in real world implementations.</p>
<p>Board members highlighted the tangible benefits. Atul Tulshibagwale (SGNL), who has led three <a href="https://openid.net/shared-signal-wg-returns-to-gartner-iam-for-interoperability/">Shared Signals interop events</a> in just over a year, emphasized that these events give implementers a clear target and a pressure testing ground for deployments. At this same event, the<a href="https://openid.net/authzen-at-gartner-iam/"> first interop event for the AuthZen specification</a> was also held. The <a href="https://openid.net/authzen-shared-signals-in-the-gartner-iam-2025-spotlight/">results of those two interop events</a> were published April 2nd, with “lines going out the door” for Gartner IAM Summit attendees to observe the specs in person.</p>
<p>Nancy Cam-Winget, OpenID Foundation’s Treasurer, echoed this, noting her Cisco team’s participation in the recent California DMV hackathons co-hosted by the OpenID Foundation. The event enabled multiple vendors to mature the specifications in the Digital Credentials Protocols (DCP) working group while also demonstrating that the many use cases in varying industries are enabled through the use of these decentralized credentials.</p>
<p>Dima Postnikov, Vice Chair, spotlighted the energy and collaboration at a <a href="https://openid.net/the-openid-federation-interoperability-event/">recent interop event in Sweden</a>, where OpenID Federation experts were able to identify and close residual spec gaps in a trusted environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gail added that in the most recent <a href="https://openid.net/openid-foundation-demonstrates-real-world-interoperabiity-of-new-digital-identity-standards/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials test event on May 5</a>, implementers achieved a 90% plus passing rate (in both pairwise aggregate results, and multi-wallet tests with a single verifier), offering strong validation that the specs are both rigorous and interoperable.</p>
 Delegated authority – a cross cutting specification priority 
<p>A standout theme in the panel was the growing demand for an OIDF specification&nbsp;addressing <a href="https://openid.bitbucket.io/ekyc/openid-authority.html">delegated authority</a>, a foundational requirement across multiple emerging use cases. From protecting children online through age assurance, to enabling secure Agentic AI interactions and digital estate management after death, this theme resonated as one of the most critical specification needs on the horizon. This spec is being progressed in the OIDF<a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/"> eKYC &amp; IDA Working Group.</a></p>
<p>Board Chair Nat Sakimura emphasized the agility of the OpenID Foundation’s spec development model. Just two interoperable implementations and a 60 day public review are required to push a draft toward finalization, as long as all other processes have been followed, including a consensus on the approach. This flexible yet robust process is well suited to the evolving demands at the intersection of identity and AI.</p>
 Supporting 26 ecosystems, and growing 
<p>Gail introduced the breadth of the 26 ecosystems currently supported by the OpenID Foundation through specification due diligence, certification, and strategic engagement. This includes efforts in open banking, health, data, and identity, many in emerging markets. Gail mentioned that this work spans Global South and North countries, with multiple ecosystems in some jurisdictions:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ali Adnan highlighted Authlete’s firsthand experience working across diverse ecosystems around the world, and emphasized the critical role that the OpenID Foundation plays in helping these ecosystems bring their deployments to market. He addressed how the OpenID Foundation supports their objectives through consistent specification deployment, self-certification programs, and ongoing relationship management.</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura stressed the importance of prioritizing the needs of countries where the majority of the world’s population resides. Listening to these markets ensures the OpenID Foundation specifications can truly deliver on the promise of global interoperability.</p>
<p>Dima expanded on the work of the new Ecosystem Community Group, which is developing reference architectures to help governments and implementers accelerate adoption across sectors. Gail also noted the importance of the OpenID Foundation’s role as a co-organizer in multi stakeholder initiatives like <a href="http://sidi-hub.community">SIDI Hub</a>, where the focus is on enabling cross border interoperability for digital identity.</p>
 Convergence of Themes 
<p>As part of the context setting, the Board also reflected on the convergence we see of Faster Payments, Open Data and Digital Identity with some countries starting with these use cases linked together, and some starting by approaching them separately.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Board also observed that these three use cases are often combined with a few others under the umbrella or “new packaging” and called&nbsp; “Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI).”&nbsp; DPI is terminology used commonly amongst global south community participants but less so in the global north. The OIDF noted that DPI tends to also include a couple of additional areas around eSignatures, Digital Government, and Civil Registries. However, the Board highlighted that the linking of DPI under a single umbrella can complicate the governance picture where some areas like Faster Payments and Digital Identity have more reliance on institutions and private entities outside of the control of a single jurisdiction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, whatever lens one takes on these use cases, the Board reinforced that layers sit below these use cases and they are required to deliver secure and interoperable implementations and ecosystems. As an expert provider of specifications that underpin these use cases, and as a scalable provider of certification services, the OpenID Foundation Board is keen to continue playing a central role supporting existing and emerging ecosystem partners (public and private sector led)&nbsp; in achieving their goals of security, interoperability, global scale, and operational efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Thank you to the community 
<p>The OpenID Foundation Board extends its deep thanks to all the panellists and contributors: Nat Sakimura, Dima Postnikov, Nancy Cam-Winget, Atul Tulshibagwale, and Ali Adnan, with Gail Hodges moderating the conversation. Special thanks to Andi Hindle and the Identiverse content development team for featuring this important topic.&nbsp;</p>

We then met up regularly to chat about where we were, what ideas were floating around and get inspiration from one another. Once we had drafts, we each read each other’s pieces offering comments and suggestions.</p><p>Our finished pieces can be found at this linktree: <a href="https://linktr.ee/ai_future_education">https://linktr.ee/ai_future_education</a></p><p>After we submitted our think pieces to UNESCO, we decided to do a roundtable event hosted by Doug. Over 100 people signed up, with 50 more on the waitlist. Participants gathered to discuss the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education. The event brought together educators, tech experts, and policymakers to dissect our six pieces on AI’s future role in learning environments.</p><p>This blog post summarises our very nuanced discussion surrounding AI’s role in education. If you’re interested in this type of thing, we’d recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIgNyHRxCos">the full&nbsp;session</a>.</p> 1. Personalized Learning <p>One of the themes discussed was personalized learning facilitated by AI. While AI can functionally analyze student data to tailor curricula and pacing, we talked about the emotional and social dimensions of learning. The lack of empathy in AI systems hinders holistic education, which requires human interaction.</p> 2. Equity and&nbsp;Access <p>We talked about the theory that AI could democratize access to quality education, but we highlighted significant challenges. Unequal access exacerbates existing disparities in educational opportunities, and it is not just infrastructure that is inequitable in our education system.</p> 3. The Educator’s Role <p>AI’s impact on educators’ roles was another theme in our conversation. While AI can handle routine tasks like grading, potentially reducing administrative burdens, there are concerns about over-reliance on technology displacing human interaction. We argued for understanding teachers as mentors, facilitators, guardians and creatives to try and make clear that “efficiency” is not a goal in education.</p> 4. Privacy and&nbsp;Bias <p>We talked a lot about the ethical implications surrounding various aspects of AI. From data privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and transparency in AI decision-making, we stressed the importance of ethical guidelines and accountability measures.</p> 5. Collaboration <p>We talked a bit about the potential for collaboration between educators and AI. We tried to think about what a complementary relationship with AI might look like for education. While AI might enhance some of our teaching tools, it cannot be allowed to overshadow the irreplaceable human&nbsp;element.</p> 6. The Future of Education <p>In conclusion, we know and spoke about the fact that any technology and its implementation in education must be approached with caution and balance. Our conversation underscored that AI is not a panacea but a technology that exists within a particular context, and that like any technology, it’s how we use it that&nbsp;matters.</p><p>Go deeper:</p>  This is the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIgNyHRxCos">​Recording</a> for the full&nbsp;session  We made an AI generated <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f8n4B_HzEXUhhSUqcTUpYmsWUSPQy7EDfB42VS2wuBE/edit?referrer=luma&amp;tab=t.0#heading=h.pbm7aujexa0g">​Chat&nbsp;summary</a>  <a href="https://linktr.ee/ai_future_education">​All of our think pieces</a> are worth a close read.

 Exploring the plural, context-dependent, and socially-negotiated nature of new literacies <p>Over the past couple of months, we’ve been working on an ‘AI Literacy’ project with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/responsible-innovation-centre">Responsible Innovation Centre for Public Media Futures</a> (RIC), hosted by the BBC. We’ve already published:</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-does-ai-literacy-look-like-for-young-people-aged-14-19-8b4d798eb369">What does AI Literacy look like for young people aged&nbsp;14–19?</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-makes-for-a-good-ai-literacy-framework-423c57f01e9a">What makes for a good AI Literacy framework?</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/core-values-for-ai-literacy-0dfb0ce5145f">Core Values for AI&nbsp;Literacy</a>  <p>In this post, we want to explore the tension we’ve felt between referring to ‘AI Literacy’ in the singular, versus referring to a plurality of ‘AI Literacies’. Ultimately, although our original brief used the singular form (as do many of our peers) we have decided to take the latter, plural, approach — for reasons we will explain&nbsp;below.</p><p>One very practical reason to emphasise ‘AI Literacies’ is that it is difficult to talk about ‘delivering’ a literacy. “Literacy” always begs the question of context: What does literacy mean to this particular person in this particular setting at this particular moment? What it means to be ‘AI literate’ is going to look very different to someone working in a corporate office job, compared to a teenager using AI for a creative project. Additionally, there are multiple literate behaviours when we think about AI — for example, understanding the socio-economic reality of the AI landscape versus knowing how to prompt an LLM to get the kind of information or answer you are looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>AI Literacies are therefore both plural and context-specific. They are also socially-negotiated. Literate behaviours depend on the community with which an individual is interacting. This becomes evident through a few examples.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>If you are a parent of teenagers, you will have experienced a time when they respond in a way which makes sense to them and their friends, but not to you. You are likely to have to ask them what they mean or use a resource like the Urban Dictionary. Other behaviours such as using a particular emoji might be hilarious for reasons you cannot quite comprehend.</p><p>These “rhetorics of communication” are an important part of literacy practices, especially in the digital realm. They constitute ways of interacting with other people within a techno-social system which itself privileges and foregrounds certain kinds of behaviours, while either explicitly or implicitly discouraging others. For example, contemporary chat apps allow you to see not only that a message has been delivered, but whether it has been read. The act of not reading a particular message may be seen in multiple lights: Is the person ignoring me? Are they mad at me? Are they offline in the&nbsp;forest?</p><p>Any time we are communicating in ways which are mediated by technologies, part of literate behaviour involves understanding the “affordances” that the technology provides as well as understanding how that technology might be shaping our behaviour.</p><p>If you were, for example, quickly texting your teenager while at work, you might send your text and then open a workplace chat window which looks and feels very much like the social one which you have just been using. However, because the context is different — as well as perhaps both the demographic makeup and number of people in the chat — you act differently. =Your literate behaviours are thus socially-negotiated, meaning that you vary your behaviour in different situations.</p><p>As we start to understand AI Literacies, we need to think about the most common way in which people experience generative AI — by prompting a Large Language Model (LLM) through a chat window. The chat window is a familiar technology, but the fact that there isn’t a human on the other side of it is not. Part of AI Literacies therefore involves exhibiting and modifying our behaviours based on our knowledge and experience of factors that surround this particular chat&nbsp;window.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>With personal or workplace chats, what is outside of the frame informs literate behaviours inside the frame. Similarly, when we are interacting with AI, the more we know about what is outside the frame, the more we can develop appropriate literate behaviours inside the frame. Again, these literate behaviours are plural: will others be able to tell that you are using the outputs of an LLM? (will they mind?) They are based on context: should you trust the company behind the technology you are using? And they are socially-negotiated: are there environmental concerns of which you should be&nbsp;aware?</p><p>Angela Gunder’s <a href="https://openedculture.org/projects/dimensions-of-ai-literacies/">Dimensions of AI Literacies</a> provides a helpful way to think about these issues. Building on my work on the <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/thesis">Essential Elements of Digital Literacies</a>, Gunder’s framework sets out a series of overlapping dimensions that shape how people interact with AI. This approach supports the idea that AI Literacies are not a fixed set of skills, but a collection of practices negotiated within communities and shaped by&nbsp;context.</p><p>AI Literacies, like Critical Media Literacies, Digital Literacies, Information Literacies, Data Literacies, and a whole host of “new” literacies, should be considered to be fundamentally plural. What counts as “literate behaviours” are socially-negotiated based on context. Words and phrases, however, are important to describe what we mean. And that is why we will be referring to AI Literacies in the project we’re doing with the RIC for the&nbsp;BBC.</p> Coming soon <p>We are working on a public version of our landscape setting and framework for AI Literacies. We’ll be sharing that soon. In the meantime, follow our contributions to this space through <a href="https://ailiteracy.fyi/">https://ailiteracy.fyi/</a> and get in touch if you have projects and programmes that can benefit from our experience and expertise in education and technology.</p><p>Thanks to Laura Hilliger for being a fantastic editor of this&nbsp;post.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/ai-literacy-or-ai-literacies-52d3c58f8b7e">AI Literacy or AI Literacies?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>At Blockchain Commons, we design open infrastructure that prioritizes privacy, autonomy, and human dignity. That’s why I support and personally signed the <a href="https://nophonehome.com">No Phone Home Initiative</a>. It is not just a position, it’s a call to preserve a foundational principle of decentralized identity: Credentials must be verifiable without enabling surveillance!</p>

 Why “No Phone Home” Matters 

<p>The problem is simple: when verifying a digital credential such as a mobile driver’s license or a diploma, many systems require contacting the original issuer. This creates a digital trail of who is verifying what, when, and why. That trail can be used to profile and surveil, allowing issuers to track credential holders without their knowledge.</p>

<p>Manu Sporny, in an email to the W3C Credentials Community Group (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2025Jun/0008.html">June 3, 2025</a>), clarified the stakes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Retrieving a status list could be misinterpreted as ‘phoning home’ … but it’s not anywhere near the same level of “phoning home” that contacting the issuer and telling them ‘I’ve got Steve here at
booze-hut.com, is he over 21?’ achieves.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the threat of direct identity leak is just the tip of the iceberg. That’s because credential presentation isn’t a one-off event. It’s recurrent. Even when identifiers or interactions are pseudonymous, repeated verifications leak sensitive metadata, allowing issuers or third parties to correlate time, location, and use-pattern metadata into behavioral profiles.</p>

<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation talks about some of this in <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/no-phone-home/">“Nearly 100 Experts Are Saying ‘No Phone Home’”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The risks multiply when applied across domains. Federated protocols developed for use within organizations become surveillance systems when used between different sectors or jurisdictions. Phone home capabilities that seem innocuous within a single domain can become tools for tracking and control when applied broadly without aggressive oversight and fine-tuning.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Problematically, this is how these systems are designed to work! As Kim Hamilton Duffy says in the first of a series of articles <a href="https://kimdhamilton.com/latent_surveillance/">on mDL privacy</a> that she’s currently working on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This isn’t an unintended consequence—it’s an architectural feature that can trivially enable persistent record-keeping of when and where you use your credentials, creating patterns that can be analyzed long after the original transaction by unknown third parties.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This also reveals yet another danger: how “normal” it feels to let credential issuers remain silently in the loop.</p>

 Revocation Without Surveillance 

<p>Some argue that checking for the revocation of a credential requires phoning home. But that’s a false dilemma. In the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2025Jun/0009.html">same W3C thread</a>, Sporny noted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are a few ways to retrieve a status list without directly contacting the issuer that use commonly deployed web technology.””</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technical mitigations discussed and developed by the community include:</p>

 
   Large, pseudonymous status lists (e.g., Bitstring Status List) 
   Use of CDNs or file mirrors to avoid direct issuer contact 
   Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) for unlinkable status fetching 
 

<p>There are still issues with these potential mitigations. For example, Kyle Den Hartog (Pryvit NZ) raised <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2025Jun/0004.html">concerns</a> about status list misuse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“An issuer creates a bitstring list of sufficiently large size, but only includes 1 active credential index per bitstring list. All other indexes are spoofed. The rest of the list would look active to the holder/verifiers but could still be a tracking mechanism by the issuer.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, these edge-case attacks reinforce why the core architecture must be surveillance-resistant by default.</p>

<p>Privacy isn’t the only issue with revocation checking: it’s also a structural risk. If we tie credential validity to live status checks, we quietly shift power from holders to issuers. It becomes a form of dependency injection, one that contradicts the goal of self-sovereign identity.</p>

 Not Just Technical: It’s Ethical 

<p>This isn’t just a technical issue. It goes to the ethical heart of self-sovereign identity design.</p>

<p>Daniel Hardman offered this framing in a <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2025May/0050.html">related thread</a> on edge cases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Verifiable credentials verify without issuer coordination; that is what the ‘verifiable’ in ‘verifiable credential’ means.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joe Andrieu argued in the same <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2025May/0009.html">May 2025 thread</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*The identity system that wins is going to be the one we can use in any circumstance by anyone. … It’s my wallet. I expect it to serve me, as a user agent. I do not accept that it might also serve the state as a surveillance platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At Blockchain Commons, we agree. The ability to verify credentials offline, without depending on a central service, is essential for resilience and civil liberties.</p>

<p>A report prepared for the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/publications/aclu-digital-id-state-legislative-recommendations">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) put it clearly by requiring “No Issuer ability to track via phone home mechanism” and saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One way a digital ID can differ from physical ID is that it can enable the issuers of the digital ID to track where, when, and to whom one shows their ID. This tracking can reveal very private and sensitive information about the digital ID holder — namely, when and where, online or off, they present their ID. Standards and technologies should be designed so that the issuer (or any of its agents or contractors) cannot engage in any of these forms of tracking.”</p>
</blockquote>

 Emergencies Are Not an Excuse 

<p>Some use cases such as disaster response or first responder tracking have prompted discussions around consent-based “check-ins.” These are complex and worthy of consideration. But the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#verification">VC Data Model 2.0 spec</a> is clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Credential status specifications MUST NOT enable tracking of individuals, such as an issuer being notified (either directly or indirectly) when a verifier is interested in a specific holder or subject. Unacceptable approaches include “phoning home …”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But compliance doesn’t equal safety. Even digital credentials that conform to existing standards—such as ISO 18013-5—can still include implementation choices that enable surveillance. Privacy must be baked into system design, not retrofitted through policy disclaimers.</p>

<p>As Alexis Hancock of the <a href="https:www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</a> warned (via <a href="https://statescoop.com/no-phone-home-mobile-drivers-license-privacy/">State Scoop</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We have to act now because governments are enthusiastic about digital ID, but if we don’t pin down these basic principles now, it’s going to be a problem later.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can build systems that are opt-in, purpose-specific, and out-of-band, without compromising the privacy baseline for everyone else.</p>

 Our Commitment 

<p>At Blockchain Commons, we believe decentralized identity should empower the individual, not quietly report on them. We are actively designing open standards such as <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/blob/master/Docs/GordianEnvelope.md">Gordian Envelope</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/dCBOR-2023.md">dCBOR</a> to support truly private, verifiable, interoperable credentials.</p>

<p>We support “No Phone Home” because surveillance should never be the default. And we invite others to join us in making sure the future of identity remains decentralized, private, and just.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Welcome to the May edition of the Digital Identity NZ newsletter. This month, we’re excited to introduce our new Executive Director, share insights from Techweek25’s Foundations for Tomorrow Event.</p>



<p>Andy Higgs Appointed as New Executive Director</p>



<p>We’re pleased to announce that Andy Higgs has joined Digital Identity NZ as our new Executive Director.</p>



<p>Andy brings over 20 years of experience across digital identity, AI strategy, and innovation in both public and private sectors. His background includes leadership roles at Futureverse and Centrality, where he focused on self-sovereign identity solutions and ecosystem partnerships.</p>



<p>His experience extends to policy development with the Department of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, including work on the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework and the Consumer Data Right.</p>



<p>Andy’s collaborative approach will be valuable as DINZ continues to work alongside members to build a trusted digital identity ecosystem for everyone in Aotearoa.</p>







<p>Digital Public Infrastructure: Foundations for Tomorrow Event<br><br>During Techweek25, government, industry, and public sector leaders gathered at Parliament’s Legislative Chamber to discuss how digital public infrastructure (DPI) could transform service delivery across New Zealand.<br><br>Key takeaways for the digital identity community:</p>



 
 Ministerial vision:&nbsp;Hon Judith Collins KC announced plans for an all-of-government app allowing citizens to store digital credentials, receive notifications, and access services in one secure digital space.<br>&nbsp; 



 Economic benefits:&nbsp;Pete Herlihy from AWS highlighted that digital identity is one of four core components of DPI that can deliver significant economic growth—between 1-2% of GDP in developed nations.<br>&nbsp; 



 Human-centered approach:&nbsp;Deloitte’s Adithi Pandit emphasised how unified digital infrastructure could enable more joined-up social services and reduce fragmentation.<br>&nbsp; 



 Implementation plans:&nbsp;Public Service Commissioner Sir Brian Roche indicated a move toward greater centralisation with prescribed platforms and standards to make digital infrastructure a low-cost utility.<br>&nbsp; 



 Industry perspective:&nbsp;Xero founder Rod Drury called for greater urgency in digital identity implementation, suggesting New Zealand could leverage its small size to move quickly and “solve digital identity by Christmas.”

  <p>ABSTRACT: “Fair Witnessing” is a new approach for asserting and interpreting digital claims in a way that mirrors real-world human trust: through personal observation, contextual disclosure, and progressive validation. It can be implemented with the decentralized architecture of Gordian Envelopes to allow individuals to make verifiable statements while balancing privacy, accountability, and interpretability. At its core, fair witnessing is not about declaring truth, it’s about showing your work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the early days of decentralized identity, we referred to what we were working on as “Verifiable Claims.” The idea was simple: let people make cryptographically signed statements and allow others to verify them. But something unexpected happened. People assumed these claims would settle arguments or stop disinformation. They saw the term “verifiable” and equated it with “truth.”</p>

<p>The reality was more modest: we could verify the source of a claim but not its accuracy. We could assert that a claim came from a specific person or organization (or even camera or other object) but not whether that claim was unbiased, well-observed, or contextually complete.</p>

<p>This misunderstanding revealed a deeper problem: how do we represent what someone actually saw and how they saw it, in a way that honors the complexity of human trust?</p>

 A Heinleinian Inspiration 

<p></p>

<p>Iin Stranger in a Strange Land, Robert Heinlein described a special profession: the Fair Witness. A Fair Witness would be trained to observe carefully, report precisely, make no assumptions, and avoid bias. If asked what color a house was, a Fair Witness would respond, “It appears to be white on this side.”</p>

<p>It is this spirit we want to capture to fulfill the promise of the original verifiable claims.</p>

<p>A Fair Witness in our digital era is someone who not only asserts a claim but also shares the conditions under which it was made, including context, methodology, limitations, and bias:</p>

 
   What were the physical conditions of the observation? 
   Was the observer physically present? 
   Did they act independently? 
   What interests or leanings might have shaped their perception? 
   How did they minimize those biases? 
 

<p>These are not just nice-to-haves. They are necessary components of evaluating a claim’s credibility.</p>

 Beyond Binary Trust 

<p>Fair witnessing challenges binary notions of trust. Traditional systems ask a “yes” or “no” question: do you trust this certificate? This issuer?</p>

<p>But trust is rarely binary like this in the real world. It is layered, contextual, and progressive. The claim made by a pseudonymous environmental scientist might start out with low trust but could grow in credibility as:</p>

 
   They reveal their professional history. 
   Others endorse their work. 
   They disclose how they mitigated their potential biases. 
 

<p>Trust builds over time, not in a single transaction. That’s <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-progressive-trust-lifecycle/">progressive trust</a>.</p>

 Trust as a Nested Statement 

<p>To marry a fair witness claim to the notion of progressive trust requires the nesting of information. As shown in the example of the environmental scientist, the witnessing of an observation gains weight as the context is added: turning the scientist’s claims into a fair-witness statement required collecting together information about who the scientist is, what their training is, and what their peers think of them.</p>

<p>But as noted, progressive trust isn’t something that occurs in a single transaction: it’s revealed over time. We don’t want it to all be revealed at once, because that could result in information overload for someone consulting a claim and could have privacy implications for the witness.</p>

<p>A progressive trust model of fair witnessing requires that you show what you must and that you withhold what’s not needed—until it is.</p>

 Privacy and Accountability, Together 

<p>This model strikes a crucial balance. On one hand, it empowers individuals (fair witnesses) to speak from experience without needing permission from a centralized authority. On the other hand, it allows others to verify the integrity of the claim without requiring total exposure.</p>

<p>There are numerous use cases:</p>

 
   You can prove you were trained without revealing your name. 
   You can demonstrate personal observation without revealing your exact location. 
   You can commit to a fact today and prove you knew it later. 
 

 Fair Witnessing with Gordian Envelope 

<p>The demands of Fair Witnessing go beyond the capabilities of traditional verifiable credentials (VCs), primarily because VCs can’t remove signed information but maintain its validation—and the ability to do so is critically important if you want to nest information for revelation over time.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a technology already exists that provides this precise capability: Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a>, which allows for: the organized storage of information; the validation of that information through signatures; the elision of that information; the continued validation of the information after elision; and the provable restoration of that information.</p>

<p>Any subject, predicate, or object in Gordian Envelope can itself be a claim, optionally encrypted or elided. This enables a deeply contextual, inspectable form of expression.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
 
   Alice could make a fair-witness observation, which would be an envelope. 
   Information on the context of Alice’s assertion can be a sub-envelope. 
   A credential for fair witness training can be a sub-envelope. 
   Endorsements of Alice’s work as a fair witness can be sub-envelopes. 
   Endorsements, credentials, and even the entire envelope can be signed by the appropriate parties. 
   Any envelope or sub-envelope can be elided, without affecting these signatures and without impacting the ability to provably restore the data later. 
 

<p>It’s progressive trust appropriate for use with fair witnessing in an existing form!</p>

 Toward a New Epistemology 

<p>Being a Fair Witness isn’t about declaring truth. It’s about saying what’s known, with context, so others can assess what’s truth. Truth, in this model, is interpreted, not imposed. A verifier—or a jury—decides if a claim is credible, not because a central authority says so, but because the Fair Witness has provided information with sufficient context and endorsements.</p>

<p>In other words, fair witnessing is not about what is true, but about how we responsibly say what we believe to be true—and what others can do with that.</p>

<p>This is epistemology (the theory of knowledge) that’s structured as a graph. It’s cryptographically sound, privacy-respecting, and human-auditable. It reflects real-world trust: messy, contextual, and layered. By modeling that complexity rather than flattening it, we gain both rigor and realism.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>In a world of machine-generated misinformation, ideological polarization, and institutional distrust, we must return to the foundations: observation, context, and human responsibility.</p>

<p>Fair witnessing offers a new path forward—one that is verifiable, privacy-respecting, and grounded in how humans actually trust.</p>

<p>After decades of cautiously watching from the sidelines, governments around the world have started investing in, rolling out, and regulating digital identity systems on aggressive timelines. These foundational changes to government infrastructure and the economy are happening largely outside public awareness, despite their generational consequences for privacy.</p><p>Digital identity systems implemented by governments today will shape privacy for decades. Whatever ecosystems and technical architectures are established in the coming years could ossify quickly, and it would take enormous political will to make changes at such a foundational level if society develops buyer's remorse once the ripple effects become clear.</p><p>That's why nearly 100 experts across technology, policy, and civil liberties have united around one principle: digital identity systems must be built without latent tracking capabilities that could enable ubiquitous surveillance. Thus, the <a href="https://nophonehome.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">nophonehome.com petition</a>.</p> Who's Behind This <p>Civil society groups working on legal advocacy and industry oversight (ACLU, EFF), cybersecurity experts (including Bruce Schneier), privacy-by-design software companies of various sizes (Brave, many DIF members), and experts from university faculties (Brown, Columbia, Imperial College London) all signed on. The list includes authors of collaborative open standards, chief executives, state privacy officers, and other public servants. This is not a coalition of "activists" so much as a broad coalition of experts and policy-watchers sounding an alarm about consequential decisions passing largely unnoticed by the average citizen and end-user.</p><p>The breadth of this coalition reflects widespread concern about the technical and policy implications of embedded tracking capabilities.</p> What "Phone Home" Means <p>As a general rule, "phone-home" is a shorthand for architectural principles of tracking enablement (just as "no phone-home" refers to tracking mitigation, broadly speaking). When a verifier of credentials interacts directly with the credential's issuer—even if just to check validity or revocation status—they are "phoning" the credential's "home." This opens the subject and/or the holder of that credential to privacy risks, no matter how well the request is anonymized or handled. These API connections create data that can be combined, correlated, and abused, especially when verifiers share information or when issuers abuse their role.</p><p>The risks multiply when applied across domains. Federated protocols developed for use within organizations become surveillance systems when used between different sectors or jurisdictions. Phone home capabilities that seem innocuous within a single domain can become tools for tracking and control when applied broadly without aggressive oversight and fine-tuning. Over time, little mismatches and slippages in how these protocols work get exploited and stretched, amplifying glitches.</p><p>In the worst-case scenario, some systems enable real-time revocation decisions, giving issuers—potentially governments—immediate control over citizens' ability to access services, travel, or participate in society. A natural tendency to "over-request" foundational documents in situations where such strong identification is unjustified is amplified by familiarity, lack of friction, and other UX catnip; all the SHOULDs in the world won't stop verifiers from doing it. And verifiers over-asking without also providing a fallback or "slow lane" can make a sudden or temporary unavailability of foundational credentials painful or even exclusionary. The side-effects and externalities pile up dangerously in this industry!</p><p>Technologists see these kinds of capabilities (phone-home of any kind, remote revocation, low-friction foundational identity requests) like loaded guns in Act 1 of a Chekhov play: "If this capability exists within a digital identity system, even inactively, it will eventually be misused."</p> The Scale and Timing Problem <p>Most foundational identity systems being implemented for national-scale deployment include system-wide phone home tracking capabilities, either actively or latently. Many policymakers involved in these rollouts are not even aware of the tracking potential built into the standards they are adopting.</p><p>Four factors make this moment critical:</p>  Scale of deployment: These systems will serve billions of users across developed nations, effectively replacing physical credentials.  Precedent-setting effects: When one jurisdiction adopts tracking-enabled systems, it influences global practices and standards.  Infrastructure persistence: Technical decisions made today will persist for decades, becoming prohibitively expensive to change once embedded.  Mission creep inevitability: Capabilities developed for legitimate purposes like fraud prevention naturally accrue new private-sector and/or public-sector use-cases over time due to natural market pressures. Today's private-sector usage is tomorrow's public-sector secondary data market.   The Fallacy of "Privacy by Policy" <p>The fundamental problem with latent tracking capabilities is that policies change, but technical architecture persists. If a system has surveillance capability—even if unused—it will eventually be activated. Emergencies, changing administrations, or shifting political priorities can quickly justify "pressing the button" to enable widespread tracking.</p><p>The solution is simple: they cannot press a button they do not have.</p><p>Consider AAMVA's recent decision to prohibit the "server retrieval" capability throughout the U.S.—a positive step that we welcome. However, most low-level implementations (e.g. core libraries) will likely implement the entire specification and leave it to the last-mile implementers to honor (or not) this policy. As an incubator of new specifications and prototypes, DIF feels strongly that jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction policies is just "turning off" what the specification still instructs software to implement for later policies to turn back on at the flick of a switch. We believe the underlying ISO specification needs to remove "server retrieval" completely, lest every authority in the U.S. remain one emergency away from activating broad, identity-based surveillance of all citizens.</p> Privacy-Preserving Alternatives Exist <p>The choice between security and privacy is false. Offline-first verification operates without server communication—the credential contains cryptographic proofs that can be validated independently. The ISO 18013-5 standard itself includes "device retrieval" mode, a privacy-preserving alternative that functions entirely offline.</p><p>Even credential revocation can be implemented without phone home capabilities. Privacy-preserving revocation systems are in production today, proving that security and privacy can coexist.</p><p>The technology exists. The standards exist. What has been missing is commitment to prioritize privacy over the operational convenience of centralized tracking.</p> Moving Forward <p>Awareness is growing. We welcome developments like AAMVA's prohibition of server retrieval, but more work is needed across the broader digital identity ecosystem to eliminate latent surveillance capabilities entirely.</p><p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation develops standards that prioritize privacy, supports implementations that respect user autonomy, and advocates for technical architectures that prevent tracking and add friction to data misuse. Our membership includes many technologists and vendors designing tracking-free alternatives for these and other use cases.</p><p>We encourage you to read the full No Phone Home statement at <a href="https://nophonehome.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://nophonehome.com</a>. Whether you are building, deploying, or using these systems, your voice matters at this critical juncture. </p><p>The question is not whether we can build privacy-preserving digital identity—it is whether we will choose to do so. Let's build it right.</p> <p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) is an engineering-driven organization focused on developing the foundational elements necessary to establish an open ecosystem for decentralized identity and ensure interoperability between all participants.

<p>As a precursor to&nbsp;the LF Decentralized Trust Mentorship 2025 Project, “<a href="https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/904d06c5-5054-4a8e-b933-376d5581cba3">Blockchain-Based OAuth 2.0 Authorization in 5G Core Networks with Hyperledger Fabric</a>,” this blog is the first in a series that explores the evolution of OAuth 2.0 authorization in 5G Core Networks, highlighting its current limitations and the potential of decentralized frameworks to enhance security. In this series, we will discuss how OAuth 2.0 operates in 5G, its risks, and how the integration of Hyperledger Fabric can overcome these challenges.</p>

 Embedding Ethics for Audiences aged&nbsp;14–19 <p>WAO is currently working with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/responsible-innovation-centre">Responsible Innovation Centre for Public Media Futures</a> (RIC), which is hosted by the BBC. The project, which you can read about in our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-does-ai-literacy-look-like-for-young-people-aged-14-19-8b4d798eb369">kick-off post</a>, is focused on research and analysis to help the BBC create policies and content to help improve the AI Literacy skills of young people aged&nbsp;14–19.</p><p>We’re now at the stage where we’ve reviewed academic articles and resources, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-makes-for-a-good-ai-literacy-framework-423c57f01e9a">scrutinised frameworks</a>, and reviewed input from over 40 experts in the field. They are thanked in the acknowledgements section at the end of this&nbsp;post.</p><p>One of the things that has come up time and again is the need for an ethical basis for this kind of work. As a result, in this post we want to share the core values that inform the development of our (upcoming) gap analysis, framework, and recommendations.</p> Public Service Media&nbsp;Values <p>Public Service Media (PSM) organisations such as the BBC have a mission to “inform, educate, and entertain” the public. The Public Media Alliance lists <a href="https://www.publicmediaalliance.org/understanding-public-service-media/">seven PSM values</a> underpinning organisations’ work as&nbsp;being:</p>  Accountability: to the public who fund it and hold power to&nbsp;account  Accessibility: to the breadth of a national population across multiple platforms  Impartiality: in news and quality journalist and content that informs, educates, and entertains  Independence: both in terms of ownership and editorial values  Pluralism: PSM should exist as part of a diverse media landscape  Reliability: especially during crises and emergencies and tackling disinformation  Universalism: in their availability and representation of diversity  <p>These values are helpful to frame core values for the development of AI Literacy in young people aged&nbsp;14–19.</p> AI Literacy Core&nbsp;Values <p>Using the PSM values as a starting point, along with our input from experts and our desk research, we have identified the following core values. These are also summarised in the graphic at the top of this&nbsp;post.</p> 1. Human Agency and Empowerment <p>AI Literacy should empower young people to make informed, independent choices about how, when, and whether to use AI. This means helping develop not just technical ability, but also confidence, curiosity, and a sense of agency in shaping technology, rather than being shaped by it (UNESCO, 2024a; Opened Culture, n.d.). Learners should be encouraged to question, critique, adapt, and even resist AI systems, supporting both individual and collective agency.</p> 2. Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion <p>All young people, regardless of background, ability, or circumstance should have meaningful access to AI Literacy education (Digital Promise, 2024; Good Things Foundation, 2024). Ensuring this in practice means addressing the digital divide, designing for accessibility, and valuing diverse perspectives and experiences. Resources and opportunities must be distributed fairly, with particular attention to those who are digitally disadvantaged or underrepresented.</p> 3. Critical Thinking and Responsible Use <p>Young people should be equipped to think critically about AI, which means evaluating outputs, questioning claims, and understanding both the opportunities and risks presented by AI systems. In addition, young people should be encouraged to understand the importance of responsible use, including understanding bias, misinformation, and the ethical implications of AI in society (European Commission, 2022; Ng et al.,&nbsp;2021).</p> 4. Upholding Human Rights and Wellbeing <p>Using a rights-based approach — including privacy, freedom of expression, and the right to participate fully in society — helps young people understand their rights, navigate issues of consent and data privacy, and recognise the broader impacts of AI on wellbeing, safety, and social justice (OECD, 2022; UNESCO,&nbsp;2024a).</p> 5. Creativity, Participation, and Lifelong&nbsp;Learning <p>AI should be presented as a tool for creativity, collaboration, and self-expression, not just as a subject to be learned for its own sake. PSM organisations should value and promote participatory approaches, encouraging young people to contribute to and shape the conversation about AI. This core value also recognises that AI Literacy is a lifelong process, requiring adaptability and a willingness to keep learning as technology evolves (UNESCO,&nbsp;2024b).</p> Next Steps <p>We will be running a roundtable for invited experts and representatives of the BBC in early June to give feedback on the gap analysis and emerging framework. We will share a version of this after acting on their feedback.</p><p>If you are working in the area of AI Literacy and have comments on these values, please add them to this post, or get in touch: <a href="mailto:hello@weareopen.coop">hello@weareopen.coop</a></p> Acknowledgements <p>The following people have willingly given up their time to provide invaluable input to this&nbsp;project:</p><p>Jonathan Baggaley, Prof Maha Bali, Dr Helen Beetham, Dr Miles Berry, Prof. Oli Buckley, Prof. Geoff Cox​, Dr Rob Farrow, Natalie Foos, Leon Furze, Ben Garside, Dr Daniel Gooch, Dr Brenna Clarke Gray, Dr Angela Gunder, Katie Heard, Prof. Wayne Holmes, Sarah Horrocks, Barry Joseph, Al Kingsley MBE, Dr Joe Lindley, Prof. Sonia Livingstone, Chris Loveday, Prof. Ewa Luger, Cliff Manning, Dr Konstantina Martzoukou, Prof. Julian McDougall, Prof. Gina Neff, Dr Nicola Pallitt, Rik Panganiban, Dr Gianfranco Polizzi, Dr Francine Ryan, Renate Samson, Anne-Marie Scott, Dr Cat Scutt MBE, Dr Sue Sentance, Vicki Shotbolt, Bill Thompson, Christian Turton, Dr Marc Watkins, Audrey Watters, Prof. Simeon Yates, Rebecca&nbsp;Yeager</p> References   Digital Promise (2024).

   The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) has created an open technical standard providing publishers, creators, and consumers the ability to trace the origin of different types of media.  Over the last year, the organization has been creating a governance framework and conformance program (based on the ToIP Metamodel) and is ready to launch it this quarter.

 Briefing Document: Review of C2PA and its Governance 
<p>Date: May 15, 2024<br>
Source: Excerpts from “GMT20250515-145218_Recording_2560x1440.mp4”<br>
Presenter: Scott Perry, Co-chair of Trust over IP’s Foundations Steering Committee, Founder and CEO of the Digital Governance Institute, Co-chair of the Creator Assertions Working Group at the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).<br>
Topic: C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) and the Application of Trust over IP’s Governance Metamodel.</p>
 1. Executive Summary 
<p>This briefing summarizes a presentation by Scott Perry on the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and the application of the Trust over IP (ToIP) governance metamodel to its conformance program. The C2PA is an industry-wide initiative creating a technical standard to attach “truth signals” or provenance information to digital objects. Facing a critical need to operationalize and govern this specification to ensure market trust and adoption, the C2PA has adopted the ToIP governance metamodel. This framework provides the necessary structure to establish a conformance program, define roles and responsibilities, manage risks, and create trust lists for compliant products and certification authorities. The program is set to officially launch on June 4th, initially focusing on self-assertion for conformance and introducing two levels of implementation assurance, with plans for independent attestation and higher assurance levels in the future.</p>
 2. Key Themes and Ideas 
 
 The Problem of Trust in Digital Objects: The presentation highlights the growing challenge of establishing trust and authenticity for digital content in a world of easily manipulated or AI-generated media. This is particularly relevant for industries like telecommunications struggling with identity and verification, as noted by a participant’s observation about OTPs and SMS verification. 
 C2PA as a Standard for Provenance and Authenticity: The C2PA specification aims to provide a technical solution by creating a “content credential” or manifest that is cryptographically bound to a digital object. This manifest acts as a ledger of actions taken on the object, providing a history and “nutrition label” of its source and modifications. “basically, it’s all of the major tech companies except Apple… coming together to create a standard for provenence, authenticity, truth signals on digital objects that can be digitally attached to digital objects.” 
 Content Credential (Manifest): This is the core mechanism of the C2PA. It is a digitally attached ledger of actions taken on a digital object, such as “Camera took picture,” “edited picture,” or “an AI took this picture.” This manifest is “bound to it and linked to it” in a “cryptographically binding format,” providing tamper evidence. 
 Scope of C2PA Responsibility: The C2PA primarily focuses on “created assertions,” which are “product-driven,” documenting actions taken within a product (e.g., a camera generating a picture, Photoshop editing an image). 
 Distinction from “Gathered Assertions”: The C2PA does not take responsibility for “gathered assertions,” which are claims made by individuals or organizations outside of a product (e.g., “I Scott Perry took the picture” or industry-specific identifiers). These are the purview of other groups like CAWG (Content Authenticity Working Group) and related efforts like the Creator Assertions working group at DIF. 
 Binding Mechanism: The C2PA uses X.509 certificates to bind the generator product to the digital asset. “when a picture is taken, the X509 certificate will be used will be binding it will be used to bind it bind the product to the asset.” This requires camera manufacturers and other product vendors to obtain certificates from approved Certification Authorities (CAs). 
 The Need for Governance: While the C2PA created a technical specification, they recognized the critical need for a governance framework to operationalize and control the standard’s implementation and use in the market. “the key aspect is you have a spec out but you can’t control the use of the specification… they couldn’t get, you know, their arms around, you know, the on controlling its the specification use.” 
 Application of ToIP Governance Metamodel: Scott Perry highlights how the ToIP governance metamodel provided the necessary structure for the C2PA to build its conformance program. “I came in with my toolkit from the the trust over IP project and it worked beautifully. It just created the structure to allow them to make the right decisions for themselves.” 
 Key Components of the Governance Program (based on ToIP):Risk Assessment: Started with a “threats and harms task force” to identify major risks, particularly around the tampering of evidence and manifests. 
 Governance Requirements and Framework: Defined primary documents (specification, security requirements, legal agreements) and control documents (privacy, inclusion, equitability requirements). A key output is a glossary of terms for the new ecosystem. 
 Governance Roles and Processes: Identified key roles: the Governing Authority (C2PA Steering Committee), the Administering Party (Conformance Task Force), and Governed Parties (CAs, Generator Product companies, Validator Product companies). 
 Legal Agreements: Formal agreements are being established between the C2PA and governed parties outlining roles, responsibilities, conformance requirements, and dispute resolution mechanisms. 
 Conformance Criteria and Assurance: Defined based on the C2PA specification and implementation security requirements. The program includes “four levels of of assurance around the implementation of products,” though initially rolling out with two levels. These levels are tied to “security objectives” and assessed against the “target of evaluation” (the product and its supporting infrastructure). 
 Conformance Process: Involves an intake form, application review, assessment of infrastructure (initially self-assertion, moving towards independent attestation), legal agreement signing, and adding records to trust lists. 
 Residual Risk Assessment and Adaptation: The program includes a process to learn from the rollout, identify unmet requirements or issues, and adapt the program for continuous improvement. 
 Trust Lists (Registries): Central to the program are trust lists identifying approved Generator Products, Validator Products, and Certification Authorities. A timestamp authority trust list is also being added. 
 Levels of Assurance: The program is defining levels (initially rolling out two) to reflect different degrees of confidence in the implementation of the C2PA specification and associated security requirements. Achieving a higher level of assurance requires meeting all requirements for that level. 
 Self-Assertion (Initial Rollout): Due to the complexity of auditing and getting the program launched quickly, the initial phase requires participants to self-assert that they meet the specification and requirements. 
 Conformance Certificate: Upon successful conformance, products will receive a certificate tied to an OID (Object Identifier) denoting the assurance level they have achieved. This OID in the manifest’s certificate will identify the assurance level of the provenance information. 
 JPEG Trust and Copyright: While C2PA provides provenance information that can be used for copyright, it doesn’t define ownership or copyright laws. JPEG Trust is mentioned as an organization creating an ISO standard focused on copyrights in concert with the C2PA standard. 
 Relationship with W3C: The C2PA is actively engaged with the W3C, with discussions happening at the technical working group level regarding related standards like PROV (for provenance). 
 Future Directions: Plans include introducing higher levels of assurance, implementing independent attested conformance, developing quality control software for assessing product compliance, and establishing a fee structure for the conformance program. 
 CAWG (Content Authenticity Working Group) as a Broader Ecosystem: CAWG is viewed as a potentially larger ecosystem dealing with identity, metadata, endorsements, and AI learning process specifications, which will need to create their own applications and standards that can integrate with the C2PA foundation. 
 
 3. Important Ideas and Facts 
 
 The C2PA is the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity. 
 It includes major tech and product manufacturers, excluding Apple initially but aiming to include them. 
 The core technical output is the Content Credential (Manifest), a digitally attached ledger of actions on a digital object. 
 The manifest provides tamper evidence and binds the product to the asset using X.509 certificates. 
 C2PA focuses on “created assertions” (product-driven actions), leaving “gathered assertions” (individual/organizational claims) to other groups like CAWG. 
 The Trust over IP governance metamodel has been successfully applied to structure the C2PA conformance program. 
 The program addresses threats and harms related to tampering and requires adherence to implementation security requirements. 
 The C2PA conformance program will officially launch on June 4th at the Content Authenticity Initiative symposium in New York City. 
 The initial launch will include two levels of implementation assurance and a self-assertion confidence model. 
 Key outputs of the governance program are legal agreements and trust lists of conforming products and certification authorities. 
 The C2PA standard is becoming an ISO standard this year. 
 Timestamp authorities will play a crucial role in providing trust signals related to the time of claim assertion. 
 The program includes mediation and dispute resolution mechanisms in its legal agreements. 
 The governance program provides the structure for the C2PA to “operationalize the spec” and control its use. 
 
 4. Key Quotes 
 
 “basically, it’s all of the major tech companies except Apple… Coming together to create a standard for provenence, authenticity, truth signals on digital objects that can be digitally attached to digital objects.” 
 “what it what it’s proposed to do is to create a ledger of actions against a digital object that is bound to it.” 
 “It’s kind of the nutrition label on food… it’s really the nutrition label of all digital objects.” 
 “The C2PA did not want to get involved in all of the the potential root, you know, actions and and variances about those types of things. They wanted to create the platform.” 
 “They create the platform and they create the binding between the digital asset and the and the manifest using X509 certificates.” 
 “The key aspect is you have a spec out but you can’t control the use of the specification… they couldn’t get, you know, their arms around, you know, the on controlling its the specification use.” 
 “the governance program was needed to operationalize the spec. The spec was had, you know, a limitation in its usefulness without a governance program around it.” 
 “I came in with my toolkit from the the trust over IP project and it worked beautifully. It just created the structure to allow them to make the right decisions for themselves.” 
 “we’re creating a program which will hold generator and validator products accountable to the specific ification that’s already been published.” 
 “We are creating two levels of implement implementation assurance and we are are using a self assertion confidence model we don’t have the mechanisms in place to hold organizations accountable for meeting the specification we don’t have an you know an assurance mechanism in place yet to do that.” 
 “It is the hope that you know copyright laws can use the trust signals that are coming from the CTBA specification and conformance program in use for defining ownership and copyright.” 
 “The conformance criteria is the spec and the spec is now at at level 2.2.” 
 “we are looking at levels of assurance around the implementation of a product. Now it’s not just the product but it’s also its infrastructure.” 
 “These are the kinds of records that were that are in the schema for the trust list.” 
 
 5. Next Steps 
 
 Official launch of the C2PA conformance program on June 4th. 
 Continued work on independent attestation and higher levels of assurance for the conformance program. 
 Development of quality control software or processes for assessing product compliance. 
 Ongoing collaboration with W3C and other relevant standards bodies. 
 Further exploration of the broader CAWG ecosystem and its integration with C2PA.

<p>Abstract</p>



<p>Session hijacking is a growing initial attack vector for online fraud and account takeover. Because FIDO authentication reduces the effectiveness of other simpler forms of compromise, such as credential stuffing and phishing, cybercriminals turn to theft and re-use of bearer tokens. Bearer tokens are a form of credential which include session cookies used by browsers connecting to websites and OAuth access tokens used by other thick client application types such as native mobile applications. When these credentials are long-lived and can be “lifted and shifted” from the machine where they were created to be usable by a bad actor from another machine, their tradable value is significant. Emerging technologies such as Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) for browsers and Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) for OAuth applications seek to reduce the threat of session hijacking. This article describes how these technologies address the problem of session hijacking and how they complement strong phishing resistant authentication in online ecosystems.</p>



<p>Audience</p>



<p>This white paper is for chief information security officers (CISOs) and technical staff whose responsibility it is to protect the security and life cycle of online identity and access management from online fraud.&nbsp;</p>

 1. Introduction 



<p>Authentication and authorization are integral parts of an identity lifecycle, especially for online credential ecosystems. The growing threat of online identity fraud with costly security incidents and breaches has enterprises looking for ways to protect and secure their workforces from account takeover through different attack vectors such as phishing, credential stuffing, and session hijacking. For authentication, FIDO authentication with passkeys provides users with “Safer, more secure, and faster online experiences”, and an increase in the adoption of passkeys has contributed to a reduction of the success of attack vectors of credential phishing, credential stuffing, and session hijacking accomplished via man-in-the-middle (MITM) phishing attacks. However, what happens after the authentication ceremony?</p>



<p>After authentication, browsers and application clients are typically issued other credentials. Enterprise applications generally fall into two primary categories: those that are web browser based and use session cookies for state management and those that are thick client applications using OAuth access tokens (this includes some browser-based single page applications and most native mobile applications). Both types of credentials (session cookies and access tokens) are considered, in their basic use, as “bearer” tokens. If you have the token (the session cookie or the access token), then you can continue to transact for the lifetime of that token as the user who authenticated and owned it.This whitepaper explores adjacent technologies that address the “lift and shift” attack vector for bearer tokens and how these technologies complement FIDO-based authentication mechanisms. In particular, this paper focuses on the proposed web standard Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) for protecting browser session cookies and OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) for protecting OAuth grants.</p>



 2. Terminology 



<p>session hijacking: An exploitation of the web session control mechanism that is normally managed for a session cookie.</p>



<p>credential stuffing: An automated injection of stolen username and password pairs (credentials) into website login forms to fraudulently gain access to user accounts.</p>

<p>access token: A credential used by a client-side application to invoke API calls on behalf of the user.</p>



<p>session cookie: A credential managed by browsers to maintain session state between a browser and a website.</p>



<p>bearer token: A token (in the context of this whitepaper may refer to either an access token or a session cookie) so called because whoever holds the token can use it to access resources. A bearer token on its own can be “lifted and shifted” for use on another computing device.</p>



<p>sender-constrained token: A token protected by a mechanism designed to minimize the risk that anything other than the client which established the token during an authentication process could use that token in subsequent requests for server-side resources.</p>



<p>Device Bound Session Credential (DBSC): A proposal for a W3C web standard defining a protocol and browser behavior to establish and maintain sender-constrained cookies. The mechanism uses proof of possession of an asymmetric cryptographic key to help mitigate session cookie hijacking.OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Procession (DPoP): A mechanism for implementing sender-constrained access tokens that requires clients to demonstrate possession of an asymmetric cryptographic key when using the token.</p>



<p>OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Procession (DPoP): A mechanism for implementing sender-constrained access tokens that requires clients to demonstrate possession of an asymmetric cryptographic key when using the token.</p>



 3. Adjacent/complementary technologies for a secure ecosystem 



<p>While FIDO authentication technology can effectively eliminate phishing and credential stuffing attacks that occur during the login process, the addition of solutions to mitigate threats associated with bearer token theft is equally important. Bad actors whose attacks are thwarted during the login process will go after the next weakest link in the chain and try to steal post-authentication bearer tokens. This section explores two of these technologies for protecting bearer tokens: Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) protect browser-based session cookies and Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) protects OAuth grants. Alternative approaches to protect bearer tokens are also discussed.</p>



<p>Because no single piece of technology can protect against all threats, a combination of multiple techniques is required for adequate protection.</p>

<p>Before discussing Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC), you will need to understand the problem being addressed regarding browser session cookies. Session hijacking via cookie theft allows an attacker, who possesses stolen cookies, to bypass end-user authentication, including any strong or multi-factor authentication (MFA). This is particularly problematic when browsers create long-lived session cookies (which are a type of bearer token), since these cookies can be traded as alternatives to a user’s primary authentication credentials and then used from the attacker’s machine. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, financial loss, and damage to an organization’s reputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attackers perform cookie theft through various methods such as man-in-the-middle phishing of a user’s existing MFA login process (when phishing-resistant authentication such as FIDO is not used), client-side malware, and occasionally through vulnerabilities in server-side infrastructure or software. Regardless of how cookie theft is perpetrated, when successful, these attacks are not only dangerous, but also hard to isolate and detect. Complementary technologies, such as Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC), minimize the risks associated with browser cookie theft by making stolen cookies impractical to use from any machine other than the machine to which they were issued during authentication.</p>



<p>3.2 Device Bound Sessional Credentials – DBSC</p>



<p>DBSC refers to a proposed web standard currently in development within the Web Application Security working group of the W3C[2]. The goal of DBSC is to combat and disrupt the stolen web session cookies market. This is achieved by defining an HTTP messaging protocol and required browser and server behaviors to result in binding the use of application session cookies to the user’s computing device. DBSC uses an asymmetric key pair and in browser implementations the private keys should be unextractable by an attacker – for example stored within a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), secure element, or similar hardware-based cryptographic module.</p>



<p>At a high level, the API in conjunction with the user’s browser and secure key storage capabilities, allows for the following:</p>



 
 The server communicates to the browser a request to establish a new DBSC session. This includes a server-provided challenge. 



 The browser generates an asymmetric key pair, then sends the public key along with the signed challenge to the server. This process is referred to as DBSC registration. Browser implementations of DBSC should use operating system APIs that facilitate secure, hardware-bound storage and use of the private key. 



 The server binds the public key to the browser session by issuing a short-lived, refreshable auth_cookie which is then required to be transmitted in subsequent browser requests to the web server. 
 



<p>As the auth_cookie regularly expires, a mechanism is required for the browser to refresh the auth_cookie asynchronously to primary application web traffic. The refresh process requires signing a new server-issued challenge with the same private key created during DBSC registration, thereby re-proving (regularly) that the client browser is still in possession of the same private key.</p>



<p>Limiting the lifetime of the auth_cookie to short periods of time (for example, a few minutes) disrupts the market for trading long-lived session cookies. An attacker can only use stolen session cookies (including the auth_cookie) for a brief period, and cannot perform a refresh operation, since the private key required to perform a refresh operation is not extractable from the client machine.</p>



<p>DBSC may be introduced into existing deployments with minimal changes to the application. This is important as DBSC could easily be incorporated as a web plugin module in existing server-side technology (for example, Apache module, Servlet Filter, or reverse proxy functionality). This permits enterprises to roll out deployment of DBSC in phases without a complete overhaul of all current infrastructure and companies can prioritize certain critical endpoints or resources first.</p>



<p>DBSC server-side implementations can also be written in a manner that permits semantics, for example: “If the browser supports DBSC, use it, otherwise fallback to regular session characteristics.” This allows users to gain the security advantages of DBSC when they use a browser that supports it without having to require all users to upgrade their browsers first.</p>



<p>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/dbsc">Device Bound Session Credentials explainer</a> for more details on the DBSC protocol and standard, including a proposal for enterprise-specific extensions that adds attestation to DBSC keypairs.</p>



<p>3.2.1 What makes DBSC a technology complementary to FIDO?</p>



<p>The DBSC draft standard permits the login process to be closely integrated with the DBSC API. While FIDO is a mechanism that makes authentication safer and phishing resistant, DBSC is a mechanism that makes the bearer credential (session cookie) safer post-authentication. They complement each other by reducing the risk of account takeover and abuse, making the entire lifecycle of application sessions safer.</p>



<p>3.2.2 Alternative solutions</p>



<p>DBSC is not the first standard to propose binding session cookies to a client device. Token Binding is an alternative that combines IETF RFCs 8471, 8472, and 8473. Token Binding over HTTP is implemented via a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension and uses cryptographic certificates to bind tokens to a TLS session. Token Binding has had limited browser adoption and is complex to implement as it requires changes at the application layer and in TLS security stacks. The Token Binding over HTTP standard has not been widely adopted and only one major browser currently offers support.</p>



<p>3.2.3 Advice</p>



<p>The DBSC standard relies on local device security and operating system APIs for storage and use of the private key that is bound to the browser’s session. While these private keys cannot be exported to another device, the key is available on the local system and may be exercisable by malware residing on the user’s device. Similarly, in-browser malware still has complete visibility into both regular session cookies and short-lived auth_cookies. DBSC is not a replacement for client-side malware protection, and the threat model for DBSC does not provide protections from persistent client-side malware. Ultimately, the user must trust the browser.</p>



<p>As browsers start to support DBSC over time, it will be important for servers to be able to work with a mix of browsers that do and do not include support for this technology. Some enterprises may dictate that corporate issued machines include browsers known to support DBSC, but many will not. It will be necessary for server-side implementations to take this into consideration, using DBSC when the browser responds to registration requests, and tolerating unbound session cookies when the browser does not. When building or choosing a commercial solution, ensure you consider this scenario, and include the ability to implement access control policies that strictly require DBSC in highly controlled or regulated environments or for specific applications.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, DBSC is in early evolution. It remains to be seen whether or not it will be widely adopted by browser vendors. The hope is that incubating and developing this standard via the W3C will result in wider adoption than previous proposals, similar to the way that the WebAuthn API has been adopted to bring passkey authentication to all major browser implementations.</p>



 4. OAuth grants 



<p>The previous section introduced DBSC as a means to protect against session cookie theft in web browsers. Thick application clients, including mobile applications and single-page web applications, typically use stateless API calls leveraging OAuth grants instead of session cookies. An OAuth grant may be established in several ways, with the&nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252">recommended pattern for thick clients</a> being to initially use the system browser to authenticate a user, and grant access for an application to act on their behalf. Conceptually this is remarkably similar to browser-based sessions, including the ability and recommendation, to use FIDO authentication for end-user authentication when possible. At the conclusion of the browser-based authentication portion of this flow, control is returned to the thick client application or single-page web application where tokens are established for use in programmatic API calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The challenge that occurs from this point forward is almost identical to that described for browsers – the OAuth tokens are bearer tokens that if exposed to a bad actor can be used to call application APIs from a remote machine instead of from the legitimate application.</p>



<p>This section describes the use of DPoP, a technology for protecting the “lift and shift” of credentials used in OAuth-protected API calls which, just like DBSC, makes use of an asymmetric key pair and ongoing proof of possession of the private key.</p>



<p>4.1 Demonstrate Proof of Possession (DPoP)</p>



<p>OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) is an extension of the existing OAuth 2.0 standard for implementing device bound (or sender-constrained) OAuth access and refresh tokens. It is an application-level mechanism that allows for the tokens associated with an OAuth grant (that is, refresh tokens and access tokens) to bind with the requested client using a public and private key pair. This requires the client to prove ownership of its private key to the authorization server when performing access token refresh operations and to resource servers when using access tokens to call APIs.</p>



<p>6. OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252</a></p>



<p>High assurance OpenID specifications, such as <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">Financial-grade API (FAPI 2.0)</a>, mandate the use of sender-constrained tokens and DPoP is the recommended method for implementing this requirement when Mutual TLS (mTLS) is not available.</p>



<p>At a high level, DPoP requires that:</p>



 
 The client generates a per-grant public/private key pair to be used for constructing DPoP proofs. Best practice implementations should use operating system APIs to ensure the private key is non-extractable. 



 On initial grant establishment (for example, exchanging an OAuth authorization code for the grant’s first access token and refresh token), a DPoP proof (a JWT signed by the client’s private key that contains, among other things, a copy of the public key) is used to bind a public key to the grant. 



 Requests to a resource server using an access token obtained in this manner must also include a DPoP proof header, continuously proving possession of the private key used during grant establishment. This is done for every API request. Resource servers are required to check if an access token is sender-constrained, confirm the public key, and validate the DPoP proof header on each API call. 



 For public clients, subsequent refresh_token flows to the authorization server’s token endpoint must also contain a DPoP proof signed with the same key used during initial grant establishment. This is particularly important as the refresh tokens are often long-lived and are also a type of bearer token (that is, if you have it you can use it). The authorization server must enforce the use of a DPoP proof for these refresh token flows and ensure signature validation occurs via the same public key registered during initial grant establishment. 
 



<p>Unlike a plain bearer access token which can be used by any holder, DPoP based access tokens are bound to the client that initially established the OAuth grant, since only that client can sign DPoP proofs with the private key. This approach minimizes the risks associated with malicious actors trading leaked access tokens.</p>



<p>Refer to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449">DPoP RFC 9449</a> – OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) for more information.</p>



<p>4.2 What makes DPoP a complementary technology to FIDO?</p>



<p>FIDO can be leveraged for phishing resistant end-user authentication during establishment of an OAuth grant. Refresh and access tokens obtained by a client following this authentication should be safeguarded against “lift and shift” attacks just like session cookies in browser-based apps. DPoP is a recommended solution for protecting these OAuth tokens from unauthorized post-authentication use. Together, FIDO for end user authentication and DPoP for binding OAuth tokens to a client device complement each other to improve the overall security posture for identities used in thick client applications.</p>



<p>4.2.1 DPoP alternative solutions?</p>



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705">RFC8705</a> – OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens describes a mechanism that offers a transporter layer solution to bind access tokens to a client certificate. While it has been approved for use in <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">FAPI 2.0</a> for open banking solutions, it is not particularly suitable for public clients such as native mobile applications.</p>



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9421">RFC9421</a> – HTTP Message Signatures defines an application-level mechanism for signing portions of an HTTP message. Key establishment and sharing between the client and verifier are not defined by this specification, although this could be performed in a trust on first user manner during initial grant establishment in a similar manner to DPoP. There is no known public specification that maps the use of HTTP message signatures to the use case of sender-constrained bearer tokens in an OAuth client application. In the absence of such a public specification, widespread adoption for this use case is unlikely.</p>



<p>4.2.2 Advice</p>



<p>Sender-constrained tokens are a good idea, and, in some deployments, they are a regulatory requirement. For example, use of the FAPI profiles of OAuth is now mandated by many sovereign open banking initiatives. DPoP is a relatively simple way to achieve this requirement and is flexible enough to cover a wide range of application client types. That said, care must still be taken to adhere to the security considerations of DPoP. Pay close attention to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449#section-11">section 11 of RFC9449</a>, as well as apply other application security strategies for native or browser based single page applications as your scenario dictates. Remember that DPoP is focused solely on addressing the threats associated with token exfiltration, which include trading and use by malicious actors. It should be considered part of a defense-in-depth strategy for OAuth applications.</p>



 5. Conclusion 



<p>The intent of this paper is to inspire thinking around how different web security standards fit together and how those standards relate to the use of FIDO authentication for users. There are so many standards and standards bodies that it is often hard to understand which compete in the same space and which augment one another to form part of a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy for identity fraud protection in online applications.</p>



<p>This paper tackled a specific, prevalent application security problem – the malicious trading and use of stolen cookies and access tokens. This paper also showed how technologies such as DBSC and DPoP mitigate the threats associated with token theft and how these technologies are complementary to FIDO authentication. Paired with FIDO, DBSC and DPoP provide greater overall identity fraud protection for your applications.</p>

 Community strategies and&nbsp;tools <p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/blogs/community-platform-project/building-power-and-making-change-community-strategies-and-tools">cross-posted on the Amnesty UK&nbsp;blog</a></p><p>Community-driven change is more important than ever. Whether we are advocating for social justice, environmental sustainability, or political reform, collective action is how we create lasting impact. But how do we build a movement that starts with individual curiosity and grows into sustained activism? That’s where the Amnesty International UK (AIUK) community platform project comes in — a digital hub designed to empower individuals, support collaboration, and drive meaningful change.</p><p>This blog post outlines how the platform and community strategy work together to guide people from discovery of the AIUK community to becoming activists within&nbsp;it.</p>Image remixed from an original by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO 1. Discovery <p>The journey of community-driven change starts with discovery. This is the stage where individuals first come into contact with AIUK. Maybe they learn about an issue, identify it as important, and begin to consider how they might want to get involved. Or maybe they meet someone at a demonstration, and discover the community first-hand.</p><p>AIUK social media, through broadcasting, is just one tool that helps people discover Amnesty International UK. AIUK makes complex issues accessible and relatable. We want to do the same as AIUK highlights grassroots efforts and community initiatives.</p><p>We want to encourage posts that&nbsp;show:</p>  Our dedicated community and highlight key grassroots initiatives and campaigns.  Signposts to find local groups or events based on interests.  Digital actions, such as petitions or downloading campaign guides, to help users take their first&nbsp;steps.  <p>Such content ensures that even people who are new can find relevant AIUK communities and take the first steps toward engagement.</p> 2. Intention to&nbsp;Engage <p>Once someone discovers a cause they care about, the next step is forming an intention to engage. This stage is all about commitment — moving from passive interest to active participation.</p><p>By showcasing community on the AIUK website, we both invite people in and celebrate what the community is achieving. We want to present clear pathways for involvement and help community members inspire others to take steps towards&nbsp;action.</p><p>We need to figure out processes that&nbsp;help:</p>  Goal-setting: Encouraging community members to set personal milestones, like committing to attend 100 meetings.  Sharing success: Telling success stories and finding testimonials that effectively attract new people while celebrating community achievements.  Balancing information: Showcasing static information about past successes with dynamic, real-time updates on current campaigns from the community.  <p>By making it easy for people to express their intent and take small but meaningful steps, we build confidence and lay the groundwork for deeper engagement.</p> 3. Taking Action: Turning Intent into&nbsp;Impact <p>With intention comes action, and this is where real change begins. At this stage, people start to feel a sense of belonging and are ready to contribute to a cause they care&nbsp;about.</p><p>A knowledge base can help equip users with actionable tools. We’ll need clear resources and learning pathways&nbsp;that:</p>  Guide people to the right information: Whether it’s organising a protest, writing letters to policymakers, or starting a local campaign, the knowledge hub can provide step-by-step guidance tailored to issues we work&nbsp;on.  Help people collaborate: People should be able to connect with others who share their interests and work together on projects — whether virtually or in person. Best practices and community policies may also be at home in the knowledge hub.  Show them into the community: Make sure that people feel supported and seen as they take action. Create an architecture of participation that brings them into the community platform.  <p>This stage is about turning isolated actions into collective power, with the support of the community ensuring that every contribution counts.</p> 4. Sustaining Action: Building Lasting Commitment <p>Sustained action is the key to creating lasting change. Too often, movements fizzle out after an initial burst of energy, but with a strong community strategy and integrated platform, we can keep momentum&nbsp;going.</p><p>To sustain engagement, the community platform needs to help people align with others in the AIUK movement. We need to think&nbsp;about:</p>  Feedback loops: Regular check-ins with the community to understand their needs and ensure that we are adapting the community strategy and platform accordingly.  A recognition ecosystem: Using digital badges and shoutouts for individuals or groups who demonstrate consistent commitment to help us make activism more&nbsp;visible.  Storytelling opportunities: Sharing success stories and lessons learned will inspire others and keep motivation high.  <p>By encouraging a sense of belonging and purpose, we ensure that members find reasons to continue building collective power for human&nbsp;rights.</p> 5. Becoming an Activist: Empowering Future&nbsp;Leaders <p>The final stage is becoming an activist. At this point, individuals understand that community isn’t one person, but rather all of us. They begin to work on behalf of others, coordinate together and lift people up with their leadership.</p><p>These leaders will use other coordination tools and processes and that’s great! We want to empower the development of activist and leadership skills. We’ll&nbsp;need:</p>  Decentralised coordination best practices: For members who are ready to take on larger roles, such as leading groups or campaigns.  Mentorship programs: Connecting experienced activists with newcomers to share knowledge and build networks.  Advocacy training: Workshops, webinars, and resources focused on effective communication, policy advocacy, and community organising.  <p>Through these efforts, we can go beyond nurturing individual leaders to continue building a movement.</p> The Power of Community Work in Driving&nbsp;Change <p>The journey from discovery to becoming an activist is a process of gradual engagement and empowerment. There is a system of platforms, processes and content that help AIUK move people towards becoming an activist. Although we use various digital tools, the journey is an emotional and social&nbsp;one.</p><p>We are working hard to make sure the community platform project harnesses the collective strength of our community and makes a difference that&nbsp;lasts.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/building-power-and-making-change-367b03f9b785">Building Power and Making Change</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Fourth is <a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">personal AI</a>. This is AI that is as much yours as your shoes, your bike, and your PC. Personal, not personalized.</p>
<p>To explain how these will work together, start here:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not long after <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527/">The Intention Economy</a> came out in May, 2012, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Thomson_(executive)">Robert Thomson</a>, Managing Editor of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/">The Wall Street Journal</a>, wanted the book’s opening chapter to serve as the cover essay for the Marketplace section of an upcoming issue. <a href="https://hbr.org/hbrpress">Harvard Business Review Press</a> didn’t like that idea, so I wrote an original piece based on one idea in the book: that shoppers will soon be able to tell the market what they’re looking for, in safe, secure and anonymous ways—a kind of advertising in reverse that the book called “personal RFPs” and has since come to be called “intentcasting.” This became <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444873204577535352521092154">The Customer as a God</a>: The image above was the whole cover of the Marketplace section on Monday,&nbsp; July 23, 2012. The essay opened with these prophetic words: “It’s a Saturday morning in 2022…”</p>
<p>It is now a Friday morning in 2025, and that godly future for customers is still not here. Yes, we have more market power than in 2012, but we are digital serfs whose powers are limited to those granted by&nbsp; Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and other feudal overlords. This system is a free market only to the degree that you can choose your captor.&nbsp; This has led to—</p>
<p></p>
<p>The IONBA (Internet Of Notning But Accounts) is based on a premise: that the best customers are captive ones. In this relic of the industrial age, customers are captive to every entity that requires logins and passwords. Customers also have no ways of their own to globally control what data is collected about them, or how. Or to limit how that data is used.&nbsp; This is why our digital lives are infected by privacy-killing data-collection viruses living inside our computers, phones, TVs, and cars.</p>
<p>If you didn’t know about those last two, dig:</p>
 
 Consumer Reports says “<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics/privacy/how-to-turn-off-smart-tv-snooping-features-a4840102036/">All smart TVs—from Samsung, LG, you name it—collect personal data</a>.”&nbsp;They also come with lame “privacy” controls, typically buried deep in a settings menu. (Good luck exhuming them. The ones in our TCL and Samsung TVs have all but disappeared.) 
 Mozilla calls new cars “<a href="http://the%20Worst%20Product%20Category%20We%20Have%20Ever%20Reviewed%20for%20Privacy">the Worst Product Category We Have Ever Reviewed for Privacy</a>.” There is also nothing you can do to stop your car from reporting on everything your car does—and everything you do, including sexual ativity—to the carmaker, insurance companies, law enforcement, and who knows who else. This data goes out through your car’s cell phone, misleadingly called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telematic_control_unit">telematics control unit</a>. The antenna is hidden in the shark fin on your car’s roof or in an outside mirror. 
 
<p>Businesses are also starting to lose faith in surveillance, for at least eight reasons:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2015/01/16/privacy/">People hate it</a>. 
 They also fight it. By 2015 ad blocking and tracking protection were <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the biggest boycott in world history</a>.

 Customers are using AI tools for guidance toward a final purchase, bypassing marketing schemes to bias purchasing decisions along the way. For more on that, see <a href="https://marketoonist.com/2025/05/marketing-ai-agents.html">Tom Fishburne’s cartoon</a>, and <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/marketings-new-middleman-ai-agents/">Bain’s report</a> about it. 
 
<p>So our four roads to The Intention Economy start with the final failings of the systems built to prevent it. Now let’s look at those roads.</p>
<p>Visa Intelligent Commerce</p>
<p>The press release is <a href="https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.21361.html">Find and Buy with AI: Visa Unveils New Era of Commerce</a>. Less blah is <a href="https://corporate.visa.com/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html">Enabling AI agents to buy securely and seamlessly</a>. Here’s the opening copy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine a future where an AI agent can shop and buy for you. AI commerce — commerce powered by an AI agent — is going to transform the way consumers around the world shop.</p>
<p>Introducing Visa Intelligent Commerce, an initiative that will empower AI agents to deliver personalized and secure shopping experiences for consumers – at scale.</p>
<p>From browsing and selection to purchase and post-purchase management, this program will equip AI agents to seamlessly manage key phases of the shopping process.</p></blockquote>
<p>Visa CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McInerney">Ryan McInerney</a>&nbsp;says a lot more in a 1:22 talk at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atiskafZIJo">Visa Product Drop 2025</a>. The most relevant part starts about 26 minutes in, with a demo starting at about 31:30. Please watch it. Much of what you see there owes to Inrupt and Solid, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> says were inspired by The Intention Economy. For more about where Inrupt and Solid fit in Visa Intelligent Commerce, see <a href="https://www.inrupt.com/blog/standards-for-agentic-commerce-visas-bold-move">Standards for Agentic Commerce: Visa’s Bold Move and What It Means: Visa’s investment in safe Intelligent Commerce points to a future of standards-forward personal AI</a>, by <a href="https://www.inrupt.com/about">John Bruce</a>, Inrupt’s CEO. John briefed Joyce and me over Zoom the other day. Very encouraging, with lots to develop on and talk about.</p>

<p>IEEE P7012 “MyTerms”</p>
<p><a href="https://projectvrm.org/2025/04/06/myterms/">MyTerms</a>, <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">the most important standard in development today</a>, will be a keystone service of <a href="https://customercommons.org">Customer Commons,</a> the nonprofit spinoff of ProjectVRM. It will do for contract what Creative Commons did for copyright: give individuals a new form of control. With MyTerms, agreements between customers and companies will be far more genuine mutual, and open to new forms of innovation not based on the kind of corporate control that typifies the IONBA. For example, it can open Visa Intelligent Commerce to conversations and relationships that go far past transaction. Take for example <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/market-intelligence-that-flows-both-ways-e822fa74530">Market intelligence that flows both ways</a>. While this has been thinkable for a decade or more (that last link is from 2016), it’s far more do-able when customers and companies have real relationships based on equal power and mutual interests. These are best framed up on agreements that start on the customer’s side, and give customers scale across all the companies with which they have genuine relationships.</p>
<p>First Person Project (FPP)</p>
<p>To me, FPP begins with the vision <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2015/11/25/remembering-big-davy/">“Big Davy” Sallis</a> came up with while he was working for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314191743/http://visaeurope.com/">VISA Europe</a> in 2012, and read the The Intention Economy. At the time, he wanted Visa to make VRM a real category, but assumed that would take too long. So he decided to create a VRM startup called <a href="https://www.qredo.com/">Qredo</a>. Joyce and I consulted Qredo until&nbsp; <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2015/11/25/remembering-big-davy/">Davy</a> died (far too young) in 2015. Qredo went into a different business, but <a href="http://searls.com/qredo1/">a draft I created for Qredo’s original website</a> survives, and it outlines much of what the&nbsp; FPP will make possible. That effort is led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drummondreed/">Drummond Reed</a>, another friend and collaborator of Davy’s and a participant in ProjectVRM from the start. Drummond says the FPP is inspired by <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2014/03/19/why-we-need-first-person-technologies-on-the-net/">Why We Need First Person Technologies on the Net</a>, a post published here in 2014. That post begins,</p>
<blockquote><p>We need&nbsp;first person technologies&nbsp;for the same reason we need first person voices: because there are some things only a person can say and do.</p>
<p>Only a person can use the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronouns">pronouns</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;“I,” “me,” “my” and “mine.” Likewise, only a person can use tools such as screwdrivers, eyeglasses and pencils. Those things are all&nbsp;first person technologies. They were invented for individual persons to use.</p>
<p>We use first person technologies the same unique ways we use our voices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among other things, the First Person Project will fix how identity works on the Internet. With FPI—First Person Identity—interactions with relying parties (the ones wanting “your ID”) don’t need your drivers license, passport, birth certificate, credit card, or account information. You just give them what’s required, on an as-needed basis, in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">verifiable credentials</a>. The credentials you provide can verify that you are a citizen of a country, licensed to drive, have a ticket to a game, or whatever. In other words, they do what Kim Cameron outlined in his<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065"> Laws of Identity</a>: disclose minimum information for constrained uses (Law 2) to justifiable parties (Law 3) under your control and consent (Law 1). The credential you present is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier">DID: a Decentralized Identifier</a>. No account is required.</p>
<p>Trust in FPI also expands from individual to community. Here is how Phil Windley explains it in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2025/04/establishing_first_person_digital_trust.shtml">Establishing First Person Digital Trust</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Alice and Bob met at IIW, they didn’t rely on a platform to create their connection. They didn’t upload keys to a server or wait for some central authority to vouch for them. They exchanged DIDs, authenticated each other directly, and established a secure, private communication channel.</p>
<p>That moment wasn’t just a technical handshake—it was a statement of first-person identity. Alice told Bob, “This is who I am, on my terms.” Bob responded in kind. And when they each issued a verifiable relationship credential, they gave that relationship form: a mutual, portable, cryptographically signed artifact of trust. This is the essence of first-person identity—not something granted by an institution, but something expressed and constructed in the context of relationships. It’s identity as narrative, not authority; as connection, not classification.</p>
<p>And because these credentials are issued peer-to-peer, scoped to real interactions, and managed by personal agents, they resist commodification and exploitation. They are not profile pages or social graphs owned by a company to be monetized. They are artifacts of human connection, held and controlled by the people who made them. In this world, Alice and Bob aren’t just users—they’re participants.</p></blockquote>
<p>This also expands outward into community, and webs of trust. You get personal agency plus community agency.</p>
<p>The FPP covers a lot more ground than identity alone, but that’s where it starts. Also, Customer Commons is a funding source for the FPP, and I’m involved there as well.</p>
<p>Personal AI</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rezarassool/">Reza Rassool</a> was also inspired by The Intention Economy when he started <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/">Kwaai.ai</a>, a nonprofit community developing open-source <a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">personal AI</a>. I now serve Kwaai as its volunteer Chief Intention Officer.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what personal AI will do for this woman:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Looks great, but we’re stuck in IONBA, she has little control over her personal data in all those spaces. For example,</p>
 
 She doesn’t have the digital version of what George Carlin called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLoge6QzcGY">a place for my stuff</a>.” (Watch that video. It’s brilliant—and correct.) 
 She has few records of where she’s been, who she’s been with and when—even though apps on her phone know that stuff and are keeping it inside the records of her giant overlords and/or selling it to parties unknown, with no way yet for getting it back for her own use. 
 Her finances are possibly organized, but scattered between the folders she keeps for taxes, plus the ones that live with banks, brokers, and other entities she hardly thinks about. It would be mighty handy to have a place of her own where she could easily see all her obligations, recurring payments, subscriptions, and other stuff her counterparties would rather she not know completely. 
 Her schedules are in Apple, Google, and/or Microsoft calendars, which are well app’d and searchable, but not integrated. She has no digital calendar that is independent and truly her own. 
 Her business and personal relationship records are scattered across her contact apps, her Linkedin page, and piles of notes and business cards. She has no place or way of her own to manage all of them. 
 Her health care records (at least here in the U.S.) are a total mess. Some of them ares inside the MyCharts and patient portals provided by separate (and mostly unconnected) health care specialists and medical systems. Some of it is in piles of printouts she has accumulated (if she’s kept them) from all the different providers she has seen. Some of it is in fitness and wellness apps, all with exclusive ways of dealing with users. None of it is in a unified and coherent form. 
 
<p>So the challenge for personal AI is pulling all that data out of all her accounts, and putting it into forms that give her full agency, with the help of her personal AIs.&nbsp; Personalized AIs from giants can’t do that. <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">We need our own personal AIs</a>.</p>
<p>Four roads, one destination: a world where free customers prove more valuable than captive ones. Let’s make it happen.</p>

<p>Passkeys are unique digital credentials tied to a user’s personal device and offer a way to authenticate identity without the need for traditional passwords or one-time text codes.</p>



<p>Passkeys never leave the device and so cannot be reused across websites, which makes them resistant to phishing and other common attacks.</p>

<p>DIF members showcased their vision at this year's European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC 2025), bringing together experts who are defining the future of human-centric digital identity. As AI capabilities accelerate, DIF members are tackling both the architectural foundations and philosophical implications of self-sovereign identity, and EIC provided an excellent forum to share how they are solving digital identity's most complex challenges.</p> The Philosophy Behind Standards: Values in Digital Identity <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-sabadello-353a0821/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Markus Sabadello</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/danube-tech/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Danube Tech</a> and DIF Steering Committee member, delivered a compelling talk examining the philosophical underpinnings of digital identity standards. His presentation, "The Worldviews behind Digital Identity Standards," argued that technical choices in standards like OID4VC, DIDComm, SD-JWT-VC, and the W3C verifiable credential data model reflect deeper philosophical trajectories variously aligned with European values like Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.</p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/world-views-behind-digital-eic25?ref=blog.identity.foundation"></a>Markus Sabadello presents "The Worldviews behind Digital Identity Standards"<p>Sabadello illustrated how technologies like <a href="https://book.didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm</a> prioritize fraternity through peer-to-peer connections, while JSON-LD enables innovation and liberty through permissionless semantic flexibility and self-publishing. As the industry standardizes wallets and verifiable credentials, he emphasized that these standards should be evaluated not only on technical merits but also on how they impact human values like sovereignty and equitable participation.</p><p>The talk concluded with an important reminder that technology is never value-neutral, highlighting the need to align digital identity standards with humanistic values while avoiding the pitfalls of fragmentation from competing, politically and commercially driven standards.</p> AI and Identity: A New Frontier <p>Another highlight of the conference was the Verifiable AI talk and panel series. In his talk "Private Personal AI and Verified Identity for AI Agents", <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alastairijohnson/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Alastair Johnson</a> (CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nuggets?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Nuggets</a>) explored the challenges of implementing truly private personal AI that protects user sovereignty while creating verifiable identities for AI agents.

<p>ISL began its life as the Me2B Alliance, striving to create standards to enable greater power symmetry in the digitally facilitated relationship between consumers (“Me-s”) and the companies whose technology they use (“B-s”). We called this the M2B relationship. For mobile apps, all too often it’s a case of “Me2 Who Knows?!” People have a right to know who’s legally responsible for the apps they use, and it is anything but clear in mobile app stores today. App stores are failing to make clear the legal entity who is responsible for apps. ISL has filed responsible disclosures with Apple starting in late 2024 but our repeated attempts have been dismissed. </p>
 Anatomy of Responsible Party Info in the App Stores 
<p>Both Google and Apple allow for two kinds of developer accounts: individual and organization. The creation of either type of account requires identity validation, but it’s a lower bar for individuals than for organizations. Individuals must provide a government issued ID credential before being allowed to open a developer account. This validates the individual’s name and address. Organizations, however, must provide a DUNS number to validate the legal existence of the organization. <a>1</a><a>2</a></p>
<p>▶ Problem 1: How effective is this level of identification authentication? ISL recently found an app developer with 15 apps in the Google Play store with no verifiable legal existence whatsoever. Thus, the process is imperfect at best.</p>
<p>In both stores, the “Account Holder” (to use Apple’s language) is the individual/entity who is in a legal relationship with the app store [owner]. </p>
<p>Figures 1a and 1b show two parts of an Apple App store listing. Note that the name in blue under the app name appears to be the Account Holder (Figure 1a). Note that the Information section of the app listing shows five other places where we expect to see the same Account Holder name and websites.</p>
 <p>Figure 1a: Apple App Store Example – App Header</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 1b: Apple App Store Example – App Information</p> 
<p><br>
Figures 2a and 2b show a similar annotated view of the Google Play Store app listing. Between Figures 2a and 2b, there are six instances where the Account Holder name appears.</p>
 <p>Figure 2a: Google Play Store Example – Part 1</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 2b: Google Play Store Example – Part 2</p> 
<p><br>
This all seems fine. What we see in practice, though, is that the various links and names presented in the app store listing that should be definitively showing the name of the legally party responsible for the app often have inconsistencies. Which brings us to additional problems.</p>
<p>▶ Problem 2: Account Holders can create additional user accounts within their account, including users with permissions to submit/delete apps.<a>3</a> There’s seemingly no governance over this capability, left strictly in the hands of the Account Holder.</p>
<p>▶ Problem 3: The app store app listing doesn’t indicate if the developer of the app is an individual or a company. This information matters. People deserve to know if they’re using an app developed by an individual developer, or by a company. No matter what, so long as apps are collecting personal information, people have an unconditioned right to know who gets their data and what they’re doing with it.</p>
<p>▶ Problem 4: The Apple app store doesn’t disclose the location of the responsible app developer but the Google Play store does.<a>4</a> The great thing about app ecosystems is that they foster worldwide participants. The problem is that the responsible developer can be oceans away from consumers, making it difficult or impossible to hold the developer accountable if there are issues.</p>
<p>▶ Problem 5: Apps have broken developer links. It’s wildly confusing when the name in blue or green font under the app name is different from the name that appears when you click on the developer link. Imagine if you went to a grocery store and there was a loaf of bread with no brand or company information. You wouldn’t want to eat that. When you click on the Developer Website link for the app shown in Figure 1b you find yourself not only not at a site that says Kepler47, you find a non-functional page for audiojoy.com (Figure 3).</p>
 <p>Figure 3 Developer website URL for 12 Step AA NA Daily Meditation from the Apple App Store: <a href="https://audiojoy.com/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi">https://audiojoy.com/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi</a></p> 
<p><br>
▶ Problem 6: The Account Holder name from the listing header doesn’t match the name in the privacy policy OR in the App Support link. Figures 4a and 4b illustrate a case where the listed developer in the listing header is Will Aitchison (Figure 4a), but the privacy policy fails to indicate a legally responsible data controller entirely (Figure 4b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 4a: Account Holder name</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 4b: Privacy policy link for app by Will Aitchison: <a href="https://www.firststeporegon.org/docs/PrivacyPolicy_25-05-2018.pdf">https://www.firststeporegon.org/docs/PrivacyPolicy_25-05-2018.pdf</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 4c: Privacy Policy from “Developer’s Website”</p> 
<p>Note that there’s another layer of confusion for the First Step Oregon app, namely, the privacy policy found on the App Support page differs from the privacy policy linked in the app store (Figure 4c). This case is a case where the app developer was likely an individual affiliated with the organization who wrote and submitted the app on behalf of the company. Still, it leaves a question for users: who is responsible? Who does the user contact in the case of issues?</p>
<p>The Boggle: Arcade Edition app in the Apple store shows a similar situation. The Account Holder appears to be Zynga Inc. from the app store listing header (Figure 5a). But when you click on the  App Support link you see the Take-Two Terms of Service (Figure 5.b). Similarly, the linked privacy policy is also Take-Two’s. Finally, this app includes a copyright showing Zynga Inc. in the information section (Figure 5c). In this instance, the original Account Holder (Zynga Inc.) was acquired by another company (Take-Two). Zynga appears to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two based on its California business registration status, but the “hybrid” information in the app store is confusing.<br>
</p>
 <p>Figure 5a: Boggle App store listing header – Account Holder: Zynga Inc.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 5b: Boggle App Support Link</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 5c: Boggle App store listing – Information Section</p> 
<p>Interestingly, not all Zynga games in the app store show Take-Two info at the App Support link. Figure 6b shows the App Support link for FreeCell, another Zynga game.  </p>
 <p>Figure 6a: FreeCell App store listing header</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 6b: FreeCell App Support link</p> 
<p><br>
▶ Problem 7: App Information shows two different names. Figures 7a and 7b show elements of the Apple app store listing for the app, Count Money and Coins – Photo Touch Game. In the Information section of the app store listing, Innovative Investments Limited is shown as the Seller, but Grasshopper Apps is the copyright registrant.</p>
 <p>Figure 7a: Count Money and Coins App store listing header</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 7b: Count Money and Coins app – Information section</p> 
<p><br>
▶ Problem 8: App store listings with broken privacy policy links. It’s relatively easy to find apps in the app stores whose privacy links are simply broken, non-functional. This is what we found with most of the Innovative Investments Limited apps (Figure 7c).</p>
 <p>Figure 7c: <a href="http://www.grasshopperapps.com/privacy-policy">http://www.grasshopperapps.com/privacy-policy</a></p> 
 Conclusions  
<p>NONE of this should be happening today. App stores receive 30% of all app revenues and thus have ample resources to programmatically monitor these situations. Consumers should never have to conduct forensic research in order to figure out who they’re entering into a business relationship with. Here’s a recap of what the app store owners should do:</p>
 
 Make it crystal clear on your label who the legal entity responsible for the app is (I’ll call this “responsible developer”). 
 Make sure ALL instances in and related to the app store listing consistently show the same responsible developer name. 
 Make sure there is valid, working contact information for the responsible developer.  
 Indicate if the developer is an individual or an organization. <br>
 a. Ideally, we’d like to know the organization type, as this effects their legal obligations. For instance, for-profit vs. non-profit vs. government entities.<br>
 b. It’s also important to indicate coarse location information of the developer—i.e. city, state and country. 
 Make sure privacy policy links are functional all the time. 
 
<p>Here are Recommendations for app consumers:</p>
 
 If there isn’t a privacy policy, don’t install the app.  
 If there are no privacy details provided in the Apple store, don’t install the app.  
 If there’s no developer contact information provided, don’t install the app.

 Final Thoughts 
<p>We are well past the point of understanding the risks of these things, yet we see no systemic changes under development on the part of Apple and Google to put safety measures in place. Perhaps shining this light on some of the issues can help spur action. </p>

 Summary of roles and permissions for Apple developer accounts: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/account/access/roles/">https://developer.apple.com/help/account/access/roles/</a> 
 Location of the developer was met with some warranted and some dubious pushback from Android developers as shown on this Reddit thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/17w3pgz/google_started_displaying_full_legal_name_and/?rdt=50889">https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/17w3pgz/google_started_displaying_full_legal_name_and/?rdt=50889</a> . Mandatory disclosure of an individual developer’s location presents some risks. That said, the developer is capable of getting every user’s location information so it seems a reasonable requirement.

<blockquote>A decentralized repository for secure, scalable genomic data sharing &amp; AI-driven personalized healthcare insights — powered by OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph&nbsp;(DKG).</blockquote> OriginTrail powers the future of ethical AI in healthcare with&nbsp;ELSA <p>We’re excited to announce that <a href="https://origintrail.io">OriginTrail</a> is joining forces with the <a href="https://elsa-ai.eu">ELSA</a> (European Lighthouse on Secure and Safe AI) initiative to shape the future of decentralized, privacy-preserving artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. Digital healthcare today faces three pressing challenges: safeguarding patient privacy, bridging fragmented data silos for seamless interoperability, and meeting strict regulatory requirements without stifling innovation.</p><p>At the heart of this collaboration lies a DeReGenAI — a decentralized repository for secure, scalable genomic data sharing and AI-driven personalized healthcare, powered by the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). This initiative tackles the most pressing challenges in digital health: enabling secure, compliant, and user-sovereign sharing of sensitive genomic data while unlocking the full potential of AI-driven personalized healthcare.</p> Trustworthy AI needs trustworthy infrastructure <p>AI is transforming healthcare — but for it to do so responsibly, it must be built on a foundation of trust, transparency, and ethics. That’s exactly what OriginTrail brings to the table within the ELSA consortium: an open-source, decentralized infrastructure that ensures data privacy, ownership, and interoperability at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>By integrating OriginTrail DKG, DeReGenAI becomes a decentralized repository that puts patients in control of their most personal asset — their genomic data. This&nbsp;enables:</p>  User-managed permissions: Patients decide who can access their data, when, and for what&nbsp;purpose.  Privacy-preserving monetization: Individuals can opt to share their data with research institutions or health providers on their own&nbsp;terms.  AI-ready interoperability: Seamless interaction with AI systems while maintaining the integrity and provenance of the&nbsp;data.  <p>At its core, the OriginTrail DKG act as a knowledge graph of knowledge graphs — a globally distributed network where each participant maintains control over their own knowledge node. These nodes interact in a fully decentralized manner, eliminating the risks of centralized data silos and single points of&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Here’s why this&nbsp;matters:</p>  Global scale: Access data from diverse sources without compromising security.  Privacy-first architecture: Data sovereignty is seamlessly integrated into the infrastructure.  Compliance-ready: Designed with GDPR and other regulatory frameworks in&nbsp;mind.  Interoperable: Built for seamless integration with AI technologies and healthcare systems.   How does DeReGenAI work? <p>To power the next generation of personalized healthcare, DeReGenAI employs decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG) — an evolution of how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with external&nbsp;data.</p><p>Instead of querying a centralized source, the LLMs in DeReGenAI leverage the OriginTrail DKG to retrieve verified, decentralized knowledge. This&nbsp;unlocks:</p>  More accurate AI insights,  Context-aware healthcare recommendations,  Trustworthy and verifiable AI behavior.  <p>The ELSA initiative brings together top-tier European academic, industrial, and technology partners, such as University of Oxford, The Alan Turing Institute, NVIDIA, and others, to build a future where AI is both effective and ethical. As part of the ELSA initiative, OriginTrail is used to build a trusted data ecosystem for the AI age — one where people, not platforms, control their data, and where innovation never comes at the cost of&nbsp;ethics.</p><p>We’re proud to be driving this change, and even prouder to be doing it alongside an incredible group of partners.</p><p>Learn how OriginTrail is powering the shift to human-centric AI at <a href="https://origintrail.io/">https://origintrail.io/</a>.</p><p>Trust the&nbsp;source.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-powers-the-future-of-ethical-ai-in-healthcare-with-elsa-d59b628438be">OriginTrail powers the future of ethical AI in healthcare with ELSA</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Current Landscape 



<p>The public safety sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation, embracing new technologies to enhance emergency response, law enforcement, and disaster management. However, this shift also brings challenges such as data security risks, privacy concerns, and the need for reliable information verification in critical situations.</p>



<p>When DIACC was established in 2012, its goal of creating a secure digital ecosystem extended to all sectors, including public safety. As a trusted authority in digital identity and authentication, DIACC’s mission is more crucial than ever as public safety agencies increasingly rely on digital systems and data sharing to protect communities.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can strengthen its public safety infrastructure, improve emergency response times, and enhance collaboration between various agencies. Interoperable frameworks, such as the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF), ensure that public safety systems remain secure, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



 Advancing Digital Trust in Public Safety 



 1. Enhancing Emergency Response and Coordination 



<p>Implementing robust digital trust solutions can significantly improve emergency response by:</p>



 
 Enabling secure, real-time data sharing between agencies 



 Verifying the authenticity of emergency communications 



 Facilitating rapid and accurate identification of individuals in crises 
 



 2. Leveraging the DIACC PCTF for Public Safety 



<p>DIACC encourages public safety agencies to adopt the PCTF as a tool to:</p>



 
 Implement secure identity verification for first responders and emergency personnel 



 Enhance the integrity of emergency alert systems 



 Improve interagency collaboration through trusted data exchange 
 



 3. Addressing Privacy Concerns in Surveillance and Data Collection 



<p>To balance public safety needs with individual privacy rights, DIACCweDIACC recommendss:</p>



 
 Implementing transparent data collection and usage policies 



 Adopting privacy-preserving technologies in surveillance systems 



 Ensuring proper authentication and authorization for access to sensitive data 
 



 4. Combating Misinformation in Crisis Situations 



<p>Digital trust frameworks can help public safety agencies:</p>



 
 Verify the authenticity of information during emergencies 



 Establish trusted channels for disseminating critical updates 



 Collaborate with social media platforms to combat the spread of false information 
 



 5. Enhancing Cybersecurity in Critical Infrastructure 



<p>Public safety agencies can use digital trust solutions to:</p>



 
 Secure communication networks used in emergency response 



 Protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats 



 Implement robust identity and access management systems for sensitive facilities 
 



 Best Practices and the Way Forward 



 1. Adopt Emerging Technologies 



<p>Public safety agencies should leverage technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) to enhance their digital trust capabilities and improve emergency response. AI can be used for real-time data analysis and decision-making, while DLT can ensure the integrity and immutability of critical information.</p>



 2. Foster Cross-Sector Collaboration 



<p>DIACC encourages collaboration between public safety agencies, technology providers, and other stakeholders to develop standardized digital trust practices.</p>



 3. Educate and Train 



<p>DIACC is committed to educating public safety personnel and the public about digital trust through:</p>



 
 Specialized training programs for emergency responders 



 Public awareness campaigns on the importance of verified information during crises 



 Advocacy for regulations that support the implementation of digital trust solutions in public safety 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>The public safety sector urgently needs robust digital trust solutions to protect Canadians and Canadians and communities in an increasingly digital world. By adopting frameworks like the PCTF, public safety agencies can enhance their operational efficiency, build public trust, and improve their ability to respond to emergencies, providing a reassuring path forward.</p>



<p>Together, as public safety agency leaders, policymakers, and stakeholders in emergency management, we can create a public safety ecosystem that leverages digital trust to protect citizens, respects their privacy, and solidifies Canada’s position as a secure and effective leader in emergency management.</p>

 Overview 
<p>This briefing summarizes a presentation by Carly Huitema from Agri-food Data Canada (ADC) to the Trust over IP (ToIP) Ecosystem and Governance Working Group. The presentation focuses on ADC’s efforts to improve research data management in the agri-food sector, specifically through the development of the “Semantic Engine” suite of tools. A central theme is the importance of “FAIR” data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and how machine-readable data schemas, particularly using the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) standard, contribute to achieving this goal. The discussion also highlights the advantages of derived identifiers (digests) over assigned identifiers for reproducibility, authenticity, and decentralization, and ADC’s ongoing work to integrate their tools and schemas into existing research infrastructure.</p>
 Key Themes and Important Ideas 
 
 
 
 Improving Research Data Management in a Decentralized Ecosystem: The research data ecosystem is described as highly decentralized with independent research groups. While guided by best practices, mandates for standardized approaches are often slow to adopt. Incentives can be conflicting, particularly the “publish or perish” culture versus the time needed for thorough data documentation. Long-term planning (e.g., 50-year repository funding) is a crucial consideration. ADC, a project at the University of Guelph funded by multiple Canadian sources (CFREF, Genome Canada, UoG, OMAFA, Compute Ontario, etc.), aims to address these challenges by working directly with researchers. 
 Making Agri-food Data FAIR: A core objective of ADC is to make agri-food data FAIR:
 
 Findable: Ability to identify and locate data resources and their context. 
 Accessible: Ability to access (with permission) and use data once found, often requiring open protocols. 
 Interoperable: Using standards for data to ensure compatibility, including standard vocabularies. 
 Reusable: Data with sufficient context (licenses, provenance, descriptions) can be reused by others for replication or new research. Carly Huitema states: “Findable is the ability to identify and find resources as well as their context. If it’s accessible that once found you can access it with permission and use it interoperable. Certainly lots of our work at Trust Over IP is about how to ensure interoperability of standards including vocabularies and reusable that that there are licenses and provenance and other things that help make this data reusable.” 
 
 
 Data Requires Context: Data alone is insufficient; it needs context to be useful. This context includes details like sample source, analysis methods, data schemas, catalogue information, data licenses, data governance agreements, associated publications, methodologies, scripts, and contributors. 
 The Semantic Engine: ADC is developing the Semantic Engine, a suite of tools designed to help researchers create “rich contextual and machine-readable data schemas.”
 
 The Semantic Engine aims to make the process of documenting data less daunting for researchers. 
 It functions as a self-teaching web app, providing guidance and tutorials. 
 The engine uses the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) standard for writing schemas. 
 
 
 Data Schemas and Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA):
 
 A data schema describes the attributes of a dataset (e.g., columns in a table) and provides detailed information about them (type, units, description, format, etc.). 
 OCA is highlighted as an international and open standard for documenting schemas, developed by the Human Colossus Foundation. Two key advantages of OCA:
 
 Embeds Digests: OCA schemas can embed derived identifiers (digests/fingerprints) for the schema itself and for its constituent parts. This is crucial for reproducibility and authenticity of digital artifacts. 
 Organized by Features: OCA structures schemas by features (e.g., all descriptions, all units) rather than attribute by attribute (e.g., JSON-LD, XML Schema). This organization offers advantages:
 
 Task-based Governance: Allows for governance at the feature level (e.g., assigning responsibility for translation features). 
 Optimized for Feature Management: Facilitates adding or removing features (like languages or units) without altering the identifiers of other features. 
 Mix-and-Match: Enables easier combination and reuse of different schema components. 
 ADC has developed an “OCA Package” which wraps the core OCA standard with extensions for community-specific features and developing standards, allowing for gradual migration of these features to the core standard as they become accepted. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Assigned vs. Derived Identifiers:
 
 Assigned Identifiers (Names): Created by a governance body, linked to an object via a lookup table. Resolution requires trusting the authoritative governance body and their lookup table. “If you find an object, you cannot figure out the identifier – you must go to the authoritative body and look it up in their table.” Resolution services can only be hosted or delegated by the governance body. 
 Derived Identifiers (Digests/Fingerprints): Calculated directly from a digital object using a hashing function. They are unique fingerprints for a specific version of the object. Key for reproducibility and authenticity: “You can identify the resource originally used. You can verify the resource is the same one that was originally used.” Anyone can calculate a derived identifier, build a resolution service, and verify the resolution service is pointing to the correct object. Derived identifiers enable objects to be hosted in multiple locations. Carly Huitema humorously quotes, “If you liked it, then you should have put a digest on it.” Derived identifiers are excellent for snapshots but do not handle dynamic content or versioning directly. Versioning requires a governing authority or a decentralized identifier (DID) system where subsequent versions are linked and controlled. 
 
 
 Tools Provided by the Semantic Engine:
 
 Schema Authoring Web App: Guides researchers through creating machine-readable schemas. 
 Data Entry Excel Generator: Creates an Excel spreadsheet with headers and schema descriptions based on the authored schema, helping standardize data collection. Includes the schema’s derived identifier. 
 Data Entry on the Web / Data Verification Engine: A tool to verify data sets against the rules defined in a schema. Allows researchers to quickly check for inconsistencies before combining data from multiple sources. 
 
 
 Integration into Research Infrastructure: ADC is working to integrate their schemas and tools into existing Canadian and international research infrastructure.
 
 Schemas can be deposited into long-term research data repositories (e.g., Borealis in Canada), often receiving assigned identifiers like DOIs. 
 These schemas, with their embedded derived identifiers, can then be found through federated search engines that index multiple repositories (e.g., Lunaris in Canada, OpenAIRE in Europe).  
 This allows researchers to publish papers referencing schemas by their identifiers, enabling others to find and verify the schema used. 
 
 
 Addressing IP and Sensitive Data:
 
 The Semantic Engine itself does not store user data or schemas, reducing IP concerns related to the platform. 
 Schemas are generally less sensitive than the actual data, allowing them to be more openly shared. This enables discovery of datasets and potential collaborations without exposing proprietary information. 
 Schemas can include flags for sensitive data attributes (e.g., farm location). While ADC’s tools don’t currently enforce access controls based on these flags, this information in the machine-readable schema can be used by internal pipelines or other systems to manage sensitive data appropriately (e.g., triggering anonymization). 
 
 
 Future Directions: ADC plans to continue integrating with research infrastructure, add digests as identifiers to more objects, and develop tools for other machine-readable standards (e.g., cataloging metadata, policy rules). They also aim to increase the number of features supported in the schema description process (e.g., range rules, ontology framing). 
 
 
 
 Key Takeaways for ToIP 
 
 The FAIR data principles are highly relevant to decentralized ecosystems and align well with ToIP goals. 
 Derived identifiers (digests) offer significant advantages for reproducibility, authenticity, and decentralized resolution, making them a powerful tool for digital objects within a trust framework. 
 The architecture of data schemas (feature-by-feature vs. attribute-by-attribute) has implications for governance, versioning, and the application of derived identifiers to schema components. 
 Integrating decentralized identity and verifiable credentials concepts (like OCA) into existing research infrastructure can enhance discoverability, interoperability, and trust in scientific data. 
 The Semantic Engine provides a practical example of building user-friendly tools to generate machine-readable metadata, addressing the challenge of widespread adoption of such standards.

		<p>This document and podcast were generated by Google’s NotebookLM. They provide information about <a href="https://www.glia.net/richard-whitt">Richard Whitt</a>‘s vision for a more human-centric internet built on trust, as presented to the Ecosystem &amp; Governance Working Group (EGWG) of the Trust over IP Foundation on March 20, 2025. It also draws from materials related to the <a href="https://www.glia.net/">GLIA Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.glianetalliance.org/">GliaNet Alliance</a>, founded by Richard Whitt.</p>
<p>The current state of the web is characterized by surveillance capitalism, where companies prioritize data extraction and manipulation, leading to a lack of trust. Richard Whitt argues that this undermines human agency and necessitates a shift towards a web built on trustworthy intermediaries.</p>
<p>His proposed solution centers around the concept of Net Fiduciaries, a new category of entities that would prioritize users’ interests through the application of fiduciary duties like care and loyalty, similar to professionals in medicine and law. This would be a voluntary approach, driven by ethical considerations and good business practices, rather than imposed regulations on existing platforms.</p>
<p>The GliaNet Alliance is a coalition of companies and organizations committed to this vision. Its goal is to build a “web worthy of trust” by fostering ethical technology practices and using transformative governance principles. The alliance operates as a community of practice, with working groups focusing on areas like business models, policies, practices, and standards.</p>
<p>Key concepts discussed include:</p>
 
 The SEAMS cycle (Surveillance, Extraction, Analysis, Manipulation), which describes the problematic data practices prevalent on the web. 
 Glea, the ancient Greek word for glue, symbolizing trust as the social glue. 
 A multi-layered approach to change, encompassing governance, markets, technology (edge tech), and public policy. 
 The importance of authentic personal AI agents that operate on behalf of the user, contrasting with the “double agent” nature of current AI assistants that primarily serve platform interests. 
 The distinction between agenticity (capability) and agentiality (acting on behalf of) in AI systems. 
 The potential for interoperability between AI agents across different platforms. 
 
<p>The alliance is exploring ways to demonstrate trust to the public, potentially through analogies (like a “doctor for your web life”), marketing that emphasizes fiduciary duties, and clear communication about data handling practices. They are also considering mechanisms for recourse in case of breaches.</p>
<p>Richard Whitt’s book, “Reweaving the Web,” further elaborates on these ideas, outlining the problems with the current web and proposing practical steps to create a more user-centric digital future. The book has received positive testimonials from prominent figures in the tech and policy fields.</p>
<p>The GliaNet Alliance is in its early stages, focused on building its community, establishing governance structures, and exploring business models that align with its ethical principles. They are also engaging with policymakers and exploring potential collaborations, including with the Trust over IP Foundation. Consumer Reports is an anchor member and is exploring branding its AI agent as a GliaNet project. Kwaai.ai, an open-source LLM project, is also part of the alliance, aiming to build a platform with fiduciary duties to developers and agents.</p>

<p>At the 2025 RSAC Conference in San Francisco, our team met with dozens of industry experts, cybersecurity professionals, and investors to find out more about the biggest security technologies and trends that are impacting your business.&nbsp;</p>



 Tech-Specific Innovation 



<p>While AI was one of the hottest topics at the show, it wasn’t the&nbsp;only&nbsp;topic of discussion; we also heard a lot about the evolving ransomware ecosystem and what organizations need to be doing today to prepare for the arrival of “Q-Day”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But perhaps the second-biggest discussion piece was around identity and access security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the rise of AI-powered deepfakes and fraud attempts, we’re seeing more need than ever before for organizations to make the switch from passwords to more secure methods of authentication, such as Passkeys—and many experts were optimistic that this space will see a lot of adoption over the next year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key Insights:</p>



 
 Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance:&nbsp;“We’re going to see Passkey deployment continue to grow in regulated industries. That’s really important, because addressing the higher assurance use cases and taking passwords out of play there will give greater confidence for more and more companies to deploy Passkeys at scale, which will further accelerate our journey towards putting passwords fully in the rear-view mirror.”

<p>Microsoft has officially shifted to <a href="https://www.msspalert.com/news/world-password-day-puts-a-spotlight-on-passwords-passwordless">passkeys</a>, such as facial recognition, fingerprint scans, and PINs, as the default sign-in method for all new accounts beginning this month, marking its most significant step yet toward a password-free future, according to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-microsoft-passwordless-world-password-day/">TechRepublic</a>.</p>



<p>The move coincides with World Password Day and aligns with the tech giant’s broader commitment to the Passkey Pledge, an industry initiative to eliminate passwords in favor of more secure, phishing-resistant login methods. In a blog post, Microsoft executives Joy Chik and Vasu Jakkal emphasized that passkey users are three times more likely to log in successfully than those using passwords. Although existing account holders can still use passwords, Microsoft is nudging them toward using biometrics or PINs by default. Nearly all Windows users already rely on Windows Hello, and the shift is backed by support from industry partners, including Apple and Google, who are also rolling out FIDO-compliant passkey systems across their platforms. The change promises to streamline security and user experience across the board.</p>

<p>FIDO-Based Authentication to Replace SMS-Based Verification, Says UK NCSC</p>



<p>The U.K. government is set to replace SMS-based verification systems for digital services with passkeys this year in a bid to shore up cyber defenses.</p>



<p>The initiative will be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/government-adopt-passkey-technology-digital-services">rolled out</a>&nbsp;by the U.K. National Cybersecurity Center using the open authentication standard Fast IDentity Online, or FIDO, as a more “secure and cost-effective solution.”</p>



<p>“The NCSC considers passkey adoption as vital for transforming cyber resilience at a national scale,” the NCSC said. “In addition to enhanced security and cost savings, passkeys offer users a faster login experience, saving approximately one minute per login when compared to entering a username, password and SMS code,” the agency said.</p>

<p>The new working group emerges at a time of growing momentum for&nbsp;passwordless authentication&nbsp;in the payments sector. Last year,&nbsp;<a href="https://idtechwire.com/visa-brings-passkeys-to-online-payments-in-major-fido-victory/">Visa implemented passkeys for online payments</a>, allowing customers to authorize transactions using&nbsp;biometric authentication&nbsp;rather than traditional passwords.</p>

<p>Anyone setting up a new Microsoft account will soon find they’re encouraged to use a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/passwordless-authentication-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it-asap">passkey</a>&nbsp;during the sign-up process.</p>



<p>Microsoft introduced passkey support across most of its consumer apps last year, allowing users to sign into their accounts without the need for 2FA methods or remembering long passwords. A year later, it’s removing passwords as the default and encouraging all new signups to use passkeys.</p>



<p>PCMag attempted to sign up for a new Microsoft account on May 2, but it still asked for a password at the time of publication. Microsoft hasn’t shared an exact timeframe for when the change will take place, but you should expect it to happen in the coming days.</p>



<p>This is the first time a new account can be entirely passwordless. Previously, it had to have one alongside your passkey.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/05/01/pushing-passkeys-forward-microsofts-latest-updates-for-simpler-safer-sign-ins/">blog post</a>, Microsoft says 98% of passkey attempts to log in are successful, while passwords are only at 32%. Microsoft is also&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/new-user-experience-for-consumer-authentication/3822035">introducing</a>&nbsp;what it calls a “streamlined” sign-in experience for all accounts that “prioritizes passwordless methods for sign-in and sign-up.” It means some UX design changes to highlight passkey functionality.</p>

 Reviewing the landscape and sharing our&nbsp;approach <p>WAO is currently working on a project with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/responsible-innovation-centre">Responsible Innovation Centre for Public Media Futures</a> (RIC), hosted by the BBC. Our focus is on AI Literacy for 14–19 year olds and you can read more context in our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-does-ai-literacy-look-like-for-young-people-aged-14-19-8b4d798eb369">project kick-off blog&nbsp;post</a>.</p><p>One of the deliverables for this project is to review AI Literacy frameworks, with a view to either making a recommendation, or coming up with a new one. It’s not just a case of choosing one with a pretty&nbsp;diagram!</p><p>Frameworks are a way in which an individual or organisation can indicate what is worth paying attention to in a given situation. Just as the definition of ‘AI Literacy’ varies by context, the usefulness of a framework depends on the situation. In this post, we share the judgements we made using criteria we developed and share our process in case it is useful for your own&nbsp;work.</p> Narrowing down the&nbsp;list <p>While there can be some commonality and overlaps between frameworks for different contexts, the diversity of possible situations is huge. There can never be a single ‘perfect’ framework suitable for every situation. For example, just imagine what ‘AI Literacy’ might look like for (adult) engineers and developers compared with children of primary school age. As with <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/tag/web-literacy-map/">our work at Mozilla</a> you can define what a ‘map’ of new literacies might look like, but it can only ever be one of many that describe the overall ‘territory’.</p><p>With our work on this project, we had to bear in mind our audience (14–19 year olds) and the mission of the BBC. There is a long history of Critical Media Literacy which is particularly relevant to our research here, and which was one of the factors when reviewing frameworks.</p><p>With a relatively short project timeline of three months, we needed a way to quickly classify approximately forty frameworks and related documents we have collected. We shared relevant details with <a href="https://perplexity.ai">Perplexity AI</a> (using the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model) over multiple conversations. This helped us reduce our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQJ39Y1ic6DDDpyv9JzHGqQgdBnVeleCoXRXlI-J2uP8HO7YGy8SV9V5M7nDb9cYiAErK8jgx0DPneh/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true">initial list of around 40 frameworks</a> to a more manageable 25.</p> Coming up with&nbsp;criteria <p>Next, we came up with some criteria by which to judge them. These criteria were informed by our own work in the area for 15+ years, along with either interviews or surveys with over 35 experts in the field. While these criteria are meant as a heuristic for this project, they are also a useful starting point for asking questions about any project relating to new literacies.</p>  Definition of AI — ensures everyone has the same starting&nbsp;point  Development process — adds transparency and credibility  Target audience — helps match the framework to its&nbsp;users  Real-world relevance — shows how ideas work in&nbsp;practice  AI safety and ethics — addresses both risks and responsible use  Skills and competencies listed — clarifies what learners should be able to&nbsp;do  Reputable source — increases trust in the framework  <p>We included both safety and ethics because both are needed for using AI in a responsible and trustworthy way.</p> Categorising the most relevant frameworks <p>We used a traffic light (red/yellow/green) categorisation system to score each framework on the above criteria. Only one of the frameworks we reviewed, the <a href="https://oecd.ai/en/classification">OECD Framework for Classifying AI Systems</a>, meets all criteria with a ‘green’&nbsp;rating.</p><p>There are several other frameworks which we judge as meeting the criteria as ‘green’ except for one criterion (‘yellow’). Listed alphabetically by organisation, these&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://digitalpromise.org/initiative/artificial-intelligence-in-education/">Artificial Intelligence in Education</a> (Digital&nbsp;Promise)  <a href="https://www.educause.edu/content/2024/ai-literacy-in-teaching-and-learning/executive-summary">AI Literacy in Teaching and Learning: A Durable Framework for Higher Education</a> (EDUCAUSE)  <a href="https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/projects-and-activities/education-and-training/digital-transformation-education/digital-competence-framework-citizens-digcomp_en">Digital Competence Framework for Citizens</a> (European Commission)  <a href="https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org/policy-and-research/research-and-evidence/research-2024/ai-literacy">Developing AI Literacy With People Who Have Low Or No Digital Skills</a> (Good Things Foundation)  <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000391105">AI competency framework for students</a>&nbsp;(UNESCO)  <p>There are other frameworks which we have decided to include which included two or more criterion as ‘yellow’. For example, the Open University’s <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/learning-design/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OU-Critical-AI-Literacy-framework-2025-external-sharing.pdf">Critical AI Literacy Framework</a>, Ng, et al’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X21000357">article</a>, and Prof. Maha Bali’s <a href="https://blog.mahabali.me/educational-technology-2/what-i-mean-when-i-say-critical-ai-literacy/">blog post</a> linked from her <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/highereducation/2024/02/26/where-are-the-crescents-in-ai/">framework</a> all do a good job of defining Critical AI Literacies. We would also note that the <a href="https://www.digitaleducationcouncil.com/form/ai-literacy-framework">Digital Education Council</a>’s list of skills and competencies relating to AI Literacy is useful to pair with those from EDUCAUSE, UNESCO, and the European Commission.</p> Next steps <p>As mentioned earlier, our brief for this project involves either making an informed recommendation of a framework, or to come up with our own. We’re currently leaning toward the latter, but either choice will be the subject of a future blog&nbsp;post.</p><p>If you have questions, concerns, comments, or indeed a particularly useful resource which you think would be useful for this project, please do get in touch.

<p>After supporting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20690359/microsoft-windows-10-passwordless-password-option-update">passwordless Windows logins</a>&nbsp;for years and even allowing users to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675175/microsoft-account-passwordless-no-password-security-feature">delete passwords from their accounts</a>, Microsoft is making its biggest move yet toward a future with no passwords. Now it will ask people signing up for new accounts to only use more secure methods like passkeys, push notifications, and security keys instead, by default.</p>



<p>The new no-password initiative by Microsoft is accompanied by its recently launched,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636622/microsoft-account-sign-in-new-design-dark-mode">optimized sign-in window</a>&nbsp;design with reordered steps that flow better for a passwordless and passkey-first experience.</p>



<p>Although current accounts won’t have to shed their passwords, new ones will try and leave them behind by not prompting you to create a password at all:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of this simplified UX, we’re changing the default behavior for new accounts. Brand new Microsoft accounts will now be “passwordless by default.” New users will have several passwordless options for signing into their account and they’ll never need to enroll a password. Existing users can visit their account settings to delete their password.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With today’s changes, Microsoft is renaming “World Password Day” to “World Passkey Day” instead and pledges to continue its work implementing passkeys over the coming year. This time last year, the company implemented&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147124/microsoft-passkeys-support-consumer-msa">passkeys into consumer accounts</a>. Microsoft says it’s seeing “nearly a million passkeys registered every day,” and that passkey users have a 98 percent success rate of signing in versus 32 percent for password-based accounts.</p>

<p>As you’ll already know, today is&nbsp;<a href="https://betanews.com/2025/05/01/move-over-passwords-every-verification-method-has-its-day/">World Passkey Day</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>&nbsp;has released an independent study of over 1,300 consumers across the US, UK, China, South Korea, and Japan to understand how passkey usage and consumer attitudes towards authentication have evolved.</p>



<p>The results are encouraging, they find 74 percent of consumers are aware of passkeys and 69 percent have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts.</p>



<p>Among those who have used passkeys, 38 percent report enabling them whenever possible. More than half of consumers now believe passkeys are both more secure (53 percent) and more convenient (54 percent) than passwords.</p>



<p>This increase in passkey adoption is likely driven by the shortcomings of passwords. Last year, over 35 percent of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities. In addition, 47 percent of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account.</p>



<p>To further encourage organizations to embrace the shift to passkeys, the FIDO Alliance has also launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">Passkey Pledge</a>, a voluntary pledge for online service providers and authentication product and service vendors committed to embracing passkeys.</p>



<p>“The establishment and growth of World Passkey Day reflects the fact that organizations of all shapes and sizes are taking action upon the imperative to move away from relying on passwords and other legacy authentication methods that have led to decades of data breaches, account takeovers and user frustration, which imperil the very foundations of our connected society,” says Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance. “We’re thrilled by the fact that over 100 organizations around the world signed our Passkey Pledge, and we are pleased to support the market in their march towards passkeys through a variety of freely available assets, including our market-leading Passkey Central resource center.”</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wpd-report-2025-consumer-password-passkey-trends/">full report</a>&nbsp;is available from the FIDO Alliance site.</p>

<p>Microsoft is on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/04/05/microsoft-confirms-password-deletion-for-windows-users-what-you-do-now/">mission to delete passwords</a>&nbsp;for a billion users, given that “<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/12/12/convincing-a-billion-users-to-love-passkeys-ux-design-insights-from-microsoft-to-boost-adoption-and-security/">the password era is ending</a>.” The Windows-maker warns users that “bad actors know it, which is why they’re desperately accelerating password-related attacks while they still can.” And those attacks are now making headlines weekly.</p>



<p>The answer is passkeys, which link your account security to your physical device security, which means unless an attacker has access to your hardware and unlock method — biometric or PIN, they can’t bypass a password to login.</p>



<p>More than others, Microsoft is not just promoting passkeys but also password deletion: “If a user has both a passkey and a password, and both grant access to an account, the account is still at risk for phishing. Our ultimate goal is to remove passwords completely and have accounts that only support phishing-resistant credentials.”</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>, the organization charged with promoting passkeys has taken to the internet airwaves this time around to “launch a Passkey Pledge to further accelerate [the] global movement away from passwords.”</p>



<p>Its latest research found that “over 35% of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities, [and] 47% of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account. This is significant for passkey adoption, as 54% of people familiar with passkeys consider them to be more convenient than passwords, and 53% believe they offer greater security.”</p>



<p>FIDO has welcomed Microsoft’s password deletion as industry leading. “This is an exciting and seminal milestone as Microsoft is taking passwords out of play for over a billion user accounts,” its CEO Andrew Shikiar told me, “who can now instead leverage user-friendly, phishing-resistant passkeys. Microsoft’s leadership in doing so today will help encourage more service providers to do the same, which moves us collectively closer to the day when passwords are fully in our rear-view mirror.”</p>

 Moving past passwords is improving brand trust 



<p>The FIDO Alliance has also recently invited companies to participate in the World Passkey Pledge to create a more secure future, and move past the vulnerability and hassle of passwords.</p>



<p>Simon McNally, Cybersecurity Expert at Thales said, “Passwords have long been a weak link in digital security, forcing consumers and businesses into a frustrating cycle of password resets and potential breaches. We welcome the FIDO Alliance’s commitment to World Passkey Day and its push for a passwordless future. Passkeys provide a seamless and secure authentication experience, eliminating the risks and frustrations associated with traditional passwords.</p>



<p>Passkeys are automatically generated and securely stored, removing the burden of creating and managing complex passwords. They also enhance privacy by allowing authentication without sharing sensitive data, reducing the risk of breaches. As trust in digital security becomes more critical, businesses must prioritise passwordless solutions to protect users and build brand confidence.”</p>



 The Passkey Pledge for a Passwordless Future 



<p>To commemorate World Password Day (or at it will henceforth be known, World Passkey Day), the FIDO Alliance has released a<a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/fido-alliance-champions-widespread-passkey-adoption-and-a-passwordless-future-on-world-passkey-day-2025-302443727.html">&nbsp;survey</a>&nbsp;on the usage of passkeys which found that&nbsp;74% of consumers are aware of passkeys, meaning that consumers are aware of the potential value a passkey login experience can bring. To support this, the survey also found that&nbsp;69% of consumers have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts.</p>



<p>Furthermore, for those who have used passkeys,&nbsp;38% report enabling them whenever possible&nbsp;suggesting that some consumers already see the added user experience and security benefits passkeys bring. In fact,&nbsp;more than half of consumers believe passkeys are both more secure (53%) and more convenient (54%) than passwords. Many businesses and organizations have already signed the<a href="http://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">&nbsp;Passkey Pledge</a>, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and many more!</p>



 A pivotal moment 



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance, commented on both the recent survey, and the Passkey Pledge:</p>



<p>“This year’s World Passkey Day comes at a pivotal moment for user authentication around the world – with a rapidly growing number of service providers (including nearly half of the world’s top 100 websites) offering billions of user accounts the option to sign in with passkeys instead of passwords. Well&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">over 100 organizations</a>&nbsp;have taken the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-launches-the-passkey-pledge-to-further-accelerate-global-movement-away-from-passwords/">Passkey Pledge</a>, indicating their commitment towards a future free from the risk and burdens of passwords.</p>



<p>Consumers are not only increasingly aware of passkeys, they’re using them more frequently: 69% of respondents to our recent survey are enabling them on at least one account, and 38% are now enabling them whenever possible.</p>



<p>Passkeys are so intuitive to use that once users integrate passkeys, they rarely go back. This is good for consumers who are frustrated by password reliant sign-in processes — 35% of whom said they experienced account compromises as a result of password vulnerabilities last year — and e-commerce retailers alike.</p>



<p>This shift isn’t just about innovation or bottom lines; it’s about rebuilding digital trust and creating a safer, more efficient internet for everyone.”</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, May 2, 2025 – Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Assistant Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, Edge, Chair of Broadening the Reach Working Group for the Ecosystem for Research Networking (ERN), and ERN Steering Committee member, welcomed an esteemed group of scientific and cyberinfrastructure researchers as co-chair of this year’s ERN Summit.</p>
<p>The Ecosystem for Research Networking Summit provides the scientific and cyberinfrastructure research community an opportunity to come together and discuss ERN mission and accomplishments, hear from domain researchers and CI professionals at smaller institutions about the successes and challenges related to leveraging local, regional, and national resources for projects, and learn about funding resources and partnership opportunities, as well as regional and national communities.</p>
<p>The Summit was a virtual event held on April 23, 2025, and reflected a shared commitment to building bridges across scientific and cyberinfrastructure communities and exploring the timely topics of advanced technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum, and workforce development. Attendees heard from thought leaders who are driving AI and quantum initiatives, shaping curriculum innovation, and expanding opportunities across institutions of all sizes. Panel discussions examined the unique constraints and opportunities facing non-R1 institutions, along with the curricular innovations and partnerships shaping the future quantum workforce.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“The ERN Summit sparked dynamic conversations and showcased the perspectives of vital contributors to our national research ecosystem, including leading institutions, regional hubs, industry partners, and smaller colleges. We hope the Summit inspired new collaborations, actionable ideas, and lasting connections throughout the research and education community.”</p>

		<p>Keynote speaker, Dan Stanzione, Ph.D., Associate Vice President for Research, Executive Director, Texas Advanced Computer Center (TACC), led the topic, AI and HPC, or AI Ends HPC? where he discussed the evolving balance between AI and high-performance computing in future system designs. Dr. Stanzione argued that rather than replacing HPC, AI is transforming it, requiring the community to rethink architecture, software, workforce strategy, and environmental impact.</p>
<p>The Summit’s three panels provided insights from leading institutions, regional hubs, industry partners, and smaller institutions, including:</p>
 
 How regional economic and workforce initiatives are taking shape in AI and Quantum; 
 How industry-academic partnerships are preparing the next-generation quantum workforce, and; 
 What unique strengths and challenges are faced by non-R1 and smaller institutions in this landscape. 
 
<p>“It was wonderful seeing the strong attendance across all panels. The discussions addressed pressing issues relevant to research and education communities in universities and colleges nationwide and internationally as we collectively tackle the challenges of AI and emerging quantum technologies. We will continue these discussions over the next year, leading to solutions that will be reported on during our next summit,” Barr von Oehsen, Ph.D., Director Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and Chair of the ERN Steering Committee.</p>
<p>The Summit closed with rich dialogue on how the ERN can continue to build a thriving, inclusive community that supports institutions of all sizes and types. The energy and ideas shared set a clear path for future action! The ERN community is energized to keep the momentum going!

<p>In recognition of World Passkey Day (formerly World Password Day), the FIDO Alliance is putting the spotlight on real-world passkey deployments from leading organizations around the globe. Read on for highlights of the successes companies in various industries are seeing from delivering faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins with passkeys—showcasing the global commitment to move away from passwords.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance also released today an independent study of consumers to understand how passkey usage and consumer attitudes towards authentication have evolved. The research found that in the last year, over 35% of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities. In addition, 47% of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account. This is significant for passkey adoption, as 54% of people familiar with passkeys consider them to be more convenient than passwords, and 53% believe they offer greater security.&nbsp;The full report is available <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/World-Password-Day-2025-Final.pdf">here</a>.</p>



<p>ABANCA’s mobile app serves over 1,200,000 customers a month, serving as the bank’s largest branch. Today, more than 42% of its mobile customers are using passkeys via the bank’s ABANCA Key product. As a result, more than 11,000,000 high-risk transactions have been protected without technical or service incidents, and due to the prioritization of UX, they have managed a Customer Effort Score (CES) of 4.7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aflac was the first major insurance company to adopt passkeys in the U.S. Aflac partnered with Transmit Security to launch their passkey authentication initiative Today, only the first phase of the project is complete and yet more than 500,000 Aflac customers have enrolled a passkey, resulting in a 32% reduction in password recovery requests. This has yielded 30,000 fewer calls per month to the call center for identity issues. Aflac reports that the highest enrollment rates occur at the point of registration, reinforcing the FIDO Alliance’s Design Guidelines recommendation to prompt customers during account-related tasks. The steady, organic adoption of passkeys by Aflac customers continues to grow daily and directly contributes to measurable improvements in cost reduction and customer experience.</p>



<p>KDDI now has more than 13.6 million au ID customers that use FIDO and has seen a dramatic decrease (down nearly 35%) in calls to their customer support center as a result. KDDI manages FIDO adoption carefully for both subscribers and non-subscribers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LY Corporation property Yahoo! JAPAN ID now has 28 million active passkeys users. Approximately 50% of user authentication on smartphones now uses passkeys. LY Corporation said that passkeys have a higher success rate and are 2.6 times faster than SMS OTP.</p>



<p>Mercari has seen 9 million users enroll with passkeys, and is enforcing passkey login for users who have enrolled with synced passkeys. Notably, there have been zero phishing incidents at Mercari Shop and Mercoin (a Mercari subsidiary) since March 2023.</p>



<p>Microsoft began rolling out passkeys for Microsoft consumer account in 2024. They now see nearly one million passkeys registered every day. Microsoft has found that users signing in with passkeys are three times more successful at getting into their account than password users (about 98% versus 32%), passkey sign-ins are eight times faster than traditional password + MFA flows, and passwordless-preferred UX has reduced password use by over 20%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nikkei rolled out passkeys in February and is already seeing thousands of customers using passkeys. Additionally, they are seeing almost no inquiries about how to use passkeys at the support desk.</p>



<p>NTT DOCOMO has increased its passkey enrollments and now passkeys are used for more than 50% of authentication by d ACCOUNT users. NTT DOCOMO notably reports significant decreases in successful phishing attempts and there have been no unrecognized payments at the docomo Online Shop since September 2022 where NTT DOCOMO continuously improved UX, including increasing the number of other passkey-enabled services.</p>



<p>Samsung Electronics’ Galaxy smartphones support fast and convenient logins through biometric authentication and FIDO protocols. Due to ease of use, speed, compatibility across services, and status as an industry standard made passkeys a compelling choice for Samsung Electronics.</p>



<p>VicRoads is the vehicle registration and driver licensing authority in Victoria, Australia. It registers over six million vehicles annually and licenses more than five million drivers. Within the first weeks of deployment with its passkey vendor Corbado, passkey adoption significantly exceeded VicRoads’ expectations. Users embraced the phishing-resistant authentication method, benefiting from a frictionless login experience optimized for speed and security. The exceptionally high passkey activation rate – peaking at 80% on mobile devices and over 50% across all platforms – led to 30% passkey login rate within the first seven weeks. Uptake continues to rise steadily, translating into measurable operational benefits, including reduced authentication-related support tickets, lower SMS OTP costs and improved user experience and security.</p>



<p>Zoho Corporation has rolled out passkeys to its 100+ million zoho.com customers and has seen a resulting 30% increase month over month in passkey adoption and a 10% drop in password reset queries. As a next step, the company will begin its rollout to Zoho Vault customers in May.</p>

<p>New global survey: More than two thirds of users familiar with passkeys turn to them for simpler, safer sign-ins as password pain persists</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., May 1, 2025 – With digital security more critical than ever, the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> is commemorating World Passkey Day 2025 with the release of an independent study of consumers across the U.S., U.K., China, South Korea, and Japan to understand how passkey usage and consumer attitudes towards authentication have evolved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research found that in the last year, over 35% of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities. In addition, 47% of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account. This is significant for passkey adoption, as 54% of people familiar with passkeys consider them to be more convenient than passwords, and 53% believe they offer greater security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>World Passkey Day serves as the FIDO Alliance’s annual call to action for individuals and organizations to adopt passkey sign-ins, making the web safer and more accessible.</p>



<p>Highlights from the research show consumer passkey awareness is on the rise and outlines several key trends in adoption among those who are aware of passkeys, including:</p>



 
 74% of consumers are aware of passkeys. 



 69% of consumers have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts. 



 Among those who have used passkeys, 38% report enabling them whenever possible. 



 More than half of consumers believe passkeys are both more secure (53%) and more convenient (54%) than passwords.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>The survey report is available at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wpd-report-2025-consumer-password-passkey-trends/">https://fidoalliance.org/wpd-report-2025-consumer-password-passkey-trends/</a>, which includes additional insights on how passkey adoption is trending with consumers and organizations to improve global digital access, authentication, and security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The establishment and growth of World Passkey Day reflects the fact that organizations of all shapes and sizes are taking action upon the imperative to move away from relying on passwords and other legacy authentication methods that have led to decades of data breaches, account takeovers and user frustration, which imperil the very foundations of our connected society,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewshikiar/">Andrew Shikiar</a>, Executive Director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance. “We’re thrilled by the fact that over 100 organizations around the world signed our Passkey Pledge, and we are pleased to support the market in their march towards passkeys through a variety of freely available assets, including our market-leading Passkey Central resource center.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To further encourage organizations to embrace the shift away toward passkeys, the FIDO Alliance also launched the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge">Passkey Pledge</a>, a voluntary pledge for online service providers and authentication product and service vendors committed to embracing passkeys. The passkey pledge has received commitments from over 100 organizations in just over 20 days. A full list of companies that have taken the passkey pledge can be <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/#fill-out-the-form">found here</a>.</p>



<p>The availability of passkeys has steadily increased with implementation reaching 48% of the world’s top 100 websites as enterprises and service providers collectively seek to embrace a new era of faster sign-ins, higher success rates, fewer account takeovers, lower support costs, and reduced cart abandonment.</p>

 Notes to editors: 



 
 This SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted from April 13-14, 2025, among a global sample of 1,389 adults ages 18 and up. Respondents for this survey were selected from the nearly 3 million people who take surveys on the SurveyMonkey platform each day. Data for this survey has been weighted for age, race, sex, education, and geography to adequately reflect the demographic composition of the United States, United Kingdom, China, South Korea and Japan. The modeled error estimate for this survey is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. 



 To calculate the proportion of the world’s top websites and services that support passkeys, the FIDO Alliance combined publicly available information with its own data on passkey deployments.&nbsp; 
 



 About the FIDO Alliance 



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.

<p>Passkeys are no longer just a concept: The future of sign-in is here and consumers are ready. Built on the open authentication standards developed by theFIDO Alliance, passkeys are quickly gaining momentum among global service providers. Why? Because they offer africtionless, phishing-resistant, passwordless sign-in experience that is redefining digital security and user convenience. </p>



<p>Ahead of World Passkey Day 2025, the FIDO Alliance commissioned an independent survey of1,389 peopleacross theU.S., U.K., China, South Korea, and Japan to provide additional insights into how authentication preferences are evolving in real time. </p>



<p>The research shows people continue to struggle with traditional passwords: </p>



 
 36%of respondents said they’ve had at least one account compromised due to weak or stolen passwords.  



 48%admitted they’ve abandoned an online purchase simply because they forgot their password.

<p>April 29, 2025 – The FIDO Alliance has launched a Payments Working Group (PWG) to define and drive FIDO solutions for payment use cases. The PWG will also act as subject matter experts and internal advisors within the FIDO Alliance on issues affecting the use of FIDO solutions for payment use cases. The PWG is co-chaired by Henna Kapur of Visa and Jonathan Grossar of Mastercard, with other FIDO Alliance member company participants including American Express; Cartes Bancaires; Futurae; Infineon; OneSpan; PayPal; Royal Bank of Canada – Solution Acceleration &amp; Innovation; and Thales</p>



<p>The PWG will focus on three areas:</p>



 
 Identify and evaluate specific requirements for payment authentication. Requirements will include those in the area of UX, security and regulation unique to payments;. 



 Identify and evaluate existing and emerging solutions to address payment authentication requirements; and 



 Guidelines for use of passkeys and/or proposed FIDO solutions along with existing payment technologies such as EMV® 3-D Secure or EMV® EMVCo SRC. 
 



<p>The PWG will also work on associated projects relating to the use of FIDO solutions for payments including: collecting and publishing deployment case studies, documenting challenges and potential solutions to issues; and working with FIDO Alliance liaison partners to drive education and adoption.</p>



<p>Join the Payments Working Group</p>



<p>Organizations interested in taking part in the PWG and driving the adoption of passkeys for payments can inquire today. Participation in the PWG is open to all Board, Sponsor, and Government level members of the FIDO Alliance. Non-member organizations interested in participating should contact the FIDO Alliance to become a member; learn more by visiting <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/become-a-member/">https://fidoalliance.org/members/become-a-member/</a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Christopher Allen recently talked with Tereza Bízková in an interview that was published to the front page of Hackernoon. It was headlined <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-co-writer-of-tls-says-weve-lost-the-privacy-plot">“The Co-Writer of TLS Says We’ve Lost the Privacy Plot”</a>. In it, Christopher talks about what privacy means to him, what he thinks about recent privacy efforts, how centralization has become a problem, and how all of this connects to work done by the cypherpunks in the ’90s.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, Christopher answers the question: what would be non-negotiable for a new privacy-first system today? His answer unsurprisingly reflects our vision here at Blockchain Commons, built on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">data minimization</a>, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-progressive-trust/">progressive trust</a>, and limited scale.</p>

<p>Privacy is one of the fundamental <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian Principles</a>, but probably the one we talk about the least, as so much of our focus is on resilience (such as <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a>) or on independence and openness (as reflected in our attention to <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-interop/">interoperability</a>). Read <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-co-writer-of-tls-says-weve-lost-the-privacy-plot">“The Co-Writer of TLS Says We’ve Lost the Privacy Plot”</a> for much more on why privacy is important and what exactly it is!</p>

<p>Describe your service/platform/product and how it’s using FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>Microsoft Account (MSA) powers consumer-facing experiences across services like Xbox, Microsoft 365, Copilot, and more. In 2023, Microsoft began rolling out passkey support across these services, allowing users to sign in with a face, fingerprint, or device PIN instead of a password. By integrating FIDO credentials, we made it easier, faster, and significantly more secure for over a billion users accessing their Microsoft accounts, by removing the need for passwords.</p>



<p>What were the challenges you were trying to overcome?</p>



<p>We set out to solve three major challenges:</p>



<p>Security: Passwords are inherently insecure and highly vulnerable to phishing and brute force attacks. In 2024, we observed more than 7,000 password attacks per second.</p>



<p>User experience: Passwords are frustrating—users forget them, reuse them, or mistype them. We wanted a sign-in experience that users could succeed at the first time, every time.</p>



<p>Adoption at scale: We needed a solution that could work across devices and platforms while meeting high usability expectations for a global user base.</p>



<p>Why did you choose FIDO authentication over other options? What did you identify as advantages of implementing FIDO?</p>



<p>FIDO credentials offer the ideal combination of security, usability, and interoperability. They are resistant to phishing and credential theft, and they eliminate the need for shared secrets like passwords. FIDO credentials also enable seamless cross-device and cross-platform experiences—critical for consumer use cases. In testing, we found that passkeys delivered both improved security and a dramatically better user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Describe your roll out of FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>Microsoft took a phased approach. We started by enabling passkeys for MSA sign-ins across consumer services like Xbox and Copilot. From there, we made UX changes to prioritize passwordless options. New Microsoft Accounts are now passwordless by default, and existing users are guided to enroll a passkey during or after sign-in. Throughout this process, we have worked closely with platform partners like Apple and Google, and continued our long-standing collaboration with the FIDO Alliance to ensure our approach aligns with industry standards. For a more detailed look at our approach, refer to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/12/12/convincing-a-billion-users-to-love-passkeys-ux-design-insights-from-microsoft-to-boost-adoption-and-security/">Convincing a billion users to love passkeys: UX design insights from Microsoft to boost adoption and security</a>.</p>



<p>What data points can you share that show the impact FIDO authentication has had?</p>



<p>The impact has been significant:</p>



 
 We now see over one million passkeys registered every day. 



 Users signing in with passkeys are three times more successful (95% success rate vs. 30% for passwords). 



 Passkey sign-ins are eight times faster than traditional password + MFA flows. 



 Our passwordless-preferred UX has already reduced password use by over 20%. 
 



<p>These results confirm that FIDO authentication improves security, boosts user satisfaction, and reduces operational burdens like password resets and support calls.</p>

<p>Describe your service/platform/product and how it’s using FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>Nikkei Inc. and the Nikkei Group pursues its mission “to be the most trusted, independent provider of quality journalism to a global community, helping our customers make better decisions.” We offer various media services, including the Nikkei, which serves as the cornerstone of our role as a news organization. The integrated ID platform supporting the Nikkei Group’s digital services, including our core service, the Nikkei Online Edition, is “Nikkei ID.”</p>



<p><br>Nikkei ID, which offers a wide range of services, has long faced the challenge of balancing security and usability. While we have implemented measures such as improving the login experience with OpenID Connect and introducing two-factor authentication and CAPTCHA (*1) to reduce the risk of unauthorized access, addressing security risks associated with password leaks and reuse, as well as countering increasingly sophisticated attacks, has been difficult.</p>



<p>(*1)A security authentication method to verify that a user is human.</p>



<p>In this context, as FIDO authentication has evolved and the threshold for introducing passkeys to services has lowered, Nikkei ID has proceeded with consideration and implementation with high expectations. Currently, we are expanding functionality to support not only web services but also mobile apps, and aiming to promote the adoption of passkeys through increased user awareness via internal and external blog posts, presentations, and guidance at the Nikkei ID Lounge Help Center.<br><br>What were the challenges you were trying to overcome?</p>



<p>The primary goal is to balance security and user experience. Many Nikkei ID users are not accustomed to digital services, so simply enhancing security is not enough. For example, while the introduction of CAPTCHA can prevent brute-force password attacks, it can also become a barrier for users who cannot pass the Turing test (*2), leading to increased support inquiries and added burden on customer service.</p>



<p>(*2) A test to determine whether something is ‘human-like’.</p>



<p>However, FIDO authentication (passkeys) achieves high security and user experience through integration with OS and platforms as a standard. This allows us to replace security measures that reduce risks associated with password authentication but negatively impact UX with passkeys.<br><br>Why did you choose FIDO authentication over other options? What did you identify as advantages of implementing FIDO?</p>



<p>The following two options were considered as alternatives to FIDO authentication (passkeys):</p>



 
 Mandatory implementation of two-factor authentication such as TOTP or email verification 



 Social login using other ID platforms 
 



<p>As a result of comparing these options, we believe FIDO authentication (passkeys) offers the following advantages:</p>



 
 It allows for gradual transition by adding authentication on top of existing password authentication&nbsp; 



 It enables the use of higher UX authentication methods such as biometric authentication&nbsp; 



 It fundamentally resolves the risks associated with passwords 
 



<p>When it came to actual implementation, the aspect of “additional authentication” was particularly significant. In other words, it allows for implementation in a loosely coupled and highly cohesive manner without disrupting the existing ID model. The WebAuthn specification provides simple interface libraries and APIs for both backend and frontend on each platform, making secure implementation easy. Additionally, since existing authentication methods can be retained, the advantage of not significantly increasing support workload was also substantial.</p>



<p>Describe your roll out of FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>We implemented our own solution using the open-source backend library WebAuthn4J for FIDO authentication. We chose WebAuthn4J not only for its clear data model but also because it passed the FIDO2 Test Tools provided by the FIDO Alliance. For the frontend, we developed our own implementation that directly interacts with the WebAuthn API. Additionally, we created a test library to emulate FIDO authentication, enabling 24-hour automated testing as a comprehensive test of these implementations.</p>



<p>The rollout of FIDO authentication (passkeys) was carried out in the following steps:</p>



 
 Internal beta testing to gather feedback and monitor usage 



 White-box and black-box testing by external security companies 



 Public release to all users 
 



<p>What data points can you share that show the impact FIDO authentication has had?</p>



<p>Since it was just released in February this year, we cannot provide detailed numbers yet, but thousands of users are already using passkeys. Additionally, we have heard that there have been almost no inquiries about how to use passkeys at the support desk, and we recognize that passkeys are being used smoothly.</p>



<p>Resources</p>



<p>The test library that emulates FIDO authentication, mentioned in the implementation section, is publicly available as Nikkei’s open-source software. You can obtain it from the following <a href="https://github.com/Nikkei/nid-webauthn-emulator">https://github.com/Nikkei/nid-webauthn-emulator</a></p>



<p>For authorization after completing FIDO authentication (passkeys), we use Authlete, an OpenID Connect platform. In this case study, we express our enthusiasm for the introduction of FIDO authentication (passkeys). (At the time of this presentation in 2023, passkeys were still under consideration)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authlete.com/ja/resources/videos/20231212/02/">https://www.authlete.com/ja/resources/videos/20231212/02/</a></p>

 VicRoads achieves up to 80% industry-leading passkey activation rate for nearly 5 million users with Corbado 



<p>Background: VicRoads</p>



<p>VicRoads is the vehicle registration and driver licensing authority in Victoria, Australia. It registers over six million vehicles annually and licenses more than five million drivers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operating as a joint venture between the Victorian State Government, Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust, and Macquarie Asset Management, VicRoads is a critical provider of public services in the state.</p>



<p>Challenge: seamless and cost-effective authentication for government services&nbsp;</p>



<p>VicRoads aims to become Australia’s most trusted digital government service providers by delivering secure, frictionless services to millions of people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the importance of the data that VicRoads holds on behalf of its customers, security has always been a primary consideration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the past, to support protection of customer data, VicRoads mandated multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts via SMS one-time passwords (OTPs) and authenticator apps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys leverage biometrics, facial recognition, a PIN or a swipe pattern in the sign-in process. Unlike traditional MFA, passkeys require both the device storing the private key and local authentication, meaning they are both phishing-resistant and cost-effective.</p>



<p>Solution: Corbado provides a no-risk, passkey-first solution with minimal integration effort</p>



<p>&nbsp;VicRoads worked with passkey vendor Corbado, prioritizing a proven approach rather than building a solution from scratch.</p>



<p>Corbado’s deep understanding of both customer experience and the latest authentication technology gave VicRoads confidence that customers would find using passkeys easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corbado also provided in-depth technical guidance on passkey-specific challenges, including browser compatibility, recovery flows and user experience optimizations – further solidifying VicRoads’ confidence.</p>



 



<blockquote>
<p>“We selected Corbado because it could integrate passkey functionality into our existing infrastructure without disruption to our customers and operations”, said Crispin Blackall, Chief Technology Officer, VicRoads.</p>
</blockquote>



 



<p>Implementation: pre-built, passkey-optimized components &amp; SDKs enable quick integration</p>



<p>Corbado Connect seamlessly integrated with VicRoads’ existing infrastructure and CIAM, which is deeply embedded within the organization’s enterprise stack. This passkey enablement was achieved without requiring a migration of user data or authentication methods, ensuring a smooth and efficient transition for millions of users.</p>



<p>By layering passkey functionality on top of VicRoads’ current authentication system, Corbado enabled a frictionless deployment while preserving all existing user credentials. This approach eliminated the disruption and risks often associated with introducing new technology.</p>



<p>To ensure a smooth transition, VicRoads implemented passkeys in a phased rollout, beginning with personal customers. This gradual deployment, supported by Corbado Connect’s rollout controls, enabled VicRoads to monitor performance, address potential issues and optimize the user experience before seamlessly extending passkey authentication to partner and business customers.</p>



<p>Results: customers love passkeys, with up to 80% passkey activation rate in the first weeks</p>



<p>Within the first weeks of deployment, passkey adoption significantly exceeded VicRoads’ expectations. Users embraced the phishing-resistant authentication method, benefiting from a frictionless login experience optimized for speed and security.</p>



<p>The exceptionally high passkey activation rate – peaking at 80% on mobile devices and over 50% across all platforms – led to 30% passkey login rate within the first seven weeks. Uptake continues to rise steadily, translating into measurable operational benefits, including:</p>



 
 Reduced authentication-related support tickets 



 Lower SMS OTP costs 



 Improved user experience and security. 
 



<p>So far, VicRoads has successfully rolled out passkeys on its web portal. The next step is to integrate passkeys into its native apps – myVicRoads and myLearners – allowing users to leverage their existing passkeys without additional setup. Ultimately, once passkeys are fully implemented across all digital platforms, VicRoads aims to eliminate passwords entirely, maximizing security and fully embracing a passwordless future.</p>



 



<blockquote>
<p>“Passkeys are easy to use, without compromising on security. We’re excited to give our customers a simpler, more secure way to handle their registration and licensing services,” said Crispin Blackall, Chief Technology Officer, VicRoads.</p>
</blockquote>



 



<p>Opportunity: setting a new standard for government authentication&nbsp;</p>



<p>With one of the largest public sector passkey deployments globally, VicRoads has established itself as a digital leader in authentication modernization for government applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Achieving high adoption rates without disruption, VicRoads has proven that large-scale organisations can enhance security and improve user experience simultaneously. This success positions VicRoads as a benchmark for other government agencies looking to modernize their authentication strategies.</p>



 



<blockquote>
<p>“Passkeys represent a paradigm shift in how we authenticate users to digital identity services,” said Andrew Shikiar, Chief Executive Officer of the FIDO Alliance. “VicRoads’ adoption of passkeys showcases how government agencies can leverage this industry-wide innovation to protect people’s data while simplifying access to critical services. This is a significant step towards a more secure and efficient digital future for Victoria and beyond.”</p>
</blockquote>



 



<p>Next Steps: developing next generation authentication</p>



<p>VicRoads’ ongoing partnership with Corbado ensures it remains at the forefront of authentication innovation while maintaining a seamless user experience for its expanding digital service base. A key advantage of Corbado’s managed passkey service is its built-in adoption-enhancing optimisations, ensuring continuous improvements and seamless WebAuthn conformity with all future WebAuthn updates.</p>



<p>With this initiative, VicRoads has paved the way for broader adoption of passkeys in the government and public sector, proving that secure, frictionless authentication at scale is achievable.</p>

<p>Describe your service/platform/product and how it’s using FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>Our mobile banking app is our bank’s largest branch, serving over 1,200,000 customers each month. These customers require the best protection against identity theft attacks, and we provide the most robust and innovative solutions, always prioritizing the best user experience. ABANCA Key is a new identity verification service based on FIDO standards. It was launched after years of research by leading players to prevent identity theft attacks. Using passkeys, ABANCA Key provides the highest level of protection. It is impossible to guess or reuse them, so they protect our customers’ private information from attackers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What were the challenges you were trying to overcome?</p>



<p>On one hand, there’s the security challenge. The rise of phishing through calls and SMS messages in Spain has become a plague and a real problem for administrations, mobile operators, and financial institutions but on the other hand, there was the need to maintain the best user experience with the least friction. Passkeys give us a framework for interoperability and standardization, which provides us with ease of implementation and deployment. However, above all, and for the first time in the security industry, it provides a framework of homogeneity to achieve a frictionless user experience.</p>



<p>Why did you choose FIDO authentication over other options? What did you identify as advantages of implementing FIDO?</p>



<p>We chose FIDO for many reasons: for its future strategy, as it allows us to follow many ways, including MFA and passwordless, for trust, as the FIDO Alliance includes leading players in security, operating systems, infrastructure, and mobile ecosystem; and for the standardization and homogenization what it give us, which reduces implementation, deployment and roll out times.</p>



<p>Describe your roll out of FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>To deliver the best user experience, we’re committed to having the deepest possible understanding of the technology. This enables us to effectively identify and resolve issues, and to better understand user behavior. We became our own partner by developing our own platform based on the FIDO standard and certifying it as if it were a provider.</p>



<p>We rolled out the deployment in phases. In under five months, we had the development of both server and&nbsp; front-end (iOS and Android) ready, and we began the rollout in an initial phase with our employees, and subsequently to end customers in batches. In just seven months, we were already in a general roll out to all customers.</p>



<p>What data points can you share that show the impact FIDO authentication has had?</p>



 
 More than 42% of our customers are already using ABANCA Key 



 More than 11,000,000 high-risk transactions has been protected with ABANCA Key without technical or service incidents&nbsp; 



 Customer roll out ran without technical or service incidents, and most importantly, with our customer journey UX to sign in ABANCA Key and to use it, we’ve managed a Customer Effort Score (CES) of 4.7.&nbsp;

<p>To add to recent reports from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/ai-agent-attacks">Symantec</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://cofense.com/blog/microsoft-copilot-spoofing-a-new-phishing-vector">Cofense</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://labs.guard.io/vibescamming-from-prompt-to-phish-benchmarking-popular-ai-agents-resistance-to-the-dark-side-1ec2fbdf0a35">Guardio</a>&nbsp;also now warns that “with the rise of Generative AI, even total beginners can now launch sophisticated phishing scams — no coding skills needed. Just a few prompts and a few minutes.”</p>



<p>And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/16/cyber-signals-issue-9-ai-powered-deception-emerging-fraud-threats-and-countermeasures/">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;has just told users the same. “AI has started to lower the technical bar for fraud and cybercrime actors looking for their own productivity tools, making it easier and cheaper to generate believable content for cyberattacks at an increasingly rapid rate… AI-powered fraud attacks are happening globally.”</p>

 Ecosystem-Orchestrator für die Deutsche EUDI-Wallet 



<p>Die Einführung der EUDI-Wallet in Deutschland, basierend auf der novellierten eIDAS-Verordnung, stellt eine zentrale Herausforderung dar, um bis 2026 eine sichere, digitale Identitätslösung für Bürger bereitzustellen. Ziel ist es, ein umfassendes Ökosystem zu schaffen, das öffentliche Institutionen, privatwirtschaftliche Akteure und Regulierungsbehörden integriert. Dieses Ökosystem soll nicht nur technische Standards und Prozesse etablieren, sondern auch die Akzeptanz der Bürger fördern und die rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen gewährleisten.</p>



<p>Die Autoren dieses Whitepapers schlagen eine Public-Private-Partnerschaft in Form einer Genossenschaft als neutralen Ecosystem-Orchestrator vor. Diese Genossenschaft soll:</p>



 
 Demokratische Governance&nbsp;bieten, mit transparenter Kontrolle und Einflussmöglichkeiten für alle Mitglieder. 



 Kostendeckendes Finanzierungsmodell&nbsp;durch Mitgliedsbeiträge und Sonderzuwendungen implementieren. 



 Zentrale Aufgaben&nbsp;wie Zertifizierung von Wallets, Registrierung von Verifizierungsstellen und Förderung der Kommunikation zwischen Akteuren übernehmen. 
 



 Herausforderungen für die neue Bundesregierung 



<p>Die Bundesregierung ist durch die Verordnung [(EU) 2024/1183] dazu verpflichtet, bis Ende 2026 eine EUDI-Wallet für alle Bürger bereitzustellen, in der Ausweisdaten in elektronischer Form sicher gespeichert werden können. Die vollständige Umsetzung des EUDI-Wallet Ökosystem hat bis 2027 zu erfolgen. Das Bundesinnenministerium bereitet seit Mai 2023 die Konzeptionierung und Umsetzung der deutschen Wallet-Lösung federführend vor. Um die Akzeptanz bei den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern zu fördern, ist es nicht nur erforderlich, die technische Infrastruktur bereitzustellen, sondern auch ein umfassendes Ökosystem aufzubauen. In diesem Ökosystem interagieren privatwirtschaftliche Akzeptanzstellen, zertifizierte Vertrauensdienste, öffentliche Einrichtungen aus Bund und Ländern sowie Regulierungsbehörden und Zertifizierungsstellen miteinander. Der Aufbau eines solchen Ökosystems stellt eine hochkomplexe Aufgabe dar. Sie erfordert die Etablierung von Standards und Prozessen, die von allen beteiligten Privatunternehmen und öffentlichen Institutionen geteilt und umgesetzt werden können. Dabei steht die Berücksichtigung der Interessen der Bürgerinnen und Bürger im Vordergrund. Zudem müssen alle rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen eingehalten, die missbräuchliche Nutzung persönlicher Daten verhindert und ein attraktives Investitionsumfeld für die Unternehmen der Privatwirtschaft geschaffen werden.</p>



 Aufbau des EUDI-Wallet Ökosystems als Public-Private Partnership mit neutraler Governance 



<p>Die Autoren dieses Whitepapers plädieren für eine Public-Private-Partnerschaft als Ecosystem Orchestrator, die sich in einer Genossenschaft organisiert. Die Genossenschaft hat den Zweck, die Interessen aller Genossenschaftsmitglieder – also aller Akteure im EUDI-Wallet Ökosystem – gleichermaßen zu fördern. Die Genossenschaft benötigt eine demokratische Governance, die Einfluss, Kontrolle und Transparenz ggü. den Mitgliedern ermöglicht. Sofern die Genossenschaft selbst keine Investitionen tätigt, sollte ihre Satzung eine not-for-profit Klausel beinhalten, sodass lediglich die Kosten gedeckt werden müssen, die sich am Bedarf der Mitglieder orientieren.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Genossenschaft sollte durch die nachstehenden Organe gesteuert werden.</p>



 
 Generalversammlung: Bildet das höchste Entscheidungsgremium der Genossenschaft. Jedes Mitglied erhält ein Stimmrecht. Die Summe der Stimmen von Nicht-Europäischen bzw. investierenden Mitgliedern darf 25% nicht überschreiten. 



 Vorstand: Führt das Tagesgeschäft und übernimmt die Verantwortung für die Umsetzung der Governance und der Strategie. 



 Aufsichtsrat: Bildet das Kontrollorgan des Vorstands. 



 Ecosystem Coach: Stabstelle als Mediator zwischen den Akteuren zur Offenlegung und Management von Interessenskonflikten. 
 



<p>Öffentliche Institutionen sollten die Genossenschaft gründen, ein Regelwerk in Form einer Satzung definieren und den Beitritt von Akteuren der Privatwirtschaft ermöglichen. Es sind dabei sämtliche Akteure der Rollen aus der eIDAS-Novelle wie bspw. PID-Provider, Pub-EAA-Provider, (Qualified) Trust Service Provider, Wallet Provider und Trust List Provider einzubinden.</p>



<p>Finanzierungskonzept: DieFinanzierung der Betriebskosten erfolgt durch Mitgliedsbeiträge. Werden temporärMittel für bestimmte Zwecke benötigt, kann eine Finanzierung in Form von Sonderzuwendungen der Mitglieder erfolgen.</p>



<p>Aufgaben: Interessen der Mitglieder fördern, Kommunikation zwischen den Mitgliedern erleichtern, Wallets zertifizieren, Verifizierungsstellen registrieren, rechtliche Fragestellungen klären, öffentliche Kommunikation bündeln, Durchdringung der EUDI-Wallet messbar machen, Schnittstellen bereitstellen, etc.</p>



<p>Opt-Out: Die Mitgliedschaft kann ordentlich gekündigt werden. Erkenntnisse aus einer Risikoanalyse zu Opt-Out Szenarien sollten bei der Erstellung der Satzung berücksichtigt werden.</p>



 Fazit 



<p>Um das Ökosystem für die deutsche EUDI-Wallet aufzubauen ist ein neutraler Ecosystem-Orchestrator erforderlich, der gemeinsam mit öffentlichen und privatwirtschaftlichen Organisationen ein Ökosystem für die deutsche EUDI-Wallet aufbaut. Dies kann, wie vorliegend aufgezeigt, durch eine Genossenschaft abgebildet werden, in der alle Akteure des Ökosystems kartellrechtskonform und strukturiert kooperieren.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, a dedicated research team from IDunion has been working intensively on the Digital Product Passport (DPP). &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the last two years, our focus shifted from theory ( a joint publication with key partners [→ read the paper <a href="https://idunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2023-03-27_IDunion-AP-10.5_Whitepaper_V1.01_final.pdf">here</a>]) to hands-on implementation resulting in a Demo – &nbsp;DPP solution that is:</p>



 
 Data Carrier Agnostic: The product link can be embedded into any data carrier listet in <a href="https://standict.eu/landscape-analysis-report/landscape-digital-product-passport-standards">Landscape of Digital Product Passport Standards | StandICT.eu 2026</a>. 



 Product Agnostic: Our DPP works with any type of product, whether batch-based, lot-based or individual instances. 



 Automatic Identification of the Requester: The solution aligns with #eIDAS2.0 by supporting decentralized identification of individuals and organizations. 



 Technology Stack Independent: The DPP can be accessed without downloading a additional app and lowers the threshold for adoption and enhances usability. 



 Lightweight &amp; Semantically Rich: Information is delivered &nbsp;through Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and semantic data schemas, ensuring seamless interoperability. Additionally, we use W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to guarantee unique, globally resolvable product IDs. 



 Cryptographically Verifiable: All data within the DPP is cryptographically signed, enabling validation of authenticity and trust without central intermediaries. 



 Trust Infrastructure Support: Establishing trust over the data and integration with Digital Identity Trust Anchors is possible, ex by using the eIDAS 2.0 mechanism and the EU Trust infrastructure proposed for natural and legal entities. 
 



 Demonstration: Digital Product Passport System for Battery 



<p>Our final demo phase featured a live demonstration of a DPP tied to a battery cell used in an electric scooter.</p>



<p>The goal was to simulate how a real-world DPP can accompany a product through its entire lifecycle — from raw material extraction to end-of-life recycling.</p>



<p>We explored the perspectives and requirements of key stakeholders, including: Miners, Battery pack manufacturers, Economic operators, Consumer, Recyclers and Government and public interest organizations</p>



<p>Through interactive demonstrations, we answered key questions in real time, illustrating how a decentralized, interoperable, and trustworthy DPP can benefit every actor along the value chain.</p>

  <p>In early 2025, Blockchain Commons architected and engineered a major project for the Zcash blockchain: the ZeWIF specification that allows all of its wallets to interoperate.</p>

  <p>Interoperability is something that I consider vitally important for a technological ecosystem, so I was thrilled that Blockchain Commons could improve interoperability for Zcash. Here’s a bit more on why, what Blockchain Commons did for Zcash, and what I’d like to do for other technological communities.</p>
</blockquote>

 The Limits of Interop 

<p>Obviously, some level of interop is necessary for any ecosystem, or it just wouldn’t work. There was a white paper and there are BIPs for Bitcoin; without them, no one could agree on how the blockchain works. We similarly have specifications, RFCs, and standards for everything from email to graphics file formats.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are limits to interop. Standards tend to cover the things that are required for the broadest level of intercommunication within an ecosystem. But when companies begin to work on their own apps, their work often turns proprietary—sometimes aggressively so—and that limits a technological ecosystem’s ability to continue to grow.</p>

<p>As an example, email has standards such as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322">RFC 5322</a> for how mail servers communicate with each other. When mailers begin storing their mail, things become somewhat more balkanized: you might use a classic <code>mbox</code> format or a single-message <code>eml</code> format or a proprietary format such as Microsoft Outlook’s <code>msg</code>. Finally, there’s no consistency at all for how mailers might algorithmically filter messages: it’s hard to control whether a message ends up in the “Important”, “Everything Else”, or even “Spam” category of Gmail, even if a mailer adopts newer standards such as DKIM, DMARC, and SPF.</p>

<p>Yet, all of these types of interactions are important. If a mail ends up in a Spam folder, that’s almost as bad as it not being delivered at all; if mail can’t be restored from a proprietary mailbox, it’s lost as well. That’s why interop is important.</p>

 The Power of Interop 

<p>I developed four core architectural fundamentals for Blockchain Commons that I call the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian Principles</a>. Of them, Privacy is only peripherally related to the question of interoperability, but the other three highlight why interop is important for the health of any technological ecosystem.</p>

 
   Independence is a user-focused principle. It says that users should be free from external control. This is the heart of my ideas of <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a>, and it’s the heart of interoperability too. With the ability to export or exchange data in an interoperable way, users don’t get locked into a single platform. Instead, they can choose among a variety of options to find an application, service, or pricing structure that meets their precise needs. 
   Resilience is a data-focused principle. It says that data should be protected from loss. When data output and exchange formats are standardized for interoperability, they become widely used and widely understood. That ensures that they can be recovered far into the future. If you’ve ever tried to recover an old ClarisWorks or WordStar file, you’ve seen how much a non-interoperated file format can damage resilience. In comparison, <code>.rtf</code> files will never be lost and even <code>.docx</code> is pretty good—both because Microsoft Word has an enormous install base and because it’s an XML-based output format. 
   Openness is a creator-focused principle. It says that infrastructure should be open so that new creators can join the ecosystem. When communication is standardized, anyone can develop in accordance with the standards, including newcomers. But, this isn’t just beneficial to creators, it’s also beneficial to users. Without new entrants, an ecosystem can become staid and stagnant. With new entrants, an ecosystem is constantly innovating and expanding. It creates an atmosphere of coopetition: members of the ecosystem cooperate to interoperate, but then compete to offer the best products within those standards. 
 

<p>In other words, interoperability is beneficial for the vast majority of members of the ecosystem: users get more options, more innovations, and freedom of choice; creators get the ability to fairly participate and compete; and data gets strong protections far into the future.</p>

 What We Did for Zcash 

<p>I was thrilled when members of the Zcash community started talking with me about their needs, because it showed a strong, ecosystem-wide understanding of the need for inteoperability.</p>

<p>But there was also a strong inciting incident that led to the Zcash work: the older <a href="https://z.cash/support/zcashd-deprecation/">zcashd server was being deprecated</a> and so there was a need to migrate digital-asset data from its wallet to others. This also reflected a longer-term issue. Digital assets had sometimes been <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/shifting-from-zeclite-to-zashi/47756">lost during previous migrations</a> due to differences or even bugs in different wallets.</p>

<p>Obviously, a one-off migrator could have been created, likely linking zcashd with its replacement wallet, <a href="https://github.com/zcash/wallet">zallet</a>. But I approached things from an architectural point of view: I wanted to create an extensible Wallet Interchange Format (that’s the “eWIF” in “ZeWIF”) that would not just enable the zcashd migration, but also allow any migration from one wallet to another within the Zcash ecosystem. I wanted to take the immediate needs and political will and turn it into something that could benefit the community for years to come.</p>

<p>That was the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashCommunityGrants/zcashcommunitygrants/issues/3">ZeWIF proposal</a> that we put forth. It called for one month of studying Zcash wallet data as it currently exists, then another two months of developing the spec and writing libraries to convert among different wallets using that spec. (That timeline turned out to be a bit ambitious, but we’re closing out the initial design with a fourth month of work.)</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the above diagram shows, the <code>zewif</code> Rust crate lies at the center of the ZeWIF system. It creates in-memory representations of data from a variety of inputs and can output that abstracted data in a numbers of forms. Obviously, it can accept input from ZeWIF files and it can output to ZeWIF files. However, that’s just part of the process. Individual developers can also choose to use create front ends that import data from their wallets to <code>zewif</code> and back ends that export the data from <code>zewif</code> to their wallets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we release ZeWIF into the ecosystem, we should see advancements in accordance with the Gordian principles:</p>

 
   Independence. Users will be able to move their funds easily among Zcash wallets. 
   Resilience. Translation of keys and seeds should be more reliable, and if conversion is done using our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zmigrate/blob/master/docs/bestpractices.md">best practices</a>, there should be clear warnings if anything wansn’t converted. 
   Openness. New wallets can join the ecosystem. If they have innovative features, they can easily pick up new users if they support ZeWIF as an import format. 
 

<p>I’ve been thrilled to have strong support from wallet makers in the Zcash community. That type of buy-in is required to make interoperability work. <a href="https://zingolabs.org/">Zingo Labs</a>, the makers of the Zingo wallet, introduced us to the opportunity and have worked closely with us to fulfill our vision. Meanwhile, <a href="https://z.cash/ecosystem/electric-coin-company/">ECC</a> has been our next testbed, since they’re using ZeWIF to manage conversions between zcashd and zallet. Other principals have been involved as well, and just as importantly we didn’t receive any pushback from anyone who refused to use the format. (Not everyone has adopted it yet, but we’re just finalizing the complete ZeWIF draft at this point.)</p>

<p>We were fortunate, because that’s not always the case.</p>

 What We Did for Bitcoin 

<p>This isn’t Blockchain Commons’ first rodeo. Creating interoperability has been Blockchain Commons’ goal since the start, and we’ve done most of our interop work to date with Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Our two biggest successes for Bitcoin have been <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/animated-qrs/">Animated QRs</a> and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR</a>. Animated QRs are a standardized way to move large files across airgaps. That’s the exact sort of intercommunication that has always required interoperability. SSKR is a standardized way to shard a secret, currently focused on Shamir’s Secret Sharing. Because it isn’t just about intercommunication, getting a variety of companies to use it was a bigger victory, because it ensures those secrets will remain accessible and resilient into the far future. Both technologies are integrated with our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">Uniform Resources</a>, which have been implemented by <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/implementations/">more than a dozen companies</a>, offering true interoperability.</p>

<p>But these successes have unfortunately been piecemeal. There’s just one company that I’m aware of that’s adopted a pretty wide swath of Blockchain Commons’ Gordian specifications, and that’s our long-time sponsor, <a href="https://foundation.xyz/">Foundation</a>. We  most recently worked with them to support <a href="https://community.foundation.xyz/t/quantumlink/291">QuantumLink</a>, a Post-Quantum-Cryptopgraphy (PQC) method of Bluetooth communication that’s in their new <a href="https://foundation.xyz/buy-passport-prime/">Passport Prime device</a>, but they’ve also implemented URs, Animated QRs, SSKR, and other Blockchain Commons interop specs. As a result, they’ve got well-studied, mature specifications that they didn’t roll themselves and that should be resilient and reliable far into the future. I think that adding in a variety of linked interop specs like this has a multiplicative effect.</p>

<p>I’d love to see more of this in the Bitcoin community, but a lot of people are resistant.</p>

 Why People Fight Interoperability 

<p>The primary reason that we see people fight interoperability is market dominance. The Bitcoin ecosystem has grown large enough that some of the bigger players have stepped back from inteoperability</p>

<p>I was sad to see ColdCard go this way, after they themselves built on Trezor and other open-source libraries. At least they’ve remained source-verifiable (meaning you can view their code in their repo), at least until you get now to the proprietary chip, but they were once one of maybe three hardware wallets that were fully open-source,and so fully interoperable.</p>

<p>But I think the recent release of Ledger Recover was even more of a tragedy. Here they were offering a big innovation: a way to recover seeds by splitting them up and distributing them off device, similar to Blockchain Commons’ own <a href="https://z.cash/ecosystem/electric-coin-company/">Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR)</a>. But by keeping their protocol for distributing and recovering seed shares non-interoperable, they kept anyone else from offering seed vaults of their own, instead locking their users into their choices—which were very unpopular due to  privacy-busting requirements for KYC information.</p>

<p>The exact opposite approach is taken by another of Blockchain Commons’ long-time developer partners, Craig Raw of the <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow wallet</a>. He’s working hard to make Sparrow compatible with everything out there, but the difficulty he faces underlines the issues with the semi-interoperable state of most blockchains. He has to make <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR-like lists</a> of otherwise incompatible products and introduce secret sauce to interoperate with each of them. We’re very luck to have the Sparrow wallet working with all of these different devices, but it’s something that would never happen if there weren’t someone as dedicated as Craig working on the project.</p>

<p>For smaller companies, interoperability is a way in. Obviously, you should do it!</p>

<p>For bigger companies, interoperability means both trusting your engineers to provide the best experience and trusting your customers to recognize it. That’s a leap of faith, but one that I’d hope to see most companies make in our industry. After all the idea of personal control is likely one of the reasons that your customers are working with digital assets in the first place!</p>

 The Potential for Other Blockchains 

<p>I hope that our work with Zcash (and before that with Bitcoin) is just a first step. I’d like to take that experience to other blockchains and offer new interoperability to grow those ecosystems as well.</p>

<p>Even after the work we’ve already done, Bitcoin may still need this sort of work the most, because it’s gotten so big. How could we make migration between wallets easier? Or just the migration of seeds or keys? How could we more widely standardize the backup of seeds with a methodology like Ledger Recover or our own CSR? How could we inteoperate third-party services such as pricing and fee lookups? Every one of these elements of interoperability would improve the ecosystem, but they require a dedication to inteoperability itself.</p>

<p>The same is true for other ecosystems that have gotten large enough to see multiple companies working on projects. Big changes could be the incentive for this, such as Monero’s move to Seraphis. But even without big changes on the horizon, big ecosystems grow to the point where interoperability becomes a requirement: Ethereum has a huge infrastructure built around WalletConnect, but we’ve talked with people in the ecosystem who think there’s real room for improvement. I hope that many chains (and other ecosystems) beyond Monero and Ethereum will see the advantages of improving interoperability for all the reasons I’ve laid out here, particular independence for users, resilience for data, and openness for developers.</p>

<p>Are you a leader working in a digital-asset ecosystem? Would you like to work with me to take lessons learned from the Zcash project to create interoperable wallet formats, data-exchange formats, service formats, or something else? Drop me a line at <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">team@blockchaincommons.com</a>. I’d love to talk about how we can expand your ecosystem as well.</p>

		 Connecting with Graduate Students in the Digital Learning Era 
<p>The day’s events kicked off with the breakout session, Connecting with Graduate Students in the Digital Learning Era, presented by Georgian Court University’s Denise Furlong, Assistant Professor, and Janine Ataide, Educator and Graduate Student. As more graduate programs provide online options to meet the needs of working adults, universities must consider different ways to engage these students as valued members of the community even though they may never see the physical campus. Some students report that they feel a sense of belonging and strong collaboration within their program and others feel a sense of isolation in their learning experience. This session explored the different aspects of programs and courses that are important in engaging and empowering graduate students as truly part of the university community, as well as how course design, faculty collaboration, and peer connections can contribute to fostering a sense of belonging among online graduate students.</p>
 Navigating the Use of Generative AI in Online Classrooms 
<p>As generative AI tools become increasingly prevalent, educators face unique challenges and opportunities in the online classroom. Carol Smith-Cuevas, Associate Director, Learning Engagement &amp; Development, Kean University, discussed effective strategies for responding to students’ use of generative AI in Navigating the Use of Generative AI in Online Classrooms. Attendees explored this topic from a professor’s perspective and learned practical approaches to integrating AI tools into coursework, setting clear guidelines, and promoting ethical use. Smith-Cuevas also explained different ways to design assignments that encourage critical thinking and originality, how to utilize AI detection tools, and resources that can help students to understand the implications of AI-generated content. Attendees left equipped with actionable practices to create a fair, engaging, and academically rigorous online classroom.</p>
 Integrating Free AI Training and Micro-Credentials into Learning Environments 
<p>Professors John Shannon, Seton Hall University, and Susan O’Sullivan-Gavin, Rider University, led the session, Unlocking the Future of Learning: Integrating Free AI Training &amp; Micro-Credentials into Learning Environments, and explored how educators can seamlessly integrate free, high-quality AI training programs and micro-credentialing opportunities from platforms like MIT OpenCourseWare, Harvard Online, LinkedIn Learning, Google, and others into their courses. Attendees learned how to identify and incorporate free AI training and certification programs that align with course objectives, and strategies for scaffolding these resources into curriculum design to enhance student engagement and skill development. Shannon and O’Sullivan-Gavin also shared helpful methods for leveraging micro-credentials to increase student employability and lifelong learning pathways.</p>
 Demystifying AI Literacy 
<p>Attendees joined NJIT/NJII’s Learning &amp; Development Initiative to explore critical AI literacy standards for education and beyond. Led by Stefanie Toye, Project Manager, NJIT &amp; NJII, and Dr. Teresa Keeler, Project Manager at The Learning &amp; Development Initiative, NJIT, this presentation shared why these standards are essential, who needs them, and how to implement them effectively. They shared specific ideas about how these standards can be constructed and adopted, and why AI literacy is crucial for K-12 and higher ed educators and administrators.</p>
 Advancing Accessible Digital Education at Hudson County Community College 
<p>Callie Martin, Senior Instructional Designer, Hudson County Community College, and Joshua M. Gaul, Ed.D., Associate Vice President &amp; Chief Digital Learning Officer, Edge, led the presentation, Building an Inclusive Future: Advancing Accessible Digital Education at Hudson County Community College (HCCC). This breakout session highlighted HCCC’s collaborative efforts with Edge to build a more inclusive and accessible digital learning environment. Through this partnership, HCCC has embraced Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles to remove barriers and create equitable educational experiences for all students. The session showcased how the college, supported by Edge’s expertise and resources, has implemented student-centered strategies that prioritize accessibility, engagement, and success. Attendees will learn practical approaches to designing inclusive courses and hear firsthand how institutional collaboration can drive meaningful change in digital education.</p>

		 The Digital and Data-Driven Center for Teaching and Learning 
<p>The day continued with the second round of breakout sessions, including The Digital and Data-Driven Center for Teaching and Learning led by John Baldino, OFS, Director, Center for Teaching and Learning, Lackawanna College. He shared best practices for using communication technology, digital content and marketing platforms, artificial intelligence, and collected data to create a sustainable Center for Teaching and Learning model that can help empower CTLs to support faculty in their academic success.</p>
 Crafting Collaborative Conversations 
<p>Curiosity Catalysts: Crafting Collaborative Conversations, led by Adelphi University’s Karen Kolb, Director, Faculty Center for Professional Excellence, Jennifer Southard, Instructional Designer, and Marilena Orfanos, Instructional Designer, examined research-backed, low-effort strategies that enhance online discussions and collaboration without adding to instructor workload. Participants learned how to design thought-provoking prompts that ignite curiosity, integrate AI and digital tools to support interaction, and implement alternative discussion formats—such as multimedia responses and collaborative annotation—to foster deeper engagement. This session also covered effective ways to maintain instructor presence without micromanaging, and gave attendees ready-to-use techniques to create more engaging, inclusive, and meaningful online discussions.</p>
 Supporting Persistence in STEM Learners 
<p>Natalya Voloshchuk, Assistant Teaching Professor, and Karen Harris, Senior Instructional Designer and Assessment Specialist, from Rutgers University led the session A Learning Outcomes Strategy for Supporting Persistence in STEM Learners to demonstrate how assessment and feedback can aid in developing self-directed learners by examining an implementation of a deliberate data collection Rubric. They discussed how the Rubric is used to help students identify their strengths alongside the areas to work on toward improvement, while also offering the instructor valuable insights for supporting persistence in STEM courses. Harris and Voloshchuk shared some course-level learning data and reflected on how it might impact learning across a STEM curriculum. They also considered how incorporating learning outcomes in rubrics can help students make connections to work skills they are developing that will support them in internships and research settings.&nbsp;</p>
 The Implications of AI for Next-Generation Education 
<p>Steven D’Agustino, Senior Director for Online Programs, Fordham University, joined EdgeCon to explore the transformative impact of AI on education. He began by defining key AI terms such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Neural Networks, and discussed the growing use of AI tools like ChatGPT among students for academic tasks. The presentation highlighted the challenges and opportunities of integrating technology into education, categorizing adoption methods as intentional, accidental, or unilateral, and how the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated unilateral adoption due to necessity. D’Agustino raised concerns about AI’s potential to depersonalize learning, leading to cognitive de-skilling, and creating a sense of futility among students and educators. However, he also outlined four essential tasks for educators in the AI era: curating, contextualizing, creating, and collaborating. The presentation underscored the importance of equity in AI integration and how educators must focus on humanistic ends to ensure that AI is used deliberately and equitably to benefit all students.</p>
 A Blueprint for Excellence in Short Course Development and Design 
<p>In the session, Beyond the Badge: A Blueprint for Excellence in Short Course Development and Design, Molloy University’s Dr. Amy Gaimaro, Dean of Innovative Delivery Methods, and Susan Watters, Associate Director of Blended and Online Learning, examined the blueprint development of high-quality short courses while embedding quality course design badges. Participants learned how to identify quality criteria for designing courses, establish clear learning objectives and outcomes that align with industry standards and learner needs, and how to address regular and substantive interactions in online asynchronous short courses.</p>
<p>This session was ideal for instructional designers, online administrators, training managers, and educators who were looking to enhance the quality and impact of their short course offerings. Attendees gained strategies for incorporating quality assurance throughout the course development lifecycle, best practices for designing and implementing effective quality badge systems, and actionable steps to improve learner engagement and course effectiveness.</p>
 Visions for Online Learning: Evolving Strategies and Institutional Growth 
<p>As online learning continues to evolve, institutions must adapt their strategies to meet shifting student expectations, market demands, and technological advancements.&nbsp; EdgeCon panel discussion, Visions for Online Learning: Evolving Strategies &amp; Institutional Growth, brought together higher education leaders to explore innovative approaches to online learning that drive institutional growth and long-term success. Panelists, Michael Ciocco, Ph.D., Associate Vice President of Online Learning, Rowan University, John F. O’Callaghan, Jr., Vice President for Transformational Learning &amp; Chief Online Officer, Kean University, and Joshua M. Gaul, Ed.D., AVP &amp; Chief Digital Learning Officer, Edge, discussed emerging trends, the role of data and AI in shaping digital learning experiences, strategies for scaling programs sustainably, and the balance between quality, accessibility, and financial viability.

		 The Rise of Non-Degree Credentials 
<p>Afternoon sessions kicked off with The Rise of Non-Degree Credentials–The Future of Higher Education led Michael Edmondson, Associate Provost, NJIT. He shared how traditional higher education is struggling to keep pace with workforce demands and a growing number of companies now favor skills-based hiring over degree-based credentials, with 70% of job skills expected to change by 2030 due to AI and automation. Employers increasingly prefer hiring candidates with business-oriented or technical microcredentials that provide real-world experience and rapid upskilling. Attendees learned how microcredentials can offer a solution by closing the workforce gap, aligning learning with employer needs, and fostering lifelong learning. As businesses prioritize AI, data analytics, and soft skills, microcredentials are emerging as the future of education, providing professionals with the flexibility to adapt and thrive in an evolving job market.</p>
 The Growth of Online Education at Rowan University 
<p>Mike Sunderhauf, Director of Instructional Design, and William McCool, Online Course Operations Coordinator, from Rowan University led the breakout session, Shaping the Future: The Growth of Online Education at Rowan University, where they shared how Rowan University is undergoing a transformation in its approach to online education, shifting focus from traditional on-campus programs to scalable online offerings. The session explored how Rowan University is reshaping online education through a combination of strategic collaboration, program design, and faculty empowerment, ultimately fostering an engaging and dynamic learning environment for students and instructors alike. Sunderhauf and McCool shared how their learning strategy aligns with a flexible model, allowing instructors to follow a standardized framework while being empowered to update and adapt their courses to meet the needs and interests of each learner group. They showed how this balance between consistency and adaptability fosters both reliability and innovation in the learning process.</p>
 &nbsp;Integrating Virtual Reality into Higher Education 
<p>Joining EdgeCon from Seton Hall University, Renee Cicchino, Director of Instructional Design and Training, and Riad Twal, Senior Instructional Designer, gave a closer look into how the University has been experimenting with Virtual Reality since the release of the Google Cardboard Viewer in 2014. In 2024, they acquired a number of Meta Quest Pro devices, allowing for an entire class to participate in a virtual experience at the same time. During the 2024 Fall semester, Seton Hall launched a pilot program examining how they can best facilitate Virtual Reality experiences for graduate and undergraduate classes.&nbsp; These experiences are informing the development of a Virtual Reality Showcase to formally introduce this technology to their faculty, along with examples of how this technology can be incorporated into various course topics.</p>
<p>This session focused on the instructional designer’s perspective of evolving VR Technology, the introduction of the Quest for Business device management software, initial faculty and student experiences with the Meta Quest Pro devices, future plans for expanded access and utilization, and suggestions for implementation at other institutions.</p>

		 Using AI in the Math Classroom for English Language Learners 
<p>Grace E. Cook, Ph.D., Program Area Lead of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, Montclair State University, has seen an increase in the number of English Language Learners (ELL) in her classroom, particularly students whose primary language is Spanish. By incorporating the use of ChatGPT and Google Notebook into the daily functions of the class, she has been able to make mathematics more accessible. In this session, Cook shared her experiences with teaching in English and Spanish with the assistance of AI and discussed the pros and cons of their uses and what her ELL students list as the positives and negatives of each resource.</p>
 Podcasting to Create Interdepartmental Collaboration 
<p>In Podcasting to Create Interdepartmental Collaboration and Showcase Faculty Innovation, Seton Hall University presenters, Kate Sierra, Instructional Designer, Teaching, Learning, and Technology Center, and Ann Oro, Senior Instructional Designer, explored how the Teaching, Learning, and Technology Center (TLTC) at Seton Hall launched a podcast series called Innovate and Educate to explore the intersection of technology and teaching. They highlighted how topics such as technology integration, accessibility tools, and other innovations are transforming learning, improving student outcomes, and addressing classroom challenges.</p>
<p>Attendees gained insights into the process of developing and sustaining a podcast, including identifying relevant resources, building an audience, and maintaining engagement. They also learned how this initiative has strengthened institutional resiliency by fostering a culture of innovation and shared learning. Participants were encouraged to consider how podcasting could serve as a scalable, cost-effective strategy for their own institutions to spotlight success stories and support strategic goals.</p>
 Creating an Institutional Culture of Accessibility 
<p>Many institutions approach accessibility in silos and rely on specialized offices rather than embedding responsibility across the entire campus. In Creating an Institutional Culture of Accessibility, Laura M. Romeo, Ph.D., Director of Learning Innovation, Development, and Scholarship, Edge, shared strategies for shifting to an integrated, institution-wide approach. The discussion looked at governance structures, training models, and change management strategies that can empower all departments to play a role in accessibility. Attendees gained practical insights on overcoming implementation barriers, methods to measure cultural progress in institutional accessibility efforts, and how to foster a culture that moves beyond compliance to true inclusivity.</p>
 Celebrating Achievements and Contributions 
<p>At this spring event, Edge celebrated the exceptional work of higher education institutions across the region by presenting a series of awards to recognize their impressive impact and accomplishments.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>The Preserving Education Through Change Award was presented to Montclair State University (MSU) and accepted by the University’s President, Jonathan Koppell, to recognize the significant vision and leadership by one of New Jerseys signature public universities. As the educational community navigates unprecedented change, it is vital that institutions seek opportunities for collaboration and support. MSU has been a primary example of this kind of support and stewardship in recent years. As MSU itself continues to grow, the institution has also shown a capacity for significant leadership, leading a merger with the former Bloomfield College, now Bloomfield College of Montclair State University. By preserving continuity and quality of educational opportunities at an institution noted for serving first-generation students and those from diverse backgrounds, MSU has strengthened New Jersey’s educational system and the college experience for their students.</p>

Panel 4 on Law and Policy for the Attention Crisis, featuring Alex Roberts (moderator), Dick Daynard, Leah Plunkett, Woody Hartzog and Zephyr Teachout.<p>Last Friday, April 11, three of us, <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/bietti/">Elettra Bietti</a>, <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/aileen-nielsen/">Aileen Nielsen</a>, <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/laura-aade/">Laura Aade</a>, co-organized a workshop titled “The Battle for Our Attention: Empirical, Philosophical and Legal Questions” which took place at Northeastern University School of Law, and benefited from the support of CLIC, Northeastern’s <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/academics/centers/clic/">Center for Law, Information and Creativity</a>, and the involvement of Harvard’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center</a> community of fellows and faculty. The event brought together leading legal scholars, policymakers, economists, medical scientists, computer scientists, media scholars, and technologists to address the pressing issue of how today’s digital technologies are transforming the understanding, use, and allocation of human attention, including implications for how we spend our time and what information we&nbsp;consume.</p><p>The discussion was wide-ranging, interdisciplinary, and deeply enlightening. We discussed whether attention <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/nick-seaver">“actually exists”</a>, <a href="https://heartbrain.hms.harvard.edu/people/michael-esterman-phd">how it works</a>, the <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/yochai-benkler/">history</a> and <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/marshall-van-alstyne/">business models</a> of attention capture, the challenges and <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/david-lazer/">findings</a> that arise from <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/person/elena-glassman">empirical</a> <a href="https://cbw.sh/">studies</a> of attention and attention markets, the relation between attention, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/bridget-todd">intimacy</a>, <a href="https://www.umass.edu/communication/about/directory/emily-e-west">convenience</a> and<a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/rebecca-tushnet/"> the law of trademarks</a>, possible analogies with <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/daynard/">tobacco and gambling litigation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-law/faculty/directory/full-time/zephyr-teachout/">policymaking</a> associated with <a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/woodrow-hartzog/">regulating engagement</a> and <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/leah-a-plunkett/">children’s use of social&nbsp;media</a>.</p><p>The event began with a panel on the political economy of attention. <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/yochai-benkler/">Yochai Benkler</a> kicked off the discussion with an overview of the capitalist drive to capture and instrumentalize attention over time, beginning with the 19th century press and culminating in today’s digital technologies. He argued that markets won’t solve attention problems and could exacerbate attention harms, in contrast with <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/marshall-van-alstyne/">Marshall Van Alstyne</a>’s suggestion that a Coasean model of attention rights could help platform owners manage misinformation and reduce incentives to share inaccurate or false information. Where Benkler advocated for the decommodification of attentional experiences, Van Alstyne advocated for a market regime of incentives and individual rights to speak and listen. <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/david-lazer/">David Lazer</a>, for his part, adopted a middle ground position, presenting several findings on the slow but steady decoupling of content from its sources. He showed that information has become less traceable to sources, and discussed chatbots’ role in producing knowledge that is increasingly divorced from reliable reference to authors and media&nbsp;sources.</p><p>The second morning panel addressed the empirics of attention. <a href="https://heartbrain.hms.harvard.edu/people/michael-esterman-phd">Michael Esterman</a> discussed some of his clinical work, showing that attention is a fluctuating, fragile process deeply shaped by cognitive and environmental factors. Sustaining attention for long periods of time and across contexts remains a phenomenon that is not well understood, and Esterman presented results showing that blocking a population’s mobile phone access for two weeks could improve participants’ attention, as well as their mental health and well-being. Esterman also pointed to the need for increasing measurements outside of laboratory settings to better understand the external validity of fundamental psychological results related to attention. <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/person/elena-glassman">Elena Glassmann</a> then approached attention from the perspective of an interface designer, emphasizing that platforms actively shape how users direct their attention — often without users realizing it. Glassmann highlighted the danger of decontextualisation, where AI-driven tools summarize content by stripping away critical context and leaving users unaware of biases or omissions, and suggested ways to help people build reality-grounded mental models that provide access to contextual information, rather than hiding complexity. <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/christo-wilson/">Christo Wilson</a> concluded the panel with an overview of empirical approaches to studying attention platform business models, highlighting his role with David Lazer in creating and hosting the <a href="https://nationalinternetobservatory.org/index.html">National Internet Observatory</a> at Northeastern, a center that offers tools for researchers to study how people behave online in response to particular design features and platform strategies over long periods of&nbsp;time.</p><p>During the lunch keynote, FTC Commissioner and Law Professor <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/alvaro-bedoya">Alvaro Bedoya</a> spoke of his effort building a team of doctors and psychologists at the FTC whose focus and expertise includes children’s mental health and well-being. He also spoke of his work advocating for <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/BedoyaStatementonCOPPARuleNPRMFINAL12.20.23.pdf">children’s privacy</a> under <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/statement-commissioner-alvaro-m-bedoya-issuance-notice-proposed-rulemaking-update-childrens-online">COPPA</a> and of the analogies and differences between tobacco, sports gambling and addiction to technological devices and products. Commissioner Bedoya suggested that more research needs to be done to better understand which products, platforms and specific technological features cause addiction and other mental health disorders.</p><p>The afternoon began with a third panel on media and communication systems for attention capture. <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/nick-seaver">Nick Seaver</a> presented a spirited argument that attention may, in fact, not exist at all. While holding and waving a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_jiggler">mouse jiggler</a>, Seaver showed that attention is primarily defined or constructed by the way it is measured. Measurement, in turn, serves primarily as a managerial tool of control. While they might appear to be measuring participation, platform designers are in reality disciplining, tracking and controlling populations. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/bridget-todd">Bridget Todd</a> spoke of her work in the podcasting world, emphasizing the relation between intimacy and attention: audiences pay attention based on proximity to particular types of content and the emotions that content generates for them. Her view is that the current digital economy prioritizes profitable outrage over thoughtful storytelling, but that we should always push for the latter. <a href="https://www.umass.edu/communication/about/directory/emily-e-west">Emily West </a>presented some of her research on Amazon through the lens of convenience. Attention and addiction to digital products are promoted by appealing to convenience: platforms engineer frictionless experiences to generate user dependencies, producing a culture of learned passivity and inattention that quietly erodes agency. <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/rebecca-tushnet/">Rebecca Tushnet </a>spoke of the law of advertising and the doctrines of dilution and confusion under trademarks law, explaining that the law simultaneously invokes but misunderstands the science of, or empirical realities of, human attention, protecting only those parts of attention that can be owned under intellectual property regimes. Similar to Seaver’s argument that attention is effectively what we can measure, Tushnet’s presentation highlighted that we live in an economy of signals and containers of attention.</p><p>The day ended with a panel discussion on legal and policymaking efforts in the attention space. <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/daynard/">Richard Daynard</a> shared key takeaways from his litigation experience fighting tobacco and gambling companies. He explained that these industries intentionally engineer their products to addict users while funding research that shows the exact opposite, namely that their products are not addictive and individuals who engage in excessive use are the ones to blame. He added that these companies often lose in product liability litigation, where strict liability regardless of intention is the standard. <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-law/faculty/directory/full-time/zephyr-teachout/">Zephyr Teachout</a> then offered an overview of the evolving Supreme Court jurisprudence on the First Amendment, arguing that current shifts in the court’s composition and caselaw are opening the door to possible legislation and reform in the attention space, something that until recently seemed largely implausible. <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/leah-a-plunkett/">Leah Plunkett</a> discussed state social media laws and described them as providing financial compensation, privacy safeguards for children and workplace protections. She focused on a recent <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/03/11/utah-bill-aimed-protecting-child/">Utah law</a> that allows children to sue their parents for compensation when their image is used in their parents’ social media feed for profit and described her involvement in drafting a model law on this theme for the Uniform Law Commission. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/woodrow-hartzog/">Woody Hartzog</a> concluded the panel presentations, discussing his work with Neil Richards on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4845648">wrongful engagement</a>, a tort which would allow individuals to sue digital companies for profiting from their addiction and engagement while neglecting users’ well&nbsp;being.</p><p>The event ended with participants discussing potential research overlaps, future collaborations and potential for advocacy across US regions. In the words of CLIC Director <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/roberts/">Alex Roberts</a>, who moderated the last panel, “[i]f an interdisciplinary field of “attention studies” wasn’t already a thing, it is&nbsp;now.”</p><p>This event would not have been possible without support and assistance from Northeastern’s CLIC, Alexandra Roberts, Jennifer Huer, Walaa Al Awad, Natalia Pifferer, Brad Whitmarsh, and Jacob Bouvier. We also thank Harvard Law’s Laura Zeng, and BKC’s Bey Woodward and Jonathan Zittrain for additional enthusiasm and assistance.</p><p>We hope to continue this important conversation in the months and years to come with all of you.

<p>Today, we’re sharing important news about the future of Ceramic.</p><p>With the rapid rise of agents as the new critical user and interface to the web, it’s increasingly clear that supporting a healthy, trustless, decentralized model for AI is essential. Our team, part of <a href="https://linktr.ee/recalllabs?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Recall Labs</a> after our merge with Textile, is shifting our primary focus to <a href="https://recall.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Recall</a>: a platform where AI agents prove themselves, improve themselves, and earn for their intelligence.</p><p>As part of this, we’ll be repurposing parts of Ceramic, deprecating others, and introducing a standalone open source version for the community. We want to openly communicate what this means for you and your applications built on Ceramic, as well as outline the path forward.</p> From Ceramic to Recall <p>Over the years, Ceramic has been pivotal in helping us understand decentralized data, composability, and robust synchronization. It’s been the leading technology for dozens of applications and networks in need of scalable, edge-centric, verifiable data storage and replication. We spent more than five years developing and iterating on Ceramic and are immensely proud of the advancements and technology we’ve shipped.</p><p>Even more than that, we are so thankful for your partnership. Our customers and community have relentlessly innovated on brand new tech, helped us move from prototypes to stable networks, and been the driving force for our continued commitment to open, decentralized data. Thank you for all of your support, and all you’ve helped us learn.</p><p>One of the persistent challenges we’ve faced with Ceramic has been the UX of decentralized data systems: managing keys and signing data, novel access control flows, and counterintuitive patterns for data flow have been challenges for many users and developers. Interestingly, all these properties are native and intuitive for the internet’s new class of users: agents.</p><p>Recall is a cryptoeconomic platform for AI agents to prove, improve, and earn based on their intelligence. It builds heavily on the technology we’ve built previously, but is a new platform and demands our full commitment.</p> What This Means for Ceramic Users <p>We deeply appreciate the trust and investment you’ve made in Ceramic. While our priority is Recall, we remain committed to setting Ceramic users up for success as we sunset certain parts of Ceramic.Here’s exactly what you need to know:</p> Introducing ceramic-one <p>Ceramic-one is the most performant, stable, and decentralized implementation of Ceramic. There is a new client SDK for reading/writing to ceramic-one: <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/tree/main/sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/tree/main/sdk</a></p><p>Ceramic-one introduces <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/new-ceramic-release-ceramic-one-with-new-ceramic-recon-protocol/">Recon</a>, enabling reliable synchronization and historical data syncing across nodes. All existing data from ComposeDB remains fully accessible and readable through ceramic-one.</p><p>Ceramic-one will continue to function independently, with no dependency on our infrastructure or any other centralized authority. Further, Ceramic-one is under an MIT license, so anyone who wants to fork it and continue developing it on their own is welcome to do so.</p> Anchoring and Conflict Resolution on Ceramic-one <p>We’re committed to completing one final critical feature for ceramic-one: self-anchoring to Recall. This allows fully decentralized timestamping without relying on our centralized CAS or Ethereum L1, making ceramic-one truly self-sufficient. This will be implemented sometime after the mainnet release of Recall.</p><p>Manual conflict resolution is currently possible through ceramic-one by exposing all stream HEADs, allowing applications to apply their own business logic to select which branch(s) of the stream's history they wish to use. We’re also considering building automated conflict resolution (based on anchor timestamps)—the only remaining functionality from js-ceramic not yet implemented in ceramic-one. If this feature is important to your use case, please reach out, as your feedback will influence our decision.</p><p>After these improvements, ceramic-one will reach a feature-complete MVP. At that point, we will only prioritize critical bug fixes. ceramic-one will continue to exist as stable software under an open MIT license—fully available for anyone who wishes to fork, improve, or independently evolve it.</p> Deprecation of js-ceramic and ComposeDB <p>Effective immediately, we’re deprecating js-ceramic and ComposeDB. We recommend migration to ceramic-one, the streamlined, performant successor, as soon as possible.</p><p>Migration Steps:</p>  A new client SDK for ceramic-one is now available here: <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/tree/main/sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ceramic-one SDK</a>  Step-by-step migration guidance is provided in our upgrade guides:  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/new-ceramic-release-ceramic-one-with-new-ceramic-recon-protocol/">Migration Guide on Ceramic Blog</a>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/blob/main/UPGRADE.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Detailed Upgrade Instructions on GitHub</a>    <p>Timeline and Support</p><p>ComposeDB and the Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) will be completely shut down at least one month after Recall’s Mainnet launch. (Exact date TBD, but expected in mid-2025.). After that date, ComposeDB-dependent apps will break if not migrated to ceramic-one.</p> Recall: The Future of Decentralized Intelligence <p>Ceramic’s legacy and your contributions have directly influenced our development of Recall. Many of Ceramic’s strengths—openness, transparency, and decentralization—live on and evolve within Recall’s cryptoeconomic framework.</p><p>Recall aims to become a vibrant ecosystem for AI builders and developers. We warmly invite Ceramic users to explore the opportunities Recall offers: building intelligent agents, participating in verifiable competitions, and earning from proven performance.</p> <p>We’re grateful for your support of Ceramic and excited about this next chapter with Recall. Our team remains available to assist your migration and ensure your continued success. If you have questions related to Ceramic, please reach out to us <a href="mailto:ceramic@set.gl">here</a>. If you’re interested in learning more about Recall, find us <a href="https://x.com/recallnet?ref=blog.ceramic.network">on Twitter</a>!</p><p>Warm regards,<br>The Recall Labs Team</p>

 ZeWIF Specification 

<p></p>

<p>The Zcash extensible Wallet Interchange Format (ZeWIF) has been Blockchain Commons’ main priority since the Zcash Community Grants program approved our proposal at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Why It’s Important. Blockchain Commons talks a lot about interoperability, and that’s what ZeWIF is: it’s a way to freely exchange data between Zcash wallets in a standardized form. What we don’t talk about as often is why interoperability is important.</p>

<p>It goes back to our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian principles</a>. Interoperability supports at least three of them.</p>

 
   It supports independence because any user can freely move their data among the interoperable software systems. 
   It supports openness because any developer can easily join the ecosystem by adopting a mature, well-understood specification. This creates an environment of coopetition (cooperative competition) that leads to advances in technology and usability. 
   It supports resilience because the interoperable format makes data less likely to be lost: it’ll be in a form that will be understood and therefore accessible, well in the future. 
 

<p>For a wallet ecosystem, interoperability means that users will have the freedom to move their digital assets among Zcash wallets. That’s the precise independence we want users to have, which is why it’s been worth spending a few months of time on this project.</p>

<p>The ZeWIF Meetings. To support the ZeWIF project, Blockchain Commons held <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/#meetings">three meetings</a> in the first quarter: on the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/meeting1/">initial wallet survey</a>, on the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/meeting2/">first demo of the zmigrate tool</a>, and on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/meeting3/">ZeWIF data abstractions</a>. Meeting with developers to ensure that specifications serve everyone’s needs has always been a bedrock policy for Blockchain Commons, so we’ve of course extended it here. (At least one more meeting is planned, for April 16th, to demo the data file format.)</p>


  
    
      #1: Wallet Survey:










   
    
   



    
    
      #2: Zmigrate demo:










   
    
   



    
    
      #3: Abstraction Discussion:










   
    
   



    
  


<p>What We’ve Released So Far. The ZeWIF project is built around the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zewif">zewif library</a>, which stores Zcash wallet data in an in-memory format. We’ve also written <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zewif-zcashd">zewif-zcashd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zewif-zingo">zewif-zingo</a> to demonstrate the import of data from those wallets to ZeWIF, while our partners at <a href="https://zingolabs.org/">Zingo Labs</a> have produced “zewif-zecwallet” for importing zecwallet data (though that PR hasn’t been merged yet). Finally, we authored <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zmigrate">zmigrate</a>, which is a demo CLI for importing zcashd content. With these demos and libraries in hand, other wallet developers can start working to interchange their own data via the ZeWIF format.</p>

<p>What’s Still to Come. With our releases so far, data can be interchanged between different Zcash wallets as long as it’s all done on the same machine: you just import into the in-memory ZeWIF format from one wallet, then export to another. But we expect most use cases will instead involve at least two different machines. That’s where the ZeWIF file format comes into play. Building on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a>, it translates the ZeWIF in-memory storage into a fixed file that can then be moved to a different machine. We expect to demo the Envelope ZeWIF format at that upcoming April 16th meeeting.</p>

 Post-Quantum Commons 

<p></p>

<p>Is Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) the next big thing? We were able to support our friends at Foundation with some PQC work just as we got the ZeWIF project going at the start of the year.</p>

<p>Why It’s Important. Quantum Computers are starting to appear, and though they’re far, far from what would be needed to break cryptography at the moment, there’s no telling when there’s going to be a sudden “quantum” leap. Though today’s cryptography might not need PQC, if you’re working on something that might be around for 5 or 10 years, you should be thinking about it!</p>

<p>PQC Meeting. Our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/meetings/2025-03-pqc/">March Gordian meeting</a> contained all the details of our PQC work, including what Quantum Computing is.</p>



 
    
   

<p>QuantumLink. The highlight of the meeting was a discussion of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/assets/pdfs/202503-quantumlink.pdf">QuantumLink</a> from our friends at <a href="https://foundation.xyz/">Foundation</a>. This is a  quantum-resistant protocol for Bluetooth communication that is a critical component of their new <a href="https://foundation.xyz/buy-passport-prime/">Passport Prime</a> wallet. It allows them to use Bluetooth with high security and for that security to remain strong 5 or 10 years in the future, in case Quantum Computing does make those big strides forward.</p>

<p>What We’ve Released So Far. The QuantumLink technology was enabled by new PQC support that Blockchain Commons incorporated into its libraries. You can now use the PQC algorithms <a href="https://hackmd.io/@bc-community/rJ8DOmCd1e">ML-DSA and ML-KEM</a> in our Rust stack, from <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-components-rust">bc-componenents</a> on up.</p>

 Open Integrity 

<p></p>

<p>We had one other big release in Q1: <a href="https://github.com/openintegrityproject">Open Integrity</a>, a system for increasing the trust of software being developed in Git. Well, technically it was released on April 7th, the 20th anniversary of Git’s release, but this is something that Blockchain Commons Architect Christopher Allen has been working on for about a year, so we’re thrilled to get the word out.</p>

<p>Why It’s Important. We wrote <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/open-integrity/">a whole article</a> discussing why Open Integrity is important. But, in short: Git repos are growing increasingly important for the deployment of critical software, and Git doesn’t actually provide a high-level of trust for those repos, despite the ability to sign commits. Open Integrity bridges the gap betwen what Git offers and what online software distribution needs.</p>

<p>What We’ve Released So Far. The Open Integrity project is now available in an early form at <a href="https://github.com/openintegrityproject">GitHub</a>. A <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity_Problem_Statement.md">Problem Statement</a> offers  details on the issues we’re trying to solve and our solutions. We’ve also got a number of tools and scripts, the most import of which creates an <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/src/setup_git_inception_repo.sh">inception commit on a repo</a>. This inception commit is the root of trust that lays the foundation for ensuring that you always know who’s in control of a repo.</p>

<p>If you want to try out Open Integrity, see the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity_Script_Snippets.md">Open Integrity Snippets file</a>, which has complete instructions on how to get that inception-commit script running, plus many examples that will allow you to experiment with Open Integrity.</p>

 

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s it for our big Q1 projects, but we had a number of smaller releases over the course of the quarter as well.</p>
</blockquote>

 

 New Articles 

<p>The Right to Transact. We think the right to transact should be an international freedom. Read more in Christopher’s recent article, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/RightToTransact/">“The Case for an International Right to Freedom to Transact”</a>, which builds on his 2024 musing, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/ValuesDesign/">“How My Values Inform Design”</a>.</p>

<p>SSI Orbit Podcast. Christopher also was interviewed for the <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/videos/SSI-Podcast/">SSI Orbit Podcast</a>. It’s been nine years since he wrote the foundational <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>. Where do things stand today?</p>

 New Dev Docs 

<p>SSKR Pages. We updated our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR dev pages</a> with the big focus being differentiating <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/#what-are-sskr-urs">SSKR URs</a> (where you split up a key) and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/#what-are-sskr-envelopes">SSKR Envelopes</a> (where you protect the entire contents of an Envelope by creating and splitting up a key). The <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/vectors/">test vectors</a> also now demonstrate both cases.</p>

<p>UR Pages. We similarly did some big updates to our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">UR dev pages</a>. Here the issue was that URs had seen some changes over the years, especially as we locked down CBOR tag registration, and our examples were no longer up-to-date. Now, every page and every test vector should be correct. There’s also a new page on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/envelope/">URs for Gordian Envelope</a>.</p>

<p>Meetings Pages. All of Blockchain Commons’ meetings are now documented on a new <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/meetings/">meetings page</a>, which also includes subpages with videos and slides (and usually transcripts) of everything from the last few years!</p>

<p>Improved Crate Docs. Finally, we’ve used some lessons learned from the documentation of ZeWIF to improve the documentation of our Rust stack. As a result, docs.rs now has improved docs for <a href="https://docs.rs/dcbor/0.16.5/dcbor/">bc-dcbor</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/bc-components/0.18.2/bc_components/">bc-components</a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/bc-envelope/latest/bc_envelope/">bc-envelope</a></p>

 New Ports 

<p>Lifehash to Rust. Lifehash is now available in a new <a href="https://github.com/GalactechsLLC/lifehash-rs">Rust Implementation</a> courtesy of Ken Griggs. Lifehash is a critical element of the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/oib/">object identity block</a>, which can help users to recognize seeds and keys. We hope this will allow for more deployment.</p>

 New Research 

<p></p>

<p>Provenance Marks. One of our newest innovations, courtesy of Blockchain Commons Lead Researcher Wolf McNally, is the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2025-001-provenance-mark.md">provenance mark</a>. The provenance mark is a cryptographically secure chain of marks that facilitates the easy verification of authenticity. We’ll have more on them in the months ahead, but in the meantime, you can read Wolf’s <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2025-001-provenance-mark.md">research paper</a> on the topic!</p>

<p>Provenance References. If you want to start playing with provenance marks right now, 
we’ve already released a series of reference apps and libraries. They include our original <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Provenance">Swift implementation</a>, our newer <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/provenance-mark-rust">Rust implementation</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/provenance-mark-cli-rust">CLI</a> that can be used to create and manage marks!</p>

 

<p>That’s it for the moment. For the next quarter, we’ll be closing out our initial work on ZeWIF in April, and we’ll be offering more looks at Provenance Marks in the months ahead.</p>

Remix by Doug&nbsp;Belshaw.<p>We Are Open Co-op (WAO) is a collective of individuals who share a commitment to ethical, inclusive, and sustainable practices in all aspects of our work, including AI literacy. Our approach to this area is grounded in the belief that AI is an extension of digital literacies, not a separate field. We aim to demystify AI, helping people recognise that the digital literacy skills they already possess are directly applicable to&nbsp;AI.</p><p>AI’s societal impacts are significant and well-documented, but the public often struggles to grasp its opportunities and risks. A trusted guide is needed to balance optimism with caution, particularly given AI’s potential effects on jobs, culture, and other critical&nbsp;areas.</p> The project <p>We are delighted to have started work on a new project with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/responsible-innovation-centre">Responsible Innovation Centre for Public Media Futures</a>, hosted by the BBC. As an institution with a long and valued history in delivering high quality educational initiatives that help audiences understand and navigate new technologies, we believe the BBC is well placed to help public understanding and engagement with emerging technologies such as&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Our focus is research and analysis which aims to find gaps in provision for younger audiences. Over the next few months we’ll be interviewing experts, reviewing resources, and scrutinising frameworks. We will be using this research to create a report along with a framework and guide which will ultimately help the BBC create policies and content for young people. We’ll be sharing an open version of what we create, so look for those in the&nbsp;summer.</p> Our approach <p>Starting with desk research, and building on the work we’ve already curated, we’re creating a library of interesting definitions, frameworks, and resources that can help us understand what other people are exploring when it comes to AI Literacy in combination with public&nbsp;media.</p><p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/activists-campaigners-and-advocates-versus-ai-cabfd87c0f46">As with our work</a> with Friends of the Earth where we researched <a href="https://policy.friendsoftheearth.uk/reports/harnessing-ai-environmental-justice">AI and environmental justice</a>, we will bring together a variety of experts to give feedback and sense check what falls out of some of the research.</p><p>Along the way, we’ll share updates based on our findings, so if you know of a person, organisation, initiative, framework, or resource that we should take a look at, please let us know!

<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) has officially launched its <a href="https://htwg.identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Hospitality &amp; Travel Working Group</a>, evolving from the ongoing H&amp;T Special Interest Group (SIG). This new working group will focus on developing standards, schemas, processes, and documentation to support the self-sovereign exchange of data between travelers, services, intermediaries in the hospitality and travel industry, and their AI agents.</p> Mission and Focus <p>The primary goal of the working group is to enable travelers to maintain ownership and control over their personal data while allowing for seamless interactions with travel service providers. The group will address critical aspects of traveler profiles, focusing on data portability, privacy, and interoperability across the travel ecosystem.</p> Meeting Schedule <p>The working group will convene twice weekly:</p>  Tuesdays at 14:00:00 UTC  Fridays at 14:00:00 UTC  <p>These regular meetings will facilitate ongoing collaboration among industry stakeholders, technology providers, and standards bodies.</p> Leadership Perspectives <p>"We are enormously proud that the hard work of our dedicated Hospitality &amp; Travel SIG has led to a Working Group that will develop key specifications. From sharing boarding passes and hotel preferences to loyalty programs and dietary requirements, travelers constantly provide the same information to different companies throughout their journey.</p><p>"Travelers need to share, and overshare, the broadest range of personal data on their voyage, ranging from seat or dietary preferences, to government identities or passports, across multiple service providers who may not have the best data handling practices. This working group will develop standards that allow travelers to control exactly what data they share, with whom, and for how long - eliminating both unnecessary data exposure and the frustration of repeatedly entering the same information," said Kim Hamilton Duffy, Executive Director of the DIF.</p><p>Douglas Rice, industry veteran and Hospitality &amp; Travel Working Group chair added: "The travel ecosystem has long struggled with fragmented approaches to customer data and identity management. This working group will help establish the technical foundations needed for travelers to maintain control of their data while enabling the personalized experiences they expect. We're building toward a future where your travel preferences, loyalty information, and credentials can move with you seamlessly across your journey—all while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security, and enabling AI agents to act on verified information about the traveler.”</p> Next Steps <p>The working group will initially focus on defining standardized schemas for travelers or their digital agents to present profiles, establishing protocols for secure data exchange, and developing guidelines for implementation across various travel touch points. Industry participants are encouraged to join the working group to contribute their expertise and perspectives.</p><p>For more information about participating, visit the <a href="https://htwg.identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF Hospitality &amp; Travel Working Group web site</a>.</p>

<a href="https://keyless.io/"></a>



<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Keyless?</p>



<p>Our vision is for a safer, more private world. Keyless is on a mission to redefine how the world authenticates – enabling people to securely access services with a simple look, without compromising their biometric data.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>We can answer this with a simple example: mule accounts. Fraudsters will pay people to open bank or crypto accounts using their real ID, then take over and use those accounts to launder money. On paper, the account looks legitimate – but the person using it isn’t who the bank thinks it is.</p>



<p>This kind of fraud is only possible when identity assurance is weak. With trustworthy digital identity, this can be stopped by verifying who is really behind the screen not just at sign-up, but every time they log in, send a payment, or change account details.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identity is the foundation for secure online interactions. It drives inclusion, cuts costs, and reduces fraud. When companies can trust their users, they grow faster and more confidently.</p>



<p>Keyless sits within consumer apps – often in banking and fintech, but also in government and university portals. Whenever a user performs a sensitive action, like logging in or approving a payment, Keyless triggers an authentication selfie using the device’s camera. Unlike text messages, call centers, or even FaceID, this process actually proves who the user is – not just that they have access to a device or mobile number. </p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada is already taking significant steps toward becoming a global leader in digital identity. The government is actively developing a nationwide digital ID program designed to make accessing both public and private services faster and more secure.</p>



<p>By continuing to invest in public-private collaboration, Canada can lead the way in building trusted, inclusive digital ecosystems that other countries look to for guidance.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>We joined DIACC to help shape the future of digital identity in a way that’s secure, user-friendly, and preserves citizen privacy. We believe in collaboration and are excited to contribute our expertise in biometric authentication and privacy-preserving technologies.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Within the biometric authentication space, Keyless is known for its privacy-preserving approach. Uniquely, we authenticate users without storing their facial biometric data anywhere – keeping their biometric information completely private.</p>

<p>Organizations are encouraged to take the Passkey Pledge ahead of World Passkey Day on May 1&nbsp;</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., April 9, 2025 – The FIDO Alliance is inviting organizations around the world to take the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">Passkey Pledge</a>, a voluntary commitment to increase awareness and adoption of passkey sign-ins to make the web safer and more accessible.</p>



<p>Since passkeys were introduced to the world in 2022, hundreds of service providers have embraced the greater security and usability that passkeys bring to users. Over 15 billion user accounts are now equipped with the option to use a passkey instead of relying on passwords, which are easy to steal and reuse for account takeovers and fraud. Organizations that deploy passkeys are consistently finding that a greater percentage of their users are able to sign into services in far less time – which helps generate added revenue and/or employee productivity while also reducing fraud and account takeovers.</p>



<p>To further advance and promote the use of passkeys, the first Thursday in May each year is now recognized as World Passkey Day (previously World Password Day). Companies can take the Passkey Pledge in advance of World Passkey Day and commit to making a good-faith effort to achieve the following goals throughout the year:</p>



 
 For service providers that have an active implementation of passkeys for sign-in – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken to measurably increase the use of passkeys by users when signing into the company’s services. 



 For service providers that are in the process of implementing passkeys for sign-in – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate measurable actions taken to enable passkeys for signing into the company’s services. 



 For vendors with a FIDO-based products and/or service – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken to measurably increase the use of passkeys through adoption of the company’s products and/or services. 



 For vendors developing FIDO-based products and/or services – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate measurable actions to FIDO certify its products and launch a product or service with passkey sign-in support. 



 For industry associations and standards organizations&nbsp;– Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions to increase the visibility and benefits of passkey sign-ins. 
 



<p>Organizations that take the pledge will receive assets to support their involvement and will have the opportunity to take part in activities and announcements planned for World Passkey Day on May 1, 2025.</p>



<p>More details on the pledge, including the sign-up form, can be found at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 Current Landscape 



<p>Governments worldwide are accelerating their digital transformation efforts to meet the growing expectations of citizens and businesses. Canada is no exception, with public sector services increasingly moving online to improve efficiency, accessibility, and security. However, this shift brings significant challenges, including data privacy concerns, cybersecurity threats, and the need for seamless, interoperable services across jurisdictions.</p>



<p>When DIACC was established in 2012, its mission was to create a secure digital ecosystem. Today, this goal is even more critical for modernizing government services while ensuring security, privacy, and usability. DIACC has evolved from research to certifying real-world digital trust solutions, setting audit standards, shaping policies, and connecting businesses and government to strengthen Canada’s digital economy.</p>



<p>Digital trust—which empowers individuals, businesses, and government agencies to engage online securely and transparently—is essential for delivering reliable public services. Without it, citizens may lack confidence in digital government initiatives, limiting their adoption and effectiveness.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can strengthen its public service infrastructure, enhance citizen confidence, and improve service delivery. Interoperable frameworks such as the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF) ensure that digital services remain secure, adaptable, and trusted while protecting personal electronic information between government agencies and service providers.</p>



 Advancing Digital Trust to Modernize Government Services 



 1. Driving Efficiencies, Cost Savings, and Economic Growth 



<p>Governments can leverage DIACC, the PCTF, and PCTF certification along with technical standards to help streamline processes, reduce costs, and create economic opportunities through:</p>



 
 Reducing Implementation Costs: Standardized digital trust solutions lower costs associated with developing, integrating, and maintaining digital trust capabilities. 



 Enhancing Service Efficiencies: Digital credentials and interoperable frameworks minimize redundancies and enable faster, more secure service delivery. 



 Unlocking Interprovincial Trade: A unified digital trust framework will enable seamless service delivery to Canadians across Canada, regardless of province of residence.&nbsp; 



 Facilitating Labour Mobility: Efforts to reduce interprovincial trade across Canada mean the importance of secure and portable digital credentials has never been greater. Reducing bureaucratic licensing and certification verification barriers will ensure workers can move between provinces more efficiently. 



 Boosting Public-Private Collaboration: By aligning digital trust standards with industry best practices, governments can foster innovation and attract investment in secure digital services. 
 



 2. Strengthening Public Confidence in Digital Services 



<p>For government digital services to succeed, citizens must trust them. Implementing robust digital trust solutions allows governments to:</p>



 
 Ensure secure and seamless access to online services 



 Protect citizens’ data from fraud and misuse 



 Increase adoption of digital services by providing verifiable trust measures 



 Improve operational efficiency by reducing manual verification processes

 A New Era for Sustainable Computing <p>Demand for computing power is exploding as AI models, cloud services, and decentralized applications consume ever-greater amounts of energy. But not all energy is created equal. In some regions, a data center might be drawing power from a coal-heavy grid, while elsewhere excess wind or solar power goes unused. For the past decade, tech giants addressed this by buying renewable energy or improving efficiency. But what if we could take a more dynamic approach — shifting computational workloads across location and time to maximize use of clean&nbsp;energy?</p><p>Enter Carbon-Aware Nomination, a groundbreaking mechanism from Energy Web that does exactly that. It ensures computational tasks run where and when they have the lowest carbon intensity. This isn’t a standard cloud feature or a typical blockchain project, but a fusion of both: it connects decentralized computing networks with real-time carbon intensity data from <a href="https://watttime.org/">WattTime</a> and the Green Software Foundation’s <a href="https://carbon-aware-sdk.greensoftware.foundation/">Carbon-Aware SDK</a>. And the best part — it’s going open-source, inviting the entire industry to build a greener digital future together.</p> The Carbon Cost of Computing: Why It&nbsp;Matters <p>Computing today has a massive carbon cost. Data centers account for around 1–2% of global electricity use (on par with the airline industry), and that share is rising fast. Some forecasts warn that with the AI boom, data center energy demand could hit double-digit percentages of global consumption by 2030. In short, if we don’t make computing more sustainable, it will hinder global climate goals. Today’s solutions to decarbonize workloads rarely have real-time “carbon awareness.” This means a lot of flexible computing — like batch processing or AI training jobs — might be running at the worst possible times for the planet. Carbon-Aware Nomination changes that paradigm by intelligently routing workloads to times and places where electricity is greenest.</p> Why Carbon-Aware Nomination Is a Game-Changer <p>Carbon-aware computing isn’t an entirely new idea, but no one has implemented it the way we have. Existing approaches have serious limitations:</p>  Blind Spots in Conventional Cloud Sustainability: Major cloud platforms have introduced sustainability dashboards and efficiency tools to help customers estimate carbon footprints. However, these proprietary solutions require you to trust their reporting. There’s no independent way to verify if a given workload actually ran on low-carbon energy. In other words, you might see carbon-saving claims, but you can’t prove them. While Carbon-Aware Nomination is built for decentralized compute networks, its methodology could be adapted for cloud orchestration. However, the current implementation is blockchain-native, ensuring verifiable, tamper-proof sustainability claims.  Decentralized Compute Lacks Climate Intelligence: Emerging networks like iExec, Golem, and Akash distribute workloads across many nodes, leveraging blockchain for compute marketplaces. Yet, they schedule jobs without considering the carbon intensity of those nodes. A task might just as easily run on a coal-powered node as on a solar-powered one. Until now, no decentralized computing platform has integrated real-time carbon optimization into its scheduling logic.  <p>This is where Carbon-Aware Nomination stands apart. It combines decentralized computing with live carbon-intensity data for the first time. By doing so, it delivers several unique benefits that neither traditional clouds nor existing blockchain compute projects&nbsp;offer:</p>  Decentralized &amp; Trustless Architecture: Built on the Energy Web X blockchain, every decision and claim is transparent. There’s no single company controlling the process, and sustainability claims are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone. This brings a new level of trust to green computing — auditors or stakeholders can confirm, via the public ledger, that a workload ran at a time of low grid emissions.  Real-Time Carbon Intelligence: The system taps into WattTime’s API and the GSF Carbon-Aware SDK to get live and forecasted grid emissions data. Workloads are continuously matched to the cleanest energy times in real time. If wind picks up in Region A or solar output surges in Region B, the scheduler knows and can route tasks accordingly. We’re not offsetting carbon with credits or averaging it annually; we’re actively avoiding emissions as they&nbsp;happen.  Hybrid Public/Enterprise Nodes: Flexibility is built in. Organizations can nominate workloads to run on public decentralized nodes or their own infrastructure — whichever meets the carbon criteria. For example, an enterprise could use its private servers when they’re running on green power, or tap into a public pool of nodes in another region when local power is dirty. Carbon-Aware Nomination isn’t “all or nothing” — it’s a smart overlay that finds the greenest option across a mix of resources.  Verifiable ESG Reporting: Every workload handled through this system generates a digital proof of its execution with associated carbon data. Think of it like an eco-receipt. This proof can feed directly into ESG reports or sustainability audits, backed by blockchain records. Instead of saying “we think our computations were low-carbon,” organizations can cryptographically demonstrate it. This level of accountability is increasingly crucial as investors and regulators demand hard evidence of climate&nbsp;action.  Open-Source Collaboration: Unlike proprietary cloud solutions, Carbon-Aware Nomination is being released as open-source software. This invites an entire community — from researchers to startups — to use it, audit it, and improve it. By sharing the code, Energy Web ensures transparency of the algorithm and accelerates innovation. Anyone will be able to plug into the system or even contribute new features (for example, supporting new types of workloads or integrating additional data sources). We believe an open approach is the fastest way to standardize carbon-aware computing across the&nbsp;world.   How It Works (In Simple&nbsp;Terms):   Checks Carbon Data: A group of computers (nominators) analyze real-time electricity grid data to find where energy is greenest.  Finds the Best Spot: The nominators select and agree on the cleanest available computing resources to execute the workload and qualify for&nbsp;rewards.  Runs &amp; Verifies: The selected computers can accept and execute the workload, and the blockchain records proof of completion, ensuring eligibility for&nbsp;rewards.   How It Works (In detail): The Carbon-Aware Nomination Pool <p>So, how does the system actually orchestrate a “greener” workload? Rather than a central scheduler deciding where tasks run, Carbon-Aware Nomination uses a decentralized pool of worker nodes and nominators that collectively determine the optimal execution plan. Here’s a high-level look at the&nbsp;process:</p>  Live Carbon Data Feeds: Using the Carbon Aware SDK, the system continuously pulls real-time and forecasted carbon intensity data from WattTime’s service. This data covers different regions and grids, updating as conditions change (like when a big solar farm comes online in the afternoon or when a coal plant ramps up at&nbsp;night).  Normalized Comparison: Because “100 gCO₂/kWh” means different things on different grids, the scheduler normalizes carbon intensity across regions. This prevents it from always favoring the same region and ensures a fair comparison. In essence, the algorithm knows what “clean” means for each location and time — a form of smart&nbsp;context.  Energy Web X Worker Registry: All participating compute nodes (whether run by individuals, companies, or data centers) register on the Energy Web X blockchain registry. They publish metadata about their location, hardware, and efficiency. This on-chain registry is like a directory of available computing resources, with info crucial for carbon-aware decisions. It’s also transparent — anyone can see which nodes are available and where they&nbsp;are.  Green Nomination Process: When a workload needs scheduling, a separate group of decentralized nominators, independent from the compute nodes themselves, evaluates the available options. These nominators analyze live carbon intensity data (from step 1), assess each node’s performance and capacity, and rank them based on sustainability. Essentially, the nodes compete, but not on price or speed alone, on verifiable carbon performance. The system then nominates the best-suited, lowest-carbon node to execute the task, ensuring a trustless and tamper-proof selection process.  Workload Execution &amp; Proof: The chosen node runs the computation. During and after execution, it logs the energy used and the carbon intensity at that time. This information is reported back and recorded (for example, as an attestation on Energy Web X). The result is a verifiable proof that “Task X was executed at Time Y in Region Z with carbon intensity Q gCO₂/kWh.” If someone doubts the claim, the proof is on the blockchain for anyone to&nbsp;verify.  <p>Continuous Optimization: Over time, the system can employ incentives to improve efficiency. For instance, node operators who consistently provide low-carbon compute (by perhaps adding their own renewable energy or load-shifting) could be rewarded. Likewise, if the network notices certain regions becoming cleaner (say a new wind farm installed), it will naturally start shifting more workloads there. The feedback loop encourages the whole ecosystem to move towards cleaner operations, as sustainable nodes get more business.</p><p>In practice, this means a company using Carbon-Aware Nomination could submit a batch job and know that the job will run at the best possible time (perhaps an hour later when a green energy surge comes) and in the best location (maybe on a server one country over where it’s a windy night), all without manual intervention. The heavy lifting of “when and where to compute” is handled by the decentralized logic in a transparent way.</p> How Carbon-Aware Nomination Fits into Energy Web&nbsp;X <p>Carbon-Aware Nomination is a component of the broader Energy Web X (EWX) ecosystem. EWX is Energy Web’s new architecture for decentralized solutions, and it supports multiple “nomination” methods (i.e., scheduling and matching mechanisms) for every single compute workload of their solutions. Carbon awareness is one powerful approach, but not the only one — some applications might optimize purely on cost or latency, for example. Within&nbsp;EWX:</p>  Solutions can opt-in to Carbon-Aware Nomination if minimizing emissions is a priority, or choose other nomination modules better suited to their needs. This flexible architecture means EWX can cater to different preferences (greenest vs. fastest vs. cheapest, etc.), and Carbon-Aware Nomination is available for any solution that cares about sustainability.  Even for applications that prioritize performance, Carbon-Aware Nomination can run in the background or as a secondary filter. For instance, if two nodes are equally capable, why not pick the one on cleaner energy? In this way, the carbon-aware mechanism can enhance other scheduling strategies by adding a sustainability lens.  All of this happens while leveraging the security and transparency of Energy Web’s blockchain. The nominations (scheduling decisions) and the resulting proofs are recorded on-chain, which aligns with Energy Web’s mission to use open digital infrastructure for the clean energy transition. EWX provides the trust layer that makes Carbon-Aware Nomination’s claims audit-proof.   Decentralized Nomination: Trustless, Transparent, and Resilient <p>Unlike a traditional cloud scheduler (where one company’s software decides where your job runs), Carbon-Aware Nomination operates without a single controlling entity. The decision process is distributed among many participants and governed by open algorithms. This decentralized approach brings several advantages:</p>  Trustless operations: You don’t have to trust Energy Web or any cloud provider’s claims — you can verify the outcomes yourself on-chain. If a workload was supposed to run on green power, anyone can check the records and confirm it did. This is crucial for companies that need to report emissions reductions to regulators or want to avoid greenwashing.  Transparency: Every step, from the carbon data used to the final selection of a node, can be made transparent. Community members could even watch a dashboard of live nominations happening, seeing in real time how the system is chasing the lowest-carbon resources. This level of openness is unheard of in proprietary cloud scheduling.  Resilience: Decentralization also means there’s no single point of failure. The nomination process can continue even if one node or one data feed goes down. Multiple nodes participate in making decisions, and the blockchain ensures a canonical record. It’s much harder to corrupt or game the system — doing so would require attacking a broad, global network of participants.  <p>For users, this simply translates to peace of mind. You get a robust service that not only optimizes for sustainability but is also inherently reliable and tamper-proof.</p> Why Open Source&nbsp;Matters <p>Energy Web is committed to open-sourcing the entire Carbon-Aware Nomination system. By making it freely available to developers, enterprises, and even competitors, we aim to set a new industry standard for carbon-aware computing. Transparency is a core value here — anyone can inspect the code to understand how decisions are made and suggest improvements. Open source also accelerates innovation: a global community can adapt the tool for new use cases (imagine carbon-aware scheduling for edge devices or for other batch processes like rendering and scientific computing). We’re releasing this under an open license so that this carbon-aware logic can proliferate everywhere, not just within Energy Web’s ecosystem.</p><p>Ultimately, climate change is a shared challenge. We believe that by open-sourcing this solution, we enable network effects — more contributions, more adoption, and more emissions saved. No single company can decarbonize IT on its own, but together, we can make carbon-aware computing the “new normal” for all data centers and&nbsp;devices.</p> Join the&nbsp;Movement <p>Carbon-aware computing is the future. Whether you’re an enterprise managing thousands of servers, a blockchain enthusiast, or a developer hacking on weekends, you can start integrating Carbon-Aware Nomination into your workflows to make a tangible impact. This isn’t just an Energy Web project — it’s a call to all cloud providers, decentralized network operators, and software platforms: join us in running workloads on clean energy. Imagine a world where every AI training, every render job, every transaction validation automatically seeks out the greenest energy available. That’s what we’re building, and we invite you to build it with&nbsp;us.</p><p>The code will be open-sourced on Energy Web’s GitHub (and accessible through our developer portal). We’ll be hosting community calls and tutorials for those who want to implement it or contribute. By working together, we can ensure that the digital infrastructure of the future not only powers our economies — but also heals our planet. It’s time to decarbonize the cloud, one workload at a&nbsp;time.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/carbon-aware-nomination-system-for-decentralized-computing-is-now-live-604996982c0f">Carbon-Aware Nomination System for Decentralized Computing is now live</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A Vision for the Future of Microcredentials Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>This is the final post in a series drawing on insights from a <a href="https://www.ndln.ie/new-learning-and-teaching-models">report authored by We Are Open Co-op</a> (WAO) for the Irish National Digital Leadership Network (NDLN). The report explores the historical roots of credentialing, the emergence of microcredentials, and their potential to reshape education and professional development.</p><p>This post draws on the insights explored so far to outline a vision for the future of microcredentials. By focusing on inclusivity, open standards, and meaningful recognition, microcredentials can be a transformative tool for education and professional development. Here, we propose actionable steps for organisations to harness their potential and create systems that truly empower learners.</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-1-50b0fc77cd05">Part 1 — Introduction and&nbsp;Context</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-2-985ab20a1176">Part 2 — The Evolution of Credentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-3-c3c956c09574">Part 3 — Demystifying Microcredentials</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-4-4a0811255a00">Part 4 — Trends Shaping the Future of Microcredentials</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-5-fde07efdcbd2">Part 5 — The Role of Technology in Microcredentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-6-fe96ea9be396">Part 6 — Challenges and Risks in Microcredentialing</a>  Part 7 — A Vision for the Future of Microcredentials (this&nbsp;post)   Open Recognition as a Guiding Principle <p>A key aspect of the future of microcredentials is the principle of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a>, which values learning in all its forms, whether formal, informal, or experiential. By embracing this approach, organisations can ensure microcredentials acknowledge diverse achievements and highlight contributions that might otherwise be overlooked.</p><p>For instance microcredentials can&nbsp;help:</p>  Charities — Recognise the skills gained through volunteering, advocacy, and community projects, offering participants portable evidence of their contributions.  NGOs — Validate the efforts of community workers, promoting inclusion and recognising the expertise developed in challenging environments.  Co-ops — Highlight collaborative and informal learning within member-driven structures, supporting collective progress and innovation.  Businesses — Align microcredentials with organisational priorities, such as sustainability or diversity, to strengthen employee development and retention.  Higher Education — Create stackable credentials that integrate with degree programmes and reflect industry partnerships, enabling more flexible and relevant learning pathways.   The Responsible Use of Technology <p>Technology plays a critical role in delivering effective microcredentialing systems. Tools like <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F">Open Badges</a> and Verifiable Credentials ensure transparency, portability, and security. Digital wallets give learners control over their achievements, while AI can assist in mapping skills and recommending pathways.</p><p>However, implementing these tools requires careful consideration. Equity, accessibility, and data privacy must be central to their design to avoid excluding certain groups or compromising trust. By prioritising interoperability and avoiding proprietary systems, organisations can ensure credentials remain functional across platforms and contexts.</p> Encouraging Cross-Sector Collaboration <p>The development of impactful microcredentialing systems relies on partnerships across education providers, employers, policymakers, and technology developers. Collaboration can:</p>  Align microcredentials with societal goals and workforce needs.  Establish shared quality assurance frameworks to build&nbsp;trust.  Pool resources and expertise to address challenges like accessibility and&nbsp;cost.  <p>Such partnerships help ensure that microcredentials are not only useful but also widely recognised and respected.</p> Embedding Inclusivity and&nbsp;Equity <p>For microcredentialing systems to achieve their full potential, inclusivity must be at their core. This means designing platforms that are accessible to people with diverse needs, reducing financial barriers, and proactively engaging marginalised communities. Embedding these values ensures microcredentials contribute meaningfully to social equity and support lifelong learning opportunities.</p> Taking the Next&nbsp;Step <p>Microcredentials have the potential to celebrate diverse learning experiences, allowing individuals to present their skills and achievements in ways that matter. Whether your organisation is considering a pilot project or a larger-scale initiative, We Are Open Co-op can provide the expertise you need. From strategic planning to technological implementation, we ensure your microcredentialing projects are impactful and learner-focused.</p><p>👋 <a href="https://weareopen.coop/#four">Get in touch</a> with us today to explore how we can support your journey toward a more inclusive and forward-thinking approach to credentialing.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-7-4ce87debec12">Reframing Recognition: Part 7</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>When can you trust a software release? How do you know that a software repo is safe, that it represents the intent of its creators? On the 20th anniversary of Git, these questions are more important than ever.</p>

<p>Obviously, Git lays the foundation for trust in software releases with its ability to sign commits, but the trust of the system is unfortunately shallow. Untrusted content can be merged into a trusted repo, commit histories can be rewritten, and trust can’t be reliably extended into the future. These are crucial issues to solve if we are trusting software that originates in Git … and some pretty crucial software originates with Git, from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">Microsoft’s vscode</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl">OpenSSL project</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/core">vue.js framework</a>. Which is what led me to the design of the Open Integrity system. Though Git may look like to the average user like it offers a strong level of trust, it’s a dangerous mirage. Open Integrity makes repo trust a reality.</p>


  


<p>Open Integrity is still built with Git, meaning that it can be used on GitHub, GitLab, or whatever other Git tool that you prefer. There are no additions required other than the Open Integrity scripts themselves. However, Open Integrity makes trust the default rather than an add-on, establishing a root of trust when a repo is created, defending it against inappropriate additions, and extending that trust to new users and new keys as a project evolves.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Open Integrity’s root of trust can also be used as a DID (decentralized identifier) identity, supporting <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> for a user or a project. But taking advantage of that might be the next step. For the moment, let me dive a bit further into the problems of Git’s current trust framework and how I designed the architecture of Open Integrity to resolve them.</p>

 A Problem of Trust 

<p>The foundation of trust in Git is signing commits with a signing key that is registered with a Git account, but that turns out to be a fragile level of trust because it leaves a number of loopholes.</p>

 
   
    <p>Signing isn’t required. Even if an account has a legitimate signing key, use of that key isn’t required. Even if a Git hosting service enforces commit signing, unsigned commits can typically still be merged from branches.</p>
   
   
    <p>Merging doesn’t guarantee signatures. Generally, merging offers one of the biggest gaps in signing security. It’s not just that merged commits can be unsigned, but that a branch can be deleted after merging, leaving no trace as to whether its commits were signed or not.</p>
   
 

<p>Things don’t necessarily get better when signing actually occurs.</p>

 
   
    <p>Repo origin can’t be verified. Though you can verify signed commits belong to the person who currently controls a repo, there’s no way to verify that they haven’t illegitimately taken over the repo since its inception.</p>
   
   
    <p>Chain of trust functionality is non-existant. On the flipside, there’s no way to show a legitimate transfer of authority between a repo’s originator and its current controller.</p>
   
   
    <p>Key revocation is weak. Though keys can be manually revoked, there’s no way to automatically do so, and there are no warnings if a revoked key was used for signing.</p>
   
   
    <p>History can be rewritten. Finally, Git includes a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">purposeful tool</a> to allow you to rewrite commit history: editing commit messages, rebasing at a large scale, and even removing or changing files! This will change SHA-1 checksums, but as with other dangers here, there’s inadequate messaging to warn of this issue.</p>
   
 

 Solving the Problems 

<p>Solving Git’s trust issues are relatively easy in theory:</p>

 
   Repo ownership needs to be cryptographically provable back to a repo’s origin. 
   Signing needs to be required for commits and merges alike. 
   Commit history needs to be irrevocable. 
   Strong warnings are needed when these conditions aren’t met. 
 

<p>However, nothing is ever that simple in practice. To practically solve the problems required designing an Open Integrity architecture that resolved each of the highlighted problems:</p>


  
    
      Problem
      Solution
    
  
  
    
      Unverified Origin
      Inception Commit
    
    
      Unverified Transfer
      Trust Transition Commit
    
    
      Key Revocation
      Trust Transition Commit<br>Improved Logging
    
    
      Signing Not Required
      Scripted Functions<br>Defined Settings
    
    
      Merging Issues
      Scripted Functions<br>Data Preservation<br>Defined Settings
    
    
      History Issues
      Improved Logging<br>Defined Settings
    
  


<p>Here’s how each of these architectural elements work:</p>

<p>Inception Commit. An inception commit is the first commit made to a repo. It locks the repo’s inception (initial) key with an empty commit, and so secures the repo with both the SSH signature and a SHA-1 hash that’s hard to purposefully collide because of the minimalism of the commit.</p>

<p>Trust Transition Commit. Any authorized key can be used to generate a trust transition commit, which is another zero-sized commit. Additional, trusted keys can be added, and keys can also be revoked. This allows both keys and team members to change over the course of a project, which is crucial for an open-source or large-scale project. The first trust transition commit is done with the inception key; after that any authorized key can be used.</p>

<p>Improved Logging. Many of the protections of Open Integrity arise from scripts that incorporate extensive logging, ensuring that users can see that all security measures are being met. This is done with Git commit messages and with <code>git note</code>.</p>

<p>As an example, here is what the commit logging looks like for an inception commit, a trust transition commit, and a key revocation:</p>

<p>Inception Commit:</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #a3306ef [🏁 Inception Commit] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Initialize repository and establish a SHA-1 root of trust"
    ├─ Signed by: @a61TkTtL... (🏁 Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Empty: true (no files added)
    ├─ SHA-1 Protection: Constrained content + SSH signature
└─ Verification: Platform-independent
</code>   

<p>Trust Transition Commit:</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #b24d9c1 [🔑 New Allowed Commit Signers File] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Added second device key for Alice"
    ├─ Signed by: @a61TkTtL... (🏁 Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
    └─ New Authorized Commit Signers:  
        - 🏁 Inception Key explicitly not included for future commits
        - + @a61TkTtL... (Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)  
        - + @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 2 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
</code>   
<p>Key Revocation:</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #c3d7f12 [🔄 Key Rotation: Removed Alice's Second Device] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Revoked second device key"
    ├─ Signed by: @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 2 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Authorized Commit Signers changed:
        - 🗑️ @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;) is no longer authorized.
        - @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 2 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
        - @b73RkKpQ... (Bob using Work Laptop &lt;bob@example.com&gt;)  
        - @c58XmWpL... (Charlie using Home PC &lt;charlie@example.com&gt;) 
</code>   
<p>The commits also clearly show when something is done that violates the basic precepts of Open Integrity. For example:</p>
   <code>    ├─ 🚨 ERROR: Commit was signed using a previously revoked key!
</code>   

<p>Scripted Functions. Logging and the other protections of Open Integrity are available through scripts and one-line “snippet” scripts that can run from aliases. They replace the bare <code>git</code> functions with ones that ensure that each commit or merge meets all the Open Integrity requirements. For example, here’s a <code>git merge</code> alias:</p>
   <code>git merge feature-branch --verify-signatures \
    --require-author-signature \
    --require-committer-authorization
</code>   

<p>Defined Settings. Git allows settings for repos and workflows; securing these settings can improve the security of repos. <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Enforcing_Signed_Commits_And_PRs_GitHub.md">“Enforcing Signed Commits and Pull Request Requirements in GitHub”</a> describes how GitHub makes use of these settings; similar functionality is available elsewhere in the Git ecosystem.</p>

<p>Data Preservation. Logging, aliases, and settings together ensure the preservation of some data related to a merge. As the following commit shows, information such as an author’s key is preserved when a merge occurs, along with information that the committer verified the original signature.</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #fa34d76 [🔀 Merge Commit with Verified Author] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Merge feature-branch: Added authentication layer"
    ├─ Committer: @c58XmWpL... (Charlie using Home PC &lt;charlie@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Author: @e83TkLqM... (Eve using Dev Machine &lt;eve@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Author Signature: Verified ✓ (signed 2024-02-10T15:30:00Z)
    ├─ Committer Authorization: Verified ✓ (in allowed_signers since 2024-01-15)
    └─ Signatures stored: ./config/verification/signatures
</code>   
<p>The original author’s signature is not currently preserved due to the complexity of doing so. Working to preserve the signature without having to keep the branch around forever remains on the TODO list for Open Integrity.</p>

 Using Open Integrity Now 

<p>Open Integrity is available at the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject">OpenIntegrityProject repo</a>. Though it’s still in development, you can get started with it right now.</p>

<p>You should do so if you have a use case for Open Integrity such as:</p>

 
   You’re developing or releasing software through Git that holds sensitive information (such as a digital-asset wallet, a healthcare app, or even a web browser). 
   You’re developing or releasing software through Git that might be used by people or companies that also hold sensitive data (such as financial or medical companies), even if your app does not. 
   You’re developing or releasing software that requires any level of trust from its users. 
   You have a team of developers that changes over time. 
 

<p>The docs at the Open Integrity repo include a more extensive <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity_Problem_Statement.md">Problem Statement</a> that goes beyond what’s in this article, but the most important file might be the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/src/setup_git_inception_repo.sh">setup_git_inception_repo.sh</a> script, which will create a new Open Integrity repository for you. If you want to better understand how it works under the hood, see <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity-CLI_One_Liners.md">One Liners</a>, which also documents step-by-step how to setup and use an Open Integrity repo. Future plans can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/ROADMAP.md">Project Roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>Give it <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity-CLI_One_Liners.md">a try</a>, and if you have questions, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/issues">open an issue</a> or <a href="https://github.com/orgs/OpenIntegrityProject/discussions">start a conversation</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on Open Integrity for about a year now. I started this work because I thought the promise of trust implicit in Git was extremely important for software design and release, but that it needed improvement. I hope you’ll agree and find the improvements worthwhile!</p>

<p>Just days after Google confirmed it is bringing its next AI upgrade to Gmail,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/03/24/google-confirms-gmail-upgrade-3-billion-users-must-now-decide/">with major privacy implications</a>, there’s more good and bad news for the 3 billion users relying on Google to deliver secure, spam-free email to their phones and computers. It turns out that a dangerous email attack has operated under the radar for years — until now.</p>



<p>First to the good news. Google’s tightening restrictions on the mass delivery of spam emails to your inbox is working and it’s having a devastating impact on the industry spawned to plague you with marketing messages. “Over the last year,” website&nbsp;<a href="https://martech.org/apple-and-gmail-make-it-harder-for-email-campaigns-to-get-to-the-inbox/">MarTech</a>&nbsp;says the industry has seen “engagement rates (open and click rates, especially) drop considerably. Their emails only show up in the inboxes of people already engaging with the brand. For most subscribers, the emails are getting flagged as spam.”</p>

 Energy Web, WattTime, and Green Software Foundation Unveil Open-Source Carbon-Aware Nomination to Green Decentralized Computing <p>Zug, Switzerland &amp; Oakland, CA — April 3, 2025 — Energy Web, a global nonprofit building open-source Web3 technologies for the energy transition, WattTime, an environmental tech nonprofit providing real-time grid emissions data, and the Green Software Foundation (GSF) today announced the launch of Carbon-Aware Nomination, an open-source system for scheduling computing workloads based on electricity carbon-intensity. This first-of-its-kind solution leverages GSF’s Carbon-Aware SDK, blockchain technology, and live emissions data from WattTime to ensure that applications run when and where power is cleanest, drastically reducing the carbon intensity of computing workloads.</p><p>A New Standard for Carbon-Aware Compute</p><p>Carbon-Aware Nomination combines Energy Web’s decentralized computing platform with WattTime’s Automated Emissions Reduction (AER) data feeds and GSF’s Carbon-Aware SDK, allowing any batch job or flexible workload to automatically “chase” the lowest-carbon energy available. Instead of running immediately or in a fixed location, a task can be delayed or relocated — for example, executing at night in a region with abundant wind energy — with the entire decision process orchestrated and verified on the Energy Web X blockchain. Unlike traditional cloud computing tools, this system provides cryptographic proof of the carbon emissions caused, giving enterprises and developers unprecedented transparency into the sustainability of their IT operations.</p><blockquote>“Our community has been looking for ways to cut IT emissions without sacrificing performance or trust,” said Mani Hagh Sefat, CTO of Energy Web. “Carbon-Aware Nomination delivers that by leveraging decentralization. By partnering with WattTime and integrating GSF’s Carbon-Aware SDK, we’re injecting the best real-time data into an open, trustless network of computing resources. The result is a game-changer — any organization can now ensure its workloads run with the lowest possible carbon impact, and they can prove it. We’re excited to open-source this tool and work with others to scale it up; this is about creating a new norm for green computing across the industry.”</blockquote><p>Collaboration Across Climate-Tech Innovators</p><p>WattTime’s leadership echoed the significance of this collaboration.</p><blockquote>“This partnership demonstrates how data and technology can come together to fight climate change in new domains,” said Gavin McCormick, WattTime co-founder and Executive Director. “Energy Web’s innovative use of our emissions intelligence, coupled with the Green Software Foundation’s Carbon-Aware SDK, ensures that even computing workloads can automatically prioritize clean energy. We’re thrilled to see Automated Emissions Reduction principles expanding into cloud and blockchain infrastructure. By giving organizations the power to run tasks when renewables are abundant, Carbon-Aware Nomination turns climate intention into&nbsp;action.”</blockquote><blockquote>The Green Software Foundation (GSF), which has been advancing sustainability in software development, also sees this as an important milestone. “GSF’s mission is to reduce the environmental impact of software, and integrating our Carbon-Aware SDK into decentralized compute systems represents a major step toward that goal,” said Asim Hussain, Executive Director of Green Software Foundation. “By working with Energy Web and WattTime, we’re proving that sustainability can be a core part of modern computing — measurable, verifiable, and open-source.”</blockquote><p>An Open-Source Future for Climate-Smart Computing</p><p>The Carbon-Aware Nomination system is fully open-source, with documentation and developer tools provided by Energy Web. Companies and developers can integrate it into cloud workflows, decentralized applications, or scheduling software to begin reducing the carbon emissions of their operations. Because the solution runs on a public blockchain, any sustainability claims are transparent and auditable by third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>This initiative also aligns with broader efforts by the tech sector to cut emissions: recent studies estimate that data centers and networks account for over 1% of global electricity use, and industry leaders are keen to mitigate this&nbsp;impact.</p><p>By launching Carbon-Aware Nomination in collaboration with WattTime and the Green Software Foundation, Energy Web aims to foster an ecosystem of climate-smart computing. The three organizations plan to engage cloud providers, enterprises, and researchers in adopting the approach. This joint effort showcases the power of cross-sector partnerships, bringing together blockchain-based decentralization, real-time environmental intelligence, and software-driven carbon-aware scheduling.</p><p>Energy Web, WattTime, and GSF invite interested partners to join the initiative, contribute to the open-source codebase, and collectively drive a new era of sustainable digital infrastructure.</p><p>About Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p>Energy Web is a software company developing open-source technologies to accelerate the energy transition. Its decentralized solutions leverage blockchain to create innovative market mechanisms, empowering energy companies, grid operators, and businesses worldwide. (<a href="http://www.energyweb.org">www.energyweb.org</a>)</p><p>About WattTime</p><p>WattTime is an environmental tech nonprofit that empowers all people, companies, policymakers, and countries to slash emissions and choose cleaner energy.

<p>Specialists from different fields in the digital identity ecosystem have shed light on what it takes to be accredited for New Zealand’s Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF). They shared their thoughts during a webinar on March 26 moderated by the Executive Director of Digital Identity New Zealand, Colin Wallis, during which they also explained details about the process and the benefits that come with the accreditation.</p>



<p>The DISTF in New Zealand is a legal framework designed to regulate digital identity services as the country looks to expand its digital ID services. New rules and accreditation system of the DISTF&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/new-zealand-finalizes-digital-identity-services-trust-framework">took effect</a>&nbsp;last November.</p>



<p>The objective of the webinar dubbed “DISTF Evaluators Showcase” was to provide an opportunity for those considering a DISTF accreditation to have an understanding of its advantages for small and large scale entities, organizational roles, costs and time frames, and the preparation process for the evaluation of compliance with standards which precedes the accreditation application.</p>



<p>Discussants included security consultant at Middleware Group,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-norcliffe-2646061/">Tom Norcliffe</a>; Director of Cyber, Privacy and Resilience at Deloitte which is an accredited evaluator,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-bossert-02186b11/">Marcus Bossert</a>; and Founder of Cianaa Technologies,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cianaatech/">Rizwan Ahmad</a>, who are all&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity New Zealand</a>&nbsp;members. There was also the Regulatory Practice Manager of New Zealand’s Department of Internal Affairs,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deanne-myers-746628a7/">Deanne Myers</a>.</p>



<p>The first three speakers took time off to make an introduction of their companies, highlighting their services and key projects across the domains of digital identity and cybersecurity. They also mentioned some of their projects in New Zealand and the institutions they work with.</p>



<p>Bossert, for a start, explained the work Deloitte as a consultancy services firm is doing in the digital security assessment space. He mentioned that the firm offers services in cyber strategy, transformation, digital privacy, trust, and enterprise security, application cloud security, emerging technology solutions, threat detection and response, as well as operational security services. He also said that they have worked extensively on digital identity projects.</p>



<p>He said evaluation for the DISTF accreditation process looks at several factors including enterprise security, cloud security, security and resilience mechanisms, and threat detection and response, among others. The official also explained that the firm plays a significant role in guiding organizations through the accreditation process, helping them to align their cybersecurity and privacy expertise in order to ensure successful transactions.</p>



 Accreditation not a mere compliance formality 



<p>The accreditation, he insisted, is not just for the purposes of compliances but is something that enables entities demonstrate robust security practices which are vital for building confidence and trust among stakeholders such as boards, customers, and even regulators.</p>



<p>“If you think about why you want to get accredited, you’ve got to think about the stakeholders that are involved in this. But fundamentally, you have to think about it from a more practical and operational perspective as well,” Bossert said.</p>



<p>“Security, privacy, development and operations teams are really interested in knowing that you have solid security practices built in. It is quite valuable for them to understand and have clarity on what the control measures are. So, I see the accreditation process as a mechanism to build confidence that your stakeholders need,” he stated.</p>



<p>“[Thanks to] the work that we do, our knowledge and global network, we can help you accelerate readiness and navigate the shortest path to success, so that we help you focus on those things that really matter, get your accreditation and accelerate operational readiness.”</p>



<p>For his part, Norcliffe from Middleware Group emphasized the importance of the digital ID trust framework, saying it is crucial for most of the work they are doing with government entities and the private sector in New Zealand.</p>



<p>Taking the floor, Ahmad said Cianaa Technologies has a framework on which their team of independent security evaluators offer services which include penetration testing, privacy, and GDPR compliance.</p>



<p>“We assess organizations based on this [framework]. We see whether you’re keeping the information confidential, whether you have the integrity intact, whether your services are available, whether it has non-repetition, and if it has the proper authentication authorization,” he said.</p>



<p>“Now, when we assess your organization based on that, it actually automatically gives up to the right assessment, because if something is missing, then there’s something missing in security.”</p>



 Overview of accreditation application process 



<p>Myers said the team she manages is responsible for basically all aspects of the accreditation process. She gave an overview of components of the application process required by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dia.govt.nz/Trust-Framework-Authority">Trust Framework Authority</a>&nbsp;(TFA), noting that the entire process is transparent.</p>



<p>“We receive and assess applications for accreditation as a trust framework provider. We monitor ongoing compliance with the requirements of accreditation, assess applications for renewal, and obviously deal with any issues that arise in the course of these processes.”</p>



<p>She explained that a part of the application process requires results of an independent evaluation undertaken by independent evaluators, including a conformance assessment against the New Zealand identification standards. “Those outputs or deliverables will be submitted as part of an application,” she stated.</p>



<p>“There are currently 15 independent security evaluators who have been appointed and three privacy independent evaluators. However, we are currently undertaking an expression of interest process, calling for interest from other agencies who are able and who meet the criteria to be appointed as either a privacy or security evaluator, or both.”</p>



<p>Myers also shared important links and resources which can help those seeking accreditation to better understand what is required of them and how they can go through the process successfully. She also said the application would need to be submitted within 12 months of the standards compliance evaluation.</p>



 Understand what you need 



<p>The speakers also noted the place of AI in the trust framework evaluation process. Ahmad said while the technology can make a positive contribution to the process, it can also bring about challenges that effect these assessments.</p>



<p>Bossert added that those applying for accreditation must clearly understand what they need, and often, they expect the process to be as quick, painless and cost-effective as possible.</p>



<p>“If you’ve ever done something like an ISO accreditation, you would understand or know that it is very useful to be clear on the scope of accreditation that you’re looking for. So don’t apply for accreditation for areas that you don’t need. For example, if you’re not going to be providing personal information, then don’t sign up for accreditation for that,” he advised.</p>



<p>He also said for evaluators to have their work made easy, those seeking to provide trust services must take certain key factors into consideration, including having the right control and risk management mechanisms in place.</p>



<p>“I would suggest that you have a look at your solution and do a proper risk assessment early on so that you’ve got visibility of those risks and that you can start building in the necessary controls. In terms of risks, if you can demonstrate that you’re actively managing them and you have visibility and control, then that certainly helps to give the confidence needed.”</p>



<p>The aspect of pricing for the evaluation process was also addressed, with the speakers saying the process can range, approximately, from between $10,000 and $50,000, depending on the scope and the level of preparedness of the entity to be evaluated.</p>

<p>All change for Microsoft. The company has suddenly confirmed a major update “for over 1 billion end users,” as the deletion of passwords for all users becomes real.

<p></p>      First Web3 Global Battery Passport Implementation for Current and Future Regulatory Compliance           <p>Phase I of the Global Battery Passport System Demonstrated Product Traceability with Privacy-Preserving Capabilities and Selective Data Disclosure</p>
          <p>Los Angeles—31 March 2025: MOBI, a nonprofit Web3 consortium of global industry leaders, announces the successful completion of the first year in its three-year initiative to build the Global Battery Passport System (GBPS). This milestone marks a significant step in creating a secure, Self-Sovereign Identity and Data framework for seamless data spaces interoperability and digital product passports. MOBI is actively <a href="https://dlt.mobi/interoperability-pilot/">demonstrating data spaces interoperability</a> with other global consortia such as Gaia-X. While the GBPS initiative focuses on battery data exchange as its use case, the underlying technology is agnostic and can be leveraged to enhance trust, compliance, and operational efficiency for all digital transactions and traceability.</p>
<p>MOBI GBPS initiative is being spearheaded by members of the Circular Economy and the Global Battery Passport (CE-GBP) Working Group, including Anritsu, DENSO, HIOKI, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Orico, Suzuki, and TradeLog.</p>
<p>During Phase I, which took place from January to December 2024, working group members concentrated on evaluating global battery regulatory requirements and developing use cases aligned with Web3 technology for secure data exchange and management. Critically, implementers successfully launched and ran nodes on the federated<a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/"> Integrated Trust Network </a>(ITN), a member-built and operated registry for World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The ITN provides the core trust services of governance, authority, identity, and assurance to enable verifiable transactions between <a href="https://dlt.mobi/ssdi/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twins</a> (user agents) whose DIDs are anchored in the ITN.</p>
<p>Building on the success of Phase I, MOBI and its partners are now advancing to Phase II. In Phase II, implementers will leverage ITN core services to test transactions within the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/citopia/">Citopia Decentralized Marketplace</a> (DM). Anticipated technical achievements in Phase II include Web3 ecosystem onboarding, asset ownership traceability, secure data exchange, and Apps building with Citopia DM.</p>
<p>The GBPS shall operate as a specialized user-controlled application within Citopia DM, which supports secure communication, transactions, and data sharing across industries with zero-knowledge proofs. Citopia DM provides the interoperability and data sovereignty that Web3 ecosystems and value chains require. Through this setup, the GBPS shall offer a privacy-focused solution that protects proprietary information and promotes circularity in line with current and future regulations, while serving as a robust foundation for use-case-specific applications rooted in trusted and verifiable battery data, such as:</p>
 
 management of battery passports, 
 used electric vehicle (EV) pricing, 
 green financing and carbon credits, 
 charging management, and more. 
 
<p>While most battery passport solutions focus on public data disclosure, Citopia GBPS emphasizes secure sharing of proprietary data. The GBPS leverages zero trust architecture and selective data disclosure, where only relevant information is shared with intended recipients. This privacy-centric design facilitates regulatory compliance while safeguarding sensitive data, reducing the need for intermediaries and enhancing trust across value chains, creating a Web3 system for data spaces interoperability across borders and stakeholders.</p>
<p>“As current and future regulations develop, solutions like the ITN and Citopia DM are essential for addressing industry and regulatory needs. MOBI is proud to work with our members in developing a solution that is agnostic to existing data spaces along with Web2&lt;&gt;Web3 interoperability to support business objectives in creating a more secure digital future and meeting circular economy goals,” said Tram Vo, CEO and Co-founder of MOBI.</p>
<p>“A global battery passport system has the potential to unlock new levels of traceability, transparency and security in battery-related applications, supporting our efforts to contribute to greener and safer mobility,” said Roger Berg, vice president of North America Research and Development at DENSO. “While that’s an important goal for our team, this solution also represents more than that. It’s a great example of how MOBI and our fellow members are working together to support a more circular economy and sustainable world.”</p>
<p>“The second stage of Phase I has provided further valuable insights to CE-GBP WG partners. In Stage 1, the basic data sharing environment was established. In Stage 2, the first business-related technical capabilities were explored, such as the ownership management of a DID-based asset and the selective disclosure of data between two organizations,” said Christian Köbel of Honda. “These successful learnings have encouraged us to further explore the potential of a self-sovereign data ecosystem to address future challenges of the circular economy.”</p>
<p>“The functionality of DIDs and Verifiable Credentials for reliable data federation among implementing companies has been successfully verified, utilizing the Integrated Trust Network. This endeavor not only demonstrates the potential of these technologies to enhance data federation but also emphasizes the constructive and agile collaboration achieved among implementers within the cooperative framework.” said Yusuke Zushi, Senior Manager at Nissan.</p>
<p>“In Phase 1 of the Global Battery Passport (GBP) system demonstration, we learned that the MOBI GBP can be used to exchange highly confidential information. We want to thank everyone involved in Phase 1,” said implementers at Mazda Motor Corporation.</p>
<p>Said Hisashi Matsumoto of Anritsu, “MOBI’s activities have led to the successful completion of Phase I, moving towards building an ecosystem that enables reliable and secure information exchange. We are grateful to have participated in the verification of use cases with practical operations. We hope that MOBI’s efforts will continue to contribute to a more sustainable circular economy.”</p>
<p>“We are very proud of the great results of Phase I which we have achieved based on our strong relationships with major OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and more. It has been an exciting and interesting experience to work with such talented people. We will continue to take on challenges in Phase II in the name of collaboration,” said Alvin Ishiguro, Project Coordination at TradeLog, Inc.</p>
<p>MOBI and its members are committed to driving a future where collaborative, decentralized technologies foster innovation and transparency across industries.</p>

<p>This white paper is part of a three-part series on preventing phishing attacks through passkey deployment:</p>



 
 Part 1: Overview – Introduces the concepts of a passkey journey toward phishing prevention. 



 Part 2: Partial prevention – Details strategies for enforcing passkeys in specific scenarios. 



 Part 3: Full prevention – Explains how to achieve comprehensive phishing resistance. 
 



<p>Making your services phishing-resistant takes more than one day because you are not just adopting a new phishing-resistant authentication method. It is a journey with multiple stages where you improve security by strengthening account login and recovery processes. This paper outlines the passkey journey and defines the authentication and recovery requirements for each stage.</p>



 Audience 



<p>Relying parties and developers who want to protect their applications from phishing attacks by adopting passkeys.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>A Farewell Message<br><br>This is the final DINZ newsletter under my watch, but if the writing style seems familiar in April’s newsletter you’ll know that AI has been deployed or my successor hasn’t been fully onboarded&nbsp;.<br><br>It’s been a blast, it really has! I’m satisfied with DINZ’s development under my tenure. No regrets. DINZ has punched way above its weight with minimal resources – only made possible by larger organisations whose support enabled volunteer members and supporters from organisations of all sizes to dedicate time and expertise to deliver our mahi on its&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/about/">mission</a>. You know who you are, so thank you!&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks also to the DINZ Executive Councils I have served over the years. It’s a largely unheralded gig, but governance in emerging ecosystems is crucial.<br><br>DINZ Updates</p>



 
 The&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/biometrics-special-interest-group-sig/">DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group</a>&nbsp;submitted again on the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2025/03/DINZ_Submission_on_Biometrics_Code_of_Practice_March_2025-CW-signed.pdf">Biometrics Code of Practice</a>&nbsp;this month. Neither DINZ or NZTech are supportive of the code at this time, instead advocating for expert prepared Guidance to improve biometrics implementation best practice for all stakeholders, including privacy specialists who may not necessarily be biometric experts. 



 By the time you read this, our webinar&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/distf-evaluators-showcase/">‘Meet the DISTF Evaluators’&nbsp;</a>will be underway with over 100 registrations – the first educational session on this aspect of the regime as DINZ members enter the final week of&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/educational-resources/">free access to InformDI’s 7 Chapters DISTF online education suite.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; 



 DINZ members&nbsp;please complete the DISTF survey emailed to you by 14 April. 



 The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/our-work/next-generation-payments/">Next Gen Payments Consultation</a>&nbsp;from DINZ member PaymentsNZ is due this Friday, so get yours in today!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 



<p><br>Industry Insights<br><br>There are some ‘green shoots’ appearing in Aotearoa New Zealand’s digital identity space, but we have years of catch-up ahead to regain our global leadership. We have to be more nimble, smart and collegial in all dimensions (detailed examples too much for the newsletter’s word count), but suffice to say that it’s Kiwi companies like MATTR, Authsignal, JNCTN, APLYiD, MyMahi and others that keep us on the map globally.<br><br>While taking more leisure time, I’m open to some advisory work leveraging my decades of knowledge, experience and contact networks in both local and international settings not often possible in this role.&nbsp;<br><br>What’s Happening Around the Globe<br><br>As always, I’m sharing links to global news that resonated with me.</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202503/passkeys-for-enterprise-report-from-fido-says-adoption-is-growing">Passkey adoption is growing globally</a>&nbsp;– no surprise to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authsignal.com/">Authsignal</a>&nbsp;who have secured business on nearly all continents in the past few weeks. 



 <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202503/tailored-biometric-systems-tests-lay-the-foundation-for-trust-biometrics-labs">This article</a>&nbsp;argues the case for local biometrics software testing and resonates exactly with DINZ’s Kiwi faces dataset project that requires stakeholder support before it can proceed. 



 DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/nec-facial-recognition-takes-top-score-in-half-of-latest-nist-1n-test-categories">NEC takes top score in the offshore tests that are available</a>. 



 I found recent pundit Jamie Smith’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/biggest-identity-market-one-youve-never-heard-jamie-smith--ksz9e?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;utm_campaign=share_via">post on the fraud market&nbsp;</a>quite thought provoking, although I don’t fully agree with him that Organisational Identity has been under a shadow. In NZ it’s not helped by agency responsibilities being split between MBIE and DIA. 



 OI forms a major plank of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.getverified.co.nz/">Get Verified</a>&nbsp;in the payments world but there are other worlds of course. 



 That brings me to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jamiedsmith_customerfutures-empowermenttech-activity-7308046049841930241-AH5F/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAAAC64Z4BsBpUlqet58BkfzAhb574r2zYOTA">another Jamie Smith post</a>&nbsp;on Edeleman’s Trust Barometer (in the comments) where Aotearoa’s own Āhau gets a mention.&nbsp; 



 &nbsp;And for those technical and following mDL&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chrisgoh_mdl-vc-mdoc-activity-7305214876644216834-joK9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAC64Z4BsBpUlqet58BkfzAhb574r2zYOTA">this link</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chrisgoh_github-isowg10iso-18013-activity-7305201788515729409-ymML?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAC64Z4BsBpUlqet58BkfzAhb574r2zYOTA">this link</a>&nbsp;show just how quickly this space is evolving and maturing. 
 



<p>Final Thoughts<br><br>That’s it! Make sure you do something ‘identiful’ in April or attend the regional virtual catch ups on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/event/identity-management-day-2025">Identity Management Day</a>&nbsp;and I’ll see you all soon out there in cyber.</p>

<p>On 21 January 2025, the Swiss Federal Office of Justice (FOJ), in collaboration with the Federal Chancellery and the Federal Office of Information Technology and Telecommunications (FOITT), published an important <a>statement on the future of digital identity and trust infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p>As DIDAS – the Swiss association for digital trust – we are proud to have actively contributed to this milestone. Through constructive consultation, cross-sector collaboration and the sharing of insights from our community, we helped shape the direction of this foundational work. A special thank you goes to our co-authors and all those who support this joint effort.</p>
<p>Digital trust infrastructure – such as the E-ID, verifiable credentials, and interoperable wallets – is essential for the digital resilience and competitiveness of Switzerland. These are not just technological building blocks, but key enablers of a sovereign, secure and citizen-centric digital society.</p>
<p>This milestone also directly connects with the recently published vision by FIND and the State Secretariat for International Finance (SIF):<br>👉 <a href="https://find.swiss/announcements/pathway-2035-for-financial-innovation">Pathway 2035: Unlocking Financial Innovation for Switzerland</a></p>
<p>The message is clear: Switzerland’s ability to lead in financial innovation depends on a trusted digital foundation. At DIDAS, we are committed to&nbsp;enabling&nbsp;this foundation – bringing together policy, technology, and ecosystem actors to reduce friction, build interoperability, and establish trust by design.</p>
<p>Because in the end, Digital Trust is not a nice-to-have – it is a strategic imperative for Switzerland’s future.</p>
<p>Digital Trust is now firmly positioned on Switzerland’s strategic, political, and economic agenda.</p>

<p>At ISL we pride ourselves on being dispassionate truth-seekers when it comes to assessing risky behaviors in technology. But this moment in history requires expressing our passion for truth and our core values more openly.</p>
<p>What’s currently happening in the US is, by design, disruptive, disorienting, and discouraging for many. The calculated dehumanizing of trans people and immigrants coupled with the TESCREAL eugenics AI agenda elucidated by Timnit Gebru<a>1</a>  foretells a worrying, broader dehumanization campaign ahead. As does the ongoing systematic removal and censorship of any kind of diversity, trans rights or related language on government sites. These actions inexorably lead to the detention and removal of targeted people, which, sadly, has begun.</p>
<p>This moment calls for pausing, ignoring the external chaos and looking within, to our own guiding north stars and speaking out for the values within us that reflect deep truths. Deep truths such as: love and celebration of diversity being vital for both humankind’s and the planet’s survival; it’s certainly vital for the work that we do every day at ISL.</p>
<p>Diversity, equity, and inclusivity are the way. Any other exclusionary, reductive, oppressive, dehumanizing way is antithetical to the truths of human kinship and interdependence and denies the reality that healthy ecosystems need diversity to sustain and thrive.</p>
<p>ISL exposes safety risks inherent in tech when used as intended. In other words, we’ve been establishing reasonable safety standards for the behavior of software-driven products and services. But how can we contemplate “safety” without the necessary question: “for whom?”</p>
<p>Many people think that ISL is solely focused on the safety of tech used by children. It may surprise you to know that that’s not our mission. It’s the brunt of our currently funded work, but our corporate vision is:</p>
<p>“A world where all digital products are safe for humans and humankind.”</p>
<p>In other words, safety for all. </p>
<p>I take this moment to reaffirm ISL’s commitment to prioritizing and fostering conditions to create a truly diverse, inclusive, and equitable organization.</p>

 <p>Recent developments in the UK have once again highlighted the importance of user-controlled encryption for protecting personal data. Due to government demands in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617273/apple-removes-encryption-advanced-data-protection-adp-uk-spying-backdoor?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Apple has recently announced</a> that they have stopped offering end-to-end encrypted iCloud storage, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), to new users, and will disable the feature to all users in the country at an unknown point in the future.</p><p>What does this mean for you?&nbsp;</p><p>In the short term it means that UK user data is less protected, and potentially vulnerable to misuse or breaches. Without end-to-end encryption (E2EE), data stored in iCloud is accessible to Apple and, by extension, potentially to government agencies and bad actors. In the long term it sets a dangerous precedent that Apple can turn off this crucial security feature for any group of users at any time, raising concerns about digital privacy worldwide.</p><p>What can we do about it?</p><p>The answer is relatively simple, we need to encrypt our own data.&nbsp;</p><p>Relying on a third party to keep our personal data safe — even big names like Apple, Amazon, or Microsoft — will always carry risk. Policies change, and external governmental pressures can force providers to weaken security measures, leaving the user exposed.</p><p>By layering End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) on cloud storage services ourselves, we can ensure that our data is protected from unwanted access, even from the storage services themselves (in case they want to mine the content of our data).</p><p>And the best part? We can do it for free by using DIDComm!</p><p>What is DIDComm?</p><p>One powerful and open-source solution for encrypting data before cloud storage is the <a href="https://didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm</a> protocol. Hosted by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), DIDComm provides a secure, private communication methodology built on Decentralized Identifiers (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDs</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>When used to establish an end-to-end encrypted channel, DIDComm ensures that only essential delivery metadata remains in plaintext, while everything else — including the body, attachments, etc — is encrypted for intended recipients only. In practice, this means that we can use the DIDComm message format to encrypt files as they are prepared to be synchronized from a local folder to the cloud storage service and ensures that only the intended recipient (you) can access them.</p><p>How to use DIDComm for cloud encryption</p><p>Steve McCown, Chief Architect at Anonyome Labs, was the first to create a practical method for encrypting files with DIDComm before storing them into the cloud. His recent <a href="https://github.com/mccown/protecting-cloud-storage?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">GitHub release</a> provides a thorough breakdown of how it all works and offers a step-by-step guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For those looking to dive deeper,&nbsp;</p>  Join one of our upcoming DIDComm <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-usergroup/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">user group calls</a>   Join the discussion on <a href="https://discord.gg/eNN4Wns6Jb?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF’s Discord</a> in the #didcomm-user-group channel

<p>This certification allows the company to assess and validate identity verification vendors’ Document Authenticity and Face Verification solutions, contributing to fraud prevention efforts while ensuring compliance with industry standards.</p>



 Growing concerns over deepfakes drive standardisation&nbsp; 



<p>The introduction of FIDO’s IDV Programme comes in the context of increasing concerns about AI-driven fraud. According to the official press release, despite over 70 billion digital identity verification checks conducted in 2024, more than half of users remain worried about the risks posed by deepfakes and other fraudulent activities. The programme establishes a unified accreditation process to ensure remote identity verification solutions are secure and resistant to manipulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from Fime stated that remote identity verification is essential for sectors such as banking and digital ID enrolment, given the rapid advancements in deepfake technology. The official highlighted the importance of FIDO IDV Certification in helping service providers ensure that their vendors deliver reliable, validated solutions capable of protecting users and mitigating risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Officials from the FIDO Alliance emphasised that the certification programme is designed to strengthen security during onboarding and enrolment processes. They noted that, alongside biometric component certification, this initiative aims to reduce reliance on traditional passwords while enhancing security and user experience.</p>

<p>87% of companies have, or are in the midst of, rolling out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/08/15/david-cottingham-rf-ideas-implementing-passkeys/">passkeys</a>&nbsp;with goals tied to improved user experience, enhanced security, and compliance, according to the FIDO Alliance.</p>



 Key findings 



<p>Enterprises understand the value of passkeys for workforce sign-ins. Most decision makers (87%) report deploying passkeys at their companies. Of these, 47% report rolling out a mix of device-bound passkeys (on physical security keys and/or cards) and synced passkeys (synced securely across the user’s devices).</p>



<p>Organizations are prioritizing passkey rollouts to users with access to sensitive data and applications, including the three most commonly cited priority groups: Those requiring access to IP (39%), users with admin accounts (39%), and users at the executive level (34%). Organizations leverage communication, training, and documentation within these deployments to increase adoption.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/06/20/julianna-lamb-stytch-passwordless-authentication-methods/">Passkey deployments</a>&nbsp;are linked to significant security and business benefits. Respondents report moderate to strong positive impacts on user experience (82%), security (90%), help center call reduction (77%), productivity (73%), and digital transformation goals (83%).</p>



<p>Groups that do not have active passkey projects cite complexity (43%), costs (33%), and lack of clarity (29%) about implementation as reasons. This signals a need for increased education for enterprises on rollout strategies to reduce concerns, as there is a correlation between these perceived challenges and the proven benefits of passkeys.</p>

<p>Submitted by: Joni Brennan, President</p>



<p>List of recommendations</p>



<p>Recommendation 1: That the government prioritize digital trust in four areas critical to Canada’s leadership and the privacy, security and protection of our people and industries, including:</p>



 
 Digital Trust in Small and Medium Sized Businesses (SMBs) and E-Commerce; 



 Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory; 



 Digital Trust in Public Sector Modernization and Citizen Services; and 



 Digital Trust in Public Safety. 
 



<p>Recommendation 2: That the government recognize the necessity of embracing and prioritizing verification and authentication tools as part of its AI strategy.</p>



<p>Recommendation 3: That the government allocate the funding needed to support the adoption of digital trust tools to the benefit of government, businesses, and citizens alike.</p>



<p>Introduction</p>



<p>In today’s geopolitical and economic climate, Canada needs to urgently act to maximize economic security, growth and productivity — all of which depend on a foundation of trust. In an era where digital transactions drive commerce, investment, and public services, ensuring the authenticity of identities, data, and financial interactions is essential for stability and long-term success.</p>



<p>Without secure and privacy-respecting verification, businesses face higher fraud risks, increased compliance costs, and reduced consumer confidence. Investors and trading partners demand transparent, verifiable transactions and economic resilience, which depend on our ability to safeguard financial systems, facilitate secure trade, and unlock the full potential of AI-driven innovation. Strong verification systems are also key to removing barriers to interprovincial and international trade, ensuring Canadian businesses can compete in global markets with trusted credentials.</p>



<p>Yet, new threats to economic stability are emerging at an unprecedented pace. The spread of misinformation, AI-generated fraud, and identity theft undermines business operations, weakens consumer confidence, and creates vulnerabilities in financial markets. AI enables the rapid manipulation of information and identities, making it more difficult for organizations to verify legitimacy and protect against fraud.</p>



<p>Without urgent action, these challenges will erode trust, slow economic growth, disrupt financial systems, and weaken Canada’s competitive position. Labour mobility is also at risk—without trusted digital credentials, skilled professionals such as doctors, engineers, and tradespeople face delays in moving where needed most, affecting both businesses and public services.</p>



<p>Canada can drive economic security, labour mobility and digital trust by strengthening identity verification, authentication, and fraud prevention measures. By prioritizing trust as a national asset, we can enhance economic competitiveness, attract investment, and build a future where innovation thrives in a secure and resilient digital environment.</p>



<p>About DIACC</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) was created following the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review, with a goal to bring together public and private sector partners in developing a safe and secure digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>DIACC is committed to accelerating digital trust adoption and reducing information authenticity uncertainty by certifying services against its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework — a risk mitigation and assurance framework developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts that signals trustworthy design rooted in security, privacy, inclusivity, accessibility, and accountability.</p>



<p>Recommendations</p>



<p>Against this backdrop, DIACC offers three recommendations for the federal government:</p>



<p>Recommendation 1: That the government prioritize digital trust in four areas critical to Canada’s leadership and the privacy, security and protection of our people and industries, including:</p>



 
 Digital Trust in Small and Medium Sized Businesses (SMBs) and E-Commerce; 



 Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory; 



 Digital Trust in Public Sector Modernization and Citizen Services; and 



 Digital Trust in Public Safety.  
 



<p>Digital Trust in Small and Medium Sized Businesses (SMBs) and E-Commerce</p>



<p>Canada’s e-commerce sector is growing faster than ever due to emerging technology and changing customer habits. While this creates significant opportunities, it also presents challenges for small and medium businesses (SMBs), their partners, and customers. With a significant amount of business happening online, SMBs must navigate a growing competitive landscape of online security risks and earn customer trust to help unlock interprovincial and international growth opportunities. By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can foster a robust e-commerce environment that empowers SMBs, enhances consumer confidence, and boosts economic growth. Interoperable frameworks such as the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) foster digital trust by protecting personal electronic information as it travels across an organization, ensuring that e-commerce systems remain secure, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust and implementing authentication and verification tools, the government can help drive the following benefits:</p>



 
 enhanced customer trust and loyalty; 



 streamlined business processes by automating identity verification and reducing the need for manual checks; 



 faster, more efficient operations and reduced administrative costs, allowing businesses to allocate resources more effectively; 



 data minimization and the secure handling of personal information, increasing customer confidence; 



 a competitive advantage for Canada’s SMBs by helping them innovate and offer their customers new, secure digital services; and 



 a reduction in incidents of fraud, resulting in significant cost savings for businesses. These savings can be reinvested into other business areas, driving growth and innovation and improving overall business performance.  
 



<p>Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory</p>



<p>The finance and regulatory sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation. While the industry pioneers new technology and moves away from conventional platforms, it faces rising fraud, privacy breaches, and growing consumer skepticism fueled by misinformation, disinformation, and challenges verifying information in an AI-driven world. As a result, the government is encouraged to build on the existing regulatory framework and develop new regulations to facilitate secure digital transactions, including compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.</p>



<p>Further, digital trust and verification services will be critical as the government moves forward with its commitments to open-banking, with interoperability also being paramount as the federal framework and existing provincial frameworks work together. Similarly, the government has committed to reducing incidents of mortgage fraud and strengthening proof of borrower and title insurance, and digital trust and verification services can and should play a critical role in making that commitment a reality.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can secure its financial systems and enhance competitiveness in the global economy. Interoperable frameworks like the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) ensure systems remain resilient, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Public Sector Modernization and Citizen Services</p>



<p>Public services are undergoing rapid digital transformation, adopting new technologies to improve efficiency and accessibility. At the same time, they face significant challenges and barriers including data security risks, privacy concerns, and public skepticism fueled by misinformation.</p>



<p>As public services continue to move online, digital trust and verification services will be critical for ensuring that services are secure and accessible. From online healthcare consultations to digital government services, these technologies provide the necessary security infrastructure to protect public interactions and data.</p>



<p>By implementing digital trust solutions, the federal government will be able to provide secure, user-friendly online access to services; streamline identity verification for faster service delivery; facilitate seamless data sharing between agencies; reduce administrative burdens and operational costs; and improve service delivery times and citizen satisfaction.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Public Safety</p>



<p>The public safety sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation, embracing new technologies to enhance emergency response, law enforcement, and disaster management. However, this shift also brings challenges such as data security risks, privacy concerns, and the need for reliable information verification in critical situations.</p>



<p>Implementing robust digital trust solutions can significantly improve emergency response by enabling secure, real-time data sharing between agencies; verifying the authenticity of emergency communications; and facilitating rapid and accurate identification of individuals in crisis situations.</p>



<p>Public safety agencies are encouraged to leverage technologies such as AI and blockchain to enhance their digital trust capabilities and improve emergency response. AI can be used for real-time data analysis and decision-making, while blockchain can ensure the integrity and immutability of critical information.</p>



<p>DIACC encourages collaboration between public safety agencies, technology providers, and other stakeholders to develop standardized digital trust practices, and interoperable frameworks like the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) ensure that public safety systems remain secure, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



<p>Together we can create a public safety ecosystem that leverages digital trust to protect citizens, respects privacy, and solidifies Canada’s position as a secure and effective emergency management leader.</p>



<p>Recommendation 2: That the government recognize the necessity of embracing and prioritizing verification and authentication tools as part of its AI strategy.</p>



<p>In today’s world, where AI is becoming smarter every day, and information can be generated and manipulated at unprecedented speed and scale, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of information is critical. It is vital to maximize the benefits of an AI and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-fueled data ecosystem for Canada while also fostering citizen trust and protecting their safety.</p>



<p>To effectively address the challenges we’re facing while realizing the benefits of AI, the federal government should prioritize verification and authentication tools as part of its broader AI strategy. Prioritization must include funding, collaboration, and urgent action to support the development, adoption and certification of tools that verify information authenticity while protecting privacy and empowering Canadians. Governments, banks, telcos, tech companies, media organizations, and civil society must work together to deploy open, standards-based solutions and services to verify the authenticity of information.</p>



<p>The economic imperative of investing in these capabilities is clear. According to a <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/services/consulting/perspectives/generative-ai-in-finance.html">study</a> by Deloitte, the Canadian economy could unlock an additional 7 per cent (CAD $7 trillion) in economic value through AI and AGI technologies. People and organizations can only realize this potential for the good of society by investing in tools, processes, and policies that support verifying the authenticity of the information generated and processed by AI and AGI technologies.</p>



<p>Recommendation 3: That the government allocate the funding needed to support the adoption of digital trust tools to the benefit of government, businesses, and citizens alike.</p>



<p>Today, solutions can signal verified trust by getting certified against a technology-neutral risk and assurance framework like DIACC’s Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts.</p>



<p>Verifiable information authenticity relies on critical principles, including provenance and traceability: provenance establishes the origin and history of information, ensuring it comes from a reliable source, while traceability allows for audibility of the flow of information, enabling people, businesses, and governments to verify its accuracy and authenticity. These principles are essential in combating the spread of misinformation and disinformation, which can have far-reaching consequences in an AI-fueled world.</p>



<p>Provenance and traceability are potent information authenticity tools that can help:</p>



 
 businesses and professionals reduce liabilities and meet obligations to verify information about their clients and their operations; 



 citizens and residents interact securely and efficiently with governments; 



 customers and clients transact with privacy and security anywhere, anytime; 



 industries manage decision-making and securely supply chains using trusted data; 



 producers verify essential data related to environmental, safety, and operational goals and 



 creators track intellectual property to ensure fair payment and cultural protection. 
 



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>A proactive approach—rooted in collaboration between government, industry, and technology leaders—will ensure that Canada remains a trusted hub for global trade, seamless labour mobility, and secure financial transactions. We can unlock new economic opportunities, strengthen international partnerships, and fuel long-term prosperity by enabling frictionless and verifiable trade, business, and employment interactions.</p>



<p>Thank you once again for the opportunity to provide our input in advance of Budget 2025 and as we collectively move forward on the path to a digitally and economically prosperous Canada.</p>

<p>Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping the Internet, driving a historic transformation in how we engage, work, and communicate online.</p><p>However, the rise of generative AI has also led to an explosion of deepfakes, hallucinating language models, and the rapid creation of untrustworthy content — threatening the foundation of authentic communication and learning. AI-generated content now dominates the internet, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish reality from fabrication.</p><p>While AI unlocks significant advancements, it also introduces equally substantial risks, from intellectual property infringements to illegal content, such as child sexual abuse materials.</p><p>It is for this reason, we founded umanitek.</p><p>At umanitek, our mission is to fight against harmful content and the risks of AI by promoting technology that serves the greater good of humanity.</p><p>Our founders, Trace Labs, Ethical Capital Partners and AMYP Ventures AG (part of a Piëch/Porsche Family Office) bring together their capabilities in building reliable and trusted AI systems, their connection to networks that fight for the removal of internet harm, and their ability to raise awareness of the importance of knowledge and education in the age of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>But this is too big of a challenge to go at it alone. Recognizing the magnitude of this issue, we actively seek partnerships with institutions and individuals dedicated to ethical AI development. We want to partner with investors who are focused on “tech for good” solutions where societal impact is of equal importance to commercial success and to work with tech leaders, policymakers, and law enforcement to make internet safety the standard in the age of&nbsp;AI.</p> Balancing innovation with responsibility in the age of&nbsp;AI. <p>Our vision is to leverage umanitek’s technology to enable corporations and individuals to control their data, technology, and resources without compromising security, privacy, or intellectual property.</p><p>Here’s but one quick example of how umanitek will&nbsp;work.</p><p>Far too many people are concerned about the non-consensual sharing of their personal images or those of their children. Umanitek will enable companies, law enforcement, NGOs, and individuals to upload “fingerprints” of personal photos to a decentralized directory. This system will help large technology platforms identify and prevent the distribution of such&nbsp;content.</p><p>In the potential next step, it also significantly streamlines the prosecution of offenders by collaborating with law enforcement while reducing the cost and complexity of legal action related to copyright infringements.</p><p>When organizations and individuals can choose what to share and how to share it in a secure and verifiable way, all internet users benefit. Protecting legitimate content and preventing large language models from training on non-consensual data are integral to harm reduction online. We believe this is an important step to making internet safety the standard in the age of AI, reducing harmful content, and enabling trusted AI solutions.</p><p>Fighting the good&nbsp;fight.</p><p>“We invested in OriginTrail to drive transparency and trust for real-world assets. Now, we’ve co-founded umanitek to combat harmful content, IP infringements, and fake news — leveraging OriginTrail technology across internet platforms.”</p><p>— Chris Rynning, AMYP Ventures AG (part of a Piëch/Porsche Family&nbsp;Office)</p> An unprecedented alliance for ethical&nbsp;AI. <p>Umanitek stands out by combining the expertise of three leaders in their&nbsp;fields:</p><p>Trace Labs (core developers of OriginTrail) — The pioneers of neuro-symbolic AI, building trusted and verifiable AI systems. They are the developers behind the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), a technology that enhances trust in AI, supply chains, and global data ecosystems.</p><p>Ethical Capital Partners (ECP) — A private equity firm seeking out investment and advisory opportunities in industries that require principled ethical leadership. Founded in 2022 by a multi-disciplinary team with legal, regulatory, law enforcement, public engagement, and finance experience, ECP’s philosophy is rooted in identifying companies amenable to a responsible investment approach and working collaboratively with management teams in order to develop strategies to create value and drive&nbsp;growth.</p><p>AMYP Ventures AG (part of a Piëch/Porsche Family Office) — A venture capital group backing game-changing AI and Web3 initiatives with the potential for global&nbsp;impact.</p><p>This is a collaboration that combines the knowledge of AI, cutting-edge research, and technology with ethical investment strategies to create the standard for internet safety in the age of AI — an AI solution that will serve humanity.</p><p>Subscribe for updates at <a href="http://umanitek.ai">umanitek.ai</a> to stay in touch and be among the first to learn about cofounders, contributors, and partners of umanitek, as well as reserve a spot to test-drive umanitek’s products at their&nbsp;release.</p><p><a href="http://umanitek.ai">Web </a>| <a href="https://x.com/umanitek">Twitter </a>|&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/umanitek">LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/umanitek-setting-the-standard-for-internet-safety-cd5a91f142f3">UMANITEK: Setting the standard for internet safety</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 As global electricity demand soars and renewable energy expands, the IEA highlights the urgent need for digital solutions to optimize grid flexibility. Here’s how Energy Web’s Digital Spine can&nbsp;help <p>The International Energy Agency recently released two reports: <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/0f028d5f-26b1-47ca-ad2a-5ca3103d070a/Electricity2025.pdf">its annual Electricity 2025</a> analysis and a discussion of current <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/6fbf940a-d4e8-4156-b8e0-07c2f793c094/BuildingtheFutureTransmissionGrid.pdf">challenges in grid investment</a>. These documents describe two key aspects of the global energy transition: global demand for electricity is increasing, and new renewables (including distributed energy resources) are expected to be the greatest contributor to new supply that meets it. If you dig a bit deeper, you can also see why the electricity system needs a Digital Spine, Energy Web’s solution to optimize grid flexibility and unlock the potential of&nbsp;DERs.</p> The energy transition continues <p>The IEA forecasts “soaring” electricity demand over the next three years. Most of this increase will occur in developing economies, but advanced economies are expected to see increasing demand as well, driven by electric vehicle adoption, new air conditioners, heat pumps, and (especially in the U.S.) new data&nbsp;centers.</p><p>This new demand will be met by new low-carbon generation. The IEA expects fully half of the new demand to be met by solar PV, the cost of which continues to&nbsp;decline.</p> But progress increases complexity <p>It is undoubtedly excellent news that low-carbon generation will meet new demand, but the IEA cautions that power systems need to further adapt to the changing fuel mix on our grids. A combination of traditional thermal plants that are relatively inflexible, new renewable generation that is variable, and new demand patterns (e.g., more air conditioning demand on hot days and more electric vehicle charging on workday evenings) result in higher volatility in power&nbsp;markets.</p><p>We already see these impacts. The Electricity 2025 report describes the increasing incidence of negative prices in wholesale electricity markets, which occurs when supply outsizes demand so significantly that market-clearing prices fall below zero. This can happen for any number of reasons, but as the energy transition continues we would expect to see it happen more frequently in areas where afternoon solar generation could far exceed air conditioning demand (think massive amounts of rooftop and utility-scale solar) or overnight wind generation is greater than nearby transmission capacity.</p><p>Negative pricing events are most common in the regions of the world that are furthest along the energy transition, including Australia, California, and Texas (three places with very high solar PV or Wind penetration).</p>Percentage of negative hourly wholesale electricity prices in selected regions, 2019–2024 (IEA)<p>Negative price events are not in themselves a problem; however, they are noteworthy because they suggest real challenges in power system operations, which will only increase as the energy transition continues.</p> Physical infrastructure improvements will be insufficient <p>One strategy to address these challenges is to increase investments in electric grids. This means increasing transmission capacity and upgrading other physical infrastructure in order to reduce constraints that contribute to negative pricing: if one location has more power supply than demand, simply ship the excess to a location that can use it (yes, we recognize that this simplified description glosses over the complexities of constrained dispatch, but it remains true that increasing capacity in an appropriately-planned way will reduce the impacts of system constraints).</p><p>Unfortunately, the IEA does not think such new investments will be sufficient, or at least not sufficiently fast:</p><p>Around 1.5 million kilometres of new transmission lines have been built worldwide over the last decade, but inadequate transmission remains major constraint on power system development, electrification and energy security. Among other issues, grid infrastructure has struggled to keep pace with the rate at which new renewable sources are entering the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Their report describes several reasons for this, including supply chain bottlenecks and permitting delays — problems that are unlikely to recede in an era of increasing trade protectionism.</p> Managing power systems requires new ways to provide flexibility <blockquote>So if new transmission is insufficient, what is the solution? The IEA offers its perspective: “Optimising the use of existing grid infrastructure through digital technologies enhances efficiency and maximises the use of existing assets, providing a safety valve for networks and supply&nbsp;chains”</blockquote><p>This is precisely what our <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/electricity">Digital Spine</a> solution does: facilitate integration of DERs to allow grid operators and market participants to efficiently, fairly, and securely operate the grid. It can wring cost savings out of existing operational processes or even allow new market configurations that until now have not been feasible.</p><p>As an example of the latter, we implemented our Digital Spine solution in Australia as part of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO)’s Project Edge. In that project, AEMO and market participants demonstrated a new approach to integrating DERs into both transmission- and distribution-level operations: a two-sided market based on dynamic operating envelopes. An <a href="https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/initiatives/der/2023/project-edge-independent-cba-full-report.pdf?la=en">independent cost-benefit analysis</a> found that implementing this approach could save consumers AU$5–6 billion over twenty years, and that the savings would accrue to both consumers with DERs and those without them. A separate independent technology and cybersecurity assessment found that the Digital Spine as the underlying data exchange was more scalable, stable, resilient, flexible, and secure than traditional point-to-point or centralized approaches.</p><p>If you or your organization are looking to increase your network’s efficiency and unlock the full potential of DERs, please see our <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/electricity">Digital Spine</a> webpage for more information or to <a href="http://www.energyweb.org">contact&nbsp;us</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/why-the-grid-needs-a-digital-spine-insights-from-the-international-energy-agency-37922de54b3f">Why the Grid Needs a Digital Spine: Insights from the International Energy Agency</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 1. Overview 
<p>In 2024, Internet Safety Labs (ISL) added 3rd parties observed in app network traffic to our app Safety Labels viewable in <a href="https://appmicroscope.org/">AppMicroscope.org</a>. Recently, we reviewed the network traffic of the original 1541 apps, looking for data brokers and the results were clear: 16% apps that were recommended or required in schools were sending student data to registered data brokers. Every state (and District of Columbia) had at least three or more schools with apps communicating with data brokers. In total, 442 of the 663 (or 67%) studied schools had apps with data broker traffic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Importantly, “registered” data brokers don’t count apps sending data to platforms destined for data brokers, nor does it include entities that should be registered data brokers but aren’t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This report details our findings and analysis on Edtech apps observed communicating with data brokers, as well as our recommendations for educators and app developers. &nbsp;</p>
 1.1 The Inadequacy of “Data Broker” Legal Definitions&nbsp; 
<p>This analysis counts only registered data brokers found in either the <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/data_broker_registry/">California Data Broker Registry</a> or the <a href="https://bizfilings.vermont.gov/databrokersearch/Search">Vermont Data Broker Registry</a>.<a>1</a> Readers should be aware that the legal definition of “data broker” in the US fails to properly account for and hold responsible the full data supply chain feeding data brokers. Specifically, it fails to include:&nbsp;</p>
 
 First parties who sell personal information, such as mobile carriers who were found as recently as last year to be selling some of the most sensitive of personal information, location data<a>2</a>.&nbsp; 
 Entities who sell or share personal in bulk for marketing and advertising purposes, including identity resolution platforms (IDRPs) and&nbsp; customer data platforms (CDPs), both designed to ingest and synthesize personal data from a multitude of services/platforms<br>
a. This also includes adtech entities including Supply Side Platforms (SSPs), ad exchanges, Demand Side Platforms (DSPs), and Data Management Platforms (DMPs). These entities aggregate personal data shared via the real-time bidding (RTB) messages (aka “bidstream”). Note that these entities figured prominently in the recent Gravy Analytics analysis<a>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>Thus, we must assume that the volume of student data making its way into data brokers is substantially larger than this analysis conveys.&nbsp;</p>
 1.2 Methodology&nbsp; 
<p>In 2022, ISL conducted a privacy audit on recommended and required technologies for students in a representative sample of K-12 schools across the US. In total, ISL examined 1541 mobile apps, including analysis of the network traffic between the app, the first party, and all third-party servers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, ISL researchers determined the corporate owner of every subdomain that appeared in the network traffic collected for the apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we determined if the corporate owner was a registered data broker by matching against companies in the California and Vermont data broker registries; note that this reflects data broker registries as of 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 2. Findings<br>
 
 2.1&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall 
<p>243 apps or 15.8% of tested apps sent data to registered data brokers. The 243 apps sending data to data brokers communicated with a shocking 6.7 data brokers on average. This means that when children use these apps, their information will be sent to several data brokers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The top app categories sending data to data brokers were:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 News apps (77% of audited news apps)&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Reference apps (37%)&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sports apps (32%), and&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Community Engagement Platform (CEP) apps (26%).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>News, reference and sports apps are not surprising; news apps are known to be rife with adtech and martech. See Figure 7 for all category counts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As noted in all three previously published <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/reports/2022-us-k12-edtech-benchmark/">findings reports</a>, Community Engagement Platform apps were among the leakiest apps observed. The CEP developers with apps found to be communicating with data brokers are shown in Table 1.</p>

<p><br>
Of the larger CEP developers (Apptegy, Finalsite, and Intrado), it’s clear that the apps’ configurability is influencing the presence of data brokers since not all of the apps were found to be communicating with data brokers. Finalsite, for example, provides an administrative dashboard that allows school districts to edit the URLs opened by the app. In 2021, ISL spoke with Blackboard (Anthology), then-owner of the Finalsite apps, and learned that the platform performed no checking on the domains entered by school administrators. We suggested that they add guardrails, checking for things like dangling or malicious domains, at a bare minimum. Finalsite acquired Anthology from Blackboard in September 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Palm Beach County School District Android app (a CEP app) by Intrado included the most data brokers, at a whopping 31. (See also the Safety Label for the app here: <a href="https://appmicroscope.org/app/1579/">https://appmicroscope.org/app/1579/</a>) The app is no longer available on the Google Play store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Table 2 shows the five apps with the most data brokers from 2022 and from a recent retesting. Two of the apps have been removed from the store, but the other three are the same or worse with respect to the number of data brokers.&nbsp;</p>

2.2&nbsp; &nbsp;EdTech&nbsp; 
<p>As discussed in <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2022-k12-edtech-safety-benchmark-national-findings-part-1.pdf">Findings Report 1</a>, the majority of apps from the benchmark weren’t strictly edtech apps; the benchmark included a surprising number of non-edtech, general use apps. Isolating edtech categories, we find that only 6 apps (2.0%) of the strictly edtech apps had observed traffic to data brokers. While this is substantially better than the overall sample rate, for these kinds of services, there should be no data brokers receiving data from the apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

2.4&nbsp; &nbsp;State-based Observations 
<p>Data brokers were found in apps in every state and the District of Columbia. That is, every state sample of 13 schools had at least one school with at least one app with data broker traffic. Figure 1 shows how many schools from the 2022 benchmark had apps that were sending traffic to data brokers. 13 schools were sampled in each state, so the heatmap reflects up to 100% (i.e. all 13 schools) having apps with traffic to data brokers. Texas, Wisconsin and Louisiana each had apps with data brokers in all 13 studied schools.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Number of schools in state sample with at least one app with data broker traffic (13 schools max per state)</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the total number of apps with data broker traffic for each state sample of 13 schools. The states with the most apps with data broker traffic were Maryland, Kansas, and Minnesota.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: Total number of apps with data broker traffic</p>
<p>We hypothesize that the likelihood of apps with data broker traffic is mainly related to the sampled schools’ propensity to recommend a higher number of technologies to students. The correlation between the number apps with data brokers and the total number of apps was moderately strong at .69. Figure 3, the heatmap showing the total number of apps recommended by the 13 sampled schools in each state, indeed shows similarities (Texas, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Maryland, in particular).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3: Total number of apps per state</p>
<p>We were interested to see if there was any obvious correlation between state privacy laws and the number of data brokers observed. Figure 4 shows states with student data privacy laws. Indeed, three of the nine states that don’t have student data laws, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Maryland, each had high numbers of apps with data broker traffic, and all 13 schools in Wisconsin had apps with data broker traffic. While inconclusive with respect to causation, the correlation warrants future study. It’s also possible that the absence of a state student data privacy law encourages a higher number of technologies being recommended to students in schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p> There was no obvious correlation between states with children’s privacy laws and the number of apps with data broker traffic (Figure 5).&nbsp;</p>

 3. Recommendations 
 
 
 
 
 1) App developers: Apps or websites used by children should never send data to data brokers. They should also not send user data to customer data repositories
 
 
 
 a) Community Engagement Platform App Developers
 
 ISL is calling on the community engagement app developers shown in Table 1 to immediately update all of their apps to remove all data brokers. 
 We also call upon CEP app developers to install better guardrails in the administrative portal, minimally performing automated checking for dangling and malicious domains. Ideally, also disallowing or flagging any commercial sites with trackers (like MaxPreps), alerting school administrators of the risks of such sites with respect to student data sharing. 
 ISL recommends that schools not use CEP apps until they have demonstrated significant improvement in dangerous data sharing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2) Schools, Educators, and Concerned Parents: While it’s 100% the responsibility of the app developer to ensure that their apps and websites are safe for children, schools may need to be the ones demanding removal of data brokers. To help you do this, we’ve updated our app safety labels to clearly identify the number of data brokers in the app (Figure 6).&nbsp;Educators, school IT personnel and concerned parents can look up the app safety label for any app that they’re recommending to students. If it includes data brokers, stay away from the app. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can’t find your app? <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/contact-us/">Contact us</a> and we’ll be happy to audit a new app or re-audit an existing app.

<p>A Snapshot of Passkey Deployments for Employee Sign-ins in the U.S. and UK</p>



 Key findings 



 
 Enterprises understand the value of passkeys and the majority are rolling out passkeys for workforce sign-ins: The majority have either deployed or are in the midst of deploying passkeys with goals tied to improved user experience, enhanced security, and standards/regulatory compliance. Those that are deploying are rolling out a mix of device-bound and synced passkeys.&nbsp; 



 Enterprises are prioritizing passkey rollouts to users with access to sensitive data and applications, and are leveraging communication, training and documentation to increase adoption. 



 Enterprises are reporting significant security and business benefits after rolling out passkeys: they report positive impacts on user experience, security, cost reduction, productivity and digital transformation goals — and are seeing declines in usage of legacy authentication methods. Interestingly, these benefits directly correlate with what businesses who aren’t yet using passkeys dislike most about their current authentication methods: that they can be compromised, are costly, and difficult to use.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Organizations that do not have active passkey projects cite complexity, costs and overall lack of clarity about implementation as reasons, signaling a need for increased education to enterprises on rollout strategies to reduce concerns.

<p>Respondents report positive impacts on user experience, security, productivity, and cost reduction from deploying a mix of device-bound and synced passkeys</p>



<p>February 26, 2025 — <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">The FIDO Alliance</a> along with underwriters <a href="https://www.axiad.com/">Axiad</a>, <a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/">HID</a>, and <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales</a> today released its State of Passkey Deployment in the Enterprise report, finding that 87% of surveyed companies have, or are in the midst of, rolling out passkeys with goals tied to improved user experience, enhanced security, and compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report is the result of an independent survey commissioned in September 2024 by the FIDO Alliance Enterprise Deployment Working Group, with underwriting support from Axiad, HID, and Thales, to understand the state of passkey deployments in the U.S. and UK; the methods used to deploy passkeys and enroll employees; and the perceived barriers to deployment. Read the report at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/research-state-of-passkey-deployment-in-the-enterprise-a-snapshot-of-deployments-employee-sign-ins-us-uk">https://fidoalliance.org/research-state-of-passkey-deployment-in-the-enterprise-a-snapshot-of-deployments-employee-sign-ins-us-uk</a>.</p>



<p>The survey revealed four key findings:</p>



 
 Enterprises understand the value of passkeys for workforce sign-ins. A majority of decision makers (87%) report deploying passkeys at their companies. Of these, 47% report rolling out a mix of device-bound passkeys (on physical security keys and/or cards) and synced passkeys (synced securely across the user’s devices). 



 Organizations are prioritizing passkey rollouts to users with access to sensitive data and applications, including the three most commonly cited priority groups: Those requiring access to IP (39%), users with admin accounts (39%) and users at the executive level (34%). Within these deployments, organizations are leveraging communication, training, and documentation to increase adoption. 



 Passkey deployments are linked to significant security and business benefits. Respondents report moderate to strong positive impacts on user experience (82%), security (90%), help-center call reduction (77%), productivity (73%), and digital transformation goals (83%).&nbsp; 



 Groups that do not have active passkey projects cite complexity (43%), costs (33%), and lack of clarity (29%) about implementation as reasons. This signals a need for increased education for enterprises on rollout strategies to reduce concerns, as there is a correlation between these perceived challenges and the proven benefits of passkeys. 
 



<p>“This study is equally encouraging and illuminating as it points to strong willingness and commitment to deploy passkeys to employees – and also is informative in helping FIDO shape resources that we can deliver to help enterprises around the world more quickly and effectively implement their FIDO authentication strategies,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewshikiar/">Andrew Shikiar</a>, CEO and executive director of the FIDO Alliance. “Passkeys can stop AI-generated social engineering attacks in their tracks while also increasing employee productivity and reducing costs associated with help desk support and security breaches. FIDO Alliance is committed to helping more companies around the world realize these benefits by providing actionable passkey implementation guidance and best practices, which this data will help define.”</p>



<p>New phishing and fraud attempts are being used every day, driven in particular by widespread generative AI use. As reflected in the report, enterprise leaders are becoming aware of the limitations of compromisable passwords, and seeing the value of deploying the most secure and user-friendly authentication methods possible. These insights will be leveraged to further remove the perceived and/or real barriers around passkey adoption so more enterprises can experience their benefits on a global scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learn More During FIDO’s March 6 Webcast&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance will host a webcast on March 6, 2025 at 8am PST to provide further insights into the report methodology, the findings and next steps. The webcast will feature <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeljthelander/">Michael Thelander</a>, senior director of product marketing at Axiad; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-bj%C3%B6rk-0b2b679/">Katie Björk</a>, director of communications and solution marketing at HID; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahlefavrais/">Sarah Lefavrais</a>, Authentication devices product marketing director at Thales, along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-shamas-127b046/">Megan Shamas</a>, chief marketing officer of the FIDO Alliance. Register <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/passkey-adoption-workforce-trends-considerations">here</a>.</p>



<p>Michael Thelander, Axiad’s director of product marketing, thinks the survey results will deliver not just interesting data, but will also provide a path for FIDO2 to become a first class citizen alongside other forms of PKI-based authentication in the enterprise. “Passkey technology has not only matured, but this survey reveals how identity practitioners and strategists are beginning to integrate passkeys with their other workforce authentication methods, across different platforms and device types, to deliver what identity architects and users both want: strong authentication that doesn’t place a ‘friction ‘tax’ on the last step of accessing systems and networks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“HID, in collaboration with fellow FIDO Alliance members, launched this survey to gain insights into the priorities of enterprise and security leaders that drive successful passkey implementation. We also aimed to identify the challenges other organizations encounter when integrating FIDO technology into their authentication strategies. HID’s overarching goal is to empower organizations to meet their business objectives by eliminating one of their most significant obstacles: user experience and security challenges linked to passwords,” says Katie Björk, Director of Communications and Solution Marketing.</p>



<p>“Thales is excited to collaborate with the FIDO Alliance for this research, which underscores the growing adoption of passkeys for employee sign-ins,” said Haider Iqbal, Director Product Marketing IAM at Thales. “We’re seeing similar interest from our customers, who recognize the benefits of FIDO authentication for both security and productivity. Thales is committed to enabling organizations to migrate their workforce and customers to passkeys, helping them stay ahead of the curve with secure, seamless and frictionless digital journeys for all users.”</p>



<p>Survey Methodology:</p>



 
 The survey was conducted among 400 decision makers who would be / are involved in passkey deployment in companies with 500+ employees across the UK and the US. 



 The interviews were conducted online by Sapio Research in September 2024 using an email invitation and an online survey. 



 At an overall level results are accurate to ± 4.9% at 95% confidence limits assuming a result of 50%. 



 The survey was produced by the FIDO Alliance Enterprise Deployment Working Group, with underwriting support from Axiad, HID, and Thales.

<p></p>      The Digital Future of Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG)           <p>Privacy-Preserving Traceability with Digital Product Passports &amp; Data Spaces Interoperability</p>
          <p>The Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry is undergoing a rapid transformation. Consumers demand accountability and sustainability—<a href="https://www.bazaarvoice.com/blog/cpg-research/">over 70% want detailed product information</a>—while new regulations like the EU’s <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en">Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation</a> (ESPR) and the <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/forced-labor/UFLPA">Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act</a> (UFLPA) reshape the landscape. Big data leaks and supply chain disruptions have become the norm. As regulations grow increasingly stringent, consumer trust falters, and operational costs skyrocket, a paradigm shift is essential. The industry needs verifiable, trusted data seamlessly integrated — and a system that enables seamless, permissioned data exchange across the value chain.</p>
<p>Digital Product Passports (DPPs) are a key component of this transformation. A DPP is a secure, globally unique digital record that stores verifiable information about a product throughout its lifecycle—from raw materials to disposal. Widespread adoption of DPPs is critical for building trust, strengthening value chain resilience, and ensuring regulatory compliance. According to the EU, <a href="https://data.europa.eu/en/news-events/news/eus-digital-product-passport-advancing-transparency-and-sustainability">which now requires DPPs</a> for nearly all products sold in the EU, “the DPP is designed to close the gap between consumer demands for transparency and the current lack of reliable product data.”</p>
<p>However, DPPs alone are not enough. To truly unlock their potential, we need a standardized framework for data spaces interoperability—a system that enables direct, seamless transactions between participants across industries. Modern value chains involve collaboration among thousands of stakeholders, including enterprises, regulators, and consumers. When these value chains function efficiently, they improve product quality, optimize resource allocation, and lower costs. Yet, despite technological advancements, achieving this level of coordination remains a challenge.</p>
<p>Introduction to MOBI’s Web3 Infrastructure </p>
<p>Today, many organizations rely on third-party platforms and proprietary applications for data exchange, resulting in fragmented, siloed systems. This lack of interoperability limits collaboration and hinders critical processes, from ensuring product safety and ethical sourcing to enabling proper recycling and end-of-life management. Recognizing this, <a href="https://dlt.mobi/about/">MOBI was formed in 2018</a> as a neutral convener for organizations to develop standards and infrastructure for DPPs and data spaces interoperability. <a href="https://dlt.mobi/web3-infrastructure/">MOBI’s Web3 Infrastructure</a>, comprising <a href="https://dlt.mobi/citopia/">Citopia Decentralized Marketplace</a> (DM) and the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/">Integrated Trust Network</a> (ITN), offers a secure, decentralized marketplace framework with standardized communication protocols. Think of it as a private internet, wherein entities can engage in secure, autonomous, encrypted transactions.</p>
<p>Citopia DM and the ITN are built for <a href="https://dlt.mobi/ssdi/">Self-Sovereign Data and Identity</a> (SSDI). Each participant owns and manages their own <a href="https://dlt.mobi/passport/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twin</a> (SSDT), which stores two things: </p>
 
 a globally-unique <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier</a> (DID), which is anchored and validated in the ITN 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) used for transactions in Citopia DM  
 
<p>This SSDT allows participants to engage in standardized, secure, and compliant transactions on Citopia DM with selective disclosure (data only goes to intended recipients). Both Citopia and ITN are system and cloud-agnostic, meaning stakeholders can seamlessly communicate while retaining their existing systems and web services. This removes the need for costly one-off integrations and eliminates prohibitive onboarding/maintenance costs, providing a robust foundation for data spaces interoperability.</p>
<p>Citopia DM unlocks new possibilities for DPPs by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions between value chain participants. Removing reliance on third-party intermediaries lowers costs, increases traceability, and drives compliance with emerging regulatory requirements. Companies leveraging MOBI’s infrastructure can streamline operations, reduce data silos, and improve their ability to meet evolving consumer and regulatory demands. For regulators and consumers of CPGs, Citopia DM offers easy access to trusted DPPs issued by companies. For regulators, this makes it easy to verify compliance claims. For consumers, access to DPPs can inspire confident purchasing decisions and boost brand loyalty. </p>
<p>Laying the Foundation for Generative AI Applications </p>
<p>MOBI is going to take this one important step further. The robust infrastructure it has built not only addresses the critical need for tracebility and data exchange but also lays the foundation for powerful generative AI applications. By leveraging the rich, contextual data housed within DPPs and the seamless data flow facilitated by Citopia and SSDTs between rich data spaces, generative AI can move beyond generic analyses to provide participant-specific value. Imagine a scenario where:</p>
 
 Consumers can interact with generative AI agents to understand the complete lifecycle of a product they are considering purchasing. These agents, equipped with DPP data accessed through Citopia, can answer nuanced questions about a product’s sustainability footprint, ethical sourcing, or even detailed ingredient breakdowns, generating responses tailored to the individual consumer’s values and concerns. For example, a consumer with specific dietary restrictions or sustainability preferences could ask a generative AI agent: “Show me the carbon footprint and allergen information for the ingredients in this cereal, and suggest alternatives with lower environmental impact and no nuts.” The agent, accessing the DPP via Citopia, can generate a personalized, privacy-preserving response, drawing from verified data and offering actionable recommendations. 
 CPG Companies can utilize generative AI to optimize their operations and gain deeper market understanding. Generative AI agents can analyze aggregated and anonymized DPP data from across the value chain within Citopia to identify supply chain inefficiencies, predict potential disruptions, or personalize marketing campaigns with unprecedented precision. For instance, a generative AI agent could analyze DPP data to recommend optimal sourcing strategies based on real-time insights into material availability, ethical considerations, and environmental impact, while ensuring compliance with regulations like UFLPA. Furthermore, generative AI can assist in generating customized sustainability reports or proactively flag potential regulatory compliance issues based on DPP data, streamlining operations and reducing risks. 
 Regulators can employ generative AI agents to efficiently monitor and verify compliance with evolving regulations like the ESPR. These agents can be granted permissioned access to DPP data within Citopia, enabling them to automatically audit product information against regulatory requirements and identify potential non-compliance issues at scale. Generative AI can generate summaries of compliance status across product categories or highlight specific areas needing further investigation, significantly enhancing regulatory oversight and consumer protection. 
 
<p>The key to enabling these generative AI applications lies in the architecture of MOBI’s Web3 infrastructure. SSDTs with secure identities backed by the ITN ensure that each participant retains control over their data, can choose what data to disclose (and to whom), and can securely exchange verifiable data in a regulatory-mandated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_architecture">Zero Trust Architecture</a>. </p>
<p>Generative AI agents operating within this framework can be designed to access and process data in a privacy-preserving manner. For example, they can utilize techniques like differential privacy or federated learning to generate insights from aggregated DPP data without needing to access or expose the raw, sensitive data of individual participants. Selective disclosure of VCs ensures that only authorized agents receive the necessary data points, minimizing the risk of data breaches or misuse.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This means that the combination of DPPs and interoperable data spaces facilitated by MOBI’s infrastructure and generative AI represents an entirely new business phase for the CPG industry. It moves beyond basic traceability to enable a future where data becomes a dynamic tool for generating participant-specific value, fostering deeper consumer trust, optimizing business operations, and ensuring robust regulatory compliance – all within a secure and privacy-respecting ecosystem. </p>
<p>MOBI’s Web3 infrastructure is, therefore, a game-changer for the CPG industry, offering a scalable, decentralized approach to data verification and interoperability while enabling participant-specific insights and recommendations using generative AI. As consumer expectations evolve and regulatory landscapes shift, embracing decentralized, self-sovereign solutions will be the key to sustainable growth and competitive advantage. The future of CPG lies in verifiable, trusted data, and MOBI is leading the way in building the infrastructure to support it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.oneidentity.com/learn/what-is-passkey-authentication.aspx">Passkey authentication</a>&nbsp;replaces traditional passwords with a pair of cryptographic keys—public and private. The private key stays on the user’s device, while the public key sits on the server. During login, the server issues a challenge that only the private key can solve, and the response gets verified using the public key. No passwords are transmitted or stored, which reduces the attack surface significantly. Password leaks and brute-force attempts become non-issues because there is no static secret to steal or guess.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.oneidentity.com/learn/what-is-fido-authentication.aspx">FIDO2</a>&nbsp;is a joint initiative by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) aimed at delivering streamlined, strong authentication without relying on passwords. It defines a set of technical components: WebAuthn and CTAP2 (Client to Authenticator Protocol). WebAuthn standardizes how a web application interacts with an authenticator—often a platform feature like a secure enclave on a phone or a hardware security key. CTAP2 governs how that authenticator communicates with the client device, such as a laptop or smartphone.</p>

<p>The Human Colossus Foundation (HCF) recently participated in the 2025 Geneva Winter Summit, a global gathering of AI experts, policymakers, and innovators hosted by the AI for Developing Countries Forum (AIFOD) at United Nation office at Geneva. The summit focused on AI’s potential for developing countries to drive equitable digital development, culminating in the AIFOD Geneva Winter Summit Declaration 2025, which charts a path for inclusive AI progress.</p><p>At the core of HCF’s contribution were two topics:</p>  <p>The importance of access to accurate data and its provenance in AI training especially for small and less digitalize nations.</p>  <p>The role of distributed governance in fostering ethical AI Agents ecosystems which can give the edge for developing countries without need to build massive data centers for huge AI models. </p>   The Power of Accurate Data and Provenance in AI Training <p>For AI to serve communities effectively, it require access to massive data sets, best localize to avoid biases and misinformation. Unfortunately a lot of developing countries does not have such access, in many cases digital transformation just starting. This allows them to better prepare for upcoming needs of the data, they can start already shaping digital policies and strategies to invest from day one towards more accurate data ecosystems which could give them the edge relaying more on quality then quantity. AI models trained on verifiable, and well-documented data would be more accurate in their functions. Data provenance—the ability to trace data back to its source—is essential for ensuring AI models are transparent, reliable, and compliant with global data standards but as well allowing citizens and countries to verify potential bias and misinformation in AI-generated insights.</p><p>At the summit, HCF emphasized how Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) principles enable organizations to structure and verify data origins, ensuring AI models are trained on high-quality, trustworthy inputs.</p><p>Why does data provenance matter?</p>  <p>Enables to build trust and accountability in AI decision-making</p>  <p>Helps organizations comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)</p>  <p>Prevents bias and misinformation in AI-generated insights</p>  <p>HCF advocates for data-oriented architectures, where individuals and businesses can validate their data before it is used to train AI, ensuring a more transparent and responsible ecosystem.</p> Distributed Governance: The Key to Ethical and Sustainable AI <p>Governance models must evolve to keep pace with AI’s rapid growth. Traditional centralized governance structures often struggle to provide the inclusivity and adaptability needed for cross-border AI systems.</p><p>At the summit, HCF promoted distributed governance model to help with classification standards, cross-jurisdictional ethical alignment, and enhanced data transparency. A meta-governance framework would equip stakeholders with accurate, verifiable, and accessible information, enabling informed AI adoption that aligns with local regulations and ethical values. By promoting fairness, transparency, and accountability, this framework supports a responsible, sustainable AI-driven digital economy.</p><p>How can distributed governance benefit AI ecosystems?</p>  <p>Inclusive decision-making – Empowering communities, businesses, and policymakers to shape AI’s future</p>  <p>Enhanced accountability – Avoiding centralized control that can lead to bias or exploitation</p>  <p>Interoperability across jurisdictions – Helping AI operate ethically across borders without conflicting regulations</p>  <p>Through distributed governance models, AI can serve global communities fairly, ensuring that technological advancements reflect a shared ethical and socio-economic vision.</p> The 2025 AIFOD Declaration: A Commitment to Inclusive AI <p>The Geneva Winter Summit Declaration 2025 serves as a blueprint for AI governance, highlighting the need for:</p>  <p>Equitable access to AI advancements for developing nations</p>  <p>A balance between regulation and innovation</p>  <p>Stronger international collaboration to ensure ethical AI deployment</p>  <p>HCF stands committed to advancing these goals through the Dynamic Data Economy, ensuring AI serves all communities equally, ethically, and sustainably.</p> Looking Ahead: HCF’s Vision for Ethical AI Development <p>The Human Colossus Foundation will continue advocating for accurate data management, distributed governance, and responsible AI adoption.

<p>Am 26. November fand die Zweite Digital Society Conference (DSC2) im Change Hub in Berlin statt. Am 27. November fand im Rahmen der DSC2 ein Workshop zum Thema Organisationsidentitäten statt.</p>



<p>Wie im vergangenen Jahr lag der Schwerpunkt der DSC auf dem Thema Digitale Nachweise und Identitäten. In Keynote, Panels und interaktiven Worksessions wurden am 26.11.24 Genese und Rahmenbedingungen der europäischen digitalen Identitätslösung und der EUDI-Wallet erläutert und Fakten vermittelt. Auch sind wir der Frage nachgegangen, wie sich diese europäische Lösung im internationalen Kontext einordnet und was uns als Gesellschaft in den kommenden Jahren konkret erwartet. Denn die hoheitliche eID ist erst der Beginn einer schnellen und anspruchsvollen Entwicklung, in deren Folge auch Unternehmen eine digitale ID erhalten werden, um den Austausch von Daten und die Sicherheit der Identifikation von Entitäten zu gewährleisten.</p>



<p>An dieser Stelle danken wir den Referierenden, Panelisten und insbesondere unseren Förderern, ohne die wir die DSC2 nicht hätten realisieren können.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digitale Nachweise und Identitäten – sind Sie bereit?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jörg Fischer, Bundesdruckerei</p>



<p><a href="https://idunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DSC2-Keynote_JorgFischer.pdf">Download Keynote</a></p>







<p>Zu folgenden Themen bildeten sich Worksessions:</p>



 
 Anbindung von Kommunen und kleinen Unternehmen 



 Wiki Data /Organisationsidentitäten / Definition 



 ID-Diebstahl / Betrug 



 Geschäftsmodelle / Payment Integration 



 SDI-Initiativen außerhalb der EU / Interoperabilität 



 Killer-Applikationen für Europäische Wallet (EUDI-Wallet) 



 Und dann gab es noch eine Worksession unter dem augenzwinkernden Header „Dackel-Club“: Hier wurden Nutzungen und Anwendungen digitaler Identitäten diskutiert, die keine hoheitliche Identität benötigen. Zum Beispiel die Mitgliedschaft im Dackel-Club. Dies mag kurios klingen, doch wenn bedacht wird, dass mehr als 37 % der Bevölkerung der Bundesrepublik in Vereinen engagiert ist, so erscheint dieses Anwendungsfeld durchaus interessant, um Adaption und den Umgang mit Wallets voranzubringen. 
 



<p>Handout Wegweiser:</p>



<p>Schließlich wurde der Wegweiser Digitale Identitäten und Nachweise vorgestellt. Dieser ist Produkt der Zusammenarbeit innerhalb der Forschungsprojekte Sichere digitale Identitäten des BMWK (SDI) und steht nun zum Download zur Verfügung. Ziel des Wegweisers ist es, einen niederschwelligen Einstieg in die Begriffswelt digitaler Nachweise zu finden. Erläutert sind die Begriffe Wallet, digitale Identität, digitaler Nachweis, Signatur. Die Nutzung des Wegweisers ist frei.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Guest blog by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-bernstein-518688/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Greg Bernstein</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davelongley1/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dave Longley</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manusporny/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Manu Sporny</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimdhamilton/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Kim Hamilton Duffy</a></p><p>Following the IETF/IRTF Crypto Forum Research Group’s adoption of the BBS Blind Signatures and BBS per Verifier Linkability (“BBS Pseudonym”) specifications, this blog describes historical context and details of cryptographic pseudonyms, as well as the privacy features they enable.</p><p>The discussion of cryptographic pseudonyms for privacy preservation has a long history, with Chaum’s 1985 popular article “Security without identification: transaction systems to make big brother obsolete” (Chaum1985) addressing many of the features of such systems such as unlinkability and constraints on their use such as one pseudonym per organization and accountability for pseudonym use. Although Chaum’s proposal makes use of different cryptographic primitives than we will use here, one can see similarities in the use of both secret and “public” information being combined to create a cryptographic pseudonym.</p><p>Lysyanskaya’s 2000 paper (Lysya2000) also addresses the unlinkable aspects of pseudonyms but also provides protections against dishonest users. In addition they provide practical constructions similar to those used in our draft based on discrete logarithm and sigma protocol based ZKPs. Finally as part of the ABC4Trust project three flavors of pseudonyms were defined:</p>  Verifiable pseudonyms are pseudonyms derived from an underlying secret key.  Certified pseudonyms are certified pseudonyms derived from a secret key that also underlies an issued credential.  Scope-exclusive pseudonyms are verifiable pseudonyms that are guaranteed to be unique per scope string and per secret key.  Figure 1: Types of Pseudonyms<p>The BBS based pseudonyms in our draft are aimed primarily at providing the functionality of the pseudonym flavors 2 and 3 above.</p> How BBS is Fundamentally Better for Solving Dishonest Holder Fraud <p>Beyond the usual anti-forgery and tamper-evident protections that digital signatures provide, there are two different types of credential fraud that unlinkable credentials need to mitigate: third-party fraud and first-party fraud.</p><p>Third-party fraud is when one party uses another party's credentials without their knowledge or approval. This involves the theft of an honest holder's credentials.</p><p>First-party fraud is when a legitimate credential holder intentionally allows other parties to covertly use their credentials. This involves not the theft of credentials, but rather, a dishonest holder.</p><p>BBS signatures provides two different security features, one to address each of these cases:</p> 1. Holder Multifactor Authentication <p>This security feature binds a BBS credential to a particular secret that only the holder knows and that an honest holder will not share access to nor use of. When a holder presents a BBS credential, a verifier can require that the holder prove use of this secret, thereby enforcing this protection on the holder's behalf. This is an anti-theft mechanism for mitigating third-party fraud.</p><p>Note: This feature is sometimes called "holder binding", but it might be more accurately understood as "Holder Multifactor Authentication". This is because the holder is not themselves bound to the credential and it is not a mitigation for first-party fraud. It instead works like another MFA device does when performing authentication. If a dishonest holder shares that MFA device or an API to use it, then someone else can unlinkably present their credential (with the holder's approval -- perhaps even for a fee). Stopping dishonest holders from doing this is a significant challenge that involves locking down users' hardware and software – and a single failure in this scheme could potentially result in an unlimited number of unlinkable, fraudulent presentations. This feature is therefore not a protection for verifiers, but rather one for honest holders against theft. With this in mind, it can be implemented such that a holder is free to use software or hardware of their choice to provide the protection, without requiring specific approval from the issuer.</p> 2. Pseudonyms <p>This security feature binds a BBS credential to a secret that is constructed from inputs from both the holder and the issuer. When a holder presents a BBS credential, a verifier can require that the holder present a pseudonym that is based on this secret and a contextual identifier. Each time the same BBS credential is presented using the same contextual identifier, the pseudonym will be the same. This prevents a dishonest holder from covertly enabling an unlimited number of unlinkable presentations of their credential by any parties they authorize. It is an anti-cloning mechanism for mitigating first-party fraud.</p><p>Contextual identifiers can be any value, but need to be agreed upon between the verifier and the holder for a given use case. To give some examples for the presentation of credentials on the Web, a contextual identifier could be a URL like a Web origin (e.g., "<a href="https://website.example/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://website.example</a>"), a Web origin with a certain path (e.g., "<a href="https://website.example/groups/wind-surfing?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://website.example/groups/wind-surfing</a>"), or protocol-defined combination of a URL and a time range, allowing for pseudonyms to be "forgotten" or "rotated" after sufficient time has passed.</p><p>Note: Other credential schemes aim to mitigate first-party fraud by limiting the device and software that a holder chooses to engage with, sometimes referred to as "holder binding". With this approach, the holder's own device and software are trusted to be leveraged against them to constrain their behavior. This approach requires device and software allow lists, trust framework management, significant additional protocol security considerations, and ultimately means that the issuer chooses the holder's device and software (or provides them with a list of acceptable options from which they may choose). This has additional side effects, such as centralizing and vendor lock-in effects on the marketplace of devices and software. Finally, with this approach, it also only takes a single dishonest holder to thwart the protections of the device or software (that they have physical access to) to re-enable an unlimited number of unlinkable fraudulent presentations of a valid credential in the ecosystem. Catching this behavior after the fact logically requires being able to link presentations once again, one way or another, which would defeat the privacy aims of the scheme.</p> Overview: BBS Signature Bound Pseudonyms <p>The BBS signature scheme, the foundation for BBS Pseudonyms, is based on a three-party model:</p>  Signer (also known as issuer): Issues credentials&nbsp;  Prover (also known as holder or user): Receives credentials&nbsp;  Verifier: Validates proofs  <p>A prover obtains a BBS signature from a signer over a list of BBS messages and presents a BBS proof (a proof of possession of a BBS signature) along with a selectively disclosed subset of the BBS messages to a verifier.</p>Figure 2: Example of BBS Signature Flow<p>Each BBS proof generated is unlinkable to other BBS proofs derived from the same signature and from the BBS signature itself. If the disclosed subset of BBS messages are not linkable then they cannot be linked by their cryptographic presentation alone.</p>

<p>Note: the language used in this section is intentionally informal; for a more precise explanation of phrases like “…cannot be linked by their cryptographic presentation alone”, please see Lysya2000.</p>

<p>BBS pseudonyms extend the BBS signature scheme to “bind” a “cryptographic pseudonym” to a BBS signature retaining all the properties of the BBS signature scheme:</p>  &nbsp;A short signature over multiple messages  Selective disclosure of a subset of messages from prover to verifier  Unlinkable proofs.  <p>In addition BBS pseudonyms provide for:</p>  An essentially unique identifier bound to a signature/proof of signature whose linkability is under the control of the prover in conjunction with a verifier or group of verifiers. Such a pseudonym can be used when a prover revisits a verifier to allow a verifier to recognize the prover when they return or for the prover to assert their pseudonymous identity when visiting a verifier  Assurance of per-signer uniqueness, i.e., the signer assures that the pseudonyms that will be guaranteed by the signature have not been used with any other signature issued by the signer (unless a signature is intentionally reissued).  The signer cannot track the prover presentations to verifiers based on pseudonym values.  Verifiers in separate “pseudonym groups” cannot track prover presentations.   How BBS Pseudonyms Work  Overview <p>To realize the above feature set we embed a two part pseudonym capability into the BBS signature scheme. The pseudonym’s cryptographic value will be computed from a secret part, which we call the nym_secret and a part that is public or at least shared between the prover and one or more verifiers. The public part we call the context_id.&nbsp;</p><p>A simplified overview of this flow is shown in Figure 3:</p>Figure 3: Simplified overview of BBS Pseudonym flow Issuance <p>To bind a pseudonym to a BBS signature we have the signer utilize Blind BBS signatures and essentially sign over a commitment to the nym_secret. Hence only a prover that knows the nym_secret can generate a BBS proof from the signature (and also generate the pseudonym proof).</p><p>The prover chooses their (random) prover_nym and commits to it. They then send the commitment along with a ZKP proof that the prover_nym makes this commitment. The signer verifies the commitment to the prover_nym then generates the signer_nym_entropy and “adds” it to the prover_nym during the signature process. Note that this can be done since we sign over the commitment and we know the generator for the commitment.</p>Figure 4: Credential Issuance detailed flow<p>As in Lysya2000 we are concerned with the possibility of a dishonest user and hence require that that nym_secret = prover_nym + signer_nym_entropy be the sum of two parts where the prover_nym is a prover's secret and only sent to the signer in a blinding and hiding commitment. The signer_nym_entropy is “added” in by the signer during the signing procedure and sent back to the prover along with the signature.&nbsp;</p> Verification <p>The pseudonym is calculated from nym_secret and context_id using discrete exponentiation.</p>  nym_secret: A two-part secret combining:  prover_nym: Generated and known only by the prover  signer_nym_entropy: Contributed by the signer during signature    context_id: A public identifier that is shared between the prover and one or more verifiers  <p>This is similar to the computations in Lysya2000 and ABC2014. The pseudonym is presented to the verifier along with a ZKP that the prover knows the nym_secret and uses it and the context_id to compute the pseudonym value. A similar proof mechanism was used in Lysya2000. See chapter 19 of BS2023 for an exposition on these types of ZKPs.</p>Figure 5: BBS Pseudonym verification flow<p>See the appendix for a detailed diagram showing the complete BBS pseudonym issuance and verification flow.</p> BBS Pseudonym Example Applications  Certifiable Pseudonyms <p>Certifiable pseudonyms work as follows:&nbsp; the prover creates unique pseudonyms based on context_ids they choose. While the nym_secret is guaranteed unique to and by the issuer, the issuer never learns its value.&nbsp;</p><p>When using the pseudonym, the prover presents both the context_id and pseudonym to identify themselves, along with any attributes (messages) they choose to reveal. No one else without the nym_secret and signature can produce a proof that they “own” the pseudonym. The prover can create as many different, unlinkable pseudonyms by coming up with different values for the context_id.&nbsp;</p>Figure 6: In this example of Certifiable Pseudonyms, the prover chooses different a context_id per service they interact with Scope Exclusive Pseudonyms <p>With scope exclusive pseudonyms, the verifier or group of verifiers require the use of a specific context_id. This allows the verifier (or group of verifiers) to track visits by the prover using this credential/pseudonym. A verifier can limit data collection, i.e. data retention minimization, by periodically changing the context_id since the pseudonyms produced using different context_ids cannot be linked. For example a context_id like “mywebsite.com/17Nov2024” that changes daily means the verifier could only track visits daily.</p>Figure 7: Scope exclusive pseudonyms where verifiers, or groups of verifiers, require a specific context_id. In this example, scope is set a per-day level<p>Scope Exclusive Pseudonyms with Monitoring</p><p>Scope exclusive pseudonyms with monitoring enable regulated privacy in scenarios requiring third-party oversight. Consider a system for purchasing controlled chemicals: A prover with appropriate credentials uses a different pseudonym with each vendor. This prevents vendors from colluding on prices or learning secret formulas by tracking a prover's complete purchase history across different vendors. At the same time, for regulatory compliance and public safety, vendors must report all purchases to a monitor, including the pseudonym used and their vendor-specific context_id. The prover shares their nym_secret only with the monitor, allowing the monitor to link different pseudonyms to the same prover when necessary. This separation between nym_secrets and other credential-binding secrets is crucial - it enables regulatory oversight without introducing additional cross-tracking by vendors.</p>Figure 8: In this example, scope exclusive pseudonyms with monitoring are used to enable regulatory compliance while not reusing pseudonyms across vendors  A Short Selection of References   [Chaum1985] D.

<p>Thales has unveiled a new solution designed to streamline the deployment and management of FIDO security passkeys for large-scale implementations. The OneWelcome FIDO Key Lifecycle Management solution enables organizations to efficiently manage the complete lifecycle of FIDO keys while transitioning to passwordless authentication systems. The launch follows Thales’&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/thales-releases-new-passwordless-authentication-devices-102201/">previous efforts in passwordless authentication</a>, expanding their enterprise security portfolio.</p>



<p>The solution provides IT teams with comprehensive control over FIDO key management, from initial enrollment through to eventual revocation. By allowing IT departments to pre-register keys and handle lifecycle management tasks, the platform helps reduce the burden on end users while maintaining security standards. The approach supports recent&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fido-papers-explain-how-to-use-passkeys-in-the-enterprise/">FIDO Alliance guidelines for enterprise passkey implementation</a>, which emphasize the importance of streamlined deployment processes.</p>



<p>A key feature of the solution is its integration with Microsoft Entra ID through FIDO2 provisioning APIs, enabling organizations to pre-register Thales FIDO keys for their users. The integration is particularly relevant for enterprises using Microsoft 365, providing secure authentication capabilities from initial deployment. The feature arrives as Microsoft implements&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/microsoft-enforces-mandatory-mfa-across-enterprise-platforms-in-2024-2025-rollout/">mandatory multi-factor authentication across its enterprise platforms</a>.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago, The Onion published this story:</p>
<p><a href="https://theonion.com/study-finds-paint-aisle-at-lowes-best-place-to-have-com-1819570652/">Study Finds Paint Aisle At Lowe’s Best Place To Have Complete Meltdown</a></p>
<p>Now it’s the vitamin aisle at CVS:</p>
 <p>Enshittification at work.</p> 
<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">coined</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>, he was talking about how online platforms such as Google, Amazon, and TikTok get shitty over time. Well, the same disease also afflicts many big retail operations, especially ones that flood their zones with discounts and other gimmicks, enshittifying what marketers call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience">“the customer experience” (aka CX)</a>.</p>
<p>Take the vitamin aisle, above. The only people who will ever get down on all fours to read the yellow tags near the floor are the cursed employees who have to creep the length of the aisle putting them there.</p>
<p>For customers, the main cost of shopping at CVS is cognitive overhead. Think about—</p>
 
 All those yellow stickies 
 All the slow-downs at check-out when you wave your barcode at a reader, punch your phone number into a terminal, or have a CVS worker to do the same 
 All the conditionalities in every discount or “free” offer that&nbsp; isn’t 
 All the yard-long receipts, such as this one: 
 
<p></p>
<p>And the app!</p>
<p>OMFG,&nbsp; all we really need the damned app for is the one CVS function our life depends on: the pharmacy.</p>
<p>To be fair, the app doesn’t suck at the basics (list of meds, what needs to be refilled, etc.). But it does suck at helping you take advantage of CVS’s greatest strength: that there are so many of them. <a href="https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/CVS%20Pharmacy-USA/">Specifically</a>,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/CVS%20Pharmacy-USA/"></a></p>
<p>While that’s down a bit from<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/241544/cvs-caremark-number-of-stores-since-2005/"> the peak</a> in 2021, CVS is still the Starbucks of pharmacies. And while they are busy <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/money/12573233/cvs-cutting-thousands-jobs-technology/">laying off people while investing in tech</a>, you’d think they would at least make it easy to move your prescription from one store to another, using the app.&nbsp; But noooo.</p>
<p>What the app is best for is promotional crap. For example, this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Look at the small gray type in the red oval:&nbsp;198 coupons!</p>
<p>After I scroll down past the six Extrabucks Rewards (including the two above), I get these:</p>
<p></p>
<p>First, who wants a full-priced item when it seems damn near everything is discounted?</p>
<p>Second, you’d think after all these years of checking out with my Extracare barcode, and the app shows me (under “Buy It Again”) all the stuff I’ve purchased recently, that CVS would know I am a standard-issue dude with no interest in cosmetics. So why top the list of coupons with that shit? I suppose it’s to make me scroll down through the other 178 coupons to find other stuff I might want at a cheaper price.</p>
<p>I just did that and found nothing. Why? Because most of the coupons are for health products I already bought or don’t need. (I’m not sick right now.) Also, almost all of the coupons (as you see) expire three days from now.</p>
<p>Now think about the cognitive and operational overhead required to maintain that whole program at CVS. Good gawd.</p>
<p>And is it necessary? At all? When you’re the Starbucks of pharmacies?</p>
<p>Without exception, all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program">loyalty programs</a> like this one are coercive. They are about trapping and milking customers.</p>
<p>But do stores need them? Do customers? Does CVS?&nbsp; Really? When its customers are already biased by convenience.</p>
<p>Pro Tip: Real loyalty is earned, not coerced.</p>
<p>Want your store, or your chain, to be loved? Take some lessons from the most loved chain in the country: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_Joe's">Trader Joe’s</a>. In a chapter of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy</a> called “The Dance,” I list some reasons why TJ’s is loved by its customers. My main source for that list is <a href="https://www.consciouscapitalism.org/people/doug-rauch">Doug Rauch</a>, the retired president of TJ’s, where he worked for 31 years. Here are the top few:</p>
 
 They never use the word “consumer.” They call us “customers,” “persons,” or “individuals.” 
 They have none of what Doug calls “gimmicks.” No loyalty programs, ads, promotions, or anything else that manipulates customers, raises cognitive overhead or insults anyone’s intelligence. In other words, none of what marketing obsesses about. “Those things are a huge part of retailing today, and have huge hidden costs,” Doug says. (I think the company’s biggest marketing expense is its float in the Rose Parade.) 
 They never discount anything, or say anything is “on sale.” Those kinds of signals add more cognitive overhead. TJ’s wants customers not just to assume, but to know. A single price takes care of that. 
 They have less than no interest in industry fashion. TJ’s goes to no retail industry meetings or conferences, belongs to no associations, and avoids all settings where the talk is about gaming customers. That’s not TJ’s style because that’s not its substance. 
 They believe, along with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cluetrain.com/book/markets.html">Cluetrain</a>, that markets are conversations—with customers. Doug told me his main job, as president of the company, was “shopping along with customers.” That’s how he spent most of his time. “We believe in honesty and directness between human beings…We do this by engaging with the whole person, rather than just with the part that ‘consumes….We’ll even open packages with customers to taste and talk about the goods.” As a result, “There’s nothing sold at Trader Joe’s that customers haven’t improved.” 
 
<p>Then there’s what Walmart CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Scott_(businessman)">Lee Scott</a> told me in 2000 (at <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2010/09/03/3250/">this event</a>) when I asked him “What happened to K-Mart?” From The Intention Economy:</p>
<blockquote><p>His answer, in a word, was “Coupons.” As Lee explained it, K-Mart overdid it with coupons, which became too big a hunk of their overhead, while also narrowing their customer base toward coupon-clippers. They had other problems, he said, but that was a big one. By contrast, Wal-Mart minimized that kind of thing, focusing instead on promising “everyday low prices,” which was a line of Sam Walton’s from way back. The overhead for that policy rounded to zero.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which brings me to trust.</p>
<p>We trust Trader Joe’s and Walmart to be what they are. In simple and fundamental ways, they haven’t changed. The ghosts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Coulombe">Joe Coloumbe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Walton">Sam Walton</a> still run Trader Joe’s and Walmart. TJ’s is still the “irreverent but affordable” grocery store Joe built for what (in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Trader-Joe-Business-Still/dp/1400225434/">his book</a>) Joe called “the overeducated and underpaid,” and based in Los Angeles. Walmart is still Sam’s five-and-dime from Bentonville, Arkansas. (Lee Scott told me that.)</p>
<p>CVS’s equivalent to Joe and Sam was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_P._Hoagland_III">Ralph Hoagland</a>, a good friend of good friends of ours in Santa Barbara. All of us also shared history around Harvard and Cambridge, where Ralph lived when he co-founded CVS, which stood for Consumer Value Store, in 1963. In those days CVS mostly sold health and beauty products, cheaply. I remember Ralph saying the store’s main virtue was just good prices on good products. Hence the name.</p>
<p>CVS can do a much better job of signaling bargain prices by just making them as low as possible, on the model of Trader Joe’s and Walmart.</p>
<p>I think there is also a good Health position for CVS: one that bridges its health &amp; beauty origins and its eminence as the leading pharmacy chain in the U.S. And it&nbsp;could&nbsp;rest on trust.</p>
<p>I’m thinking now about tech. Specifically, FPCs, for First-Person Credentials. Read what Jamie Smith says about them in his<a href="https://www.customerfutures.com/p/the-most-important-credentials-youve"> Customer Futures</a> newsletter under the headline <a href="https://www.customerfutures.com/p/the-most-important-credentials-youve">The most important credentials you’ve never heard of</a>. Also check out—</p>
 
 What I wrote last year about <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/10/15/identity-as-root/">Identity as Root</a> 
 What <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/celebrating-innovation-winners-of-the-dif-hackathon-2024/">DIF is doing</a> 
 What <a href="https://ayra.forum/">Ayra</a> is doing 
 Other stuff you’ll be hearing about first-person credentials (but isn’t published yet) when you come to <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">the next IIW (April 8-10)</a>. 
 What you’ll be learning soon about re-basing everything (meaning every SKU, as well as every person) on a new framework that is far more worthy of trust than any of the separate collections of records, databases, and namespaces that currently divides a digital world that desperately needs unity and interop—especially around health. And::: 
 MyTerms, which is the new name for<a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/"> IEEE P7012</a>, the upcoming standard (for which I am the working group chair) that should become official later this year, though nothing prevents anyone from putting its simple approach to work. 
 
<p>MyTerms can be huge and world-changing because it flips around the opt-out consent mechanisms that have been pro forma since industry won the industrial revolution and metastasized in the Digital Age. With MyTerms, the sites and services of the world agree to your terms, not the other way around. With MyTerms, truly trusting relationships can be established between customers and companies. This is why I immodestly call it <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">the most important standard in development today</a>.</p>
<p>So I have five simple recommendations for CVS, all to de-enshittify corporate operations and customer experiences:</p>
 
 Drop the whole loyalty thing. Completely. Cold turkey. Hell, fire the marketing department. Put the savings into employees you incentivize to engage productively (not promotionally) with customers. And publicize the hell out of it. Should be fun. 
 Confine your research to what your human employees learn directly from their human customers. 
 Be the best version of what you are: a great pharmacy/convenience store chain that’s still long in health and beauty products. 
 Simplify the app by eliminating all the promotional shit, and by making it as easy as possible for customers to move prescriptions from one&nbsp; CVS store to another. 
 Watch what’s happening with first-person credentials and MyTerms. Getting on board with those will make CVS a leader, rather than a follower. 
 
<p>Coupon-clipping addicts may feel some pain at first, but if you market the new direction well—making clear that you have “everyday low prices” rather than annoying and labor-intensive discounts (many of which expire in three days), customers will come to love you.</p>

 Global payments orchestrator&nbsp;Yuno&nbsp;is launching the&nbsp;Mastercard&nbsp;Payment Passkey Service across Latin America, enabling merchants in the region to streamline online checkout processes and enhance fraud protection. 



<p>Following the launch by Yuno, merchants in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile can replace increasingly vulnerable traditional authentication methods, such as one-time passwords, with Mastercard Payment Passkey Service, which uses device-based&nbsp;<a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/password-usage-stagnates-as-consumers-turn-to-biometrics-and-passkeys-the-fido-alliance-reveals/">biometrics</a>, such as fingerprints and facial recognition already available on smartphones, to authenticate purchases.</p>



<p>Mastercard Payment Passkey Service also leverages tokenisation technology to ensure that sensitive data is never shared with third parties and remains useless to fraudsters in the event of a data breach, making transactions even more secure.</p>



<p>This technology promises to not only boost the security of online transactions, but also to significantly reduce cart abandonment rates by increasing convenience for merchants’ customers.</p>

 Solving energy challenges through collaboration, innovation, and industry driven solutions <p>The energy industry is at a turning point. With decentralization on the rise, evolving regulatory demands, and an urgent push for sustainability, industry leaders must innovate together. That’s why Energy Web is excited to launch Energy Web Circles — a new initiative that brings together enterprises, regulators, and technology providers to create software solutions for today’s energy challenges.</p> A New Model for Collaboration <p>Energy Web Circles are designed to cut through traditional silos by focusing on key issues faced by the energy sector. Each Circle zeroes in on a specific challenge or opportunity, ranging from decentralized identity management, zero carbon electric vehicle charging, to carbon-aware computing and advanced grid management. These groups offer structured, flexible environments where participants can create solutions, share insights, and help shape emerging industry standards.</p> Introducing the First Circle: Universal Energy&nbsp;ID <p>Our inaugural Circle, Universal Energy ID, sets the stage for a more secure and interoperable energy ecosystem. As energy markets become increasingly decentralized, the need for a transparent and standardized identity framework grows. The Universal Energy ID isn’t just an identity solution — it’s a trust layer for the decentralized energy economy. It enables secure, seamless, and interoperable transactions that are essential for modern energy&nbsp;systems.</p> What is the Universal Energy ID&nbsp;Circle? <p>The Universal Energy ID Circle is a collaborative initiative aimed at developing and deploying a decentralized identity and credentialing system for the energy sector. The primary goal is to create a trusted and verifiable identity infrastructure that enables seamless transactions, regulatory compliance, and secure access control across the energy ecosystem. The Circle is designed to foster the development and integration of the EnergyID framework to enable Digital Product Passports (DPPs), e.g. to manage the lifecycle of batteries. For a DPP, this means that information about a product can be stored and updated across a network of various participants (manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, consumers, regulators) without relying on a central entity, making it resistant to censorship and single points of failure. By implementing DPPs, enterprises can drive innovation in electric mobility, enable circular economy practices, and comply with evolving regulatory requirements.</p> What Does the Solution Look&nbsp;Like? <p>At the core of this initiative is the EnergyID DID method, a W3C-compliant Decentralized Identifier (DID) specifically tailored for energy applications. This method provides a secure, tamper-proof way to authenticate energy-related assets, organizations, and individuals. This framework empowers electric mobility providers, distributed energy resource (DER) operators, and digital product passport managers to build trust and security into their transactions, setting a new standard for the industry.</p><p>The solution comprises:</p>  Universal EnergyID Wallet — A digital identity wallet that allows energy stakeholders (such as utilities, DER owners, and EV users) to store and manage their decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials.  Verifiable Credentials (VCs) — These digital attestations enable secure proof of identity, asset ownership, and regulatory compliance in energy transactions.  Interoperability Layer — Designed to integrate with existing identity management systems and ensure compatibility with global standards such as eIDAS&nbsp;2.0.  Trust and Governance Framework — A decentralized governance structure ensuring that credential issuance and verification are secure, reliable, and universally accepted.  <p>How It Works in&nbsp;Practice</p>  For Electric Vehicle Charging: EV owners can use their Universal EnergyID to authenticate at any charging station, ensuring trusted, frictionless access without relying on siloed authentication systems.  For Distributed Energy Resources (DERs): A solar panel or battery storage unit can have a unique, verifiable identity that allows grid operators to authenticate its participation in energy&nbsp;markets.  For Energy Data Sovereignty: Consumers can control who has access to their energy data, ensuring privacy and security while enabling seamless energy transactions.  For Regulatory Compliance: Businesses and energy providers can automatically prove adherence to compliance standards through digitally signed verifiable credentials.  <p>Key Benefits of Universal Energy&nbsp;ID</p>  Unified Identity Management: It provides a single standard for managing identities across energy, electric mobility, and beyond, eliminating fragmentation.  Proven Adoption: Major enterprises and OEMs are already adopting this framework, demonstrating real-world traction.  Regulatory Alignment: Built to align with standards like eIDAS and Digital Product Passports, it ensures both compliance and scalability.  Open and Interoperable: The solution is integrated with leading open-source identity frameworks, including OWF and ACA-Py, making it adaptable to various use&nbsp;cases.  Secure Communication: <a href="http://www.energywebx.com">Worker nodes</a> in Energy Web act as DIDComm mediators and relayers, ensuring secure, reliable communication in decentralized identity ecosystems.  Automated Billing: The system supports automated and trustworthy billing for energy consumed and produced, reducing administrative friction  <p>Join the Movement<br>Energy Web Circles are open to all businesses interested in advancing digitization and decarbonization in the energy sector. Whether you’re an existing Energy Web member or a new partner, your expertise is welcome. By joining a Circle, you&nbsp;will:</p>  Shape Emerging Standards: Play a direct role in developing the technologies and protocols that will define the future of&nbsp;energy.  Access Exclusive Insights: Gain early access to research, reports, and discussions that keep you at the cutting&nbsp;edge.  Collaborate Globally: Work alongside leaders in energy, sustainability, and technology to drive innovation and&nbsp;change.   Call to Action: Join the Universal Energy ID Circle or create your own&nbsp;Circle <p>If digital identity, verifiable credentials, and seamless interoperability in energy can create value for your business, the Universal Energy ID Circle is for you. Whether you’re an enterprise ready to integrate decentralized identity solutions or a regulator committed to enhancing compliance mechanisms, now is the time to get involved. Or do you have a compelling use case or a challenge that could benefit from industry-wide collaboration?</p><p>The future of energy is collaborative, decentralized, and digital.

 Current Landscape 



<p>The finance and regulatory sectors are undergoing rapid digital transformation. While the industry pioneers new technology and moves away from conventional platforms, it faces rising fraud, privacy breaches, and growing consumer skepticism fueled by misinformation, disinformation, and challenges verifying information in an AI-driven world.</p>



<p>When Finance Canada’s Electronic Task Force for Payments System Review created DIACC in 2012, its goal was to unite public and private sector partners to develop a secure digital ecosystem. This goal remains, but the need to support a future-focused ecosystem underpinned by verification and authentication is more urgent than ever.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust, Canada can secure its financial systems and enhance competitiveness in the global economy. Interoperable frameworks like the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF) ensure systems remain resilient, adaptable, and trusted.</p>



 Advancing and Evolving Digital Trust in the Finance and Regulatory Sectors 



 
 Strengthening Economic Competitiveness and Growth 
 



<p>Preventing fraud and building consumer trust are economic imperatives. Fraud costs taxpayers and businesses millions annually, and to ensure Canada remains competitive, we must adopt robust digital trust solutions to reduce fraud’s financial and operational impact. Adopting the right measures will also help Canada attract international investment, foster innovation in financial services, drive growth, and create jobs.</p>



 
 Enhancing Trust Through the DIACC PCTF to Complement KYC and AML 
 



<p>DIACC encourages its members in finance and payments to adopt the PCTF as a tool to:</p>



 
 Complement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations by enhancing remote customer onboarding; 



 Authenticate identities with trusted verification systems to reduce fraud in online transactions, digital wallets, and mobile banking; and 



 Improve regulatory reporting efficiencies by using verifiable credentials for entity identification. 
 



<p>The PCTF is a critical resource for advancing interoperability, which supports trusted cross-institutional collaboration and strengthens the financial ecosystem.</p>



 
 Fostering Consumer Autonomy and Addressing Misinformation 
 



<p>Public skepticism fueled by misinformation and disinformation creates friction in adopting digital financial platforms. To tackle this, we can do the following:</p>



 
 Respect consumer autonomy: DIACC advocates for voluntary digital solutions that preserve traditional verification methods while offering enhanced, secure options. 



 Promote digital literacy: Educational campaigns can strengthen consumer confidence by helping Canadians identify trustworthy institutions. 



 Use “trust signals”: Institutions should adopt trust signals, such as verified logos or PCTF certification badges, to reassure customers of secure practices. 
 



<p>These efforts respect the diverse preferences of Canadians while promoting confidence in digital services.</p>



 
 Proactive Fraud Prevention and Responsible Innovation 
 



<p>Fraud prevention is not just about mitigation—it’s about staying ahead. To reduce incidents such as mortgage fraud and title insurance scams, we must:</p>



 
 Adopt an approach that complements existing client identification methods and includes verifiable credentials, mobile driver licenses and trust registries; financial institutions should integrate DIACC PCTF-aligned solutions to strengthen borrower identification and secure digital proof of ownership. 



 Leverage responsible AI for risk detection — fraud prevention measures must include responsible AI and real-time analytics to detect anomalies, mitigate risks, and reduce operational costs.<br> 
 



 
 Open Banking and the Future of Finance 
 



<p>The government’s commitment to open banking presents opportunities for financial innovation and introduces risks without secure digital trust frameworks. DIACC’s members are encouraged to:</p>



 
 Use the PCTF to establish interoperable risk management practices, ensuring trusted data sharing across institutions. 



 Mitigate risks in consumer-permissioned data sharing by implementing robust verification systems that prioritize data privacy and transparency. 



 Align with global open banking standards to ensure Canadian institutions remain competitive and attract international investment. 
 



<p>Open banking offers an opportunity to empower Canadian consumers and small businesses while strengthening the role of domestic innovation on the global stage.</p>



 Best Practices and the Way Forward 



 
 Enhance Digital Trust with Emerging Technologies 
 



<p>Canada must adopt emerging technologies to stay globally competitive. Financial institutions can use verifiable data and responsible AI to enhance fraud detection, wallets, credentialing, and compliance.</p>



 
 Collaborate for Global Competitiveness 
 



<p>Collaboration with international regulators and organizations is essential for aligning Canadian frameworks with global norms, enabling secure cross-border transactions and strengthening Canada’s financial ecosystem.</p>



 
 Educate and Empower Through Advocacy and Metrics 
 



<p>DIACC is committed to educating Canadians on digital literacy and trust while addressing inclusivity challenges, including:</p>



 
 Hosting sector-specific workshops and certifications to promote best practices in digital trust. 



 Amplifying simple, real-world use cases to demonstrate the benefits of digital trust solutions, such as fraud reduction and consumer empowerment. 



 Advocating for enhanced regulations prioritizing secure transactions and privacy while preserving consumer choice. 



 Publishing annual metrics on fraud prevention and consumer trust improvements to ensure transparency and accountability. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>The finance and regulatory sectors urgently need services with interoperable assurance and trust to meet the growing demands of digital transformation.</p>



<p>By working together, we can:</p>



 
 Educate citizens to strengthen digital literacy while addressing inclusivity challenges. 



 Amplify the role of governments and domestic and world banks in strengthening trust. 



 Determine how governments and organizations can best leverage the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework to complement KYC and AML regulations, build assurance, and mitigate risks for the benefit of all Canadians. 
 



<p>Through education, collaboration, and the strategic use of trusted solutions, we can solidify Canada’s position as a global leader in the digital economy while safeguarding trust, privacy, and economic opportunity for all Canadians.</p>

<p>I started reading <a href="https://boingboing.net/2">BoiongBoing</a> when it was a ‘zine back in the last millennium. I stopped when I began hitting this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In fact I don’t block ads. I block tracking, specifically with <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger,</a> from the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>.</p>
<p>But BoingBoing, like countless other websites, confuses tracking protection with ad blocking. This is because they are in the surveillance-aimed advertising business, aka adtech.</p>
<p>It’s essential to know that adtech is descended from the junk mail business, euphemistically called “direct response marketing.” As I put it in&nbsp;<a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/separating-advertisings-wheat-and-chaff-47858adfcb20#.i6msx57rv">Separating Advertising’s Wheat and Chaff</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember the movie “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>?” (Or the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers_%281978_film%29">remake by the same name</a>?) Same thing here. Madison Avenue fell asleep, direct response marketing ate its brain, and it woke up as an alien replica of itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As surveillance-based publications go, BoingBoing is especially bad. <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/boingboing.net%2F2023%2F11%2F01%2Frob-liefelds-infamous-big-chested-captain-america-artwork-is-up-for-auction.html?f=">Here is a PageXray of BoingBoing.net</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/boingboing.net%2F2023%2F11%2F01%2Frob-liefelds-infamous-big-chested-captain-america-artwork-is-up-for-auction.html%3F_bhlid%3De8eb9749113b90546c13fe8887a19e45cdcdc356?f=">here is a PageXray of the same page’s URL, to which&nbsp; tracking cruft from the email I opened was appended</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/boingboing.net%2F2023%2F11%2F01%2Frob-liefelds-infamous-big-chested-captain-america-artwork-is-up-for-auction.html%3F_bhlid%3De8eb9749113b90546c13fe8887a19e45cdcdc356?f="></a><br>
Look at that: 461 adserver requests, 426 tracking requests, and 199 other requests, which BoingBoing is glad to provide. (Pro tip: always strip tracking cruft from URLs that feature a “?” plus lots of alphanumeric jive after the final / of the URL itself. Take out the “?” and everything after it. )</p>
<p>Here is a close-up of one small part of that vast spread of routes down which data about you flows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some sites, such as <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/">FlightAware</a>, interrupt your experience with a notice that kindly features an X in a corner, so you can make it go away:</p>
<p></p><a href="https://www.flightaware.com/"></a>Which I do.<p></p>
<p>But BoingBoing doesn’t. Its policy is “Subscribe or pay with lost privacy.”&nbsp; So I go away.</p>
<p>Other sites use cookie notices that give you options such as these from a Disney company (I forget which):</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nice that you can Reject All. Which I do.</p>
<p>This one from imgur let’s you “manage” your “options.” Those, if they are kept anywhere (you can’t tell), are in some place you can’t reach or use to see what your setting was, or if they haven’t violated your privacy:</p>
<p></p>This one at Claude defaults to no tracking for marketing purposes (analytics and marketing switches are set to Off):<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>TED here also lets you Accept All or Reject All:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve noticed that Reject All tends to be a much more prominent option lately. This makes me think a lot of these sites should be ready for <a href="http://This%20draft%20standard%20covers%20contractual%20interactions%20and%20agreements%20between%20individuals%20and%20the%20service%20providers%20they%20engage%20on%20a%20network,%20including%20websites.%20It%20describes%20how%20individuals,%20acting%20as%20first%20parties,%20can%20proffer%20their%20privacy%20requirements%20as%20contractual%20terms%20and%20arrive%20at%20agreements%20recorded%20and%20kept%20by%20both%20sides.%20These%20terms%20shall%20be%20chosen%20from%20a%20collection%20of%20standard-form%20agreements%20in%20a%20roster%20kept%20by%20an%20independent%20and%20neutral%20non-business%20entity.%20Computing%20devices%20and%20software%20performing%20as%20agents%20for%20both%20first%20and%20second%20parties%20shall%20engage%20using%20any%20protocol%20that%20serves%20the%20purpose.%20The%20first%20party%20shall%20point%20to%20a%20preferred%20agreement,%20or%20a%20set%20of%20agreements,%20from%20which%20the%20second%20party%20shall%20accept%20one.%20Party-to-party%20negotiations%20over%20terms%20in%20any%20of%20these%20contracts%20or%20other%20agreements%20are%20outside%20the%20scope%20of%20this%20standard.%20If%20both%20parties%20agree,%20the%20chosen%20contract%20or%20agreement%20shall%20be%20signed%20electronically%20by%20both%20parties%20or%20their%20agents,%20and%20a%20matching%20record%20shall%20be%20kept%20by%20both%20sides%20in%20a%20form%20that%20can%20be%20retrieved,%20audited,%20or%20disputed,%20if%20necessary,%20at%20some%20later%20time–and%20which%20is%20available%20to%20do%20so%20easily.">IEEE P7012, nicknamed MyTerms</a>, which we expect to become a working standard sometime this year. (I chair the working group.) I believe MyTerms is <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">the most important standard in development today</a> because it gets rid of this shit—at least for sites that respect the Reject All signal, plus the millions (perhaps billions?) of sites that don’t participate in the surveillance economy.</p>
<p>With MyTerms, sites and services agree to your terms—not the other way around. And it’s a contract. Also, both sides record the agreement, so either can audit compliance later.</p>
<p>Your agent (typically your browser, through an extension or a header) will choose to proffer one of a small list of contractual agreements maintained by a disinterested nonprofit. <a href="https://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a> was created for this purpose (as a spin-off of ProjectVRM).

Our parent company, <a href="https://3boxlabs.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">3Box Labs</a>, has merged with <a href="https://x.com/textileio?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Textile</a>. With this, Ceramic is joining the Textile family alongside their other decentralized data solutions, Tableland DB and Basin Network.</p><p>Since Ceramic’s inception, the crypto industry has changed dramatically, and with it, the types of applications developers are building with decentralized and composable data. As AI agents reshape our digital landscape and become the primary producers and consumers of data, they bring needs very familiar to the Ceramic community: decentralized storage for knowledge and memory, open composability for sharing between agents, and streaming for real-time publishing and subscriptions.</p><p>Going forward, we have a vision for Ceramic as a foundational component of something much bigger than itself: an open intelligence network where AI agents can autonomously buy and sell intelligence from each other on-demand. Agents can plug-in to supercharge their own knowledge and capabilities, delegate tasks to agents who specialize in that skill, or publish and monetize their own expertise — all onchain. For this new network, Ceramic will play a vital role in empowering agent-to-agent communication and knowledge streaming alongside other storage technologies built by Textile.</p><p>Ceramic will continue operating with no disruption to current development or customers, but now you’ll have the added benefit of being connected to a whole new network of agents willing and able to pay for your datasets.</p><p>Read our announcement on X for more details and be sure to follow <a href="https://x.com/textileio?ref=blog.ceramic.network">@textileio </a>for future updates.</p><blockquote><p>1/10: Big News!

<p>This review period has closed as of March 20, 2025.</p>



<p>Notice of Intent: DIACC is collaborating to develop and publish the Law Society Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) to set a baseline interoperability of identity services and solutions used in the legal sector. During this public review period, DIACC is looking for community feedback to ensure that the conformance criteria is clear and auditable.</p>



<p>Accompanying this review period is the PCTF Glossary that has been updated to reflect all current terms and definitions found across the suite of PCTF documentation.</p>



<p>To learn more about the Pan-Canadian vision and benefits-for-all value proposition please review the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Overview</a>.</p>



<p>Document Status: These review documents have been developed by members of the DIACC’s <a href="https://diacc.ca/committees/">Trust Framework Expert Committee</a> (TFEC) who operate under the DIACC controlling policies and consist of representatives from both the private and public sectors. These documents have been approved by the TFEC for public comment.</p>

<p>On January 31, Christopher Allen spoke with Mathieu Glaude at the SSI Orbit Podcast on the controversial topic <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/ssi-bankruptcy/">“Has Our SSI Ecosystem Become Morally Bankrupt?”</a>. Following the video link, below, are Christopher’s Musings  on the topic, overviewing some of the material from the video.</p>

 



 
    
   

<p>The legitimacy of the modern self-sovereign identity (SSI) industry is a vital question to ask, because in the last year I’ve become to wonder if DIDs and VCs could actually lose. In my opinion, the main threat is that we made compromises in the development of these new self-sovereign technologies that led to them not being differentiated from centralized identity. We betrayed our principles.</p>

<p>But that was actually a pretty small portion of a wide-ranging discussion of identity between myself and Mathieu that I hope you’ll listen to. It also covered my history, the history of SSI, the ideals of SSI, how we’re losing them, and where that could lead us. (Spoiler: it’s not a good place.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We’ve seen what happens when you have too much control in a single authority … and we’re forgetting those lessons. We have to minimize the risks when [authorities] are wrong or their powers are abused.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My own history in the cryptography &amp; identity field dates back to meeting the founders of the Xanada Project, working with RSA, writing SSLRef, coauthoring TLS, and working with elliptic curves. This history all offers ideas for digital identity! For example, Xanadu was one of the inspirations for my ideas of edge identifiers &amp; cryptographic cliques that I recently released.</p>

<p>I also talked about how self-sovereign identity, DIDs, and VCs all matured at Rebooting the Web of Trust. Early on, we worked with experts from the UN and people working with the refuge crisis. We had all the right ingredients! But it’s so easy to lose the ideals behind a technology. Groupware lost its collaborative processes. TLS became centralized. We had ten principles for self-sovereign identity, but they’ve been somewhat lost.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Somehow we disconnect our words from where the real power is, which is anti-coercion and anti-violence.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always intended those principles to be a starting point. I was surprised when folks at RWOT weren’t interested in reviewing and revising them. Now, that disinterest has resulted in SSI technology that’s losing against MDLs and other centralized tech. Part of the problem is that privacy doesn’t seem important to people. I think it’s a vocabulary disconnect. Privacy allows us to avoid violence and coercion. Maybe those are the words we need to concentrate on!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we’ve seen what happens if we walk this path. Jacobus Lentz’s enthusiastic identity work leading up to WWII led to genocide in the Netherlands. That’s what happens when identity is centralized.</p>

<p>We need to talk more about all of these aspects of identity, so that the digital identity of the 21st century protects our basic human rights. I hope you’ll join me in discussion here or in the Youtube comments.</p>

 
 The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity Links 

<p>Christopher Allen is a long-term advocate for self-sovereign identity. He popularized the term and laid out an initial set of principles in his foundational article, <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>, coauthored the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.1/">DID spec for W3c</a>, and founded the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops</a> that advanced the technology for a decade.

<p>Why You Should Consider the FDO Standard for Zero-Trust Device Onboarding</p>



 1. Executive Summary 



<p>IoT and edge computing solutions are exploding as manufacturers are looking for new ways to modernize their operations and accelerate production. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/nternet-of-Things-IoT-connected-devices-from-2015-to-2025-in-billions_fig1_325645304#:~:text=As%20shown%20in%20Fig.,%2C14%5D.%20...">By 2025, over 75 billion IoT devices will be connected globally.</a> The industrial IoT market, which spans industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and retail is <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5359988/industrial-iot-market-by-offering-hardware">valued at USD 194 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 286 billion by 2029</a>. This surge unlocks immense opportunities and innovation for businesses and manufacturers alike. However, keeping up with the pace of demand for these devices and deploying them sustainably has created unprecedented challenges.</p>



<p>Namely, two key factors have the potential to derail the edge revolution entirely:</p>



 
 Costly and inefficient installation processes 



 Security vulnerabilities 
 



 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Guide-Onboarding-the-Future-Edge-Deployment-FDO-FIDO-Alliance-2025.pdf">Download the FDO Guide</a> 
 



 2. What is Onboarding? 



<p>When an edge node or IoT device is installed in a facility, the device must be onboarded to its management platform hosted in the building or in the cloud.</p>



 The Onboarding Challenge 



<p>Device onboarding at scale is expensive and can introduce significant risks if not done properly. Meanwhile, typical manual onboarding processes and default passwords have created severe vulnerabilities, with <a href="https://iotbusinessnews.com/download/white-papers/UNIT42-IoT-Threat-Report.pdf#:~:text=57%%20of%20IoT%20devices%20are%20vulnerable%20to,and%20password%20attacks%20using%20default%20device%20passwords.">57% of IoT devices vulnerable to medium or high-severity attacks</a>.<br></p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nearly half (48%) of critical infrastructure security leaders reported experiencing at least one major security impact due to a compromised device within the last year.</p>
</blockquote>



 What is FIDO Device Onboarding (FDO)? 



<p>FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) is a revolutionary standard designed to simplify, secure, and automate the onboarding process for IoT and edge devices. FDO simplifies device onboarding in edge and&nbsp; IoT computing environments with a plug and play, zero trust approach embedded in the specification. Developed by industry leaders like Arm, Amazon, Google, Intel, Microsoft and Qualcomm, the specification is one of the first openly available standards designed specifically to solve edge and&nbsp; IoT onboarding challenges: time-intensive, complex manual processes, high costs, and security vulnerabilities. It is targeted at industrial, medical, automotive, IT and retail use cases and is complemented by an independent certification program.&nbsp;</p>



 3. The Overlooked Opportunity and Risk 



<p>With the introduction of AI, a new layer of complexity was added to the edge challenge. Organizations are now hyper-focused on AI adoption and its promise of smarter, faster, and more efficient operations, but without addressing foundational IoT security, these ambitions are at risk of being undermined.</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance Device Onboard (FDO) provides the answer, offering a zero trust, plug and play standard that accelerates deployments while safeguarding infrastructure. In today’s challenging economic climate, automating zero-touch device onboarding enables leaders to deliver ambitious digital transformation projects with limited resources and budgets, saving installation costs, accelerating time-to-value, and improving security. FDO is an open standard that allows users to innovate. FDO’s zero-trust approach is an important piece of the IoT security puzzle and sets the stage for future AI updates inside protected enclaves.</p>



 Which industries benefit from FDO? 



IndustriesAutomotiveHealthcareChemicalManufacturingConsumer goods manufacturingOil and GasEnergyRetailEducationSupply chain and logisticsEnterprise and NetworkingTelecommunications



 What Device Types Can Be Enabled with FDO? 



Device TypesExamplesIoT sensors and devicesTemperature sensorsPressure sensors&nbsp;Motion detectorsWater quality monitorsSmart thermostatsConnected industrial equipmentSmart camerasWi-Fi-enabled cameras<br>Camera systemsEdge serversEdge serversMobile edge computing (MEC) serversNetworking equipmentRoutersSwitches&nbsp;Gateways5G small cellsIndustrial PCs and controllersIndustrial PCsProgrammable logic controllers (PLCs)Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs)



<p>Just as passkeys revolutionized user authentication, FDO is transforming device onboarding in edge computing and IoT environments.</p>



 Key Features of FDO 



<p>The key features of FDO include:</p>



 
 Late binding: Late binding saves money and time as FDO-enabled devices can be onboarded to any platform without the need for unique customization. This reduces the number of device SKUs needed versus other onboarding solutions. It ensures devices are authenticated and provisioned properly for the device recipient after ownership is verified. 



 Plug and Play: Whereas manual onboarding requires expensive, skilled technicians, FDO is highly automated, often allowing semi-skilled staff to carry out the installation. This is important in markets such as retail where FDO will allow the store manager to do the installation rather than needing to bring in an expensive IT expert. 



 Ownership voucher: Device ownership is established and transferred securely in the supply chain with the “ownership voucher,” which uses cryptographic authentication protocols in the FDO specification to verify the device recipient’s physical and digital ownership. 



 Zero-touch and zero trust: Combined, these attributes establish a zero trust approach that covers end-to-end device onboarding using embedded, cryptographic protocols, and sequential processes to perform initial onboarding actions securely and quickly. The zero trust strategy covers both the device and the management platform during the onboarding process. 
 



 FDO for AI and Additional Features 



<p>FDO is designed to permit a secure subsystem to onboard independently and securely from the rest of the system. This makes FDO an excellent candidate for updating AI models deployed in edge secure enclaves from a cloud repository.</p>



<p>Additional features include:</p>



 
 Interoperability with OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) 



 Wi-Fi ready 



 Flexible configurations for cloud, multi-cloud, and closed network environments with multi-tenant and cloud servers 



 Multiple open source implementation methods available 
 







 3. FDO Certified Products 



<p>The FIDO Alliance is an open industry association with a mission to reduce the world’s reliance on passwords. Consisting of the biggest global tech organizations and experts in cybersecurity, identity, and authentication, the alliance has a proven track record in transforming consumer authentication with passkeys.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>In two years since the initial launch, passkeys have been enabled on 20% of the world’s top 100 websites and over 15 billion accounts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The FIDO Alliance has launched this complementary independent certification program that brings additional value to end users and solution providers alike. It assures that FDO certified solutions meet all the specifications, that devices comply with all security requirements, and have been tested for interoperability with other products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FDO Certified products bring considerable additional value to end users by offering:</p>



 
 Guaranteed interoperability and security assurance 



 Faster deployments and time to value&nbsp; 



 Greater efficiencies 



 Assures security and interoperability, eliminating the need for time-consuming vendor bake-offs with uncertified or homebrewed onboarding solutions 
 



<p>Now FIDO is applying this expertise to improve device authentication in industrial IoT and edge computing environments. FDO ensures devices and edge nodes can quickly and securely authenticate and connect online during initial deployment.</p>



 4. On the Edge: The Urgency to Secure and Simplify Device Security 



<p>Operational bottlenecks are a significant challenge in both industrial and commercial sectors. Manual, unsecured device onboarding not only consumes time and resources but also increases the risk of breaches. According to Microsoft’s recent white paper, <a href="https://clouddamcdnprodep.azureedge.net/gdc/gdcQll0SB/original">How to Scale Intelligent Factory Initiatives Through an Adaptive Cloud Approach</a>, today’s manufacturing leaders are burdened with “technical sprawl and inefficiencies that create major obstacles to being able to scale solutions – including AI – to multiple production lines and geographically dispersed factories.”</p>



<p>This technical sprawl has led to data silos and management complexities, hindering global visibility and scalability. Ultimately, this prohibits the promise of connected devices from being realized in any industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The average cost of a data breach in 2023 was <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">$4.88 million</a> (USD).</p>



<p>Edge implementations involve a lot of risk. Often these edge nodes are used in remote, precarious, and high-risk environments. Industries like healthcare, energy, and manufacturing face unique challenges and regulations, such as vulnerable patient monitoring systems, hazardous environments, and risks to complex supply chains. To make matters more complex, new threats are constantly emerging, such as the rise of quantum computing and zero-day exploits.</p>



<p>Some companies may feel that they can develop their own proprietary onboarding solution, but given today’s economic pressures and the growing threat landscape, businesses often simply cannot afford to develop and maintain proprietary solutions or risk a preventable breach.</p>



 FDO and AI: A Symbiotic Future 



<p>Edge and IoT are also the “eyes and ears” of AI, collecting and transmitting data for analysis. There is a huge risk in overlooking IoT security and threats such as data poisoning, which can cripple AI models reliant on real-time data. Securing the foundation of edge and IoT is essential to unlock the full potential of AI.</p>



<p>AI systems depend on clean, reliable data streams. A compromised IoT device does not just threaten the device itself – it can corrupt AI models, disrupt decision-making, and open doors to adversarial attacks. FDO’s zero trust onboarding ensures these vulnerabilities are eliminated from the start.</p>



 5. What Problems Does FDO Solve? 



 
 Human error: <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">34% of data breaches involve human error</a> – FDO minimizes this with automation and a zero-touch approach.&nbsp; 



 Time-intensive and inefficient deployments: FDO can deploy 10 times faster than manual methods. It dramatically reduces the time and budget needed to hire skilled technicians in high-risk environments, like oil rigs and factories. In some applications, such as retail, existing on-site staff can install FDO as it is plug and play technology. 



 Market speed to innovation: Open standards help advance innovation and level the competitive playing field. By standardizing processes, providers can focus on truly adding value to their solutions. For customers, they can benefit from better solutions that are faster to deploy and more secure. 
 







 Device Security Risks&nbsp; – The Supply Chain Lifecycle 



<p>Stage 1: Manufacturing<br>Risk: Supply chain compromises (i.e., tampered devices)<br>FDO: Establishes cryptographic ownership during manufacturing, ensuring device integrity</p>



<p>Stage 2: Shipment and storage<br>Risk: Device ownership asset mismanagement<br>FDO: Tracks and secures ownership transfers, maintaining a secure chain of custody</p>



<p>Stage 3: Onboarding and deployment<br>Risk: Exposures from default passwords and manual installation errors<br>FDO: Eliminates passwords and human errors with plug and play device onboarding and zero-touch automation</p>



<p>Stage 4: Operations&nbsp;<br>Risk: Insecure data transmission, spoofing and infiltration<br>FDO: Encrypts data exchanges and ensures ongoing device authentication&nbsp;</p>



 6. Benefits of FDO for Enterprises and Providers 



<p>Standards are vital to unlocking the full potential of any major global technology innovation. Global industry standard initiatives help remove huge amounts of waste, advance technology far more quickly, and increase market competitiveness. Standards also provide long-term security. As threats evolve, experts in the field continue to evolve the standards to keep up.</p>



<p>The FDO standards have been developed and backed by the best companies in the industry, including Microsoft, Dell, and Intel. Experts from these organizations proactively work together to develop use cases and best practices for seamless and secure IoT device authentication, provisioning, and also support the adoption and implementation of the FDO standard.</p>



<p>The FDO standard is also continuously improved within the FIDO Alliance. In the last two years, several Application Notes have been released to deal with implementation and other areas related to FDO 1.1. The newest version of the standard, FDO 1.2, is currently in development with new enterprise-ready features and is expected to be released in 2025.</p>



<p>Benefits for enterprises:</p>



 
 Protect devices and supply chains with zero trust security. 



 Integration is flexible with existing systems.&nbsp; 



 Reduce the need to develop and manage your own testing requirements and protocols – buy with confidence with FDO certified products.&nbsp; 



 Reduce time to market/deployment and increase value. 
 



<p>Benefits for providers:</p>



 
 Leverage FDO certification as a competitive advantage. Ensure compatibility and earn customer trust with external independent validation. This becomes increasingly valuable as market adoption rises and FDO is increasingly referenced in Requests for Proposals (RFPs). 
 



 
 Realize hardware efficiencies, simplify production, and reduce waste. As with FDO, operating systems can be deployed on-site and do not need to be hard programmed in. This capability is now part of an active workstream within the FDO Working Group called “Bare Metal Onboarding”. 



 Fast-track solution development with confidence. 



 Free engineer time to focus on higher value projects rather than waste time with manual or proprietary onboarding solutions. Offer a faster, more efficient solution to customers.<br>
