 In 1958, Oliver R. Smoot, a student at MIT, was famously used as a human measuring stick to measure the length of the Harvard Bridge. Smoot, measuring a mere 5 foot 7 inches (1.70 m), would lay down on the bridge as his associates noted his position.

 Mike Kiser and Jen Schreiber 
<p>Beyond the immediate promise of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">Shared Signals Framework</a> in managing live sessions through <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-ID2.html">CAEP</a> events, an event-based approach offers a compelling path forward for addressing longer-term identity challenges. One such challenge is identity lifecycle management, or provisioning and deprovisioning.</p>
 Challenges of provisioning 
<p>Many underestimate the challenges of provisioning; for those who have not considered it, it may appear relatively simple on the outside. Much like watching a talented busker juggling on the streets of…oh, really any international city…say London, for no real reason other than <a href="https://openid.net/authzen-shared-signals-in-the-gartner-iam-2025-spotlight/">the (most recent) interop held in that fine city</a>.</p>
<p>Watching someone juggle looks easy, and starts relatively simple. A couple of balls fly into the air and bounce between the hands of the performer. Back and forth go the objects. The transfer seems simple, easy. And provisioning can, indeed, be like that: two discrete systems with fairly similar schemas and use cases (like an HR syncing into a local employee directory). But keep watching the busker…things rapidly get more complicated. Now instead of two objects, there are six or eight. The balls are exchanged for sticks, which are then set on fire. Now things aren’t so simple or easy, are they? The real world of provisioning escalates in much the same way; as the number of systems proliferate, so do the interconnections that must be maintained. This soon becomes an intractable problem (even without setting it on fire).</p>
<p>In an effort to address the challenges of managing the lifecycle of an identity, the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644.html">System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM)</a> was created. While SCIM has seen some success in connecting identity repositories, the rise of event-based architectures points to the need for SCIM to move from transactional and bulk operations to an event-based and asynchronous approach that allows interconnected systems to share identity context and data in near real time.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scim-events/">SCIM Profile for Security Event Tokens</a> seeks to provide a pathway for SCIM in event-based architectures.</p>
 Playing off the standards 
<p>SCIM events employ existing standards to accomplish this goal, using the same format of Security Event Tokens as in CAEP and <a href="https://openid.github.io/sharedsignals/openid-risc-profile-specification-1_0.html">Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination (RISC)</a> events. It’s important to note that while SCIM Events may use the Shared Signals Framework as a transport layer, it does not require it. The juggler may be tossing objects in the air or water, they might be throwing clubs, rings, or balls. It’s all entertaining. SCIM events can be transported via push/pull over HTTP, streaming technologies like <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html">Kinesis</a>, webhooks, or SSF. The specification is agnostic. That said, the popularity of the Shared Signals Framework may make it a preferred option.</p>
 Syncing vs Notification: A diverse approach 
<p>With the adoption of an event-based approach, this iteration of SCIM allows for more than just a flow of updated information; while some systems may need and be able to process a</p>
<p>stream of events, others may prefer to be only notified of changes. In practice, this allows them to request only the changes that they’re interested in on a secure back channel, saving effort and preserving privacy. Other systems may need to process asynchronously, dealing with this new information on their own, independent timeline. The standard allows for this customizable approach, making it flexible for a diverse set of architectures.</p>
 Benefits of real time SCIM events 
<p>The ability of SCIM Events to support real time provisioning is significant. Once adoption takes place and real-time updates can be shared within an enterprise system, zero standing privilege (and zero trust) becomes one step closer to a reality. Making changes in real time means that access is no longer permanent, it is provisioned as an identity requires it, and then removed once it is no longer needed.</p>
<p>SCIM events hold more promise than provisioning alone, by ingesting data from various sources in real time, a system finds its true security potential. An access policy that an organization wants to enforce needs current data and attributes. With input from SCIM events alongside CAEP and RISC as the sources of real-time information, the policy becomes as current as it can be.</p>
<p>Privacy from data minimization will greatly benefit with the adoption of SCIM events. Limiting data collection to only what is necessary is fundamental to privacy approaches. Minimal information SCIM events allows receivers to decide which attributes or resource lifecycle changes it can accept. Or, for a transmitter to restrict a receiving domain. Less data acquired translates to less risk for the organization.</p>
<p>Within a system, SCIM events can be used as a reaction to CAEP and RISC events. When these events relay that a session has been eliminated, the system can react to the underlying attributes data and to the&nbsp;accounts themselves to prevent future use.</p>
<p>Finally, an auditable record of everything that takes place within an organization is essential to prove compliance and risk detection within the enterprise. It is not enough to eliminate invalid sessions or adjust access and entitlements, all actions taken within a system must be recorded to ensure that it is “living by its own rules” and doing precisely what it claims to be doing. Thus, SCIM events enable not only provisioning in real time, but auditing and governance as well.</p>
 SCIM Events: A logical step 
<p>By adopting SCIM events, we move closer to addressing the long-term problem of provisioning: fragmented data stores, proprietary interfaces, and a disjointed approach to identity – the historical equivalent to juggling fire. But we achieve more than that as we move into this new paradigm: we gain real-time context for enhanced policy-based decision making. We bolster privacy-enhancing approaches to data minimization. We create concrete responses to CAEP and RISC events. And we do it all with an audit record that proves that we are moving closer to our goal – a world in which access is not available except when it is necessary.</p>
<p>In short, SCIM Events moves provisioning from a task that only seems simple into one that actually is. (The authors are still working on the other intractable problem: keeping five flaming bowling pins in the air simultaneously.)</p>

 Embedding Ethics for Audiences aged&nbsp;14–19 <p>WAO is currently working with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/responsible-innovation-centre">Responsible Innovation Centre for Public Media Futures</a> (RIC), which is hosted by the BBC. The project, which you can read about in our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-does-ai-literacy-look-like-for-young-people-aged-14-19-8b4d798eb369">kick-off post</a>, is focused on research and analysis to help the BBC create policies and content to help improve the AI Literacy skills of young people aged&nbsp;14–19.</p><p>We’re now at the stage where we’ve reviewed academic articles and resources, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-makes-for-a-good-ai-literacy-framework-423c57f01e9a">scrutinised frameworks</a>, and reviewed input from over 40 experts in the field. They are thanked in the acknowledgements section at the end of this&nbsp;post.</p><p>One of the things that has come up time and again is the need for an ethical basis for this kind of work. As a result, in this post we want to share the core values that inform the development of our (upcoming) gap analysis, framework, and recommendations.</p> Public Service Media&nbsp;Values <p>Public Service Media (PSM) organisations such as the BBC have a mission to “inform, educate, and entertain” the public. The Public Media Alliance lists <a href="https://www.publicmediaalliance.org/understanding-public-service-media/">seven PSM values</a> underpinning organisations’ work as&nbsp;being:</p>  Accountability: to the public who fund it and hold power to&nbsp;account  Accessibility: to the breadth of a national population across multiple platforms  Impartiality: in news and quality journalist and content that informs, educates, and entertains  Independence: both in terms of ownership and editorial values  Pluralism: PSM should exist as part of a diverse media landscape  Reliability: especially during crises and emergencies and tackling disinformation  Universalism: in their availability and representation of diversity  <p>These values are helpful to frame core values for the development of AI Literacy in young people aged&nbsp;14–19.</p> AI Literacy Core&nbsp;Values <p>Using the PSM values as a starting point, along with our input from experts and our desk research, we have identified the following core values. These are also summarised in the graphic at the top of this&nbsp;post.</p> 1. Human Agency and Empowerment <p>AI Literacy should empower young people to make informed, independent choices about how, when, and whether to use AI. This means helping develop not just technical ability, but also confidence, curiosity, and a sense of agency in shaping technology, rather than being shaped by it (UNESCO, 2024a; Opened Culture, n.d.). Learners should be encouraged to question, critique, adapt, and even resist AI systems, supporting both individual and collective agency.</p> 2. Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion <p>All young people, regardless of background, ability, or circumstance should have meaningful access to AI Literacy education (Digital Promise, 2024; Good Things Foundation, 2024). Ensuring this in practice means addressing the digital divide, designing for accessibility, and valuing diverse perspectives and experiences. Resources and opportunities must be distributed fairly, with particular attention to those who are digitally disadvantaged or underrepresented.</p> 3. Critical Thinking and Responsible Use <p>Young people should be equipped to think critically about AI, which means evaluating outputs, questioning claims, and understanding both the opportunities and risks presented by AI systems. In addition, young people should be encouraged to understand the importance of responsible use, including understanding bias, misinformation, and the ethical implications of AI in society (European Commission, 2022; Ng et al.,&nbsp;2021).</p> 4. Upholding Human Rights and Wellbeing <p>Using a rights-based approach — including privacy, freedom of expression, and the right to participate fully in society — helps young people understand their rights, navigate issues of consent and data privacy, and recognise the broader impacts of AI on wellbeing, safety, and social justice (OECD, 2022; UNESCO,&nbsp;2024a).</p> 5. Creativity, Participation, and Lifelong&nbsp;Learning <p>AI should be presented as a tool for creativity, collaboration, and self-expression, not just as a subject to be learned for its own sake. PSM organisations should value and promote participatory approaches, encouraging young people to contribute to and shape the conversation about AI. This core value also recognises that AI Literacy is a lifelong process, requiring adaptability and a willingness to keep learning as technology evolves (UNESCO,&nbsp;2024b).</p> Next Steps <p>We will be running a roundtable for invited experts and representatives of the BBC in early June to give feedback on the gap analysis and emerging framework. We will share a version of this after acting on their feedback.</p><p>If you are working in the area of AI Literacy and have comments on these values, please add them to this post, or get in touch: <a href="mailto:hello@weareopen.coop">hello@weareopen.coop</a></p> Acknowledgements <p>The following people have willingly given up their time to provide invaluable input to this&nbsp;project:</p><p>Jonathan Baggaley, Prof Maha Bali, Dr Helen Beetham, Dr Miles Berry, Prof. Oli Buckley, Prof. Geoff Cox​, Dr Rob Farrow, Natalie Foos, Leon Furze, Ben Garside, Dr Daniel Gooch, Dr Brenna Clarke Gray, Dr Angela Gunder, Katie Heard, Prof. Wayne Holmes, Sarah Horrocks, Barry Joseph, Al Kingsley MBE, Dr Joe Lindley, Prof. Sonia Livingstone, Chris Loveday, Prof. Ewa Luger, Cliff Manning, Dr Konstantina Martzoukou, Prof. Julian McDougall, Prof. Gina Neff, Dr Nicola Pallitt, Rik Panganiban, Dr Gianfranco Polizzi, Dr Francine Ryan, Renate Samson, Anne-Marie Scott, Dr Cat Scutt MBE, Dr Sue Sentance, Vicki Shotbolt, Bill Thompson, Christian Turton, Dr Marc Watkins, Audrey Watters, Prof. Simeon Yates, Rebecca&nbsp;Yeager</p> References   Digital Promise (2024).

This multi-stakeholder approach ensures broader perspectives are represented and creates unprecedented opportunities for alignment across traditionally separate communities.</p> Why Attend?   Unprecedented collaboration: This conference's collaborative nature bridges organizations that rarely coordinate at this scale.   Connect: Connect with peers from government and private sectors to advance standards coordination, cross-border interoperability, and robust digital public infrastructure  Network with experts: Engage directly with technical leaders, government officials, and industry pioneers shaping the future of digital trust   Who Is Organizing? <p>The current list of co-organizers can be seen in the header image, with more to be added later this week.

 Briefing Document: Review of C2PA and its Governance 
<p>Date: May 15, 2024<br>
Source: Excerpts from “GMT20250515-145218_Recording_2560x1440.mp4”<br>
Presenter: Scott Perry, Co-chair of Trust over IP’s Foundations Steering Committee, Founder and CEO of the Digital Governance Institute, Co-chair of the Creator Assertions Working Group at the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).<br>
Topic: C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) and the Application of Trust over IP’s Governance Metamodel.</p>
 1. Executive Summary 
<p>This briefing summarizes a presentation by Scott Perry on the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and the application of the Trust over IP (ToIP) governance metamodel to its conformance program. The C2PA is an industry-wide initiative creating a technical standard to attach “truth signals” or provenance information to digital objects. Facing a critical need to operationalize and govern this specification to ensure market trust and adoption, the C2PA has adopted the ToIP governance metamodel. This framework provides the necessary structure to establish a conformance program, define roles and responsibilities, manage risks, and create trust lists for compliant products and certification authorities. The program is set to officially launch on June 4th, initially focusing on self-assertion for conformance and introducing two levels of implementation assurance, with plans for independent attestation and higher assurance levels in the future.</p>
 2. Key Themes and Ideas 
 
 The Problem of Trust in Digital Objects: The presentation highlights the growing challenge of establishing trust and authenticity for digital content in a world of easily manipulated or AI-generated media. This is particularly relevant for industries like telecommunications struggling with identity and verification, as noted by a participant’s observation about OTPs and SMS verification. 
 C2PA as a Standard for Provenance and Authenticity: The C2PA specification aims to provide a technical solution by creating a “content credential” or manifest that is cryptographically bound to a digital object. This manifest acts as a ledger of actions taken on the object, providing a history and “nutrition label” of its source and modifications. “basically, it’s all of the major tech companies except Apple… coming together to create a standard for provenence, authenticity, truth signals on digital objects that can be digitally attached to digital objects.” 
 Content Credential (Manifest): This is the core mechanism of the C2PA. It is a digitally attached ledger of actions taken on a digital object, such as “Camera took picture,” “edited picture,” or “an AI took this picture.” This manifest is “bound to it and linked to it” in a “cryptographically binding format,” providing tamper evidence. 
 Scope of C2PA Responsibility: The C2PA primarily focuses on “created assertions,” which are “product-driven,” documenting actions taken within a product (e.g., a camera generating a picture, Photoshop editing an image). 
 Distinction from “Gathered Assertions”: The C2PA does not take responsibility for “gathered assertions,” which are claims made by individuals or organizations outside of a product (e.g., “I Scott Perry took the picture” or industry-specific identifiers). These are the purview of other groups like CAWG (Content Authenticity Working Group) and related efforts like the Creator Assertions working group at DIF. 
 Binding Mechanism: The C2PA uses X.509 certificates to bind the generator product to the digital asset. “when a picture is taken, the X509 certificate will be used will be binding it will be used to bind it bind the product to the asset.” This requires camera manufacturers and other product vendors to obtain certificates from approved Certification Authorities (CAs). 
 The Need for Governance: While the C2PA created a technical specification, they recognized the critical need for a governance framework to operationalize and control the standard’s implementation and use in the market. “the key aspect is you have a spec out but you can’t control the use of the specification… they couldn’t get, you know, their arms around, you know, the on controlling its the specification use.” 
 Application of ToIP Governance Metamodel: Scott Perry highlights how the ToIP governance metamodel provided the necessary structure for the C2PA to build its conformance program. “I came in with my toolkit from the the trust over IP project and it worked beautifully. It just created the structure to allow them to make the right decisions for themselves.” 
 Key Components of the Governance Program (based on ToIP):Risk Assessment: Started with a “threats and harms task force” to identify major risks, particularly around the tampering of evidence and manifests. 
 Governance Requirements and Framework: Defined primary documents (specification, security requirements, legal agreements) and control documents (privacy, inclusion, equitability requirements). A key output is a glossary of terms for the new ecosystem. 
 Governance Roles and Processes: Identified key roles: the Governing Authority (C2PA Steering Committee), the Administering Party (Conformance Task Force), and Governed Parties (CAs, Generator Product companies, Validator Product companies). 
 Legal Agreements: Formal agreements are being established between the C2PA and governed parties outlining roles, responsibilities, conformance requirements, and dispute resolution mechanisms. 
 Conformance Criteria and Assurance: Defined based on the C2PA specification and implementation security requirements. The program includes “four levels of of assurance around the implementation of products,” though initially rolling out with two levels. These levels are tied to “security objectives” and assessed against the “target of evaluation” (the product and its supporting infrastructure). 
 Conformance Process: Involves an intake form, application review, assessment of infrastructure (initially self-assertion, moving towards independent attestation), legal agreement signing, and adding records to trust lists. 
 Residual Risk Assessment and Adaptation: The program includes a process to learn from the rollout, identify unmet requirements or issues, and adapt the program for continuous improvement. 
 Trust Lists (Registries): Central to the program are trust lists identifying approved Generator Products, Validator Products, and Certification Authorities. A timestamp authority trust list is also being added. 
 Levels of Assurance: The program is defining levels (initially rolling out two) to reflect different degrees of confidence in the implementation of the C2PA specification and associated security requirements. Achieving a higher level of assurance requires meeting all requirements for that level. 
 Self-Assertion (Initial Rollout): Due to the complexity of auditing and getting the program launched quickly, the initial phase requires participants to self-assert that they meet the specification and requirements. 
 Conformance Certificate: Upon successful conformance, products will receive a certificate tied to an OID (Object Identifier) denoting the assurance level they have achieved. This OID in the manifest’s certificate will identify the assurance level of the provenance information. 
 JPEG Trust and Copyright: While C2PA provides provenance information that can be used for copyright, it doesn’t define ownership or copyright laws. JPEG Trust is mentioned as an organization creating an ISO standard focused on copyrights in concert with the C2PA standard. 
 Relationship with W3C: The C2PA is actively engaged with the W3C, with discussions happening at the technical working group level regarding related standards like PROV (for provenance). 
 Future Directions: Plans include introducing higher levels of assurance, implementing independent attested conformance, developing quality control software for assessing product compliance, and establishing a fee structure for the conformance program. 
 CAWG (Content Authenticity Working Group) as a Broader Ecosystem: CAWG is viewed as a potentially larger ecosystem dealing with identity, metadata, endorsements, and AI learning process specifications, which will need to create their own applications and standards that can integrate with the C2PA foundation. 
 
 3. Important Ideas and Facts 
 
 The C2PA is the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity. 
 It includes major tech and product manufacturers, excluding Apple initially but aiming to include them. 
 The core technical output is the Content Credential (Manifest), a digitally attached ledger of actions on a digital object. 
 The manifest provides tamper evidence and binds the product to the asset using X.509 certificates. 
 C2PA focuses on “created assertions” (product-driven actions), leaving “gathered assertions” (individual/organizational claims) to other groups like CAWG. 
 The Trust over IP governance metamodel has been successfully applied to structure the C2PA conformance program. 
 The program addresses threats and harms related to tampering and requires adherence to implementation security requirements. 
 The C2PA conformance program will officially launch on June 4th at the Content Authenticity Initiative symposium in New York City. 
 The initial launch will include two levels of implementation assurance and a self-assertion confidence model. 
 Key outputs of the governance program are legal agreements and trust lists of conforming products and certification authorities. 
 The C2PA standard is becoming an ISO standard this year. 
 Timestamp authorities will play a crucial role in providing trust signals related to the time of claim assertion. 
 The program includes mediation and dispute resolution mechanisms in its legal agreements. 
 The governance program provides the structure for the C2PA to “operationalize the spec” and control its use. 
 
 4. Key Quotes 
 
 “basically, it’s all of the major tech companies except Apple… Coming together to create a standard for provenence, authenticity, truth signals on digital objects that can be digitally attached to digital objects.” 
 “what it what it’s proposed to do is to create a ledger of actions against a digital object that is bound to it.” 
 “It’s kind of the nutrition label on food… it’s really the nutrition label of all digital objects.” 
 “The C2PA did not want to get involved in all of the the potential root, you know, actions and and variances about those types of things. They wanted to create the platform.” 
 “They create the platform and they create the binding between the digital asset and the and the manifest using X509 certificates.” 
 “The key aspect is you have a spec out but you can’t control the use of the specification… they couldn’t get, you know, their arms around, you know, the on controlling its the specification use.” 
 “the governance program was needed to operationalize the spec. The spec was had, you know, a limitation in its usefulness without a governance program around it.” 
 “I came in with my toolkit from the the trust over IP project and it worked beautifully. It just created the structure to allow them to make the right decisions for themselves.” 
 “we’re creating a program which will hold generator and validator products accountable to the specific ification that’s already been published.” 
 “We are creating two levels of implement implementation assurance and we are are using a self assertion confidence model we don’t have the mechanisms in place to hold organizations accountable for meeting the specification we don’t have an you know an assurance mechanism in place yet to do that.” 
 “It is the hope that you know copyright laws can use the trust signals that are coming from the CTBA specification and conformance program in use for defining ownership and copyright.” 
 “The conformance criteria is the spec and the spec is now at at level 2.2.” 
 “we are looking at levels of assurance around the implementation of a product. Now it’s not just the product but it’s also its infrastructure.” 
 “These are the kinds of records that were that are in the schema for the trust list.” 
 
 5. Next Steps 
 
 Official launch of the C2PA conformance program on June 4th. 
 Continued work on independent attestation and higher levels of assurance for the conformance program. 
 Development of quality control software or processes for assessing product compliance. 
 Ongoing collaboration with W3C and other relevant standards bodies. 
 Further exploration of the broader CAWG ecosystem and its integration with C2PA. 
 
<p>This briefing provides a foundational understanding of the C2PA, its technical specification, and the crucial role of the newly established governance program, structured using the Trust over IP metamodel, in driving its adoption and ensuring trust in the digital content landscape.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>



<p>Session hijacking is a growing initial attack vector for online fraud and account takeover. Because FIDO authentication reduces the effectiveness of other simpler forms of compromise, such as credential stuffing and phishing, cybercriminals turn to theft and re-use of bearer tokens. Bearer tokens are a form of credential which include session cookies used by browsers connecting to websites and OAuth access tokens used by other thick client application types such as native mobile applications. When these credentials are long-lived and can be “lifted and shifted” from the machine where they were created to be usable by a bad actor from another machine, their tradable value is significant. Emerging technologies such as Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) for browsers and Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) for OAuth applications seek to reduce the threat of session hijacking. This article describes how these technologies address the problem of session hijacking and how they complement strong phishing resistant authentication in online ecosystems.</p>



<p>Audience</p>



<p>This white paper is for chief information security officers (CISOs) and technical staff whose responsibility it is to protect the security and life cycle of online identity and access management from online fraud.&nbsp;</p>

 1. Introduction 



<p>Authentication and authorization are integral parts of an identity lifecycle, especially for online credential ecosystems. The growing threat of online identity fraud with costly security incidents and breaches has enterprises looking for ways to protect and secure their workforces from account takeover through different attack vectors such as phishing, credential stuffing, and session hijacking. For authentication, FIDO authentication with passkeys provides users with “Safer, more secure, and faster online experiences”, and an increase in the adoption of passkeys has contributed to a reduction of the success of attack vectors of credential phishing, credential stuffing, and session hijacking accomplished via man-in-the-middle (MITM) phishing attacks. However, what happens after the authentication ceremony?</p>



<p>After authentication, browsers and application clients are typically issued other credentials. Enterprise applications generally fall into two primary categories: those that are web browser based and use session cookies for state management and those that are thick client applications using OAuth access tokens (this includes some browser-based single page applications and most native mobile applications). Both types of credentials (session cookies and access tokens) are considered, in their basic use, as “bearer” tokens. If you have the token (the session cookie or the access token), then you can continue to transact for the lifetime of that token as the user who authenticated and owned it.This whitepaper explores adjacent technologies that address the “lift and shift” attack vector for bearer tokens and how these technologies complement FIDO-based authentication mechanisms. In particular, this paper focuses on the proposed web standard Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) for protecting browser session cookies and OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) for protecting OAuth grants.</p>



 2. Terminology 



<p>session hijacking: An exploitation of the web session control mechanism that is normally managed for a session cookie.</p>



<p>credential stuffing: An automated injection of stolen username and password pairs (credentials) into website login forms to fraudulently gain access to user accounts.</p>

<p>access token: A credential used by a client-side application to invoke API calls on behalf of the user.</p>



<p>session cookie: A credential managed by browsers to maintain session state between a browser and a website.</p>



<p>bearer token: A token (in the context of this whitepaper may refer to either an access token or a session cookie) so called because whoever holds the token can use it to access resources. A bearer token on its own can be “lifted and shifted” for use on another computing device.</p>



<p>sender-constrained token: A token protected by a mechanism designed to minimize the risk that anything other than the client which established the token during an authentication process could use that token in subsequent requests for server-side resources.</p>



<p>Device Bound Session Credential (DBSC): A proposal for a W3C web standard defining a protocol and browser behavior to establish and maintain sender-constrained cookies. The mechanism uses proof of possession of an asymmetric cryptographic key to help mitigate session cookie hijacking.OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Procession (DPoP): A mechanism for implementing sender-constrained access tokens that requires clients to demonstrate possession of an asymmetric cryptographic key when using the token.</p>



<p>OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Procession (DPoP): A mechanism for implementing sender-constrained access tokens that requires clients to demonstrate possession of an asymmetric cryptographic key when using the token.</p>



 3. Adjacent/complementary technologies for a secure ecosystem 



<p>While FIDO authentication technology can effectively eliminate phishing and credential stuffing attacks that occur during the login process, the addition of solutions to mitigate threats associated with bearer token theft is equally important. Bad actors whose attacks are thwarted during the login process will go after the next weakest link in the chain and try to steal post-authentication bearer tokens. This section explores two of these technologies for protecting bearer tokens: Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC) protect browser-based session cookies and Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) protects OAuth grants. Alternative approaches to protect bearer tokens are also discussed.</p>



<p>Because no single piece of technology can protect against all threats, a combination of multiple techniques is required for adequate protection.</p>

<p></p>



<p>3.1 Browser session cookie security</p>



<p>Before discussing Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC), you will need to understand the problem being addressed regarding browser session cookies. Session hijacking via cookie theft allows an attacker, who possesses stolen cookies, to bypass end-user authentication, including any strong or multi-factor authentication (MFA). This is particularly problematic when browsers create long-lived session cookies (which are a type of bearer token), since these cookies can be traded as alternatives to a user’s primary authentication credentials and then used from the attacker’s machine. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, financial loss, and damage to an organization’s reputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attackers perform cookie theft through various methods such as man-in-the-middle phishing of a user’s existing MFA login process (when phishing-resistant authentication such as FIDO is not used), client-side malware, and occasionally through vulnerabilities in server-side infrastructure or software. Regardless of how cookie theft is perpetrated, when successful, these attacks are not only dangerous, but also hard to isolate and detect. Complementary technologies, such as Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC), minimize the risks associated with browser cookie theft by making stolen cookies impractical to use from any machine other than the machine to which they were issued during authentication.</p>



<p>3.2 Device Bound Sessional Credentials – DBSC</p>



<p>DBSC refers to a proposed web standard currently in development within the Web Application Security working group of the W3C[2]. The goal of DBSC is to combat and disrupt the stolen web session cookies market. This is achieved by defining an HTTP messaging protocol and required browser and server behaviors to result in binding the use of application session cookies to the user’s computing device. DBSC uses an asymmetric key pair and in browser implementations the private keys should be unextractable by an attacker – for example stored within a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), secure element, or similar hardware-based cryptographic module.</p>



<p>At a high level, the API in conjunction with the user’s browser and secure key storage capabilities, allows for the following:</p>



 
 The server communicates to the browser a request to establish a new DBSC session. This includes a server-provided challenge. 



 The browser generates an asymmetric key pair, then sends the public key along with the signed challenge to the server. This process is referred to as DBSC registration. Browser implementations of DBSC should use operating system APIs that facilitate secure, hardware-bound storage and use of the private key. 



 The server binds the public key to the browser session by issuing a short-lived, refreshable auth_cookie which is then required to be transmitted in subsequent browser requests to the web server. 
 



<p>As the auth_cookie regularly expires, a mechanism is required for the browser to refresh the auth_cookie asynchronously to primary application web traffic. The refresh process requires signing a new server-issued challenge with the same private key created during DBSC registration, thereby re-proving (regularly) that the client browser is still in possession of the same private key.</p>



<p>Limiting the lifetime of the auth_cookie to short periods of time (for example, a few minutes) disrupts the market for trading long-lived session cookies. An attacker can only use stolen session cookies (including the auth_cookie) for a brief period, and cannot perform a refresh operation, since the private key required to perform a refresh operation is not extractable from the client machine.</p>



<p>DBSC may be introduced into existing deployments with minimal changes to the application. This is important as DBSC could easily be incorporated as a web plugin module in existing server-side technology (for example, Apache module, Servlet Filter, or reverse proxy functionality). This permits enterprises to roll out deployment of DBSC in phases without a complete overhaul of all current infrastructure and companies can prioritize certain critical endpoints or resources first.</p>



<p>DBSC server-side implementations can also be written in a manner that permits semantics, for example: “If the browser supports DBSC, use it, otherwise fallback to regular session characteristics.” This allows users to gain the security advantages of DBSC when they use a browser that supports it without having to require all users to upgrade their browsers first.</p>



<p>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/dbsc">Device Bound Session Credentials explainer</a> for more details on the DBSC protocol and standard, including a proposal for enterprise-specific extensions that adds attestation to DBSC keypairs.</p>



<p>3.2.1 What makes DBSC a technology complementary to FIDO?</p>



<p>The DBSC draft standard permits the login process to be closely integrated with the DBSC API. While FIDO is a mechanism that makes authentication safer and phishing resistant, DBSC is a mechanism that makes the bearer credential (session cookie) safer post-authentication. They complement each other by reducing the risk of account takeover and abuse, making the entire lifecycle of application sessions safer.</p>



<p>3.2.2 Alternative solutions</p>



<p>DBSC is not the first standard to propose binding session cookies to a client device. Token Binding is an alternative that combines IETF RFCs 8471, 8472, and 8473. Token Binding over HTTP is implemented via a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension and uses cryptographic certificates to bind tokens to a TLS session. Token Binding has had limited browser adoption and is complex to implement as it requires changes at the application layer and in TLS security stacks. The Token Binding over HTTP standard has not been widely adopted and only one major browser currently offers support.</p>



<p>3.2.3 Advice</p>



<p>The DBSC standard relies on local device security and operating system APIs for storage and use of the private key that is bound to the browser’s session. While these private keys cannot be exported to another device, the key is available on the local system and may be exercisable by malware residing on the user’s device. Similarly, in-browser malware still has complete visibility into both regular session cookies and short-lived auth_cookies. DBSC is not a replacement for client-side malware protection, and the threat model for DBSC does not provide protections from persistent client-side malware. Ultimately, the user must trust the browser.</p>



<p>As browsers start to support DBSC over time, it will be important for servers to be able to work with a mix of browsers that do and do not include support for this technology. Some enterprises may dictate that corporate issued machines include browsers known to support DBSC, but many will not. It will be necessary for server-side implementations to take this into consideration, using DBSC when the browser responds to registration requests, and tolerating unbound session cookies when the browser does not. When building or choosing a commercial solution, ensure you consider this scenario, and include the ability to implement access control policies that strictly require DBSC in highly controlled or regulated environments or for specific applications.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, DBSC is in early evolution. It remains to be seen whether or not it will be widely adopted by browser vendors. The hope is that incubating and developing this standard via the W3C will result in wider adoption than previous proposals, similar to the way that the WebAuthn API has been adopted to bring passkey authentication to all major browser implementations.</p>



 4. OAuth grants 



<p>The previous section introduced DBSC as a means to protect against session cookie theft in web browsers. Thick application clients, including mobile applications and single-page web applications, typically use stateless API calls leveraging OAuth grants instead of session cookies. An OAuth grant may be established in several ways, with the&nbsp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252">recommended pattern for thick clients</a> being to initially use the system browser to authenticate a user, and grant access for an application to act on their behalf. Conceptually this is remarkably similar to browser-based sessions, including the ability and recommendation, to use FIDO authentication for end-user authentication when possible. At the conclusion of the browser-based authentication portion of this flow, control is returned to the thick client application or single-page web application where tokens are established for use in programmatic API calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The challenge that occurs from this point forward is almost identical to that described for browsers – the OAuth tokens are bearer tokens that if exposed to a bad actor can be used to call application APIs from a remote machine instead of from the legitimate application.</p>



<p>This section describes the use of DPoP, a technology for protecting the “lift and shift” of credentials used in OAuth-protected API calls which, just like DBSC, makes use of an asymmetric key pair and ongoing proof of possession of the private key.</p>



<p>4.1 Demonstrate Proof of Possession (DPoP)</p>



<p>OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) is an extension of the existing OAuth 2.0 standard for implementing device bound (or sender-constrained) OAuth access and refresh tokens. It is an application-level mechanism that allows for the tokens associated with an OAuth grant (that is, refresh tokens and access tokens) to bind with the requested client using a public and private key pair. This requires the client to prove ownership of its private key to the authorization server when performing access token refresh operations and to resource servers when using access tokens to call APIs.</p>



<p>6. OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252</a></p>



<p>High assurance OpenID specifications, such as <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">Financial-grade API (FAPI 2.0)</a>, mandate the use of sender-constrained tokens and DPoP is the recommended method for implementing this requirement when Mutual TLS (mTLS) is not available.</p>



<p>At a high level, DPoP requires that:</p>



 
 The client generates a per-grant public/private key pair to be used for constructing DPoP proofs. Best practice implementations should use operating system APIs to ensure the private key is non-extractable. 



 On initial grant establishment (for example, exchanging an OAuth authorization code for the grant’s first access token and refresh token), a DPoP proof (a JWT signed by the client’s private key that contains, among other things, a copy of the public key) is used to bind a public key to the grant. 



 Requests to a resource server using an access token obtained in this manner must also include a DPoP proof header, continuously proving possession of the private key used during grant establishment. This is done for every API request. Resource servers are required to check if an access token is sender-constrained, confirm the public key, and validate the DPoP proof header on each API call. 



 For public clients, subsequent refresh_token flows to the authorization server’s token endpoint must also contain a DPoP proof signed with the same key used during initial grant establishment. This is particularly important as the refresh tokens are often long-lived and are also a type of bearer token (that is, if you have it you can use it). The authorization server must enforce the use of a DPoP proof for these refresh token flows and ensure signature validation occurs via the same public key registered during initial grant establishment. 
 



<p>Unlike a plain bearer access token which can be used by any holder, DPoP based access tokens are bound to the client that initially established the OAuth grant, since only that client can sign DPoP proofs with the private key. This approach minimizes the risks associated with malicious actors trading leaked access tokens.</p>



<p>Refer to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449">DPoP RFC 9449</a> – OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) for more information.</p>



<p>4.2 What makes DPoP a complementary technology to FIDO?</p>



<p>FIDO can be leveraged for phishing resistant end-user authentication during establishment of an OAuth grant. Refresh and access tokens obtained by a client following this authentication should be safeguarded against “lift and shift” attacks just like session cookies in browser-based apps. DPoP is a recommended solution for protecting these OAuth tokens from unauthorized post-authentication use. Together, FIDO for end user authentication and DPoP for binding OAuth tokens to a client device complement each other to improve the overall security posture for identities used in thick client applications.</p>



<p>4.2.1 DPoP alternative solutions?</p>



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705">RFC8705</a> – OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens describes a mechanism that offers a transporter layer solution to bind access tokens to a client certificate. While it has been approved for use in <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">FAPI 2.0</a> for open banking solutions, it is not particularly suitable for public clients such as native mobile applications.</p>



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9421">RFC9421</a> – HTTP Message Signatures defines an application-level mechanism for signing portions of an HTTP message. Key establishment and sharing between the client and verifier are not defined by this specification, although this could be performed in a trust on first user manner during initial grant establishment in a similar manner to DPoP. There is no known public specification that maps the use of HTTP message signatures to the use case of sender-constrained bearer tokens in an OAuth client application. In the absence of such a public specification, widespread adoption for this use case is unlikely.</p>



<p>4.2.2 Advice</p>



<p>Sender-constrained tokens are a good idea, and, in some deployments, they are a regulatory requirement. For example, use of the FAPI profiles of OAuth is now mandated by many sovereign open banking initiatives. DPoP is a relatively simple way to achieve this requirement and is flexible enough to cover a wide range of application client types. That said, care must still be taken to adhere to the security considerations of DPoP. Pay close attention to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449#section-11">section 11 of RFC9449</a>, as well as apply other application security strategies for native or browser based single page applications as your scenario dictates. Remember that DPoP is focused solely on addressing the threats associated with token exfiltration, which include trading and use by malicious actors. It should be considered part of a defense-in-depth strategy for OAuth applications.</p>



 5. Conclusion 



<p>The intent of this paper is to inspire thinking around how different web security standards fit together and how those standards relate to the use of FIDO authentication for users. There are so many standards and standards bodies that it is often hard to understand which compete in the same space and which augment one another to form part of a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy for identity fraud protection in online applications.</p>



<p>This paper tackled a specific, prevalent application security problem – the malicious trading and use of stolen cookies and access tokens. This paper also showed how technologies such as DBSC and DPoP mitigate the threats associated with token theft and how these technologies are complementary to FIDO authentication. Paired with FIDO, DBSC and DPoP provide greater overall identity fraud protection for your applications.</p>

Maybe they learn about an issue, identify it as important, and begin to consider how they might want to get involved. Or maybe they meet someone at a demonstration, and discover the community first-hand.</p><p>AIUK social media, through broadcasting, is just one tool that helps people discover Amnesty International UK. AIUK makes complex issues accessible and relatable. We want to do the same as AIUK highlights grassroots efforts and community initiatives.</p><p>We want to encourage posts that&nbsp;show:</p>  Our dedicated community and highlight key grassroots initiatives and campaigns.  Signposts to find local groups or events based on interests.  Digital actions, such as petitions or downloading campaign guides, to help users take their first&nbsp;steps.  <p>Such content ensures that even people who are new can find relevant AIUK communities and take the first steps toward engagement.</p> 2. Intention to&nbsp;Engage <p>Once someone discovers a cause they care about, the next step is forming an intention to engage. This stage is all about commitment — moving from passive interest to active participation.</p><p>By showcasing community on the AIUK website, we both invite people in and celebrate what the community is achieving. We want to present clear pathways for involvement and help community members inspire others to take steps towards&nbsp;action.</p><p>We need to figure out processes that&nbsp;help:</p>  Goal-setting: Encouraging community members to set personal milestones, like committing to attend 100 meetings.  Sharing success: Telling success stories and finding testimonials that effectively attract new people while celebrating community achievements.  Balancing information: Showcasing static information about past successes with dynamic, real-time updates on current campaigns from the community.  <p>By making it easy for people to express their intent and take small but meaningful steps, we build confidence and lay the groundwork for deeper engagement.</p> 3. Taking Action: Turning Intent into&nbsp;Impact <p>With intention comes action, and this is where real change begins. At this stage, people start to feel a sense of belonging and are ready to contribute to a cause they care&nbsp;about.</p><p>A knowledge base can help equip users with actionable tools. We’ll need clear resources and learning pathways&nbsp;that:</p>  Guide people to the right information: Whether it’s organising a protest, writing letters to policymakers, or starting a local campaign, the knowledge hub can provide step-by-step guidance tailored to issues we work&nbsp;on.  Help people collaborate: People should be able to connect with others who share their interests and work together on projects — whether virtually or in person. Best practices and community policies may also be at home in the knowledge hub.  Show them into the community: Make sure that people feel supported and seen as they take action. Create an architecture of participation that brings them into the community platform.  <p>This stage is about turning isolated actions into collective power, with the support of the community ensuring that every contribution counts.</p> 4. Sustaining Action: Building Lasting Commitment <p>Sustained action is the key to creating lasting change. Too often, movements fizzle out after an initial burst of energy, but with a strong community strategy and integrated platform, we can keep momentum&nbsp;going.</p><p>To sustain engagement, the community platform needs to help people align with others in the AIUK movement. We need to think&nbsp;about:</p>  Feedback loops: Regular check-ins with the community to understand their needs and ensure that we are adapting the community strategy and platform accordingly.  A recognition ecosystem: Using digital badges and shoutouts for individuals or groups who demonstrate consistent commitment to help us make activism more&nbsp;visible.  Storytelling opportunities: Sharing success stories and lessons learned will inspire others and keep motivation high.  <p>By encouraging a sense of belonging and purpose, we ensure that members find reasons to continue building collective power for human&nbsp;rights.</p> 5. Becoming an Activist: Empowering Future&nbsp;Leaders <p>The final stage is becoming an activist. At this point, individuals understand that community isn’t one person, but rather all of us. They begin to work on behalf of others, coordinate together and lift people up with their leadership.</p><p>These leaders will use other coordination tools and processes and that’s great! We want to empower the development of activist and leadership skills. We’ll&nbsp;need:</p>  Decentralised coordination best practices: For members who are ready to take on larger roles, such as leading groups or campaigns.  Mentorship programs: Connecting experienced activists with newcomers to share knowledge and build networks.  Advocacy training: Workshops, webinars, and resources focused on effective communication, policy advocacy, and community organising.  <p>Through these efforts, we can go beyond nurturing individual leaders to continue building a movement.</p> The Power of Community Work in Driving&nbsp;Change <p>The journey from discovery to becoming an activist is a process of gradual engagement and empowerment. There is a system of platforms, processes and content that help AIUK move people towards becoming an activist. Although we use various digital tools, the journey is an emotional and social&nbsp;one.</p><p>We are working hard to make sure the community platform project harnesses the collective strength of our community and makes a difference that&nbsp;lasts.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/building-power-and-making-change-367b03f9b785">Building Power and Making Change</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>First is <a href="https://corporate.visa.com/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html">Visa Intelligent Commerce</a>, which will make <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Intentcasting">intentcasting</a> happen in a big way. It will also elevate the roles of <a href="https://www.inrupt.com/">Inrupt</a> and the open-source&nbsp; <a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid Project</a>.</p>
<p>Second is making individuals first parties in their agreements with companies. It’s been the other way around ever since industry won the industrial revolution. Still, in the digital world, which runs on the Internet’s peer-to-peer protocols, we can fix that with an upcoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers">IEEE</a> standard called <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/">IEEE P7012</a>, aka <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2025/04/06/myterms/">MyTerms</a>.</p>
<p>Third is the First Person Project, or FPP&nbsp; (website pending). With help on the buy side from <a href="https://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a> and on the sell side by <a href="https://ayra.forum/">Ayra</a>, we can finally replace “show your ID” with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">verifiable credentials</a> presented on an as-needed basis by independent and self-sovereign individuals operating inside their own webs of trust.</p>
<p>Fourth is <a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">personal AI</a>. This is AI that is as much yours as your shoes, your bike, and your PC. Personal, not personalized.</p>
<p>To explain how these will work together, start here:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not long after <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527/">The Intention Economy</a> came out in May, 2012, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Thomson_(executive)">Robert Thomson</a>, Managing Editor of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/">The Wall Street Journal</a>, wanted the book’s opening chapter to serve as the cover essay for the Marketplace section of an upcoming issue. <a href="https://hbr.org/hbrpress">Harvard Business Review Press</a> didn’t like that idea, so I wrote an original piece based on one idea in the book: that shoppers will soon be able to tell the market what they’re looking for, in safe, secure and anonymous ways—a kind of advertising in reverse that the book called “personal RFPs” and has since come to be called “intentcasting.” This became <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444873204577535352521092154">The Customer as a God</a>: The image above was the whole cover of the Marketplace section on Monday,&nbsp; July 23, 2012. The essay opened with these prophetic words: “It’s a Saturday morning in 2022…”</p>
<p>It is now a Friday morning in 2025, and that godly future for customers is still not here. Yes, we have more market power than in 2012, but we are digital serfs whose powers are limited to those granted by&nbsp; Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and other feudal overlords. This system is a free market only to the degree that you can choose your captor.&nbsp; This has led to—</p>
<p></p>
<p>The IONBA (Internet Of Notning But Accounts) is based on a premise: that the best customers are captive ones. In this relic of the industrial age, customers are captive to every entity that requires logins and passwords. Customers also have no ways of their own to globally control what data is collected about them, or how. Or to limit how that data is used.&nbsp; This is why our digital lives are infected by privacy-killing data-collection viruses living inside our computers, phones, TVs, and cars.</p>
<p>If you didn’t know about those last two, dig:</p>
 
 Consumer Reports says “<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics/privacy/how-to-turn-off-smart-tv-snooping-features-a4840102036/">All smart TVs—from Samsung, LG, you name it—collect personal data</a>.”&nbsp;They also come with lame “privacy” controls, typically buried deep in a settings menu. (Good luck exhuming them. The ones in our TCL and Samsung TVs have all but disappeared.) 
 Mozilla calls new cars “<a href="http://the%20Worst%20Product%20Category%20We%20Have%20Ever%20Reviewed%20for%20Privacy">the Worst Product Category We Have Ever Reviewed for Privacy</a>.” There is also nothing you can do to stop your car from reporting on everything your car does—and everything you do, including sexual ativity—to the carmaker, insurance companies, law enforcement, and who knows who else. This data goes out through your car’s cell phone, misleadingly called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telematic_control_unit">telematics control unit</a>. The antenna is hidden in the shark fin on your car’s roof or in an outside mirror. 
 
<p>Businesses are also starting to lose faith in surveillance, for at least eight reasons:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2015/01/16/privacy/">People hate it</a>. 
 They also fight it. By 2015 ad blocking and tracking protection were <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the biggest boycott in world history</a>. 
 <a href="https://www.thecurrent.com/not-foolproof-ad-tech-pros-brand-safety-failures-adalytics-repor">It tarnishes brands</a>. 
 <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=don+marti+ad+fraud">Ad fraud is a gigantic problem, and built into the system</a>. 
 <a href="https://www.playwire.com/blog/the-ad-tech-industry-is-failing-publishers?utm_source=chatgpt.com">It commits Chrysoogocide </a><a href="https://www.playwire.com/blog/the-ad-tech-industry-is-failing-publishers?utm_source=chatgpt.com">(killing golden geese, most notably publishers)</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://advertisingweek.com/by-failing-to-support-publishers-the-adtech-industry-is-killing-its-golden-goose/?">Bonus link</a>. 
 <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/big-tech-digital-advertising-regulation/">Regulatory pressure against it is getting bigger all the time</a>. 
 Advertisers are finally remembering that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4733724_The_Waste_in_Advertising_Is_the_Part_That_Works">brands are made by ads aimed at populations</a>, while personalized ads are just digital junk mail. 
 Customers are using AI tools for guidance toward a final purchase, bypassing marketing schemes to bias purchasing decisions along the way. For more on that, see <a href="https://marketoonist.com/2025/05/marketing-ai-agents.html">Tom Fishburne’s cartoon</a>, and <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/marketings-new-middleman-ai-agents/">Bain’s report</a> about it. 
 
<p>So our four roads to The Intention Economy start with the final failings of the systems built to prevent it. Now let’s look at those roads.</p>
<p>Visa Intelligent Commerce</p>
<p>The press release is <a href="https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.21361.html">Find and Buy with AI: Visa Unveils New Era of Commerce</a>. Less blah is <a href="https://corporate.visa.com/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html">Enabling AI agents to buy securely and seamlessly</a>. Here’s the opening copy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine a future where an AI agent can shop and buy for you. AI commerce — commerce powered by an AI agent — is going to transform the way consumers around the world shop.</p>

<p>From browsing and selection to purchase and post-purchase management, this program will equip AI agents to seamlessly manage key phases of the shopping process.</p></blockquote>
<p>Visa CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McInerney">Ryan McInerney</a>&nbsp;says a lot more in a 1:22 talk at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atiskafZIJo">Visa Product Drop 2025</a>. The most relevant part starts about 26 minutes in, with a demo starting at about 31:30. Please watch it. Much of what you see there owes to Inrupt and Solid, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> says were inspired by The Intention Economy.

<p>IEEE P7012 “MyTerms”</p>
<p><a href="https://projectvrm.org/2025/04/06/myterms/">MyTerms</a>, <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">the most important standard in development today</a>, will be a keystone service of <a href="https://customercommons.org">Customer Commons,</a> the nonprofit spinoff of ProjectVRM. It will do for contract what Creative Commons did for copyright: give individuals a new form of control. With MyTerms, agreements between customers and companies will be far more genuine mutual, and open to new forms of innovation not based on the kind of corporate control that typifies the IONBA. For example, it can open Visa Intelligent Commerce to conversations and relationships that go far past transaction. Take for example <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/market-intelligence-that-flows-both-ways-e822fa74530">Market intelligence that flows both ways</a>. While this has been thinkable for a decade or more (that last link is from 2016), it’s far more do-able when customers and companies have real relationships based on equal power and mutual interests. These are best framed up on agreements that start on the customer’s side, and give customers scale across all the companies with which they have genuine relationships.</p>
<p>First Person Project (FPP)</p>
<p>To me, FPP begins with the vision <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2015/11/25/remembering-big-davy/">“Big Davy” Sallis</a> came up with while he was working for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314191743/http://visaeurope.com/">VISA Europe</a> in 2012, and read the The Intention Economy. At the time, he wanted Visa to make VRM a real category, but assumed that would take too long. So he decided to create a VRM startup called <a href="https://www.qredo.com/">Qredo</a>. Joyce and I consulted Qredo until&nbsp; <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2015/11/25/remembering-big-davy/">Davy</a> died (far too young) in 2015. Qredo went into a different business, but <a href="http://searls.com/qredo1/">a draft I created for Qredo’s original website</a> survives, and it outlines much of what the&nbsp; FPP will make possible. That effort is led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drummondreed/">Drummond Reed</a>, another friend and collaborator of Davy’s and a participant in ProjectVRM from the start. Drummond says the FPP is inspired by <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2014/03/19/why-we-need-first-person-technologies-on-the-net/">Why We Need First Person Technologies on the Net</a>, a post published here in 2014. That post begins,</p>
<blockquote><p>We need&nbsp;first person technologies&nbsp;for the same reason we need first person voices: because there are some things only a person can say and do.</p>
<p>Only a person can use the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronouns">pronouns</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;“I,” “me,” “my” and “mine.” Likewise, only a person can use tools such as screwdrivers, eyeglasses and pencils. Those things are all&nbsp;first person technologies. They were invented for individual persons to use.</p>
<p>We use first person technologies the same unique ways we use our voices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among other things, the First Person Project will fix how identity works on the Internet. With FPI—First Person Identity—interactions with relying parties (the ones wanting “your ID”) don’t need your drivers license, passport, birth certificate, credit card, or account information. You just give them what’s required, on an as-needed basis, in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">verifiable credentials</a>. The credentials you provide can verify that you are a citizen of a country, licensed to drive, have a ticket to a game, or whatever. In other words, they do what Kim Cameron outlined in his<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065"> Laws of Identity</a>: disclose minimum information for constrained uses (Law 2) to justifiable parties (Law 3) under your control and consent (Law 1). The credential you present is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier">DID: a Decentralized Identifier</a>. No account is required.</p>
<p>Trust in FPI also expands from individual to community. Here is how Phil Windley explains it in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2025/04/establishing_first_person_digital_trust.shtml">Establishing First Person Digital Trust</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Alice and Bob met at IIW, they didn’t rely on a platform to create their connection. They didn’t upload keys to a server or wait for some central authority to vouch for them. They exchanged DIDs, authenticated each other directly, and established a secure, private communication channel.</p>
<p>That moment wasn’t just a technical handshake—it was a statement of first-person identity. Alice told Bob, “This is who I am, on my terms.” Bob responded in kind. And when they each issued a verifiable relationship credential, they gave that relationship form: a mutual, portable, cryptographically signed artifact of trust. This is the essence of first-person identity—not something granted by an institution, but something expressed and constructed in the context of relationships. It’s identity as narrative, not authority; as connection, not classification.</p>
<p>And because these credentials are issued peer-to-peer, scoped to real interactions, and managed by personal agents, they resist commodification and exploitation. They are not profile pages or social graphs owned by a company to be monetized. They are artifacts of human connection, held and controlled by the people who made them. In this world, Alice and Bob aren’t just users—they’re participants.</p></blockquote>
<p>This also expands outward into community, and webs of trust. You get personal agency plus community agency.</p>
<p>The FPP covers a lot more ground than identity alone, but that’s where it starts. Also, Customer Commons is a funding source for the FPP, and I’m involved there as well.</p>
<p>Personal AI</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rezarassool/">Reza Rassool</a> was also inspired by The Intention Economy when he started <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/">Kwaai.ai</a>, a nonprofit community developing open-source <a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">personal AI</a>. I now serve Kwaai as its volunteer Chief Intention Officer.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what personal AI will do for this woman:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Looks great, but we’re stuck in IONBA, she has little control over her personal data in all those spaces. For example,</p>
 
 She doesn’t have the digital version of what George Carlin called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLoge6QzcGY">a place for my stuff</a>.” (Watch that video. It’s brilliant—and correct.) 
 She has few records of where she’s been, who she’s been with and when—even though apps on her phone know that stuff and are keeping it inside the records of her giant overlords and/or selling it to parties unknown, with no way yet for getting it back for her own use. 
 Her finances are possibly organized, but scattered between the folders she keeps for taxes, plus the ones that live with banks, brokers, and other entities she hardly thinks about. It would be mighty handy to have a place of her own where she could easily see all her obligations, recurring payments, subscriptions, and other stuff her counterparties would rather she not know completely. 
 Her schedules are in Apple, Google, and/or Microsoft calendars, which are well app’d and searchable, but not integrated. She has no digital calendar that is independent and truly her own. 
 Her business and personal relationship records are scattered across her contact apps, her Linkedin page, and piles of notes and business cards. She has no place or way of her own to manage all of them. 
 Her health care records (at least here in the U.S.) are a total mess. Some of them ares inside the MyCharts and patient portals provided by separate (and mostly unconnected) health care specialists and medical systems. Some of it is in piles of printouts she has accumulated (if she’s kept them) from all the different providers she has seen. Some of it is in fitness and wellness apps, all with exclusive ways of dealing with users. None of it is in a unified and coherent form. 
 
<p>So the challenge for personal AI is pulling all that data out of all her accounts, and putting it into forms that give her full agency, with the help of her personal AIs.&nbsp; Personalized AIs from giants can’t do that. <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">We need our own personal AIs</a>.</p>
<p>Four roads, one destination: a world where free customers prove more valuable than captive ones. Let’s make it happen.</p>

<p>Passkeys are unique digital credentials tied to a user’s personal device and offer a way to authenticate identity without the need for traditional passwords or one-time text codes.</p>



<p>Passkeys never leave the device and so cannot be reused across websites, which makes them resistant to phishing and other common attacks.</p>

<p>DIF members showcased their vision at this year's European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC 2025), bringing together experts who are defining the future of human-centric digital identity. As AI capabilities accelerate, DIF members are tackling both the architectural foundations and philosophical implications of self-sovereign identity, and EIC provided an excellent forum to share how they are solving digital identity's most complex challenges.</p> The Philosophy Behind Standards: Values in Digital Identity <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-sabadello-353a0821/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Markus Sabadello</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/danube-tech/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Danube Tech</a> and DIF Steering Committee member, delivered a compelling talk examining the philosophical underpinnings of digital identity standards. His presentation, "The Worldviews behind Digital Identity Standards," argued that technical choices in standards like OID4VC, DIDComm, SD-JWT-VC, and the W3C verifiable credential data model reflect deeper philosophical trajectories variously aligned with European values like Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.</p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/world-views-behind-digital-eic25?ref=blog.identity.foundation"></a>Markus Sabadello presents "The Worldviews behind Digital Identity Standards"<p>Sabadello illustrated how technologies like <a href="https://book.didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm</a> prioritize fraternity through peer-to-peer connections, while JSON-LD enables innovation and liberty through permissionless semantic flexibility and self-publishing. As the industry standardizes wallets and verifiable credentials, he emphasized that these standards should be evaluated not only on technical merits but also on how they impact human values like sovereignty and equitable participation.</p><p>The talk concluded with an important reminder that technology is never value-neutral, highlighting the need to align digital identity standards with humanistic values while avoiding the pitfalls of fragmentation from competing, politically and commercially driven standards.</p> AI and Identity: A New Frontier <p>Another highlight of the conference was the Verifiable AI talk and panel series. In his talk "Private Personal AI and Verified Identity for AI Agents", <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alastairijohnson/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Alastair Johnson</a> (CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nuggets?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Nuggets</a>) explored the challenges of implementing truly private personal AI that protects user sovereignty while creating verifiable identities for AI agents.

<p>ISL began its life as the Me2B Alliance, striving to create standards to enable greater power symmetry in the digitally facilitated relationship between consumers (“Me-s”) and the companies whose technology they use (“B-s”). We called this the M2B relationship. For mobile apps, all too often it’s a case of “Me2 Who Knows?!” People have a right to know who’s legally responsible for the apps they use, and it is anything but clear in mobile app stores today. App stores are failing to make clear the legal entity who is responsible for apps. ISL has filed responsible disclosures with Apple starting in late 2024 but our repeated attempts have been dismissed. </p>
 Anatomy of Responsible Party Info in the App Stores 
<p>Both Google and Apple allow for two kinds of developer accounts: individual and organization. The creation of either type of account requires identity validation, but it’s a lower bar for individuals than for organizations. Individuals must provide a government issued ID credential before being allowed to open a developer account. This validates the individual’s name and address. Organizations, however, must provide a DUNS number to validate the legal existence of the organization. <a>1</a><a>2</a></p>
<p>▶ Problem 1: How effective is this level of identification authentication? ISL recently found an app developer with 15 apps in the Google Play store with no verifiable legal existence whatsoever. Thus, the process is imperfect at best.</p>
<p>In both stores, the “Account Holder” (to use Apple’s language) is the individual/entity who is in a legal relationship with the app store [owner]. </p>
<p>Figures 1a and 1b show two parts of an Apple App store listing. Note that the name in blue under the app name appears to be the Account Holder (Figure 1a). Note that the Information section of the app listing shows five other places where we expect to see the same Account Holder name and websites.</p>
 <p>Figure 1a: Apple App Store Example – App Header</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 1b: Apple App Store Example – App Information</p> 
<p><br>
Figures 2a and 2b show a similar annotated view of the Google Play Store app listing. Between Figures 2a and 2b, there are six instances where the Account Holder name appears.</p>
 <p>Figure 2a: Google Play Store Example – Part 1</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 2b: Google Play Store Example – Part 2</p> 
<p><br>
This all seems fine. What we see in practice, though, is that the various links and names presented in the app store listing that should be definitively showing the name of the legally party responsible for the app often have inconsistencies. Which brings us to additional problems.</p>
<p>▶ Problem 2: Account Holders can create additional user accounts within their account, including users with permissions to submit/delete apps.<a>3</a> There’s seemingly no governance over this capability, left strictly in the hands of the Account Holder.</p>
<p>▶ Problem 3: The app store app listing doesn’t indicate if the developer of the app is an individual or a company. This information matters. People deserve to know if they’re using an app developed by an individual developer, or by a company. No matter what, so long as apps are collecting personal information, people have an unconditioned right to know who gets their data and what they’re doing with it.</p>
<p>▶ Problem 4: The Apple app store doesn’t disclose the location of the responsible app developer but the Google Play store does.<a>4</a> The great thing about app ecosystems is that they foster worldwide participants. The problem is that the responsible developer can be oceans away from consumers, making it difficult or impossible to hold the developer accountable if there are issues.</p>
<p>▶ Problem 5: Apps have broken developer links. It’s wildly confusing when the name in blue or green font under the app name is different from the name that appears when you click on the developer link. Imagine if you went to a grocery store and there was a loaf of bread with no brand or company information. You wouldn’t want to eat that. When you click on the Developer Website link for the app shown in Figure 1b you find yourself not only not at a site that says Kepler47, you find a non-functional page for audiojoy.com (Figure 3).</p>
 <p>Figure 3 Developer website URL for 12 Step AA NA Daily Meditation from the Apple App Store: <a href="https://audiojoy.com/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi">https://audiojoy.com/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi</a></p> 
<p><br>
▶ Problem 6: The Account Holder name from the listing header doesn’t match the name in the privacy policy OR in the App Support link. Figures 4a and 4b illustrate a case where the listed developer in the listing header is Will Aitchison (Figure 4a), but the privacy policy fails to indicate a legally responsible data controller entirely (Figure 4b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 4a: Account Holder name</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 4b: Privacy policy link for app by Will Aitchison: <a href="https://www.firststeporegon.org/docs/PrivacyPolicy_25-05-2018.pdf">https://www.firststeporegon.org/docs/PrivacyPolicy_25-05-2018.pdf</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 4c: Privacy Policy from “Developer’s Website”</p> 
<p>Note that there’s another layer of confusion for the First Step Oregon app, namely, the privacy policy found on the App Support page differs from the privacy policy linked in the app store (Figure 4c). This case is a case where the app developer was likely an individual affiliated with the organization who wrote and submitted the app on behalf of the company. Still, it leaves a question for users: who is responsible? Who does the user contact in the case of issues?</p>
<p>The Boggle: Arcade Edition app in the Apple store shows a similar situation. The Account Holder appears to be Zynga Inc. from the app store listing header (Figure 5a). But when you click on the  App Support link you see the Take-Two Terms of Service (Figure 5.b). Similarly, the linked privacy policy is also Take-Two’s. Finally, this app includes a copyright showing Zynga Inc. in the information section (Figure 5c). In this instance, the original Account Holder (Zynga Inc.) was acquired by another company (Take-Two). Zynga appears to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two based on its California business registration status, but the “hybrid” information in the app store is confusing.<br>

▶ Problem 7: App Information shows two different names. Figures 7a and 7b show elements of the Apple app store listing for the app, Count Money and Coins – Photo Touch Game. In the Information section of the app store listing, Innovative Investments Limited is shown as the Seller, but Grasshopper Apps is the copyright registrant.</p>

<p><br>
▶ Problem 8: App store listings with broken privacy policy links. It’s relatively easy to find apps in the app stores whose privacy links are simply broken, non-functional. This is what we found with most of the Innovative Investments Limited apps (Figure 7c).</p>

 Conclusions  
<p>NONE of this should be happening today. App stores receive 30% of all app revenues and thus have ample resources to programmatically monitor these situations. Consumers should never have to conduct forensic research in order to figure out who they’re entering into a business relationship with. Here’s a recap of what the app store owners should do:</p>
 
 Make it crystal clear on your label who the legal entity responsible for the app is (I’ll call this “responsible developer”). 
 Make sure ALL instances in and related to the app store listing consistently show the same responsible developer name. 
 Make sure there is valid, working contact information for the responsible developer.  
 Indicate if the developer is an individual or an organization. <br>
 a. Ideally, we’d like to know the organization type, as this effects their legal obligations. For instance, for-profit vs. non-profit vs. government entities.<br>
 b. It’s also important to indicate coarse location information of the developer—i.e. city, state and country. 
 Make sure privacy policy links are functional all the time. 
 
<p>Here are Recommendations for app consumers:</p>
 
 If there isn’t a privacy policy, don’t install the app.  
 If there are no privacy details provided in the Apple store, don’t install the app.  
 If there’s no developer contact information provided, don’t install the app.

 Final Thoughts 
<p>We are well past the point of understanding the risks of these things, yet we see no systemic changes under development on the part of Apple and Google to put safety measures in place. Perhaps shining this light on some of the issues can help spur action. </p>

<p></p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation’s Gail Hodges and Joseph Heenan presented a talk on “If, when, and why to implement the FDX ‘blue’ security profile with FAPI 2.0” on Tuesday April 22nd for the benefit of North American attendees at the <a href="https://www.financialdataexchange.org/FDX/FDX-Global-Summit.aspx">Financial Data Exchange’s Spring Global Summit held at the Gaylord National Harbor</a>. This talk is especially timely as members decide what RFCs to approve this month, including a proposed ‘blue’ profile that contains <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI 2.0</a>, the OpenID Foundation’s leading communications protocol for open banking and open data. Assuming the RFC comes into effect, implementers in North America will be considering this new FDX profile for their open banking deployments and compliance to local regulations in the U.S. and Canada.&nbsp;</p>
 FAPI specifications recommended by FDX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>FAPI has long been “recommended by FDX” but an important milestone came this spring when the <a href="https://www.financialdataexchange.org/FDX/About/About-FDX.aspx?WebsiteKey=deae9d6d-1a7a-457b-a678-8a5517f8a474&amp;hkey=dffb9a93-fc7d-4f65-840c-f2cfbe7fe8a6&amp;a315d1c24e44=3#a315d1c24e44">FDX Security and Authorization Work Group</a> unanimously recommended FAPI 2.0 as part of the “blue” profile in a new RFC proposal. The OpenID Foundation, as a new member of the Financial Data Exchange, applauded this encouraging milestone and hopes to see this RFC come into effect this month for the benefit of shared FDX and OpenID Foundation members and contributors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation sees great potential for FAPI 2.0 to help US and Canadian implementers to meet their regulatory compliance obligations, and to do so in a way that delivers security, interoperability, and operational efficiency by default, leaving no entity (large or small) behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other ecosystems in other parts of the world like Brazil, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Norway, and Australia are already benefiting from FAPI, and the prospect of North American implementers implementing FAPI 2.0 at scale looks promising through the FDX relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Executive Director Gail Hodges said, “The FDX expertise in data specifications perfectly complements the OpenID Foundation expertise in highly secure and interoperable communications profiles, and we value the ongoing collaboration with the Financial Data Exchange.”</p>
 Key messages shared with FDX members and stakeholders 
<p>Hodges and Heenan made a series of key points in their talk on Tuesday, which included an audience of North American banks, fintechs and aggregators, as well as civil society and government representatives. The first was the summary of key benefits of FAPI 2.0:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second was to illustrate the comprehensive nature of FAPI, which fully addresses and specifies security, authorization, authentication, interoperability, and conformance. This is a different approach to US and Canadian implementations that are using OAuth2.0 in custom environments and integrations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The third point was the confidence implementers can have in this proven set of standards, regardless of whether their own operation crosses borders with other jurisdictions or not. Many thousands of implementers have self-certified to FAPI in these jurisdictions, and the OpenID Foundation is proud to partner with many of these jurisdictions, both those that are private sector led and those that are government led. We expect the number of jurisdictions moving to adopt FAPI to grow in line with global adoption of open banking and open data regulation and best practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last, Hodges and Heenan underscored the rationale for banks, fintechs and aggregators, all who can benefit from implementing FAPI in North America:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Key decision points FDX implementers in North America may consider 
<p>For those in North America actively conducting due diligence on what they may need to do to conform to US or Canadian regulation, Hodges and Heenan provided a generic decision tree to help them in their analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
 How to enable FAPI 2.0 From OAuth 2.0 
<p>Heenan offered implementers a simple playbook if they have OAuth2.0 enabled and wish to now enable FAPI 2.0:</p>
 
 Implement secure client authentication private_key_jwt or MTLS 
 Implement sender constrained tokens DPoP or MTLS 
 Implement Pushed Authorization Requests (IETF RFC9126) 
 Implement PKCE (IETF RFC7636) 
 
<p>Any implementer can start now by building to the freely available, open source tests at the OpenID Foundation. They can even self-certify as members ($1k) or non-members ($5k). The full resource information was provided to participants as published on the OpenID Foundation’s website:&nbsp;</p>

 Going forward together 
<p>The OpenID Foundation welcomes FDX’s Security and Authorization WG/ FAPI WG collaboration on the emerging FDX profile containing FAPI 2.0 and hopes that together our mutual members will benefit from a continued and deepening strategic relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One area of mutual interest is to consider running an interoperability event amongst early North American implementers of the blue profile containing FAPI 2.0. Those interested in being part of the interop should contact <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More broadly the OpenID Foundation looks forward to supporting the Financial Data Exchange’s technical roadmap. We also look forward to sharing our insights on the role that <a href="https://openid.net/standardized-fine-grained-authorization-with-oauth2-grant-management-and-rich-authorization-requests/">RAR and Grant Management </a>are starting to play in other markets like Australia and the UK, and how such fine granted authorization could be of value in North American markets as well. Together we hope to offer useful facts that can help inform the due processes and multi-stakeholder discussions in North America.&nbsp;</p>

		 Summary 
<p>This briefing document summarizes a presentation about Agri-food Data Canada’s Semantic Engine, a suite of tools designed to enhance research data management in the agri-food sector by making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). A central focus is the use of machine-readable data schemas authored with the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) standard, which is highlighted for its use of derived identifiers (digests) over traditional assigned identifiers for improved reproducibility and authenticity. The document also details the Semantic Engine’s practical tools and ongoing efforts to integrate these standards into existing research infrastructure, addressing challenges like data context and decentralized ecosystems.</p>

 Overview 
<p>This briefing summarizes a presentation by Carly Huitema from Agri-food Data Canada (ADC) to the Trust over IP (ToIP) Ecosystem and Governance Working Group. The presentation focuses on ADC’s efforts to improve research data management in the agri-food sector, specifically through the development of the “Semantic Engine” suite of tools. A central theme is the importance of “FAIR” data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and how machine-readable data schemas, particularly using the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) standard, contribute to achieving this goal. The discussion also highlights the advantages of derived identifiers (digests) over assigned identifiers for reproducibility, authenticity, and decentralization, and ADC’s ongoing work to integrate their tools and schemas into existing research infrastructure.</p>
 Key Themes and Important Ideas 
 
 
 
 Improving Research Data Management in a Decentralized Ecosystem: The research data ecosystem is described as highly decentralized with independent research groups. While guided by best practices, mandates for standardized approaches are often slow to adopt. Incentives can be conflicting, particularly the “publish or perish” culture versus the time needed for thorough data documentation. Long-term planning (e.g., 50-year repository funding) is a crucial consideration. ADC, a project at the University of Guelph funded by multiple Canadian sources (CFREF, Genome Canada, UoG, OMAFA, Compute Ontario, etc.), aims to address these challenges by working directly with researchers. 
 Making Agri-food Data FAIR: A core objective of ADC is to make agri-food data FAIR:
 
 Findable: Ability to identify and locate data resources and their context. 
 Accessible: Ability to access (with permission) and use data once found, often requiring open protocols. 
 Interoperable: Using standards for data to ensure compatibility, including standard vocabularies. 
 Reusable: Data with sufficient context (licenses, provenance, descriptions) can be reused by others for replication or new research. Carly Huitema states: “Findable is the ability to identify and find resources as well as their context. If it’s accessible that once found you can access it with permission and use it interoperable. Certainly lots of our work at Trust Over IP is about how to ensure interoperability of standards including vocabularies and reusable that that there are licenses and provenance and other things that help make this data reusable.” 
 
 
 Data Requires Context: Data alone is insufficient; it needs context to be useful. This context includes details like sample source, analysis methods, data schemas, catalogue information, data licenses, data governance agreements, associated publications, methodologies, scripts, and contributors. 
 The Semantic Engine: ADC is developing the Semantic Engine, a suite of tools designed to help researchers create “rich contextual and machine-readable data schemas.”
 
 The Semantic Engine aims to make the process of documenting data less daunting for researchers. 
 It functions as a self-teaching web app, providing guidance and tutorials. 
 The engine uses the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) standard for writing schemas. 
 
 
 Data Schemas and Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA):
 
 A data schema describes the attributes of a dataset (e.g., columns in a table) and provides detailed information about them (type, units, description, format, etc.). 
 OCA is highlighted as an international and open standard for documenting schemas, developed by the Human Colossus Foundation. Two key advantages of OCA:
 
 Embeds Digests: OCA schemas can embed derived identifiers (digests/fingerprints) for the schema itself and for its constituent parts. This is crucial for reproducibility and authenticity of digital artifacts. 
 Organized by Features: OCA structures schemas by features (e.g., all descriptions, all units) rather than attribute by attribute (e.g., JSON-LD, XML Schema). This organization offers advantages:
 
 Task-based Governance: Allows for governance at the feature level (e.g., assigning responsibility for translation features). 
 Optimized for Feature Management: Facilitates adding or removing features (like languages or units) without altering the identifiers of other features. 
 Mix-and-Match: Enables easier combination and reuse of different schema components. 
 ADC has developed an “OCA Package” which wraps the core OCA standard with extensions for community-specific features and developing standards, allowing for gradual migration of these features to the core standard as they become accepted. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Assigned vs. Derived Identifiers:
 
 Assigned Identifiers (Names): Created by a governance body, linked to an object via a lookup table. Resolution requires trusting the authoritative governance body and their lookup table. “If you find an object, you cannot figure out the identifier – you must go to the authoritative body and look it up in their table.” Resolution services can only be hosted or delegated by the governance body. 
 Derived Identifiers (Digests/Fingerprints): Calculated directly from a digital object using a hashing function. They are unique fingerprints for a specific version of the object. Key for reproducibility and authenticity: “You can identify the resource originally used. You can verify the resource is the same one that was originally used.” Anyone can calculate a derived identifier, build a resolution service, and verify the resolution service is pointing to the correct object. Derived identifiers enable objects to be hosted in multiple locations. Carly Huitema humorously quotes, “If you liked it, then you should have put a digest on it.” Derived identifiers are excellent for snapshots but do not handle dynamic content or versioning directly. Versioning requires a governing authority or a decentralized identifier (DID) system where subsequent versions are linked and controlled. 
 
 
 Tools Provided by the Semantic Engine:
 
 Schema Authoring Web App: Guides researchers through creating machine-readable schemas. 
 Data Entry Excel Generator: Creates an Excel spreadsheet with headers and schema descriptions based on the authored schema, helping standardize data collection. Includes the schema’s derived identifier. 
 Data Entry on the Web / Data Verification Engine: A tool to verify data sets against the rules defined in a schema. Allows researchers to quickly check for inconsistencies before combining data from multiple sources. 
 
 
 Integration into Research Infrastructure: ADC is working to integrate their schemas and tools into existing Canadian and international research infrastructure.
 
 Schemas can be deposited into long-term research data repositories (e.g., Borealis in Canada), often receiving assigned identifiers like DOIs. 
 These schemas, with their embedded derived identifiers, can then be found through federated search engines that index multiple repositories (e.g., Lunaris in Canada, OpenAIRE in Europe).  
 This allows researchers to publish papers referencing schemas by their identifiers, enabling others to find and verify the schema used. 
 
 
 Addressing IP and Sensitive Data:
 
 The Semantic Engine itself does not store user data or schemas, reducing IP concerns related to the platform. 
 Schemas are generally less sensitive than the actual data, allowing them to be more openly shared. This enables discovery of datasets and potential collaborations without exposing proprietary information. 
 Schemas can include flags for sensitive data attributes (e.g., farm location). While ADC’s tools don’t currently enforce access controls based on these flags, this information in the machine-readable schema can be used by internal pipelines or other systems to manage sensitive data appropriately (e.g., triggering anonymization). 
 
 
 Future Directions: ADC plans to continue integrating with research infrastructure, add digests as identifiers to more objects, and develop tools for other machine-readable standards (e.g., cataloging metadata, policy rules). They also aim to increase the number of features supported in the schema description process (e.g., range rules, ontology framing). 
 
 
 
 Key Takeaways for ToIP 
 
 The FAIR data principles are highly relevant to decentralized ecosystems and align well with ToIP goals. 
 Derived identifiers (digests) offer significant advantages for reproducibility, authenticity, and decentralized resolution, making them a powerful tool for digital objects within a trust framework. 
 The architecture of data schemas (feature-by-feature vs. attribute-by-attribute) has implications for governance, versioning, and the application of derived identifiers to schema components. 
 Integrating decentralized identity and verifiable credentials concepts (like OCA) into existing research infrastructure can enhance discoverability, interoperability, and trust in scientific data. 
 The Semantic Engine provides a practical example of building user-friendly tools to generate machine-readable metadata, addressing the challenge of widespread adoption of such standards.

		<p>This document and podcast were generated by Google’s NotebookLM. They provide information about <a href="https://www.glia.net/richard-whitt">Richard Whitt</a>‘s vision for a more human-centric internet built on trust, as presented to the Ecosystem &amp; Governance Working Group (EGWG) of the Trust over IP Foundation on March 20, 2025. It also draws from materials related to the <a href="https://www.glia.net/">GLIA Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.glianetalliance.org/">GliaNet Alliance</a>, founded by Richard Whitt.</p>
<p>The current state of the web is characterized by surveillance capitalism, where companies prioritize data extraction and manipulation, leading to a lack of trust. Richard Whitt argues that this undermines human agency and necessitates a shift towards a web built on trustworthy intermediaries.</p>
<p>His proposed solution centers around the concept of Net Fiduciaries, a new category of entities that would prioritize users’ interests through the application of fiduciary duties like care and loyalty, similar to professionals in medicine and law. This would be a voluntary approach, driven by ethical considerations and good business practices, rather than imposed regulations on existing platforms.</p>
<p>The GliaNet Alliance is a coalition of companies and organizations committed to this vision. Its goal is to build a “web worthy of trust” by fostering ethical technology practices and using transformative governance principles. The alliance operates as a community of practice, with working groups focusing on areas like business models, policies, practices, and standards.</p>
<p>Key concepts discussed include:</p>
 
 The SEAMS cycle (Surveillance, Extraction, Analysis, Manipulation), which describes the problematic data practices prevalent on the web. 
 Glea, the ancient Greek word for glue, symbolizing trust as the social glue. 
 A multi-layered approach to change, encompassing governance, markets, technology (edge tech), and public policy. 
 The importance of authentic personal AI agents that operate on behalf of the user, contrasting with the “double agent” nature of current AI assistants that primarily serve platform interests. 
 The distinction between agenticity (capability) and agentiality (acting on behalf of) in AI systems. 
 The potential for interoperability between AI agents across different platforms. 
 
<p>The alliance is exploring ways to demonstrate trust to the public, potentially through analogies (like a “doctor for your web life”), marketing that emphasizes fiduciary duties, and clear communication about data handling practices. They are also considering mechanisms for recourse in case of breaches.</p>
<p>Richard Whitt’s book, “Reweaving the Web,” further elaborates on these ideas, outlining the problems with the current web and proposing practical steps to create a more user-centric digital future. The book has received positive testimonials from prominent figures in the tech and policy fields.</p>
<p>The GliaNet Alliance is in its early stages, focused on building its community, establishing governance structures, and exploring business models that align with its ethical principles. They are also engaging with policymakers and exploring potential collaborations, including with the Trust over IP Foundation. Consumer Reports is an anchor member and is exploring branding its AI agent as a GliaNet project. Kwaai.ai, an open-source LLM project, is also part of the alliance, aiming to build a platform with fiduciary duties to developers and agents.</p>

 A breakthrough collaboration 
  
<p>From April 28-30, 2025, Stockholm became the epicentre of innovation in digital identity federation as <a href="https://sunet.se/en/about-sunet">SUNET</a> welcomed 30 international delegates with 14 implementations to a groundbreaking OpenID Federation Interoperability event. The event brought together leaders from the private sector, government, not-for-profits,&nbsp; academic institutions, technical experts, and policy collaborators to prove out the Federation standard through live implementation interoperability testing – a pivotal milestone in the specification’s&nbsp; journey to become a final specification.</p>
<p></p>
<p>OpenID Federation is a breakthrough approach to federation that enables trust to be established between parties with no direct relationship between them by virtue of them belonging to a common federation. This modernizes the approach for establishing trust among parties for multiple purposes, including verifiable credential deployments, and seamless integration of multiple trust networks.</p>
<p>Hosted by SUNET (Swedish University Computer Network), this event was a rare opportunity to gather leading minds in identity federation into one room, to not only test the specs and identify potential improvements but to coalesce critical industry partners on realizing the potential of the specification to meet the requirements they have for ecosystems today. Participants came from Sweden, Finland, Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Portugal, Poland, Serbia, Croatia, the UK, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States!</p>
<p>“It was a pleasure to host the OpenID Foundation. The opportunity for our local community, particularly those in the public sector, to engage directly with international thought leaders was truly invaluable. We look forward to welcoming them again soon,” said Leif Johansson, SUNET.</p>
 1. Implementations 
<p>Day one kicked off with participants aligning their implementations to the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Federation 1.0 (draft 42) specification</a>. Each team brought their own unique infrastructure, metadata configurations, and trust policies to the&nbsp;table, showcasing the diversity of approaches and the flexibility of the specification.</p>
<p>There was a real spirit of collaboration in the air. Teams from different countries worked in partnership to configure and test their implementations, capturing feedback on the specs, the open source tests, and highlighting real-world integration scenarios. For the participants with a strong EU focus, many explored how these building blocks can deliver on the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home#:~:text=The%20document%20sets%20out%20the%20common%20architecture%20of,the%20five%20initial%20implementing%20regulations%20adopted%20so%20far.">EU Digital Identity Wallet ecosystem</a> requirements.</p>
<p>Mike Jones, Board Member at the OpenID Foundation said: “There’s no substitute for getting developers and deployers together to collaborate and kick the tires together. People worked closely together over three days, many of whom and previously never met. We learned valuable things about our implementations, the specification, and the certification tests that will improve all of them.&nbsp; This puts us on a solid track to finish the specification and to have leading-edge ecosystems benefit from it.”</p>
<p></p>
 2. Testing 
<p>After initial setup, it was time to stress-test the connections. The energy in the room was palpable with mixed groups reviewing and debating code whilst viewing shared terminals, debugging issues, and huddling spontaneously at whiteboards. Through structured testing and ad-hoc exploration, participants uncovered edge cases that could inform the underlying specifications and issues that could improve the tests, but crucially they could also see where their own implementations could be improved. Eight different classes of tests were performed among the 14 implementations.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Roland Hedberg, lead editor of the Federation specification, said: “Three very intensive and fun days. I was so impressed by the number of implementers present and their willingness to put their work up for evaluation. One thought that struck me was the underlying pervasive feeling that it’s now not a question about if people will use OpenID Federation, but rather when they will start.”</p>
 3. Results 
<p>The interop delivered measurable progress for everyone involved. Participants left with working federation configurations, validated trust chains, and actionable insights into specification gaps or areas of ambiguity. It was a technical leap forward that only face-to-face interoperability and cross-implementor collaboration can achieve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Portrait of the Federation Entities involved during the interop event.</p>
<p>While challenges were expected, the collective learning has now given the OpenID community clear visibility on the path to a final specification.</p>
<p>Dima Postnikov, representing <a href="https://connectid.com.au/">ConnectID</a>, said, “Trust management and discovery are now recognized as essential building blocks for anyone who runs ecosystems. This interoperability event has clearly shown that the OpenID Federation specification has reached the level of maturity required for global adoption, as demonstrated by the number of active participants representing real ecosystems and software solutions. OpenID Federation specification has a lot of potential for many more use cases and many different types of ecosystems.”</p>
 4. Lessons Learned 
<p>The week’s testing surfaced several areas for improvement, both in the specification itself and in the surrounding tooling:</p>
 
 Clarification of policy requirements across federation operators. 
 Improved debugging tools for tracking trust chain resolution. 
 Diversity of algorithms used for signing Entity Statements. 
 
<p>Henri Mikkonen, representing <a href="https://www.shibboleth.net">Shibboleth</a>, said, “The event helped us to verify that after some fairly minor fine-tunings we’re already quite well interoperable with the latest draft of the spec. It means that we can start participating in pilots. We were very happy to see that the OpenID Foundation’s conformance test suite is getting populated with tests for the federation draft too. We’re very happy to be early adopters for those tests as they’ve been super useful for testing standard OIDC features too. The good team spirit established in person means that we can continue to test interoperability remotely even after the event, crossing organizational boundaries.”</p>
<p>All feedback gathered during the event will feed into upcoming working group discussions, reinforcing the event’s role not just in implementation, but in shaping the next steps for OpenID Federation.</p>
<p></p>
 5. Next Steps 
<p>In the weeks and months ahead, the group is focused on three clear next steps:</p>
 
 Publishing updated implementation guidance based on interoperability learnings in Sweden. 
 Addressing feedback and finalising v1.0 of the OpenID Federation specification. 
 Preparing for future interoperability events, including virtual sessions and additional in-person gatherings in the second half of 2025. 
 
<p>Gail Hodges, Executive Director of the OpenID Foundation, said “Technologists that lead ecosystems face common challenges. The OpenID Foundation is honored that so many leading technologists have committed thousands of volunteer hours to develop the next generation in federation, and it is a personal joy to see them celebrating this milestone moment of interoperability and accomplishment. I cannot wait until we can celebrate the specification moving to final soon!”</p>
<p>As the work on OpenID Federation matures and ecosystem awareness builds, the OpenID Foundation expects deployment will ripple through projects, products, and jurisdictions around the world.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The National Cyber Security Centre said moving to digital passkeys to log on to Gov.UK was a vital step in making the tech more ubiquitous.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/government">Government</a>&nbsp;has announced plans to replace passwords as the way to access&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/govuk">Gov.UK</a>, its digital services platform for the public.</p>



<p>In contrast to using a password and then an additional text message or code sent to a user’s trusted device – known as two-factor authentication – passkeys are unique digital keys tied to a specific device that proves the user’s identity when they log in without requiring them to input any further codes.</p>

<p>At the 2025 RSAC Conference in San Francisco, our team met with dozens of industry experts, cybersecurity professionals, and investors to find out more about the biggest security technologies and trends that are impacting your business.&nbsp;</p>



 Tech-Specific Innovation 



<p>While AI was one of the hottest topics at the show, it wasn’t the&nbsp;only&nbsp;topic of discussion; we also heard a lot about the evolving ransomware ecosystem and what organizations need to be doing today to prepare for the arrival of “Q-Day”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But perhaps the second-biggest discussion piece was around identity and access security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the rise of AI-powered deepfakes and fraud attempts, we’re seeing more need than ever before for organizations to make the switch from passwords to more secure methods of authentication, such as Passkeys—and many experts were optimistic that this space will see a lot of adoption over the next year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key Insights:</p>



 
 Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance:&nbsp;“We’re going to see Passkey deployment continue to grow in regulated industries. That’s really important, because addressing the higher assurance use cases and taking passwords out of play there will give greater confidence for more and more companies to deploy Passkeys at scale, which will further accelerate our journey towards putting passwords fully in the rear-view mirror.”

<p>Microsoft has officially shifted to <a href="https://www.msspalert.com/news/world-password-day-puts-a-spotlight-on-passwords-passwordless">passkeys</a>, such as facial recognition, fingerprint scans, and PINs, as the default sign-in method for all new accounts beginning this month, marking its most significant step yet toward a password-free future, according to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-microsoft-passwordless-world-password-day/">TechRepublic</a>.</p>



<p>The move coincides with World Password Day and aligns with the tech giant’s broader commitment to the Passkey Pledge, an industry initiative to eliminate passwords in favor of more secure, phishing-resistant login methods. In a blog post, Microsoft executives Joy Chik and Vasu Jakkal emphasized that passkey users are three times more likely to log in successfully than those using passwords. Although existing account holders can still use passwords, Microsoft is nudging them toward using biometrics or PINs by default. Nearly all Windows users already rely on Windows Hello, and the shift is backed by support from industry partners, including Apple and Google, who are also rolling out FIDO-compliant passkey systems across their platforms. The change promises to streamline security and user experience across the board.</p>

<p>FIDO-Based Authentication to Replace SMS-Based Verification, Says UK NCSC</p>



<p>The U.K. government is set to replace SMS-based verification systems for digital services with passkeys this year in a bid to shore up cyber defenses.</p>



<p>The initiative will be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/government-adopt-passkey-technology-digital-services">rolled out</a>&nbsp;by the U.K. National Cybersecurity Center using the open authentication standard Fast IDentity Online, or FIDO, as a more “secure and cost-effective solution.”</p>



<p>“The NCSC considers passkey adoption as vital for transforming cyber resilience at a national scale,” the NCSC said. “In addition to enhanced security and cost savings, passkeys offer users a faster login experience, saving approximately one minute per login when compared to entering a username, password and SMS code,” the agency said.</p>

 Most cyber attacks leverage identities. These standards are our best defense against such attacks. 
<p>Co-authored by Atul Tulshibagwale, CTO of <a href="https://sgnl.ai/">SGNL</a>, Co-chair of <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals">Shared Signals Working Group</a>, and Corporate Board Member of OpenID Foundation, and Omri Gazitt, co-founder &amp; CEO of <a href="https://www.aserto.com">Aserto</a> and co-chair of <a href="https://openid.net/wg/authzen/">AuthZEN Working Group</a>.</p>
<p>These days, most cyber attacks compromise employee identities to breach organizations. To protect against these attacks, it is critical for all cloud services to have the latest information about each session. Instant information sharing enables making access decisions that allow access to legitimate users, while blocking attackers who attempt to impersonate legitimate users. CAEP, SSF and AuthZEN are standards that can help achieve this. Read the blog below to learn how.</p>
<p>At the recently concluded <a href="https://openid.net/authzen-shared-signals-in-the-gartner-iam-2025-spotlight/">Gartner IAM Summit in London</a>, the OpenID Foundation hosted two interoperability events. One focused on CAEP and SSF, and the other focused on AuthZEN. A question that some attendees of the conference, and those who came to see the interoperability demos, asked was, “do CAEP and AuthZEN compete with each other?”. The short answer is no, they provide complementary functionality to make dynamic authorization decisions. Read the rest of this blog to learn how.</p>
 What are CAEP and AuthZEN? 
 Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol / Profile (CAEP) 
<p>CAEP, which stands for the “Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol” (or “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-ID2.html">Continuous Access Evaluation Profile</a>” when referring just to the specification) is a means of conveying events that impact the properties of logged in sessions. The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0.html">Shared Signals Framework</a> (SSF) provides a robust and rich asynchronous event transport, and the CAEP specification defines the events which affect session properties. So while transmitters and receivers can use SSF to create, pause and delete streams of events between them, the CAEP spec defines events such as “session revoked”, “token claims change” or “device compliance change”, which can communicate changes in session state. Together, SSF and the Continuous Access Evaluation Profile form the Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol. To be clear, SSF is not just used for CAEP, it is also used for communicating account security events through <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-risc-profile-specification-1_0.html">RISC</a> (Risk Information Sharing and Coordination), and can be used as a transport for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scim-events/">SCIM Events</a> which convey account updates. Shared Signals is a foundational standard, and just like we are seeing large scale adoption of CAEP and RISC, we expect more profiles to be created on top of SSF for various specialized purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following diagram describes a typical CAEP architecture:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://sgnl.ai">SGNL</a>)</p>
 AuthZEN 
<p>NIST has defined an externalized authorization model in their <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/162/upd2/final">SP 800-162</a> publication (sometimes referred to as the “P*P” model), which can be used to externalize authorization decisions from an application or service. This architecture is described in the diagram below:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Source: <a href="https://www.aserto.com/">Aserto</a>)</p>
<p>In the above diagram, when a user requests a resource (arrow 1), the application, acting as a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), delegates the decision (arrow 2) to a Policy Decision Point (PDP). The PDP consults policies (arrow 3) that are managed offline by a Policy Administration Point (PAP). A Policy Information Point (PIP) provides data that is required for the PDP to make an access decision. Some PDPs might be stateful, and can retain data within themselves instead of always relying on a PIP. A PDP refers to its own state (which can be thought of as an internal PIP) or refers to the external PIP in order to make an access decision.</p>
<p>The AuthZEN working group’s charter is to standardize communication between all of these various components, with an initial focus on standardizing the API between the PEP and PDP.</p>
 So how do these relate to each other? 
<p>To understand the relationship between CAEP and AuthZEN, let’s put this in the broader context of modern zero-trust cloud architecture. Any modern enterprise depends on tens (maybe hundreds) of cloud services providing a range of services, including infrastructure, managed services, security, device and identity management, and end-user applications.</p>
<p>When a user accesses a specific resource within your cloud-based service, your service needs to determine whether or not that access should be allowed. Following the “P*P” pattern, the service will call a PDP to determine that. The PDP will in turn refer to data available locally to make the decision. All these interactions have to be local, because they are in the critical path of the application request, and the latency has to be minimal. Indeed, for each web page that the user loads, there may be hundreds of resources being accessed, each requiring their own access decisions.</p>
<p>The PDP needs to make instant decisions, but the locally available information may be out of date. This includes session properties such as whether the user is accessing the service from a managed device, whether the user’s session is still valid, and whether the user currently has the business need to access the requested resources. Each of these bits of information may be with a different cloud service, so fetching all of this at the time the user is trying to access the requested resources seriously affects latency and availability of your cloud service.</p>
<p>This is where CAEP comes in. CAEP can be used to asynchronously deliver the required information to any cloud service that needs to factor it in their access decisions. The access decisions themselves can use AuthZEN between the PEP and PDP. SSF provides a robust framework to determine who can subscribe to which information, and about which subjects. CAEP provides the information relevant to the session properties that can affect access decisions.</p>
<p></p>
 AuthZEN and the Shared Signals Framework 
<p>The pattern of asynchronous event delivery into stateful PDPs isn’t restricted to session signals. For example, the source of truth for users and groups is typically an Identity Provider (IdP) or a corporate directory such as Active Directory. User attributes and group membership are commonly used as data that informs authorization decisions. And indeed, many stateful PDPs will cache this information.</p>
<p>When users get added, or group memberships change, PDPs must be informed and refresh their state. SCIM Events represents a way to layer this capability on top of SSF.</p>
<p>Going further, when it comes to resource ownership and sharing, services typically keep track of this information, but must have a way of informing the PDP that the access control relationships between users/groups and resources have changed.</p>
<p>The AuthZEN working group plans to tackle these use-cases in the second half of 2025, and intends on using SSF as the foundation.</p>
 Further Reading: Rounding out the authorization architecture 
 The Continuous Security Paradigm (CSP) 
<p>This interplay of synchronous local decisions and asynchronous communication of required information is described in a bit more detail in the “<a href="https://idpro.org/continuous-security/">Continuous Security Paradigm</a>”, an article published by SSWG co-chairs Atul Tulshibagwale and Sean O’Dell in the IDPro blog.</p>
 Transaction Tokens (TraTs) 
<p>Applications, or cloud services themselves, may be composed of tens or hundreds of microservices. Any external invocation (such as the user requesting a specific transaction) results in a call chain that touches many of these microservices. Each microservice provides an internal API that can be called from within the application’s Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Now, the application may obtain a decision from the PDP for an external invocation by the user, but doing so from each microservice may be overwhelming for a PDP. This is because every end-user action in the UI might result in hundreds of calls to the applications, and each call may touch multiple microservices. So if each microservice were to call the PDP, then for each user request the PDP might have to respond to thousands of queries.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one cannot assume that the VPC is safe from tampering, because there have been devastating breaches where attackers have lurked inside an application’s VPC, causing tremendous damage without leaving a trace. There are also insider attacks where empowered insiders can misuse their access to call internal APIs. Software supply chains may also be compromised, causing your legitimate services to inflict internal damage.</p>
<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-transaction-tokens/">Transaction Tokens</a> is an upcoming standard in the IETF that addresses all of these concerns and doesn’t require each microservice to call the PDP. It helps applications bind the decisions received from a PDP to a cryptographically signed ephemeral token, so that a decision issued by the PDP can be captured in a TraT and passed down to all microservices in a call chain. This ensures that the PDPs decision is not inadvertently or maliciously modified internally to misrepresent the intent of external users.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>We’ve tried to cover many aspects of authorization in this post. There is much work to be done in every one of these areas, but the good news is that we are now maturing as a technology space, and the pattern proposed in CSP and implemented using standards like Shared Signals, CAEP, AuthZEN, and TraTs can go a long way in securing zero-trust cloud architectures.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;FIDO Alliance&nbsp;announced today the launch of a new&nbsp;Payments Working Group&nbsp;(PWG) focused on developing and implementing FIDO authentication solutions specifically for payment use cases. This initiative marks a significant expansion of the organization’s efforts to eliminate password dependencies in critical digital transactions.</p>



<p>The new working group emerges at a time of growing momentum for&nbsp;passwordless authentication&nbsp;in the payments sector. Last year,&nbsp;<a href="https://idtechwire.com/visa-brings-passkeys-to-online-payments-in-major-fido-victory/">Visa implemented passkeys for online payments</a>, allowing customers to authorize transactions using&nbsp;biometric authentication&nbsp;rather than traditional passwords.</p>



<p>The Alliance, which now comprises over 250 members, has been steadily expanding its influence across various sectors of digital authentication.</p>

<p>Anyone setting up a new Microsoft account will soon find they’re encouraged to use a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/passwordless-authentication-what-it-is-and-why-you-need-it-asap">passkey</a>&nbsp;during the sign-up process.</p>



<p>Microsoft introduced passkey support across most of its consumer apps last year, allowing users to sign into their accounts without the need for 2FA methods or remembering long passwords. A year later, it’s removing passwords as the default and encouraging all new signups to use passkeys.</p>



<p>PCMag attempted to sign up for a new Microsoft account on May 2, but it still asked for a password at the time of publication. Microsoft hasn’t shared an exact timeframe for when the change will take place, but you should expect it to happen in the coming days.</p>



<p>This is the first time a new account can be entirely passwordless. Previously, it had to have one alongside your passkey.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/05/01/pushing-passkeys-forward-microsofts-latest-updates-for-simpler-safer-sign-ins/">blog post</a>, Microsoft says 98% of passkey attempts to log in are successful, while passwords are only at 32%. Microsoft is also&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/new-user-experience-for-consumer-authentication/3822035">introducing</a>&nbsp;what it calls a “streamlined” sign-in experience for all accounts that “prioritizes passwordless methods for sign-in and sign-up.” It means some UX design changes to highlight passkey functionality.</p>

 Reviewing the landscape and sharing our&nbsp;approach <p>WAO is currently working on a project with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/responsible-innovation-centre">Responsible Innovation Centre for Public Media Futures</a> (RIC), hosted by the BBC. Our focus is on AI Literacy for 14–19 year olds and you can read more context in our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-does-ai-literacy-look-like-for-young-people-aged-14-19-8b4d798eb369">project kick-off blog&nbsp;post</a>.</p><p>One of the deliverables for this project is to review AI Literacy frameworks, with a view to either making a recommendation, or coming up with a new one. It’s not just a case of choosing one with a pretty&nbsp;diagram!</p><p>Frameworks are a way in which an individual or organisation can indicate what is worth paying attention to in a given situation. Just as the definition of ‘AI Literacy’ varies by context, the usefulness of a framework depends on the situation. In this post, we share the judgements we made using criteria we developed and share our process in case it is useful for your own&nbsp;work.</p> Narrowing down the&nbsp;list <p>While there can be some commonality and overlaps between frameworks for different contexts, the diversity of possible situations is huge. There can never be a single ‘perfect’ framework suitable for every situation. For example, just imagine what ‘AI Literacy’ might look like for (adult) engineers and developers compared with children of primary school age. As with <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/tag/web-literacy-map/">our work at Mozilla</a> you can define what a ‘map’ of new literacies might look like, but it can only ever be one of many that describe the overall ‘territory’.</p><p>With our work on this project, we had to bear in mind our audience (14–19 year olds) and the mission of the BBC. There is a long history of Critical Media Literacy which is particularly relevant to our research here, and which was one of the factors when reviewing frameworks.</p><p>With a relatively short project timeline of three months, we needed a way to quickly classify approximately forty frameworks and related documents we have collected. We shared relevant details with <a href="https://perplexity.ai">Perplexity AI</a> (using the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model) over multiple conversations. This helped us reduce our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQJ39Y1ic6DDDpyv9JzHGqQgdBnVeleCoXRXlI-J2uP8HO7YGy8SV9V5M7nDb9cYiAErK8jgx0DPneh/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true">initial list of around 40 frameworks</a> to a more manageable 25.</p> Coming up with&nbsp;criteria <p>Next, we came up with some criteria by which to judge them. These criteria were informed by our own work in the area for 15+ years, along with either interviews or surveys with over 35 experts in the field. While these criteria are meant as a heuristic for this project, they are also a useful starting point for asking questions about any project relating to new literacies.</p>  Definition of AI — ensures everyone has the same starting&nbsp;point  Development process — adds transparency and credibility  Target audience — helps match the framework to its&nbsp;users  Real-world relevance — shows how ideas work in&nbsp;practice  AI safety and ethics — addresses both risks and responsible use  Skills and competencies listed — clarifies what learners should be able to&nbsp;do  Reputable source — increases trust in the framework  <p>We included both safety and ethics because both are needed for using AI in a responsible and trustworthy way.</p> Categorising the most relevant frameworks <p>We used a traffic light (red/yellow/green) categorisation system to score each framework on the above criteria. Only one of the frameworks we reviewed, the <a href="https://oecd.ai/en/classification">OECD Framework for Classifying AI Systems</a>, meets all criteria with a ‘green’&nbsp;rating.</p><p>There are several other frameworks which we judge as meeting the criteria as ‘green’ except for one criterion (‘yellow’). Listed alphabetically by organisation, these&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://digitalpromise.org/initiative/artificial-intelligence-in-education/">Artificial Intelligence in Education</a> (Digital&nbsp;Promise)  <a href="https://www.educause.edu/content/2024/ai-literacy-in-teaching-and-learning/executive-summary">AI Literacy in Teaching and Learning: A Durable Framework for Higher Education</a> (EDUCAUSE)  <a href="https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/projects-and-activities/education-and-training/digital-transformation-education/digital-competence-framework-citizens-digcomp_en">Digital Competence Framework for Citizens</a> (European Commission)  <a href="https://www.goodthingsfoundation.org/policy-and-research/research-and-evidence/research-2024/ai-literacy">Developing AI Literacy With People Who Have Low Or No Digital Skills</a> (Good Things Foundation)  <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000391105">AI competency framework for students</a>&nbsp;(UNESCO)  <p>There are other frameworks which we have decided to include which included two or more criterion as ‘yellow’. For example, the Open University’s <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/learning-design/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/OU-Critical-AI-Literacy-framework-2025-external-sharing.pdf">Critical AI Literacy Framework</a>, Ng, et al’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X21000357">article</a>, and Prof. Maha Bali’s <a href="https://blog.mahabali.me/educational-technology-2/what-i-mean-when-i-say-critical-ai-literacy/">blog post</a> linked from her <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/highereducation/2024/02/26/where-are-the-crescents-in-ai/">framework</a> all do a good job of defining Critical AI Literacies. We would also note that the <a href="https://www.digitaleducationcouncil.com/form/ai-literacy-framework">Digital Education Council</a>’s list of skills and competencies relating to AI Literacy is useful to pair with those from EDUCAUSE, UNESCO, and the European Commission.</p> Next steps <p>As mentioned earlier, our brief for this project involves either making an informed recommendation of a framework, or to come up with our own. We’re currently leaning toward the latter, but either choice will be the subject of a future blog&nbsp;post.</p><p>If you have questions, concerns, comments, or indeed a particularly useful resource which you think would be useful for this project, please do get in touch.

<p>After supporting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20690359/microsoft-windows-10-passwordless-password-option-update">passwordless Windows logins</a>&nbsp;for years and even allowing users to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675175/microsoft-account-passwordless-no-password-security-feature">delete passwords from their accounts</a>, Microsoft is making its biggest move yet toward a future with no passwords. Now it will ask people signing up for new accounts to only use more secure methods like passkeys, push notifications, and security keys instead, by default.</p>



<p>The new no-password initiative by Microsoft is accompanied by its recently launched,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636622/microsoft-account-sign-in-new-design-dark-mode">optimized sign-in window</a>&nbsp;design with reordered steps that flow better for a passwordless and passkey-first experience.</p>



<p>Although current accounts won’t have to shed their passwords, new ones will try and leave them behind by not prompting you to create a password at all:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of this simplified UX, we’re changing the default behavior for new accounts. Brand new Microsoft accounts will now be “passwordless by default.” New users will have several passwordless options for signing into their account and they’ll never need to enroll a password. Existing users can visit their account settings to delete their password.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With today’s changes, Microsoft is renaming “World Password Day” to “World Passkey Day” instead and pledges to continue its work implementing passkeys over the coming year. This time last year, the company implemented&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147124/microsoft-passkeys-support-consumer-msa">passkeys into consumer accounts</a>. Microsoft says it’s seeing “nearly a million passkeys registered every day,” and that passkey users have a 98 percent success rate of signing in versus 32 percent for password-based accounts.</p>

<p>As you’ll already know, today is&nbsp;<a href="https://betanews.com/2025/05/01/move-over-passwords-every-verification-method-has-its-day/">World Passkey Day</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>&nbsp;has released an independent study of over 1,300 consumers across the US, UK, China, South Korea, and Japan to understand how passkey usage and consumer attitudes towards authentication have evolved.</p>



<p>The results are encouraging, they find 74 percent of consumers are aware of passkeys and 69 percent have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts.</p>



<p>Among those who have used passkeys, 38 percent report enabling them whenever possible. More than half of consumers now believe passkeys are both more secure (53 percent) and more convenient (54 percent) than passwords.</p>



<p>This increase in passkey adoption is likely driven by the shortcomings of passwords. Last year, over 35 percent of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities. In addition, 47 percent of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account.</p>



<p>To further encourage organizations to embrace the shift to passkeys, the FIDO Alliance has also launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">Passkey Pledge</a>, a voluntary pledge for online service providers and authentication product and service vendors committed to embracing passkeys.</p>



<p>“The establishment and growth of World Passkey Day reflects the fact that organizations of all shapes and sizes are taking action upon the imperative to move away from relying on passwords and other legacy authentication methods that have led to decades of data breaches, account takeovers and user frustration, which imperil the very foundations of our connected society,” says Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance. “We’re thrilled by the fact that over 100 organizations around the world signed our Passkey Pledge, and we are pleased to support the market in their march towards passkeys through a variety of freely available assets, including our market-leading Passkey Central resource center.”</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wpd-report-2025-consumer-password-passkey-trends/">full report</a>&nbsp;is available from the FIDO Alliance site.</p>

<p>Microsoft is on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/04/05/microsoft-confirms-password-deletion-for-windows-users-what-you-do-now/">mission to delete passwords</a>&nbsp;for a billion users, given that “<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/12/12/convincing-a-billion-users-to-love-passkeys-ux-design-insights-from-microsoft-to-boost-adoption-and-security/">the password era is ending</a>.” The Windows-maker warns users that “bad actors know it, which is why they’re desperately accelerating password-related attacks while they still can.” And those attacks are now making headlines weekly.</p>



<p>The answer is passkeys, which link your account security to your physical device security, which means unless an attacker has access to your hardware and unlock method — biometric or PIN, they can’t bypass a password to login.</p>



<p>More than others, Microsoft is not just promoting passkeys but also password deletion: “If a user has both a passkey and a password, and both grant access to an account, the account is still at risk for phishing. Our ultimate goal is to remove passwords completely and have accounts that only support phishing-resistant credentials.”</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>, the organization charged with promoting passkeys has taken to the internet airwaves this time around to “launch a Passkey Pledge to further accelerate [the] global movement away from passwords.”</p>



<p>Its latest research found that “over 35% of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities, [and] 47% of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account. This is significant for passkey adoption, as 54% of people familiar with passkeys consider them to be more convenient than passwords, and 53% believe they offer greater security.”</p>



<p>FIDO has welcomed Microsoft’s password deletion as industry leading. “This is an exciting and seminal milestone as Microsoft is taking passwords out of play for over a billion user accounts,” its CEO Andrew Shikiar told me, “who can now instead leverage user-friendly, phishing-resistant passkeys. Microsoft’s leadership in doing so today will help encourage more service providers to do the same, which moves us collectively closer to the day when passwords are fully in our rear-view mirror.”</p>

 Moving past passwords is improving brand trust 



<p>The FIDO Alliance has also recently invited companies to participate in the World Passkey Pledge to create a more secure future, and move past the vulnerability and hassle of passwords.</p>



<p>Simon McNally, Cybersecurity Expert at Thales said, “Passwords have long been a weak link in digital security, forcing consumers and businesses into a frustrating cycle of password resets and potential breaches. We welcome the FIDO Alliance’s commitment to World Passkey Day and its push for a passwordless future. Passkeys provide a seamless and secure authentication experience, eliminating the risks and frustrations associated with traditional passwords.</p>



<p>Passkeys are automatically generated and securely stored, removing the burden of creating and managing complex passwords. They also enhance privacy by allowing authentication without sharing sensitive data, reducing the risk of breaches. As trust in digital security becomes more critical, businesses must prioritise passwordless solutions to protect users and build brand confidence.”</p>



 The Passkey Pledge for a Passwordless Future 



<p>To commemorate World Password Day (or at it will henceforth be known, World Passkey Day), the FIDO Alliance has released a<a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/fido-alliance-champions-widespread-passkey-adoption-and-a-passwordless-future-on-world-passkey-day-2025-302443727.html">&nbsp;survey</a>&nbsp;on the usage of passkeys which found that&nbsp;74% of consumers are aware of passkeys, meaning that consumers are aware of the potential value a passkey login experience can bring. To support this, the survey also found that&nbsp;69% of consumers have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts.</p>



<p>Furthermore, for those who have used passkeys,&nbsp;38% report enabling them whenever possible&nbsp;suggesting that some consumers already see the added user experience and security benefits passkeys bring. In fact,&nbsp;more than half of consumers believe passkeys are both more secure (53%) and more convenient (54%) than passwords. Many businesses and organizations have already signed the<a href="http://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">&nbsp;Passkey Pledge</a>, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and many more!</p>



 A pivotal moment 



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance, commented on both the recent survey, and the Passkey Pledge:</p>



<p>“This year’s World Passkey Day comes at a pivotal moment for user authentication around the world – with a rapidly growing number of service providers (including nearly half of the world’s top 100 websites) offering billions of user accounts the option to sign in with passkeys instead of passwords. Well&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">over 100 organizations</a>&nbsp;have taken the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-launches-the-passkey-pledge-to-further-accelerate-global-movement-away-from-passwords/">Passkey Pledge</a>, indicating their commitment towards a future free from the risk and burdens of passwords.</p>



<p>Consumers are not only increasingly aware of passkeys, they’re using them more frequently: 69% of respondents to our recent survey are enabling them on at least one account, and 38% are now enabling them whenever possible.</p>



<p>Passkeys are so intuitive to use that once users integrate passkeys, they rarely go back. This is good for consumers who are frustrated by password reliant sign-in processes — 35% of whom said they experienced account compromises as a result of password vulnerabilities last year — and e-commerce retailers alike.</p>



<p>This shift isn’t just about innovation or bottom lines; it’s about rebuilding digital trust and creating a safer, more efficient internet for everyone.”</p>

 Representing a major milestone in digital identity progress, this unique event will showcase global stakeholder collaboration, technological innovation, and a clear focus on real-world applicability. 
 Designed for a multi-stakeholder audience, the OpenID Foundations invites interested parties to join the virtual webinar. 
 
<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF), a global leader in open identity standards, is hosting an <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/oidf-webinar-mon-5-may-2025-berlin-tickets-1311865939339?aff=oddtdtcreator">online demonstration</a> showcasing the next generation of digital identity credentials.</p>
<p>The webinar represents a crucial milestone, showcasing real-world and proven interoperability of the OIDF’s <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html">OpenID for Verifiable Presentation</a> (OID4VP), <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-1_0.html">High Assurance Interoperability Profile</a> (HAIP) and the W3C’s <a href="https://github.com/w3c-fedid/digital-credentials">Digital Credentials API</a> (DC API) specifications, among multiple wallets and verifiers, and across regions and with the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO/</a><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">IEC SC17 18013-5 mdl/mdoc</a> and<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/"> IETF </a><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">SD-JWT VC</a> credential formats.</p>
<p>Taking place on Monday, May&nbsp;5th, 2025 (4:30-6:00pm CET / 10:30am-12:00pm ET / 7:30-9:00am&nbsp;PT), the showcase will prove that these specifications are not just theoretical, but ready for adoption.</p>
<p>Parties interested in the subject matter are invited to join the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/oidf-webinar-mon-5-may-2025-berlin-tickets-1311865939339?aff=oddtdtcreator">virtual webinar</a> and hear firsthand from the implementers and VIP representatives from three governments across three regions.</p>
<p>Participants in the interoperability demonstration will include 10 teams of wallets and verifiers as well as technical standards experts from organizations like 1Password, Animo, Bundesdruckerei, Google, Mattr, Microsoft, the NIST NCCoE, and Spruce.</p>
 A significant milestone for global digital identity 
<p>This demonstration is the product of global cooperation among government contributors, industry leaders, peer standards organizations, and other technical experts who are committed to building scalable and interoperable protocols that are robust, secure, and reliable.&nbsp; Together, they ensure that the specifications have been designed with an international and multi-stakeholder perspective on digital identity, so implementers can have confidence deploying them.</p>
<p>The interoperability event will also demonstrate the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/nccoe-mdl-project-static-website/kyc_cip_onboarding.html">NIST NCCoE Digital Identities – Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) architecture</a>, which leverages the OID4VP, DC API and HAIP specifications as part of their “open a bank account” use case. The OIDF is proud to act as a <a href="https://openid.net/accelerating-mdl-adoption-united-states/">participant</a> in this project, as a <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/news-insights/nccoe-announces-collaborators-mobile-drivers-license-mdl-project-use-case-1">Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) signatory</a> since August 2024.</p>
<p>“The tools at the heart of this interoperability demonstration are built with security and privacy in mind, protecting users’ personal information while simplifying the process of proving identity online, cross platforms and cross device,” said Gail Hodges Executive Director of the OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>“Beyond the technical safeguards, these advances stand to benefit millions if not billions of people as more and more jurisdictions and institutions issue credentials and they become widely accepted”.</p>
<p>The demonstration will include demonstrations of interoperability by the participating wallet and verifier developer teams from 10+ organizations, and offer testimonials from the developers on their experience deploying the standards. VIP representatives of governments in three regions have also been invited to share their observations on the interoperability demonstration, and their plans to use the standards in their jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Together the implementers hope to offer useful feedback to finalize the specifications within the respective standards bodies. The OIDF intends to publish the three specifications (OID4VP, OID4VCI, and HAIP) as final specifications soon.</p>
<p>Joseph Heenan, Co-Chair of the Digital Credentials Protocols WG, said “Our demonstration not only proves the interoperability of our evolving standards, but also reinforces our commitment to empowering billions worldwide with secure, seamless, and privacy-preserving digital identity solutions. With these standards moving swiftly toward finalization and implementation readiness, we call on all stakeholders to join us on this journey toward a secure, interoperable, and user-centric digital future.”</p>

 About the OpenID Foundation 
<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate. Find out more at<a href="http://www.openid.net/"> openid.net</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>May 1, 2025</p>



<p>In recognition of World Passkey Day (formerly World Password Day), the FIDO Alliance is putting the spotlight on real-world passkey deployments from leading organizations around the globe. Read on for highlights of the successes companies in various industries are seeing from delivering faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins with passkeys—showcasing the global commitment to move away from passwords.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance also released today an independent study of consumers to understand how passkey usage and consumer attitudes towards authentication have evolved. The research found that in the last year, over 35% of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities. In addition, 47% of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account. This is significant for passkey adoption, as 54% of people familiar with passkeys consider them to be more convenient than passwords, and 53% believe they offer greater security.&nbsp;The full report is available <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/World-Password-Day-2025-Final.pdf">here</a>.</p>



<p>ABANCA’s mobile app serves over 1,200,000 customers a month, serving as the bank’s largest branch. Today, more than 42% of its mobile customers are using passkeys via the bank’s ABANCA Key product. As a result, more than 11,000,000 high-risk transactions have been protected without technical or service incidents, and due to the prioritization of UX, they have managed a Customer Effort Score (CES) of 4.7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aflac was the first major insurance company to adopt passkeys in the U.S. Aflac partnered with Transmit Security to launch their passkey authentication initiative Today, only the first phase of the project is complete and yet more than 500,000 Aflac customers have enrolled a passkey, resulting in a 32% reduction in password recovery requests. This has yielded 30,000 fewer calls per month to the call center for identity issues. Aflac reports that the highest enrollment rates occur at the point of registration, reinforcing the FIDO Alliance’s Design Guidelines recommendation to prompt customers during account-related tasks. The steady, organic adoption of passkeys by Aflac customers continues to grow daily and directly contributes to measurable improvements in cost reduction and customer experience.</p>



<p>KDDI now has more than 13.6 million au ID customers that use FIDO and has seen a dramatic decrease (down nearly 35%) in calls to their customer support center as a result. KDDI manages FIDO adoption carefully for both subscribers and non-subscribers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LY Corporation property Yahoo! JAPAN ID now has 28 million active passkeys users. Approximately 50% of user authentication on smartphones now uses passkeys. LY Corporation said that passkeys have a higher success rate and are 2.6 times faster than SMS OTP.</p>



<p>Mercari has seen 9 million users enroll with passkeys, and is enforcing passkey login for users who have enrolled with synced passkeys. Notably, there have been zero phishing incidents at Mercari Shop and Mercoin (a Mercari subsidiary) since March 2023.</p>



<p>Microsoft began rolling out passkeys for Microsoft consumer account in 2024. They now see nearly one million passkeys registered every day. Microsoft has found that users signing in with passkeys are three times more successful at getting into their account than password users (about 98% versus 32%), passkey sign-ins are eight times faster than traditional password + MFA flows, and passwordless-preferred UX has reduced password use by over 20%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nikkei rolled out passkeys in February and is already seeing thousands of customers using passkeys. Additionally, they are seeing almost no inquiries about how to use passkeys at the support desk.</p>



<p>NTT DOCOMO has increased its passkey enrollments and now passkeys are used for more than 50% of authentication by d ACCOUNT users. NTT DOCOMO notably reports significant decreases in successful phishing attempts and there have been no unrecognized payments at the docomo Online Shop since September 2022 where NTT DOCOMO continuously improved UX, including increasing the number of other passkey-enabled services.</p>



<p>Samsung Electronics’ Galaxy smartphones support fast and convenient logins through biometric authentication and FIDO protocols. Due to ease of use, speed, compatibility across services, and status as an industry standard made passkeys a compelling choice for Samsung Electronics.</p>



<p>VicRoads is the vehicle registration and driver licensing authority in Victoria, Australia. It registers over six million vehicles annually and licenses more than five million drivers. Within the first weeks of deployment with its passkey vendor Corbado, passkey adoption significantly exceeded VicRoads’ expectations. Users embraced the phishing-resistant authentication method, benefiting from a frictionless login experience optimized for speed and security. The exceptionally high passkey activation rate – peaking at 80% on mobile devices and over 50% across all platforms – led to 30% passkey login rate within the first seven weeks. Uptake continues to rise steadily, translating into measurable operational benefits, including reduced authentication-related support tickets, lower SMS OTP costs and improved user experience and security.</p>



<p>Zoho Corporation has rolled out passkeys to its 100+ million zoho.com customers and has seen a resulting 30% increase month over month in passkey adoption and a 10% drop in password reset queries. As a next step, the company will begin its rollout to Zoho Vault customers in May.</p>

<p>New global survey: More than two thirds of users familiar with passkeys turn to them for simpler, safer sign-ins as password pain persists</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., May 1, 2025 – With digital security more critical than ever, the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> is commemorating World Passkey Day 2025 with the release of an independent study of consumers across the U.S., U.K., China, South Korea, and Japan to understand how passkey usage and consumer attitudes towards authentication have evolved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research found that in the last year, over 35% of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities. In addition, 47% of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account. This is significant for passkey adoption, as 54% of people familiar with passkeys consider them to be more convenient than passwords, and 53% believe they offer greater security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>World Passkey Day serves as the FIDO Alliance’s annual call to action for individuals and organizations to adopt passkey sign-ins, making the web safer and more accessible.</p>



<p>Highlights from the research show consumer passkey awareness is on the rise and outlines several key trends in adoption among those who are aware of passkeys, including:</p>



 
 74% of consumers are aware of passkeys. 



 69% of consumers have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts. 



 Among those who have used passkeys, 38% report enabling them whenever possible. 



 More than half of consumers believe passkeys are both more secure (53%) and more convenient (54%) than passwords.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>The survey report is available at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wpd-report-2025-consumer-password-passkey-trends/">https://fidoalliance.org/wpd-report-2025-consumer-password-passkey-trends/</a>, which includes additional insights on how passkey adoption is trending with consumers and organizations to improve global digital access, authentication, and security.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The establishment and growth of World Passkey Day reflects the fact that organizations of all shapes and sizes are taking action upon the imperative to move away from relying on passwords and other legacy authentication methods that have led to decades of data breaches, account takeovers and user frustration, which imperil the very foundations of our connected society,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewshikiar/">Andrew Shikiar</a>, Executive Director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance. “We’re thrilled by the fact that over 100 organizations around the world signed our Passkey Pledge, and we are pleased to support the market in their march towards passkeys through a variety of freely available assets, including our market-leading Passkey Central resource center.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To further encourage organizations to embrace the shift away toward passkeys, the FIDO Alliance also launched the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge">Passkey Pledge</a>, a voluntary pledge for online service providers and authentication product and service vendors committed to embracing passkeys. The passkey pledge has received commitments from over 100 organizations in just over 20 days. A full list of companies that have taken the passkey pledge can be <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/#fill-out-the-form">found here</a>.</p>



<p>The availability of passkeys has steadily increased with implementation reaching 48% of the world’s top 100 websites as enterprises and service providers collectively seek to embrace a new era of faster sign-ins, higher success rates, fewer account takeovers, lower support costs, and reduced cart abandonment.</p>

 Notes to editors: 



 
 This SurveyMonkey online poll was conducted from April 13-14, 2025, among a global sample of 1,389 adults ages 18 and up. Respondents for this survey were selected from the nearly 3 million people who take surveys on the SurveyMonkey platform each day. Data for this survey has been weighted for age, race, sex, education, and geography to adequately reflect the demographic composition of the United States, United Kingdom, China, South Korea and Japan. The modeled error estimate for this survey is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. 



 To calculate the proportion of the world’s top websites and services that support passkeys, the FIDO Alliance combined publicly available information with its own data on passkey deployments.&nbsp; 
 



 About the FIDO Alliance 



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.

<p>Passkeys are no longer just a concept: The future of sign-in is here and consumers are ready. Built on the open authentication standards developed by theFIDO Alliance, passkeys are quickly gaining momentum among global service providers. Why? Because they offer africtionless, phishing-resistant, passwordless sign-in experience that is redefining digital security and user convenience. </p>



<p>Ahead of World Passkey Day 2025, the FIDO Alliance commissioned an independent survey of1,389 peopleacross theU.S., U.K., China, South Korea, and Japan to provide additional insights into how authentication preferences are evolving in real time. </p>

<p>The December 2024 Gartner IAM CAEP Interop event in Dallas was a huge success with numerous companies showcasing their adoption, continued investment and interest in the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">Shared Signals Framework.</a> That said, it is time to release this series of blog posts diving deeper into Shared Signals and its applicability in the greater Identity and Access Management (IAM) context, especially now we have just completed our third Shared Signals interop event at <a href="https://openid.net/shared-signal-wg-returns-to-gartner-iam-for-interoperability/">Gartner IAM London</a>. This is the first of four posts that expands on Shared Signals, where we are now and our vision for what Shared Signals can deliver. This first blog post will cover the security aspects and advantages of Shared Signals highlighting two event types in real world use cases. The second post will touch on provisioning and the crossover with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scim/about/">System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)</a> events covering real world usage. The third post will provide a cross section of Shared Signals as it applies to both continuous identity and modern IAM along with where Shared Signals will take the industry. Lastly, we will talk about Shared Signals strategically, as a central nervous system for identity and open data systems.</p>
 And here…we…go…&nbsp; 
<p>It seems as though every week there are security headlines involving data breaches, hackers gaining access to systems, state-sponsored attacks, insider threats, lack of multifactor authentication (MFA) and so on. Security is top of mind these days and companies are chasing the elusive goal of Zero Trust. They are challenged or blocked by a myriad of complexities, vendor based/solution specific API’s and/or lack of communication between security vendors/products. The lack of preventative measures like MFA combined with an insider threat is compounded by the lack of a communication fabric when those threats are exploited. It always comes back to “needing a way to talk to each other”. Enter Shared Signals Framework (SSF).</p>
 What are Shared Signals? 
<p>At a high level, shared signals refer to services and security platforms that can seamlessly and securely share information about threats and events, empowering a more coordinated and proactive response. There are many real world comparisons to shared signals such as <a href="https://amberalert.ojp.gov">amber alerts, wireless emergency alerts</a>, neighbors sharing screenshots or videos of suspicious activity, and city or municipal emergency response systems (police, fire and other systems), just to name a few. The key insight is to get the right type of real time alert into the hands of the right target population so that those individuals or systems can take remediating steps immediately. In the digital domain, these alerts start with risk signals associated with accounts and sessions.</p>
 Best Practices 
<p>“With great power comes great responsibility”. This is a great quote and resonates well with the topic of best practices to fully utilize shared signals. There are varying points of view to consider such as business, contractual, privacy, legal, compliance, operational and technical. Having a 360 degree view about the consumption and use of these signals is important to not overlook. Here are a few examples covering some of the viewpoints above.</p>
 Compliance 
<p>Shared signals are your best friend here and an enabler for a lot of compliance aspects. Here are some questions it can help address. When was a configuration updated and by whom? When a user or employee was left or was off boarded from the company can you prove that their accounts, access and session were disabled or revoked in a timely manner? When a sensitive or privileged application was accessed can you demonstrate that the proper authentication occurred per policy (e.g. MFA or non-phishable factors like WebAuthN or Passkeys)? Addressing the above questions using open and interoperable standards is a best practice and a way to address compliance complexity. Lastly, a different aspect of compliance with shared signals can be viewed as ensuring the right events were sent to the appropriate systems or receivers with the appropriate data and agreed upon contract. Ensuring this is important to not have data leakage or distributing excessive data to systems or receivers.</p>
 Legal / Privacy 
<p>While not exhaustive here, the considerations cover both intra-business use of shared signals and business to business (B2B) scenarios. Shared signals is and can be viewed as a trust framework for data and event sharing. That said, it is important to adhere to minimalistic data principles. For example, ensure subject information in the event is just enough to help the receiver or system make a decision and/or take action. A great example of minimalism, and a best practice, is using a non-identifiable identifier, such as a globally unique identifier (GUID) instead of email, username or other personally identifiable information (PII) where a user is the subject of the event. Situations may arise that call for the inclusion of attributes that are identifiable and this is where consulting with legal is a good practice to follow. When integrating with an external company, in a B2B scenario, it is best practice to consult with legal and privacy teams from both companies. When exchanging data between companies it is best practice to obfuscate identifiers and keep it scoped to the relationship between company a and company b. A great example is to use <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/pairwise_pseudonymous_identifier">pairwise pseudonymous identifiers</a> (PPIDS) during the event exchange, when the user is the subject of the event.</p>
 Use Cases and Examples 
<p>Let’s start out with some “CAEPabiliites” with continuous access evaluation: <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">CAEP</a> stands for Continuous Access Evaluation Profile, and involves real-time evaluation of user access and session management that is contextually aware as user conditions and behavior evolve. Examples of CAEP events are “session revoked,” “credential change,” “assurance level change,” or “device compliance changes.” <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-ID2.html">Click here to read more about CAEP.</a></p>
<p>If only the 80’s movie were titled “RISCy Business”…that would make this pun stick: <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">RISC</a> stands for Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination and focuses more on compromised accounts, especially when they are linked in some way to security incidents. Examples of RISC events are “account enabled,” “account disabled” or “identifier changed.” <a href="https://openid.github.io/sharedsignals/openid-risc-profile-specification-1_0.html">Click here to read more about RISC.</a></p>
 An Employee Leaves the Company 
<p>Session management still is a prevalent problem in the industry and at companies. That said, adopting Shared Signals can help to alleviate this. The classic situation is an employee who is leaving the company and actions need to be taken outside of normal HR event notifications.&nbsp; While this seems to be pretty cut and dry to a layperson, it does get complicated when you factor in session management across IAM systems, collaboration apps, and (often) multiple identity providers. Using both CAEP and RISC events here can help to address this in a standards based way that allows for coordinated response to an employee’s departure at scale across a company by using a <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-ID2.html#name-session-revoked">session revoked event</a> (CAEP) coupled with an <a href="https://openid.github.io/sharedsignals/openid-risc-profile-specification-1_0.html#name-account-disabled">account disabled event</a> (RISC). There is an added benefit here if companies also operate within one or more “federations” to one or more other companies. RISC events using the Shared Signals Framework as the communication protocol mechanism exist to facilitate this type of enhanced security collaboration between cooperating parties in a bilateral or multilateral federation, or trust framework. In this example, when the employee leaves the company, the same <a href="https://openid.github.io/sharedsignals/openid-risc-profile-specification-1_0.html#name-account-disabled">account disabled event </a>(RISC) would be sent to both the company and the other companies so that all relevant parties can perform the proper security functions at the same time, in real-time(i.e. “disable federated accounts,” “disable linked accounts,” and “remove access”). It is also important to note in the picture below that these events should be logged to the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for all parties participating in the coordinated response, as indicated by the green circle and checkbox.</p>
<p></p>
 Suspicious Activity on User Accounts 
<p>This use case is an interesting one and very context based, and in some cases subjective. To highlight how you could use Shared Signals for this we are going to break this down into 2 potential options. Before we get into that it is important to talk about subjects within Shared Signals. Subjects are important as they are the primary focus of security events within the Shared Signals Framework, which consist of users, devices, or groups of users, to name a few. To learn more about subjects <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-ID3.html#name-complex-subject-members">click here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Progressive Approach 
<p>There will need to be some assumptions made here before we dive into the Shared Signals part.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assumption 1: The SIEM or Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) platforms can classify behavior at the device level and associate that to a user. Assumption 2: Sessions are tracked and managed by either the Identity Provider or select high impact or sensitive systems in the organization.</p>
<p>Given the assumptions above, an organization’s security posture can be hardened while not impacting the end user’s experience, using the Shared Signals Framework. Crazy right? How can this be so? Here is the situation at hand. There appears to be suspicious activity originating from rogue IP addresses or new devices that have not been classified as normal or having been used by the user previously. We now have a different context level to target for revocation…device. <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-ID2.html#name-session-revoked">Session revoke events</a> (CAEP) can be emitted from the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-ID3.html#name-transmitter-configuration-d">Shared Signals Transmitter</a> with different subjects to selected receivers. In one of the session revoke events, the subject will be the IP Addresses or CIDR range, in the other it will be the rogue device identifier. This will allow an organization to target the suspicious entities, by IP addresses and rogue devices, without impacting an end user’s experience. These session revoke events would then be sent to the Identity Provider and high impact systems that have configured a stream setup with the transmitter. This is part of what is meant by a progressive approach, as time passes we have more context to draw from…sharing signals. So, time has passed when either the IP addresses or rogue devices suddenly appear again. Now that we know we can target these attributes, we can take another “progressive” action and issue a <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-ID2.html#name-credential-change">credential change event</a> (CAEP) because it can be derived that there is an account take over (ATO) occurring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Prescriptive Approach 
<p>Nothing changes from the assumptions made in the progressive approach except how security will be actioned. The situation is the same as above: “There appears to be suspicious activity originating from rogue IP addresses or new devices that have not been classified as normal or having been used by the user previously.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that assumption, this will be more drastic and impactful for the end user, but it might be required based on your organization’s security policies. A <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-ID2.html#name-session-revoked">session revoke event</a> (CAEP), <a href="https://openid.github.io/sharedsignals/openid-risc-profile-specification-1_0.html#name-account-disabled">account disabled event </a>(RISC) and even <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-ID2.html#name-credential-change">credential change event </a>(RISC) will be emitted to the identity provider and high impact systems for this scenario to ensure the security controls are reactive based on the context of the deviations in user behavior or patterns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might be asking how would the transmitter know the action was taken by the receiving systems and performed successfully? Reconciliation or double entry bookkeeping can be accomplished just by adhering to the “sharing is caring” methodology. Receivers should be transmitters, bottom line. This is where we are going next on this post.</p>
 Chaining Together Security Events 
<p>Expanding on the examples above, where an employee leaves the company or suspicious activity is detected on a user’s accounts, we can now start discussing action verification, reconciliation, and double entry bookkeeping in regards to security events. This is where Shared Signals shines! In order to get to zero trust we have to find a common way to communicate. The picture below is a great reference to help visualize the reconciliation and chaining aspects of Shared Signals as they are very powerful and useful, as it enables scale across an organization and between organizations in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security Event #1: Acme Corp had issued an <a href="https://openid.github.io/sharedsignals/openid-risc-profile-specification-1_0.html#name-account-disabled">account disabled event</a> (RISC) to Wonka Industries, a subsidiary of Acme Corp. After Wonka Industries acknowledges the inbound <a href="https://openid.github.io/sharedsignals/openid-risc-profile-specification-1_0.html#name-account-disabled">account disabled event</a> (RISC) from ACME Corp internal policy will take action from the inbound event. Once the actions are all successfully performed, an outbound security event will be transmitted back to ACME Corp in the form of another <a href="https://openid.github.io/sharedsignals/openid-risc-profile-specification-1_0.html#name-account-disabled">account disabled event</a> (RISC). Here is where the auditing, bookkeeping, and reconciling comes into play. There was a <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-03.html#name-the-txn-claim">txn claim</a> that was originally sent over in the first account disabled event (RISC) from ACME Corp with a value, let’s say it was “a1b2c3d4e5”. Now, when Wonka Industries replies back to ACME Corp it will also include the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-03.html#name-the-txn-claim">txn claim </a>with the same value that was used in the original <a href="https://openid.github.io/sharedsignals/openid-risc-profile-specification-1_0.html#name-account-disabled">account disabled event</a> (RISC), “a1b2c3d4e5”. The simplicity of this allows for verification of the security event being actioned by all parties involved, with double entry bookkeeping for auditing purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security Event #2: Acme Corp had an <a href="https://openid.github.io/sharedsignals/openid-risc-profile-specification-1_0.html#name-account-disabled">account disabled event</a> (RISC) to Initech, a different company. You may have noticed above that the events do match between ACME Corp and Wonka Industries. This begs the question…do the events always have to match for reconciling? No. The same concepts and principles apply here, as they did in scenario 1, with a minor difference. When Initech received the inbound <a href="https://openid.github.io/sharedsignals/openid-risc-profile-specification-1_0.html#name-account-disabled">account disabled event</a> (RISC) from ACME Corp they chose to reply with a <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-ID2.html#name-session-revoked">session revoked event</a> (CAEP). Why is this? It could be numerous things: policy, their CAEPability mappings, or Initech just revoked sessions for the federated identities that were just-in-time provisioned for access from ACME Corp. That said, the same <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-03.html#name-the-txn-claim">txn claim</a> that was used, “a1b2c3d4e5”, by ACME Corp will be sent back by Initiech to essentially “close the loop”. Regardless of what policy is selected by the two connected entities or the federation of interconnected entities, all participants are following the same practice of exchanging account disabled events or session revoked events and all entities will maintain accurate data.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The future is upon us now where standards foster cooperation and a “sharing is caring” mentality, such as the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) along with event types like Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP), Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination (RISC), and soon, SCIM Events. Many relying party implementers may feel most comfortable starting as a recipient of RISC and CAEP events, but the crucial jump is actually to establish the trust required to exchange events both ways. The two-way exchange of signals is what will ultimately deliver on the long term strategy of public and private sector interconnected ecosystems, which we will get to in parts 3 and 4.</p>
<p>For now, tune in next time for part 2…”Yes, Provisioning can be easier with Shared Signals” and stay safe out there.</p>
 About the OpenID Foundation 
<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate. Find out more at<a href="http://www.openid.net/"> openid.net</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>April 29, 2025 – The FIDO Alliance has launched a Payments Working Group (PWG) to define and drive FIDO solutions for payment use cases. The PWG will also act as subject matter experts and internal advisors within the FIDO Alliance on issues affecting the use of FIDO solutions for payment use cases. The PWG is co-chaired by Henna Kapur of Visa and Jonathan Grossar of Mastercard, with other FIDO Alliance member company participants including American Express; Cartes Bancaires; Futurae; Infineon; OneSpan; PayPal; Royal Bank of Canada – Solution Acceleration &amp; Innovation; and Thales</p>



<p>The PWG will focus on three areas:</p>



 
 Identify and evaluate specific requirements for payment authentication. Requirements will include those in the area of UX, security and regulation unique to payments;. 



 Identify and evaluate existing and emerging solutions to address payment authentication requirements; and 



 Guidelines for use of passkeys and/or proposed FIDO solutions along with existing payment technologies such as EMV® 3-D Secure or EMV® EMVCo SRC. 
 



<p>The PWG will also work on associated projects relating to the use of FIDO solutions for payments including: collecting and publishing deployment case studies, documenting challenges and potential solutions to issues; and working with FIDO Alliance liaison partners to drive education and adoption.</p>



<p>Join the Payments Working Group</p>



<p>Organizations interested in taking part in the PWG and driving the adoption of passkeys for payments can inquire today. Participation in the PWG is open to all Board, Sponsor, and Government level members of the FIDO Alliance. Non-member organizations interested in participating should contact the FIDO Alliance to become a member; learn more by visiting <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/become-a-member/">https://fidoalliance.org/members/become-a-member/</a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Christopher Allen recently talked with Tereza Bízková in an interview that was published to the front page of Hackernoon. It was headlined <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-co-writer-of-tls-says-weve-lost-the-privacy-plot">“The Co-Writer of TLS Says We’ve Lost the Privacy Plot”</a>. In it, Christopher talks about what privacy means to him, what he thinks about recent privacy efforts, how centralization has become a problem, and how all of this connects to work done by the cypherpunks in the ’90s.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, Christopher answers the question: what would be non-negotiable for a new privacy-first system today? His answer unsurprisingly reflects our vision here at Blockchain Commons, built on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">data minimization</a>, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-progressive-trust/">progressive trust</a>, and limited scale.</p>

<p>Privacy is one of the fundamental <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian Principles</a>, but probably the one we talk about the least, as so much of our focus is on resilience (such as <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a>) or on independence and openness (as reflected in our attention to <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-interop/">interoperability</a>). Read <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-co-writer-of-tls-says-weve-lost-the-privacy-plot">“The Co-Writer of TLS Says We’ve Lost the Privacy Plot”</a> for much more on why privacy is important and what exactly it is!</p>

<p>In a world where digital transactions and online services touch almost every facet of daily life, having a secure, privacy-preserving identity you can carry anywhere is no longer a luxury. It’s a necessity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday, May 5th, 2025 (4:30-6:00pm CET / 10:30am-12:00pm ET / 7:30-9:00am PT), the OpenID Foundation is bringing together governments, standards bodies, technology vendors, end-user organizations and technical experts who are committed to building scalable and interoperable protocols that are robust, secure, and reliable, for<a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/oidf-webinar-mon-5-may-2025-berlin-tickets-1311865939339?aff=oddtdtcreator"> a demonstration</a> that proves this vision is ready for prime time.</p>
 Why this matters 
<p>As more organizations prepare to issue and verify digital credentials at scale, the single biggest barrier to seamless user experiences is interoperability – getting disparate systems to ‘speak the same language.’ Our upcoming showcase unites three cutting-edge specifications – the<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html"> OpenID Verifiable Presentation</a> (OID4VP),<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-sd-jwt-vc-1_0-00.html#:~:text=This%20document%20defines%20a%20set%20of%20requirements%20for,high%20level%20of%20security%20and%20privacy%20is%20required."> the High Assurance Interoperability Protocol</a><a href="https://github.com/w3c-fedid/digital-credentials"> (HAIP) and the Digital Credentials API</a> (DC API). They will run end-to-end across multiple wallets and verifier platforms. This isn’t a slide deck. It’s a real-world demonstration of cross-platform credential exchange, privacy-first architecture, and enterprise-grade security.</p>
<p>Gail Hodges, Executive Director of the OpenID Foundation, said: “The tools at the heart of this interoperability demonstration are built with security and privacy in mind, protecting users’ personal information while simplifying the process of proving identity online, cross platforms and cross device. Beyond the technical safeguards, these advances stand to benefit millions, if not billions, of people as more and more jurisdictions and institutions issue credentials and they become widely accepted”.</p>
<p>Joseph Heenan, Co-Chair of the Digital Credentials Protocols Working Group, said “Our demonstration not only proves the interoperability of our evolving standards, but also reinforces our commitment to empowering billions worldwide with secure, seamless, and privacy-preserving digital identity solutions. With these standards moving swiftly toward finalization and implementation readiness, we call on all stakeholders to join us on this journey toward a secure, interoperable, and user-centric digital future.”</p>
 What you’ll see 
 
 Interoperability demonstrations of OpenID for Verifiable Presentations and the W3C Digital Credentials API working seamlessly across multiple wallets and verifier platforms using several DCQL queries. 
 Two initial credential types, both ISO mDocs and Selective Disclosure JWTs (SD-JWTs). 
 High Assurance Interoperability Profile, which delivers interoperability and security by default. 
 Insights on how implementers can adopt these standards today, such building against the freely available<a href="https://openid.net/certification/conformance-testing-for-openid-for-verifiable-presentations/"> open source test suite available from the OpenID foundation</a>. 
 
 Who should attend 
<p>This event is designed for anyone working at the intersection of identity, security, and user experience:</p>
 
 Implementers of digital identity services such as digital identity credential issuers, digital wallet providers, or relying party verifiers in all sectors (financial services, retail, healthcare, and others).

<p>Describe your service/platform/product and how it’s using FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>Microsoft Account (MSA) powers consumer-facing experiences across services like Xbox, Microsoft 365, Copilot, and more. In 2023, Microsoft began rolling out passkey support across these services, allowing users to sign in with a face, fingerprint, or device PIN instead of a password. By integrating FIDO credentials, we made it easier, faster, and significantly more secure for over a billion users accessing their Microsoft accounts, by removing the need for passwords.</p>



<p>What were the challenges you were trying to overcome?</p>



<p>We set out to solve three major challenges:</p>



<p>Security: Passwords are inherently insecure and highly vulnerable to phishing and brute force attacks. In 2024, we observed more than 7,000 password attacks per second.</p>



<p>User experience: Passwords are frustrating—users forget them, reuse them, or mistype them. We wanted a sign-in experience that users could succeed at the first time, every time.</p>



<p>Adoption at scale: We needed a solution that could work across devices and platforms while meeting high usability expectations for a global user base.</p>



<p>Why did you choose FIDO authentication over other options? What did you identify as advantages of implementing FIDO?</p>



<p>FIDO credentials offer the ideal combination of security, usability, and interoperability. They are resistant to phishing and credential theft, and they eliminate the need for shared secrets like passwords. FIDO credentials also enable seamless cross-device and cross-platform experiences—critical for consumer use cases. In testing, we found that passkeys delivered both improved security and a dramatically better user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Describe your roll out of FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>Microsoft took a phased approach. We started by enabling passkeys for MSA sign-ins across consumer services like Xbox and Copilot. From there, we made UX changes to prioritize passwordless options. New Microsoft Accounts are now passwordless by default, and existing users are guided to enroll a passkey during or after sign-in. Throughout this process, we have worked closely with platform partners like Apple and Google, and continued our long-standing collaboration with the FIDO Alliance to ensure our approach aligns with industry standards. For a more detailed look at our approach, refer to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/12/12/convincing-a-billion-users-to-love-passkeys-ux-design-insights-from-microsoft-to-boost-adoption-and-security/">Convincing a billion users to love passkeys: UX design insights from Microsoft to boost adoption and security</a>.</p>



<p>What data points can you share that show the impact FIDO authentication has had?</p>



<p>The impact has been significant:</p>



 
 We now see over one million passkeys registered every day. 



 Users signing in with passkeys are three times more successful (95% success rate vs. 30% for passwords). 



 Passkey sign-ins are eight times faster than traditional password + MFA flows. 



 Our passwordless-preferred UX has already reduced password use by over 20%. 
 



<p>These results confirm that FIDO authentication improves security, boosts user satisfaction, and reduces operational burdens like password resets and support calls.</p>

<p>Describe your service/platform/product and how it’s using FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>Nikkei Inc. and the Nikkei Group pursues its mission “to be the most trusted, independent provider of quality journalism to a global community, helping our customers make better decisions.” We offer various media services, including the Nikkei, which serves as the cornerstone of our role as a news organization. The integrated ID platform supporting the Nikkei Group’s digital services, including our core service, the Nikkei Online Edition, is “Nikkei ID.”</p>



<p><br>Nikkei ID, which offers a wide range of services, has long faced the challenge of balancing security and usability. While we have implemented measures such as improving the login experience with OpenID Connect and introducing two-factor authentication and CAPTCHA (*1) to reduce the risk of unauthorized access, addressing security risks associated with password leaks and reuse, as well as countering increasingly sophisticated attacks, has been difficult.</p>



<p>(*1)A security authentication method to verify that a user is human.</p>



<p>In this context, as FIDO authentication has evolved and the threshold for introducing passkeys to services has lowered, Nikkei ID has proceeded with consideration and implementation with high expectations. Currently, we are expanding functionality to support not only web services but also mobile apps, and aiming to promote the adoption of passkeys through increased user awareness via internal and external blog posts, presentations, and guidance at the Nikkei ID Lounge Help Center.<br><br>What were the challenges you were trying to overcome?</p>



<p>The primary goal is to balance security and user experience. Many Nikkei ID users are not accustomed to digital services, so simply enhancing security is not enough. For example, while the introduction of CAPTCHA can prevent brute-force password attacks, it can also become a barrier for users who cannot pass the Turing test (*2), leading to increased support inquiries and added burden on customer service.</p>



<p>(*2) A test to determine whether something is ‘human-like’.</p>



<p>However, FIDO authentication (passkeys) achieves high security and user experience through integration with OS and platforms as a standard. This allows us to replace security measures that reduce risks associated with password authentication but negatively impact UX with passkeys.<br><br>Why did you choose FIDO authentication over other options? What did you identify as advantages of implementing FIDO?</p>



<p>The following two options were considered as alternatives to FIDO authentication (passkeys):</p>



 
 Mandatory implementation of two-factor authentication such as TOTP or email verification 



 Social login using other ID platforms 
 



<p>As a result of comparing these options, we believe FIDO authentication (passkeys) offers the following advantages:</p>



 
 It allows for gradual transition by adding authentication on top of existing password authentication&nbsp; 



 It enables the use of higher UX authentication methods such as biometric authentication&nbsp; 



 It fundamentally resolves the risks associated with passwords 
 



<p>When it came to actual implementation, the aspect of “additional authentication” was particularly significant. In other words, it allows for implementation in a loosely coupled and highly cohesive manner without disrupting the existing ID model. The WebAuthn specification provides simple interface libraries and APIs for both backend and frontend on each platform, making secure implementation easy. Additionally, since existing authentication methods can be retained, the advantage of not significantly increasing support workload was also substantial.</p>



<p>Describe your roll out of FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>We implemented our own solution using the open-source backend library WebAuthn4J for FIDO authentication. We chose WebAuthn4J not only for its clear data model but also because it passed the FIDO2 Test Tools provided by the FIDO Alliance. For the frontend, we developed our own implementation that directly interacts with the WebAuthn API. Additionally, we created a test library to emulate FIDO authentication, enabling 24-hour automated testing as a comprehensive test of these implementations.</p>



<p>The rollout of FIDO authentication (passkeys) was carried out in the following steps:</p>



 
 Internal beta testing to gather feedback and monitor usage 



 White-box and black-box testing by external security companies 



 Public release to all users 
 



<p>What data points can you share that show the impact FIDO authentication has had?</p>



<p>Since it was just released in February this year, we cannot provide detailed numbers yet, but thousands of users are already using passkeys. Additionally, we have heard that there have been almost no inquiries about how to use passkeys at the support desk, and we recognize that passkeys are being used smoothly.</p>



<p>Resources</p>



<p>The test library that emulates FIDO authentication, mentioned in the implementation section, is publicly available as Nikkei’s open-source software. You can obtain it from the following <a href="https://github.com/Nikkei/nid-webauthn-emulator">https://github.com/Nikkei/nid-webauthn-emulator</a></p>



<p>For authorization after completing FIDO authentication (passkeys), we use Authlete, an OpenID Connect platform. In this case study, we express our enthusiasm for the introduction of FIDO authentication (passkeys).

 VicRoads achieves up to 80% industry-leading passkey activation rate for nearly 5 million users with Corbado 



<p>Background: VicRoads</p>



<p>VicRoads is the vehicle registration and driver licensing authority in Victoria, Australia. It registers over six million vehicles annually and licenses more than five million drivers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operating as a joint venture between the Victorian State Government, Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust, and Macquarie Asset Management, VicRoads is a critical provider of public services in the state.</p>



<p>Challenge: seamless and cost-effective authentication for government services&nbsp;</p>



<p>VicRoads aims to become Australia’s most trusted digital government service providers by delivering secure, frictionless services to millions of people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the importance of the data that VicRoads holds on behalf of its customers, security has always been a primary consideration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the past, to support protection of customer data, VicRoads mandated multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts via SMS one-time passwords (OTPs) and authenticator apps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys leverage biometrics, facial recognition, a PIN or a swipe pattern in the sign-in process. Unlike traditional MFA, passkeys require both the device storing the private key and local authentication, meaning they are both phishing-resistant and cost-effective.</p>



<p>Solution: Corbado provides a no-risk, passkey-first solution with minimal integration effort</p>



<p>&nbsp;VicRoads worked with passkey vendor Corbado, prioritizing a proven approach rather than building a solution from scratch.</p>



<p>Corbado’s deep understanding of both customer experience and the latest authentication technology gave VicRoads confidence that customers would find using passkeys easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corbado also provided in-depth technical guidance on passkey-specific challenges, including browser compatibility, recovery flows and user experience optimizations – further solidifying VicRoads’ confidence.</p>



 



<blockquote>
<p>“We selected Corbado because it could integrate passkey functionality into our existing infrastructure without disruption to our customers and operations”, said Crispin Blackall, Chief Technology Officer, VicRoads.</p>
</blockquote>



 



<p>Implementation: pre-built, passkey-optimized components &amp; SDKs enable quick integration</p>



<p>Corbado Connect seamlessly integrated with VicRoads’ existing infrastructure and CIAM, which is deeply embedded within the organization’s enterprise stack. This passkey enablement was achieved without requiring a migration of user data or authentication methods, ensuring a smooth and efficient transition for millions of users.</p>



<p>By layering passkey functionality on top of VicRoads’ current authentication system, Corbado enabled a frictionless deployment while preserving all existing user credentials. This approach eliminated the disruption and risks often associated with introducing new technology.</p>



<p>To ensure a smooth transition, VicRoads implemented passkeys in a phased rollout, beginning with personal customers. This gradual deployment, supported by Corbado Connect’s rollout controls, enabled VicRoads to monitor performance, address potential issues and optimize the user experience before seamlessly extending passkey authentication to partner and business customers.</p>



<p>Results: customers love passkeys, with up to 80% passkey activation rate in the first weeks</p>



<p>Within the first weeks of deployment, passkey adoption significantly exceeded VicRoads’ expectations. Users embraced the phishing-resistant authentication method, benefiting from a frictionless login experience optimized for speed and security.</p>



<p>The exceptionally high passkey activation rate – peaking at 80% on mobile devices and over 50% across all platforms – led to 30% passkey login rate within the first seven weeks. Uptake continues to rise steadily, translating into measurable operational benefits, including:</p>



 
 Reduced authentication-related support tickets 



 Lower SMS OTP costs 



 Improved user experience and security. 
 



<p>So far, VicRoads has successfully rolled out passkeys on its web portal. The next step is to integrate passkeys into its native apps – myVicRoads and myLearners – allowing users to leverage their existing passkeys without additional setup. Ultimately, once passkeys are fully implemented across all digital platforms, VicRoads aims to eliminate passwords entirely, maximizing security and fully embracing a passwordless future.</p>



 



<blockquote>
<p>“Passkeys are easy to use, without compromising on security. We’re excited to give our customers a simpler, more secure way to handle their registration and licensing services,” said Crispin Blackall, Chief Technology Officer, VicRoads.</p>
</blockquote>



 



<p>Opportunity: setting a new standard for government authentication&nbsp;</p>



<p>With one of the largest public sector passkey deployments globally, VicRoads has established itself as a digital leader in authentication modernization for government applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Achieving high adoption rates without disruption, VicRoads has proven that large-scale organisations can enhance security and improve user experience simultaneously. This success positions VicRoads as a benchmark for other government agencies looking to modernize their authentication strategies.</p>



 



<blockquote>
<p>“Passkeys represent a paradigm shift in how we authenticate users to digital identity services,” said Andrew Shikiar, Chief Executive Officer of the FIDO Alliance. “VicRoads’ adoption of passkeys showcases how government agencies can leverage this industry-wide innovation to protect people’s data while simplifying access to critical services. This is a significant step towards a more secure and efficient digital future for Victoria and beyond.”</p>
</blockquote>



 



<p>Next Steps: developing next generation authentication</p>



<p>VicRoads’ ongoing partnership with Corbado ensures it remains at the forefront of authentication innovation while maintaining a seamless user experience for its expanding digital service base. A key advantage of Corbado’s managed passkey service is its built-in adoption-enhancing optimisations, ensuring continuous improvements and seamless WebAuthn conformity with all future WebAuthn updates.</p>



<p>With this initiative, VicRoads has paved the way for broader adoption of passkeys in the government and public sector, proving that secure, frictionless authentication at scale is achievable.</p>

<p>What were the challenges you were trying to overcome?</p>



<p>On one hand, there’s the security challenge. The rise of phishing through calls and SMS messages in Spain has become a plague and a real problem for administrations, mobile operators, and financial institutions but on the other hand, there was the need to maintain the best user experience with the least friction. Passkeys give us a framework for interoperability and standardization, which provides us with ease of implementation and deployment. However, above all, and for the first time in the security industry, it provides a framework of homogeneity to achieve a frictionless user experience.</p>



<p>Why did you choose FIDO authentication over other options? What did you identify as advantages of implementing FIDO?</p>



<p>We chose FIDO for many reasons: for its future strategy, as it allows us to follow many ways, including MFA and passwordless, for trust, as the FIDO Alliance includes leading players in security, operating systems, infrastructure, and mobile ecosystem; and for the standardization and homogenization what it give us, which reduces implementation, deployment and roll out times.</p>



<p>Describe your roll out of FIDO authentication.</p>



<p>To deliver the best user experience, we’re committed to having the deepest possible understanding of the technology. This enables us to effectively identify and resolve issues, and to better understand user behavior. We became our own partner by developing our own platform based on the FIDO standard and certifying it as if it were a provider.</p>



<p>We rolled out the deployment in phases. In under five months, we had the development of both server and&nbsp; front-end (iOS and Android) ready, and we began the rollout in an initial phase with our employees, and subsequently to end customers in batches. In just seven months, we were already in a general roll out to all customers.</p>



<p>What data points can you share that show the impact FIDO authentication has had?</p>



 
 More than 42% of our customers are already using ABANCA Key 



 More than 11,000,000 high-risk transactions has been protected with ABANCA Key without technical or service incidents&nbsp; 



 Customer roll out ran without technical or service incidents, and most importantly, with our customer journey UX to sign in ABANCA Key and to use it, we’ve managed a Customer Effort Score (CES) of 4.7.&nbsp;

<p>Somewhere, in his daily online journey, he was prompted by a website or application — a “relying party” in authentication lingo — to create a passkey. But the benefit wasn’t clear to him. Nor did there seem to be any urgency. He figured I’d know&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-are-passkeys-how-going-passwordless-can-simplify-your-life-in-2025/">what passkeys are</a>&nbsp;and what to do the next time he gets a nudge to set one up.

<p>Your phone, computer and tablet is now at risk, as the nightmare of AI-powered attacks comes true. There are now multiple warnings into the use of mainstream AI platforms to design, develop and even execute attacks that are almost impossible to detect.</p>



<p>To add to recent reports from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/ai-agent-attacks">Symantec</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://cofense.com/blog/microsoft-copilot-spoofing-a-new-phishing-vector">Cofense</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://labs.guard.io/vibescamming-from-prompt-to-phish-benchmarking-popular-ai-agents-resistance-to-the-dark-side-1ec2fbdf0a35">Guardio</a>&nbsp;also now warns that “with the rise of Generative AI, even total beginners can now launch sophisticated phishing scams — no coding skills needed. Just a few prompts and a few minutes.”</p>



<p>And&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/16/cyber-signals-issue-9-ai-powered-deception-emerging-fraud-threats-and-countermeasures/">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;has just told users the same. “AI has started to lower the technical bar for fraud and cybercrime actors looking for their own productivity tools, making it easier and cheaper to generate believable content for cyberattacks at an increasingly rapid rate… AI-powered fraud attacks are happening globally.”</p>

 Ecosystem-Orchestrator für die Deutsche EUDI-Wallet 



<p>Die Einführung der EUDI-Wallet in Deutschland, basierend auf der novellierten eIDAS-Verordnung, stellt eine zentrale Herausforderung dar, um bis 2026 eine sichere, digitale Identitätslösung für Bürger bereitzustellen. Ziel ist es, ein umfassendes Ökosystem zu schaffen, das öffentliche Institutionen, privatwirtschaftliche Akteure und Regulierungsbehörden integriert. Dieses Ökosystem soll nicht nur technische Standards und Prozesse etablieren, sondern auch die Akzeptanz der Bürger fördern und die rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen gewährleisten.</p>



<p>Die Autoren dieses Whitepapers schlagen eine Public-Private-Partnerschaft in Form einer Genossenschaft als neutralen Ecosystem-Orchestrator vor. Diese Genossenschaft soll:</p>



 
 Demokratische Governance&nbsp;bieten, mit transparenter Kontrolle und Einflussmöglichkeiten für alle Mitglieder. 



 Kostendeckendes Finanzierungsmodell&nbsp;durch Mitgliedsbeiträge und Sonderzuwendungen implementieren. 



 Zentrale Aufgaben&nbsp;wie Zertifizierung von Wallets, Registrierung von Verifizierungsstellen und Förderung der Kommunikation zwischen Akteuren übernehmen. 
 



 Herausforderungen für die neue Bundesregierung 



<p>Die Bundesregierung ist durch die Verordnung [(EU) 2024/1183] dazu verpflichtet, bis Ende 2026 eine EUDI-Wallet für alle Bürger bereitzustellen, in der Ausweisdaten in elektronischer Form sicher gespeichert werden können. Die vollständige Umsetzung des EUDI-Wallet Ökosystem hat bis 2027 zu erfolgen. Das Bundesinnenministerium bereitet seit Mai 2023 die Konzeptionierung und Umsetzung der deutschen Wallet-Lösung federführend vor. Um die Akzeptanz bei den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern zu fördern, ist es nicht nur erforderlich, die technische Infrastruktur bereitzustellen, sondern auch ein umfassendes Ökosystem aufzubauen. In diesem Ökosystem interagieren privatwirtschaftliche Akzeptanzstellen, zertifizierte Vertrauensdienste, öffentliche Einrichtungen aus Bund und Ländern sowie Regulierungsbehörden und Zertifizierungsstellen miteinander. Der Aufbau eines solchen Ökosystems stellt eine hochkomplexe Aufgabe dar. Sie erfordert die Etablierung von Standards und Prozessen, die von allen beteiligten Privatunternehmen und öffentlichen Institutionen geteilt und umgesetzt werden können. Dabei steht die Berücksichtigung der Interessen der Bürgerinnen und Bürger im Vordergrund. Zudem müssen alle rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen eingehalten, die missbräuchliche Nutzung persönlicher Daten verhindert und ein attraktives Investitionsumfeld für die Unternehmen der Privatwirtschaft geschaffen werden.</p>



 Aufbau des EUDI-Wallet Ökosystems als Public-Private Partnership mit neutraler Governance 



<p>Die Autoren dieses Whitepapers plädieren für eine Public-Private-Partnerschaft als Ecosystem Orchestrator, die sich in einer Genossenschaft organisiert. Die Genossenschaft hat den Zweck, die Interessen aller Genossenschaftsmitglieder – also aller Akteure im EUDI-Wallet Ökosystem – gleichermaßen zu fördern. Die Genossenschaft benötigt eine demokratische Governance, die Einfluss, Kontrolle und Transparenz ggü. den Mitgliedern ermöglicht. Sofern die Genossenschaft selbst keine Investitionen tätigt, sollte ihre Satzung eine not-for-profit Klausel beinhalten, sodass lediglich die Kosten gedeckt werden müssen, die sich am Bedarf der Mitglieder orientieren.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Genossenschaft sollte durch die nachstehenden Organe gesteuert werden.</p>



 
 Generalversammlung: Bildet das höchste Entscheidungsgremium der Genossenschaft. Jedes Mitglied erhält ein Stimmrecht. Die Summe der Stimmen von Nicht-Europäischen bzw. investierenden Mitgliedern darf 25% nicht überschreiten. 



 Vorstand: Führt das Tagesgeschäft und übernimmt die Verantwortung für die Umsetzung der Governance und der Strategie. 



 Aufsichtsrat: Bildet das Kontrollorgan des Vorstands. 



 Ecosystem Coach: Stabstelle als Mediator zwischen den Akteuren zur Offenlegung und Management von Interessenskonflikten. 
 



<p>Öffentliche Institutionen sollten die Genossenschaft gründen, ein Regelwerk in Form einer Satzung definieren und den Beitritt von Akteuren der Privatwirtschaft ermöglichen. Es sind dabei sämtliche Akteure der Rollen aus der eIDAS-Novelle wie bspw. PID-Provider, Pub-EAA-Provider, (Qualified) Trust Service Provider, Wallet Provider und Trust List Provider einzubinden.</p>



<p>Finanzierungskonzept: DieFinanzierung der Betriebskosten erfolgt durch Mitgliedsbeiträge. Werden temporärMittel für bestimmte Zwecke benötigt, kann eine Finanzierung in Form von Sonderzuwendungen der Mitglieder erfolgen.</p>



<p>Aufgaben: Interessen der Mitglieder fördern, Kommunikation zwischen den Mitgliedern erleichtern, Wallets zertifizieren, Verifizierungsstellen registrieren, rechtliche Fragestellungen klären, öffentliche Kommunikation bündeln, Durchdringung der EUDI-Wallet messbar machen, Schnittstellen bereitstellen, etc.</p>



<p>Opt-Out: Die Mitgliedschaft kann ordentlich gekündigt werden. Erkenntnisse aus einer Risikoanalyse zu Opt-Out Szenarien sollten bei der Erstellung der Satzung berücksichtigt werden.</p>



 Fazit 



<p>Um das Ökosystem für die deutsche EUDI-Wallet aufzubauen ist ein neutraler Ecosystem-Orchestrator erforderlich, der gemeinsam mit öffentlichen und privatwirtschaftlichen Organisationen ein Ökosystem für die deutsche EUDI-Wallet aufbaut. Dies kann, wie vorliegend aufgezeigt, durch eine Genossenschaft abgebildet werden, in der alle Akteure des Ökosystems kartellrechtskonform und strukturiert kooperieren.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, a dedicated research team from IDunion has been working intensively on the Digital Product Passport (DPP). &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the last two years, our focus shifted from theory ( a joint publication with key partners [→ read the paper <a href="https://idunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2023-03-27_IDunion-AP-10.5_Whitepaper_V1.01_final.pdf">here</a>]) to hands-on implementation resulting in a Demo – &nbsp;DPP solution that is:</p>



 
 Data Carrier Agnostic: The product link can be embedded into any data carrier listet in <a href="https://standict.eu/landscape-analysis-report/landscape-digital-product-passport-standards">Landscape of Digital Product Passport Standards | StandICT.eu 2026</a>. 



 Product Agnostic: Our DPP works with any type of product, whether batch-based, lot-based or individual instances. 



 Automatic Identification of the Requester: The solution aligns with #eIDAS2.0 by supporting decentralized identification of individuals and organizations. 



 Technology Stack Independent: The DPP can be accessed without downloading a additional app and lowers the threshold for adoption and enhances usability. 



 Lightweight &amp; Semantically Rich: Information is delivered &nbsp;through Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and semantic data schemas, ensuring seamless interoperability. Additionally, we use W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to guarantee unique, globally resolvable product IDs. 



 Cryptographically Verifiable: All data within the DPP is cryptographically signed, enabling validation of authenticity and trust without central intermediaries. 



 Trust Infrastructure Support: Establishing trust over the data and integration with Digital Identity Trust Anchors is possible, ex by using the eIDAS 2.0 mechanism and the EU Trust infrastructure proposed for natural and legal entities. 
 



 Demonstration: Digital Product Passport System for Battery 



<p>Our final demo phase featured a live demonstration of a DPP tied to a battery cell used in an electric scooter.</p>



<p>The goal was to simulate how a real-world DPP can accompany a product through its entire lifecycle — from raw material extraction to end-of-life recycling.</p>



<p>We explored the perspectives and requirements of key stakeholders, including: Miners, Battery pack manufacturers, Economic operators, Consumer, Recyclers and Government and public interest organizations</p>



<p>Through interactive demonstrations, we answered key questions in real time, illustrating how a decentralized, interoperable, and trustworthy DPP can benefit every actor along the value chain.</p>

  <p>In early 2025, Blockchain Commons architected and engineered a major project for the Zcash blockchain: the ZeWIF specification that allows all of its wallets to interoperate.</p>

  <p>Interoperability is something that I consider vitally important for a technological ecosystem, so I was thrilled that Blockchain Commons could improve interoperability for Zcash. Here’s a bit more on why, what Blockchain Commons did for Zcash, and what I’d like to do for other technological communities.</p>
</blockquote>

 The Limits of Interop 

<p>Obviously, some level of interop is necessary for any ecosystem, or it just wouldn’t work. There was a white paper and there are BIPs for Bitcoin; without them, no one could agree on how the blockchain works. We similarly have specifications, RFCs, and standards for everything from email to graphics file formats.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are limits to interop. Standards tend to cover the things that are required for the broadest level of intercommunication within an ecosystem. But when companies begin to work on their own apps, their work often turns proprietary—sometimes aggressively so—and that limits a technological ecosystem’s ability to continue to grow.</p>

<p>As an example, email has standards such as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322">RFC 5322</a> for how mail servers communicate with each other. When mailers begin storing their mail, things become somewhat more balkanized: you might use a classic <code>mbox</code> format or a single-message <code>eml</code> format or a proprietary format such as Microsoft Outlook’s <code>msg</code>. Finally, there’s no consistency at all for how mailers might algorithmically filter messages: it’s hard to control whether a message ends up in the “Important”, “Everything Else”, or even “Spam” category of Gmail, even if a mailer adopts newer standards such as DKIM, DMARC, and SPF.</p>

<p>Yet, all of these types of interactions are important. If a mail ends up in a Spam folder, that’s almost as bad as it not being delivered at all; if mail can’t be restored from a proprietary mailbox, it’s lost as well. That’s why interop is important.</p>

 The Power of Interop 

<p>I developed four core architectural fundamentals for Blockchain Commons that I call the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian Principles</a>. Of them, Privacy is only peripherally related to the question of interoperability, but the other three highlight why interop is important for the health of any technological ecosystem.</p>

 
   Independence is a user-focused principle. It says that users should be free from external control. This is the heart of my ideas of <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a>, and it’s the heart of interoperability too. With the ability to export or exchange data in an interoperable way, users don’t get locked into a single platform. Instead, they can choose among a variety of options to find an application, service, or pricing structure that meets their precise needs. 
   Resilience is a data-focused principle. It says that data should be protected from loss. When data output and exchange formats are standardized for interoperability, they become widely used and widely understood. That ensures that they can be recovered far into the future. If you’ve ever tried to recover an old ClarisWorks or WordStar file, you’ve seen how much a non-interoperated file format can damage resilience. In comparison, <code>.rtf</code> files will never be lost and even <code>.docx</code> is pretty good—both because Microsoft Word has an enormous install base and because it’s an XML-based output format. 
   Openness is a creator-focused principle. It says that infrastructure should be open so that new creators can join the ecosystem. When communication is standardized, anyone can develop in accordance with the standards, including newcomers. But, this isn’t just beneficial to creators, it’s also beneficial to users. Without new entrants, an ecosystem can become staid and stagnant. With new entrants, an ecosystem is constantly innovating and expanding. It creates an atmosphere of coopetition: members of the ecosystem cooperate to interoperate, but then compete to offer the best products within those standards. 
 

<p>In other words, interoperability is beneficial for the vast majority of members of the ecosystem: users get more options, more innovations, and freedom of choice; creators get the ability to fairly participate and compete; and data gets strong protections far into the future.</p>

 What We Did for Zcash 

<p>I was thrilled when members of the Zcash community started talking with me about their needs, because it showed a strong, ecosystem-wide understanding of the need for inteoperability.</p>

<p>But there was also a strong inciting incident that led to the Zcash work: the older <a href="https://z.cash/support/zcashd-deprecation/">zcashd server was being deprecated</a> and so there was a need to migrate digital-asset data from its wallet to others. This also reflected a longer-term issue. Digital assets had sometimes been <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/shifting-from-zeclite-to-zashi/47756">lost during previous migrations</a> due to differences or even bugs in different wallets.</p>

<p>Obviously, a one-off migrator could have been created, likely linking zcashd with its replacement wallet, <a href="https://github.com/zcash/wallet">zallet</a>. But I approached things from an architectural point of view: I wanted to create an extensible Wallet Interchange Format (that’s the “eWIF” in “ZeWIF”) that would not just enable the zcashd migration, but also allow any migration from one wallet to another within the Zcash ecosystem. I wanted to take the immediate needs and political will and turn it into something that could benefit the community for years to come.</p>

<p>That was the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashCommunityGrants/zcashcommunitygrants/issues/3">ZeWIF proposal</a> that we put forth. It called for one month of studying Zcash wallet data as it currently exists, then another two months of developing the spec and writing libraries to convert among different wallets using that spec. (That timeline turned out to be a bit ambitious, but we’re closing out the initial design with a fourth month of work.)</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the above diagram shows, the <code>zewif</code> Rust crate lies at the center of the ZeWIF system. It creates in-memory representations of data from a variety of inputs and can output that abstracted data in a numbers of forms. Obviously, it can accept input from ZeWIF files and it can output to ZeWIF files. However, that’s just part of the process. Individual developers can also choose to use create front ends that import data from their wallets to <code>zewif</code> and back ends that export the data from <code>zewif</code> to their wallets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we release ZeWIF into the ecosystem, we should see advancements in accordance with the Gordian principles:</p>

 
   Independence. Users will be able to move their funds easily among Zcash wallets. 
   Resilience. Translation of keys and seeds should be more reliable, and if conversion is done using our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zmigrate/blob/master/docs/bestpractices.md">best practices</a>, there should be clear warnings if anything wansn’t converted. 
   Openness. New wallets can join the ecosystem. If they have innovative features, they can easily pick up new users if they support ZeWIF as an import format. 
 

<p>I’ve been thrilled to have strong support from wallet makers in the Zcash community. That type of buy-in is required to make interoperability work. <a href="https://zingolabs.org/">Zingo Labs</a>, the makers of the Zingo wallet, introduced us to the opportunity and have worked closely with us to fulfill our vision. Meanwhile, <a href="https://z.cash/ecosystem/electric-coin-company/">ECC</a> has been our next testbed, since they’re using ZeWIF to manage conversions between zcashd and zallet. Other principals have been involved as well, and just as importantly we didn’t receive any pushback from anyone who refused to use the format. (Not everyone has adopted it yet, but we’re just finalizing the complete ZeWIF draft at this point.)</p>

<p>We were fortunate, because that’s not always the case.</p>

 What We Did for Bitcoin 

<p>This isn’t Blockchain Commons’ first rodeo. Creating interoperability has been Blockchain Commons’ goal since the start, and we’ve done most of our interop work to date with Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Our two biggest successes for Bitcoin have been <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/animated-qrs/">Animated QRs</a> and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR</a>. Animated QRs are a standardized way to move large files across airgaps. That’s the exact sort of intercommunication that has always required interoperability. SSKR is a standardized way to shard a secret, currently focused on Shamir’s Secret Sharing. Because it isn’t just about intercommunication, getting a variety of companies to use it was a bigger victory, because it ensures those secrets will remain accessible and resilient into the far future. Both technologies are integrated with our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">Uniform Resources</a>, which have been implemented by <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/implementations/">more than a dozen companies</a>, offering true interoperability.</p>

<p>But these successes have unfortunately been piecemeal. There’s just one company that I’m aware of that’s adopted a pretty wide swath of Blockchain Commons’ Gordian specifications, and that’s our long-time sponsor, <a href="https://foundation.xyz/">Foundation</a>. We  most recently worked with them to support <a href="https://community.foundation.xyz/t/quantumlink/291">QuantumLink</a>, a Post-Quantum-Cryptopgraphy (PQC) method of Bluetooth communication that’s in their new <a href="https://foundation.xyz/buy-passport-prime/">Passport Prime device</a>, but they’ve also implemented URs, Animated QRs, SSKR, and other Blockchain Commons interop specs. As a result, they’ve got well-studied, mature specifications that they didn’t roll themselves and that should be resilient and reliable far into the future. I think that adding in a variety of linked interop specs like this has a multiplicative effect.</p>

<p>I’d love to see more of this in the Bitcoin community, but a lot of people are resistant.</p>

 Why People Fight Interoperability 

<p>The primary reason that we see people fight interoperability is market dominance. The Bitcoin ecosystem has grown large enough that some of the bigger players have stepped back from inteoperability</p>

<p>I was sad to see ColdCard go this way, after they themselves built on Trezor and other open-source libraries. At least they’ve remained source-verifiable (meaning you can view their code in their repo), at least until you get now to the proprietary chip, but they were once one of maybe three hardware wallets that were fully open-source,and so fully interoperable.</p>

<p>But I think the recent release of Ledger Recover was even more of a tragedy. Here they were offering a big innovation: a way to recover seeds by splitting them up and distributing them off device, similar to Blockchain Commons’ own <a href="https://z.cash/ecosystem/electric-coin-company/">Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR)</a>. But by keeping their protocol for distributing and recovering seed shares non-interoperable, they kept anyone else from offering seed vaults of their own, instead locking their users into their choices—which were very unpopular due to  privacy-busting requirements for KYC information.</p>

<p>The exact opposite approach is taken by another of Blockchain Commons’ long-time developer partners, Craig Raw of the <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow wallet</a>. He’s working hard to make Sparrow compatible with everything out there, but the difficulty he faces underlines the issues with the semi-interoperable state of most blockchains. He has to make <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR-like lists</a> of otherwise incompatible products and introduce secret sauce to interoperate with each of them. We’re very luck to have the Sparrow wallet working with all of these different devices, but it’s something that would never happen if there weren’t someone as dedicated as Craig working on the project.</p>

<p>For smaller companies, interoperability is a way in. Obviously, you should do it!</p>

<p>For bigger companies, interoperability means both trusting your engineers to provide the best experience and trusting your customers to recognize it. That’s a leap of faith, but one that I’d hope to see most companies make in our industry. After all the idea of personal control is likely one of the reasons that your customers are working with digital assets in the first place!</p>

 The Potential for Other Blockchains 

<p>I hope that our work with Zcash (and before that with Bitcoin) is just a first step. I’d like to take that experience to other blockchains and offer new interoperability to grow those ecosystems as well.</p>

<p>Even after the work we’ve already done, Bitcoin may still need this sort of work the most, because it’s gotten so big. How could we make migration between wallets easier? Or just the migration of seeds or keys? How could we more widely standardize the backup of seeds with a methodology like Ledger Recover or our own CSR? How could we inteoperate third-party services such as pricing and fee lookups? Every one of these elements of interoperability would improve the ecosystem, but they require a dedication to inteoperability itself.</p>

<p>The same is true for other ecosystems that have gotten large enough to see multiple companies working on projects. Big changes could be the incentive for this, such as Monero’s move to Seraphis. But even without big changes on the horizon, big ecosystems grow to the point where interoperability becomes a requirement: Ethereum has a huge infrastructure built around WalletConnect, but we’ve talked with people in the ecosystem who think there’s real room for improvement. I hope that many chains (and other ecosystems) beyond Monero and Ethereum will see the advantages of improving interoperability for all the reasons I’ve laid out here, particular independence for users, resilience for data, and openness for developers.</p>

<p>Are you a leader working in a digital-asset ecosystem? Would you like to work with me to take lessons learned from the Zcash project to create interoperable wallet formats, data-exchange formats, service formats, or something else? Drop me a line at <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">team@blockchaincommons.com</a>. I’d love to talk about how we can expand your ecosystem as well.</p>

Panel 4 on Law and Policy for the Attention Crisis, featuring Alex Roberts (moderator), Dick Daynard, Leah Plunkett, Woody Hartzog and Zephyr Teachout.<p>Last Friday, April 11, three of us, <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/bietti/">Elettra Bietti</a>, <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/aileen-nielsen/">Aileen Nielsen</a>, <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/laura-aade/">Laura Aade</a>, co-organized a workshop titled “The Battle for Our Attention: Empirical, Philosophical and Legal Questions” which took place at Northeastern University School of Law, and benefited from the support of CLIC, Northeastern’s <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/academics/centers/clic/">Center for Law, Information and Creativity</a>, and the involvement of Harvard’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center</a> community of fellows and faculty. The event brought together leading legal scholars, policymakers, economists, medical scientists, computer scientists, media scholars, and technologists to address the pressing issue of how today’s digital technologies are transforming the understanding, use, and allocation of human attention, including implications for how we spend our time and what information we&nbsp;consume.</p><p>The discussion was wide-ranging, interdisciplinary, and deeply enlightening. We discussed whether attention <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/nick-seaver">“actually exists”</a>, <a href="https://heartbrain.hms.harvard.edu/people/michael-esterman-phd">how it works</a>, the <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/yochai-benkler/">history</a> and <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/marshall-van-alstyne/">business models</a> of attention capture, the challenges and <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/david-lazer/">findings</a> that arise from <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/person/elena-glassman">empirical</a> <a href="https://cbw.sh/">studies</a> of attention and attention markets, the relation between attention, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/bridget-todd">intimacy</a>, <a href="https://www.umass.edu/communication/about/directory/emily-e-west">convenience</a> and<a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/rebecca-tushnet/"> the law of trademarks</a>, possible analogies with <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/daynard/">tobacco and gambling litigation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-law/faculty/directory/full-time/zephyr-teachout/">policymaking</a> associated with <a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/woodrow-hartzog/">regulating engagement</a> and <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/leah-a-plunkett/">children’s use of social&nbsp;media</a>.</p><p>The event began with a panel on the political economy of attention. <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/yochai-benkler/">Yochai Benkler</a> kicked off the discussion with an overview of the capitalist drive to capture and instrumentalize attention over time, beginning with the 19th century press and culminating in today’s digital technologies. He argued that markets won’t solve attention problems and could exacerbate attention harms, in contrast with <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/marshall-van-alstyne/">Marshall Van Alstyne</a>’s suggestion that a Coasean model of attention rights could help platform owners manage misinformation and reduce incentives to share inaccurate or false information. Where Benkler advocated for the decommodification of attentional experiences, Van Alstyne advocated for a market regime of incentives and individual rights to speak and listen. <a href="https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/david-lazer/">David Lazer</a>, for his part, adopted a middle ground position, presenting several findings on the slow but steady decoupling of content from its sources. He showed that information has become less traceable to sources, and discussed chatbots’ role in producing knowledge that is increasingly divorced from reliable reference to authors and media&nbsp;sources.</p><p>The second morning panel addressed the empirics of attention. <a href="https://heartbrain.hms.harvard.edu/people/michael-esterman-phd">Michael Esterman</a> discussed some of his clinical work, showing that attention is a fluctuating, fragile process deeply shaped by cognitive and environmental factors. Sustaining attention for long periods of time and across contexts remains a phenomenon that is not well understood, and Esterman presented results showing that blocking a population’s mobile phone access for two weeks could improve participants’ attention, as well as their mental health and well-being. Esterman also pointed to the need for increasing measurements outside of laboratory settings to better understand the external validity of fundamental psychological results related to attention. <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/person/elena-glassman">Elena Glassmann</a> then approached attention from the perspective of an interface designer, emphasizing that platforms actively shape how users direct their attention — often without users realizing it. Glassmann highlighted the danger of decontextualisation, where AI-driven tools summarize content by stripping away critical context and leaving users unaware of biases or omissions, and suggested ways to help people build reality-grounded mental models that provide access to contextual information, rather than hiding complexity. <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/christo-wilson/">Christo Wilson</a> concluded the panel with an overview of empirical approaches to studying attention platform business models, highlighting his role with David Lazer in creating and hosting the <a href="https://nationalinternetobservatory.org/index.html">National Internet Observatory</a> at Northeastern, a center that offers tools for researchers to study how people behave online in response to particular design features and platform strategies over long periods of&nbsp;time.</p><p>During the lunch keynote, FTC Commissioner and Law Professor <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/commissioners-staff/alvaro-bedoya">Alvaro Bedoya</a> spoke of his effort building a team of doctors and psychologists at the FTC whose focus and expertise includes children’s mental health and well-being. He also spoke of his work advocating for <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/BedoyaStatementonCOPPARuleNPRMFINAL12.20.23.pdf">children’s privacy</a> under <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/statement-commissioner-alvaro-m-bedoya-issuance-notice-proposed-rulemaking-update-childrens-online">COPPA</a> and of the analogies and differences between tobacco, sports gambling and addiction to technological devices and products. Commissioner Bedoya suggested that more research needs to be done to better understand which products, platforms and specific technological features cause addiction and other mental health disorders.</p><p>The afternoon began with a third panel on media and communication systems for attention capture. <a href="https://as.tufts.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/nick-seaver">Nick Seaver</a> presented a spirited argument that attention may, in fact, not exist at all. While holding and waving a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_jiggler">mouse jiggler</a>, Seaver showed that attention is primarily defined or constructed by the way it is measured. Measurement, in turn, serves primarily as a managerial tool of control. While they might appear to be measuring participation, platform designers are in reality disciplining, tracking and controlling populations. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/bridget-todd">Bridget Todd</a> spoke of her work in the podcasting world, emphasizing the relation between intimacy and attention: audiences pay attention based on proximity to particular types of content and the emotions that content generates for them. Her view is that the current digital economy prioritizes profitable outrage over thoughtful storytelling, but that we should always push for the latter. <a href="https://www.umass.edu/communication/about/directory/emily-e-west">Emily West </a>presented some of her research on Amazon through the lens of convenience. Attention and addiction to digital products are promoted by appealing to convenience: platforms engineer frictionless experiences to generate user dependencies, producing a culture of learned passivity and inattention that quietly erodes agency. <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/rebecca-tushnet/">Rebecca Tushnet </a>spoke of the law of advertising and the doctrines of dilution and confusion under trademarks law, explaining that the law simultaneously invokes but misunderstands the science of, or empirical realities of, human attention, protecting only those parts of attention that can be owned under intellectual property regimes. Similar to Seaver’s argument that attention is effectively what we can measure, Tushnet’s presentation highlighted that we live in an economy of signals and containers of attention.</p><p>The day ended with a panel discussion on legal and policymaking efforts in the attention space. <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/daynard/">Richard Daynard</a> shared key takeaways from his litigation experience fighting tobacco and gambling companies. He explained that these industries intentionally engineer their products to addict users while funding research that shows the exact opposite, namely that their products are not addictive and individuals who engage in excessive use are the ones to blame. He added that these companies often lose in product liability litigation, where strict liability regardless of intention is the standard. <a href="https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-law/faculty/directory/full-time/zephyr-teachout/">Zephyr Teachout</a> then offered an overview of the evolving Supreme Court jurisprudence on the First Amendment, arguing that current shifts in the court’s composition and caselaw are opening the door to possible legislation and reform in the attention space, something that until recently seemed largely implausible. <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/leah-a-plunkett/">Leah Plunkett</a> discussed state social media laws and described them as providing financial compensation, privacy safeguards for children and workplace protections. She focused on a recent <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/03/11/utah-bill-aimed-protecting-child/">Utah law</a> that allows children to sue their parents for compensation when their image is used in their parents’ social media feed for profit and described her involvement in drafting a model law on this theme for the Uniform Law Commission. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/woodrow-hartzog/">Woody Hartzog</a> concluded the panel presentations, discussing his work with Neil Richards on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4845648">wrongful engagement</a>, a tort which would allow individuals to sue digital companies for profiting from their addiction and engagement while neglecting users’ well&nbsp;being.</p><p>The event ended with participants discussing potential research overlaps, future collaborations and potential for advocacy across US regions. In the words of CLIC Director <a href="https://law.northeastern.edu/faculty/roberts/">Alex Roberts</a>, who moderated the last panel, “[i]f an interdisciplinary field of “attention studies” wasn’t already a thing, it is&nbsp;now.”</p><p>This event would not have been possible without support and assistance from Northeastern’s CLIC, Alexandra Roberts, Jennifer Huer, Walaa Al Awad, Natalia Pifferer, Brad Whitmarsh, and Jacob Bouvier. We also thank Harvard Law’s Laura Zeng, and BKC’s Bey Woodward and Jonathan Zittrain for additional enthusiasm and assistance.</p><p>We hope to continue this important conversation in the months and years to come with all of you. If you would like to join future conversations, we have created a regional mailing list which you can sign up to&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/boston-area-human-attention-scholars/?pli=1">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/reporting-from-the-battle-for-our-attention-workshop-northeastern-april-11-2025-7ca7976c546d">Reporting from “The Battle for Our Attention” Workshop @ Northeastern, April 11, 2025</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today, we’re sharing important news about the future of Ceramic.</p><p>With the rapid rise of agents as the new critical user and interface to the web, it’s increasingly clear that supporting a healthy, trustless, decentralized model for AI is essential. Our team, part of <a href="https://linktr.ee/recalllabs?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Recall Labs</a> after our merge with Textile, is shifting our primary focus to <a href="https://recall.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Recall</a>: a platform where AI agents prove themselves, improve themselves, and earn for their intelligence.</p><p>As part of this, we’ll be repurposing parts of Ceramic, deprecating others, and introducing a standalone open source version for the community. We want to openly communicate what this means for you and your applications built on Ceramic, as well as outline the path forward.</p> From Ceramic to Recall <p>Over the years, Ceramic has been pivotal in helping us understand decentralized data, composability, and robust synchronization. It’s been the leading technology for dozens of applications and networks in need of scalable, edge-centric, verifiable data storage and replication. We spent more than five years developing and iterating on Ceramic and are immensely proud of the advancements and technology we’ve shipped.</p><p>Even more than that, we are so thankful for your partnership. Our customers and community have relentlessly innovated on brand new tech, helped us move from prototypes to stable networks, and been the driving force for our continued commitment to open, decentralized data. Thank you for all of your support, and all you’ve helped us learn.</p><p>One of the persistent challenges we’ve faced with Ceramic has been the UX of decentralized data systems: managing keys and signing data, novel access control flows, and counterintuitive patterns for data flow have been challenges for many users and developers. Interestingly, all these properties are native and intuitive for the internet’s new class of users: agents.</p><p>Recall is a cryptoeconomic platform for AI agents to prove, improve, and earn based on their intelligence. It builds heavily on the technology we’ve built previously, but is a new platform and demands our full commitment.</p> What This Means for Ceramic Users <p>We deeply appreciate the trust and investment you’ve made in Ceramic. While our priority is Recall, we remain committed to setting Ceramic users up for success as we sunset certain parts of Ceramic.Here’s exactly what you need to know:</p> Introducing ceramic-one <p>Ceramic-one is the most performant, stable, and decentralized implementation of Ceramic. There is a new client SDK for reading/writing to ceramic-one: <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/tree/main/sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/tree/main/sdk</a></p><p>Ceramic-one introduces <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/new-ceramic-release-ceramic-one-with-new-ceramic-recon-protocol/">Recon</a>, enabling reliable synchronization and historical data syncing across nodes. All existing data from ComposeDB remains fully accessible and readable through ceramic-one.</p><p>Ceramic-one will continue to function independently, with no dependency on our infrastructure or any other centralized authority. Further, Ceramic-one is under an MIT license, so anyone who wants to fork it and continue developing it on their own is welcome to do so.</p> Anchoring and Conflict Resolution on Ceramic-one <p>We’re committed to completing one final critical feature for ceramic-one: self-anchoring to Recall. This allows fully decentralized timestamping without relying on our centralized CAS or Ethereum L1, making ceramic-one truly self-sufficient. This will be implemented sometime after the mainnet release of Recall.</p><p>Manual conflict resolution is currently possible through ceramic-one by exposing all stream HEADs, allowing applications to apply their own business logic to select which branch(s) of the stream's history they wish to use. We’re also considering building automated conflict resolution (based on anchor timestamps)—the only remaining functionality from js-ceramic not yet implemented in ceramic-one. If this feature is important to your use case, please reach out, as your feedback will influence our decision.</p><p>After these improvements, ceramic-one will reach a feature-complete MVP. At that point, we will only prioritize critical bug fixes. ceramic-one will continue to exist as stable software under an open MIT license—fully available for anyone who wishes to fork, improve, or independently evolve it.</p> Deprecation of js-ceramic and ComposeDB <p>Effective immediately, we’re deprecating js-ceramic and ComposeDB. We recommend migration to ceramic-one, the streamlined, performant successor, as soon as possible.</p><p>Migration Steps:</p>  A new client SDK for ceramic-one is now available here: <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/tree/main/sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ceramic-one SDK</a>  Step-by-step migration guidance is provided in our upgrade guides:  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/new-ceramic-release-ceramic-one-with-new-ceramic-recon-protocol/">Migration Guide on Ceramic Blog</a>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/blob/main/UPGRADE.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Detailed Upgrade Instructions on GitHub</a>    <p>Timeline and Support</p><p>ComposeDB and the Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) will be completely shut down at least one month after Recall’s Mainnet launch. (Exact date TBD, but expected in mid-2025.). After that date, ComposeDB-dependent apps will break if not migrated to ceramic-one.</p> Recall: The Future of Decentralized Intelligence <p>Ceramic’s legacy and your contributions have directly influenced our development of Recall. Many of Ceramic’s strengths—openness, transparency, and decentralization—live on and evolve within Recall’s cryptoeconomic framework.</p><p>Recall aims to become a vibrant ecosystem for AI builders and developers. We warmly invite Ceramic users to explore the opportunities Recall offers: building intelligent agents, participating in verifiable competitions, and earning from proven performance.</p> <p>We’re grateful for your support of Ceramic and excited about this next chapter with Recall. Our team remains available to assist your migration and ensure your continued success. If you have questions related to Ceramic, please reach out to us <a href="mailto:ceramic@set.gl">here</a>. If you’re interested in learning more about Recall, find us <a href="https://x.com/recallnet?ref=blog.ceramic.network">on Twitter</a>!</p><p>Warm regards,<br>The Recall Labs Team</p>

 ZeWIF Specification 

<p></p>

<p>The Zcash extensible Wallet Interchange Format (ZeWIF) has been Blockchain Commons’ main priority since the Zcash Community Grants program approved our proposal at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Why It’s Important. Blockchain Commons talks a lot about interoperability, and that’s what ZeWIF is: it’s a way to freely exchange data between Zcash wallets in a standardized form. What we don’t talk about as often is why interoperability is important.</p>

<p>It goes back to our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian principles</a>. Interoperability supports at least three of them.</p>

 
   It supports independence because any user can freely move their data among the interoperable software systems. 
   It supports openness because any developer can easily join the ecosystem by adopting a mature, well-understood specification. This creates an environment of coopetition (cooperative competition) that leads to advances in technology and usability. 
   It supports resilience because the interoperable format makes data less likely to be lost: it’ll be in a form that will be understood and therefore accessible, well in the future. 
 

<p>For a wallet ecosystem, interoperability means that users will have the freedom to move their digital assets among Zcash wallets. That’s the precise independence we want users to have, which is why it’s been worth spending a few months of time on this project.</p>

<p>The ZeWIF Meetings. To support the ZeWIF project, Blockchain Commons held <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/#meetings">three meetings</a> in the first quarter: on the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/meeting1/">initial wallet survey</a>, on the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/meeting2/">first demo of the zmigrate tool</a>, and on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/chains/zcash/zewif/meeting3/">ZeWIF data abstractions</a>. Meeting with developers to ensure that specifications serve everyone’s needs has always been a bedrock policy for Blockchain Commons, so we’ve of course extended it here. (At least one more meeting is planned, for April 16th, to demo the data file format.)</p>

      #3: Abstraction Discussion:










   
    
   



    
  


<p>What We’ve Released So Far. The ZeWIF project is built around the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zewif">zewif library</a>, which stores Zcash wallet data in an in-memory format. We’ve also written <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zewif-zcashd">zewif-zcashd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zewif-zingo">zewif-zingo</a> to demonstrate the import of data from those wallets to ZeWIF, while our partners at <a href="https://zingolabs.org/">Zingo Labs</a> have produced “zewif-zecwallet” for importing zecwallet data (though that PR hasn’t been merged yet). Finally, we authored <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/zmigrate">zmigrate</a>, which is a demo CLI for importing zcashd content. With these demos and libraries in hand, other wallet developers can start working to interchange their own data via the ZeWIF format.</p>

<p>What’s Still to Come. With our releases so far, data can be interchanged between different Zcash wallets as long as it’s all done on the same machine: you just import into the in-memory ZeWIF format from one wallet, then export to another. But we expect most use cases will instead involve at least two different machines. That’s where the ZeWIF file format comes into play. Building on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a>, it translates the ZeWIF in-memory storage into a fixed file that can then be moved to a different machine. We expect to demo the Envelope ZeWIF format at that upcoming April 16th meeeting.</p>

 Post-Quantum Commons 

<p></p>

<p>Is Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) the next big thing? We were able to support our friends at Foundation with some PQC work just as we got the ZeWIF project going at the start of the year.</p>

<p>Why It’s Important. Quantum Computers are starting to appear, and though they’re far, far from what would be needed to break cryptography at the moment, there’s no telling when there’s going to be a sudden “quantum” leap. Though today’s cryptography might not need PQC, if you’re working on something that might be around for 5 or 10 years, you should be thinking about it!</p>

<p>PQC Meeting. Our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/meetings/2025-03-pqc/">March Gordian meeting</a> contained all the details of our PQC work, including what Quantum Computing is.</p>



 
    
   

<p>QuantumLink. The highlight of the meeting was a discussion of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/assets/pdfs/202503-quantumlink.pdf">QuantumLink</a> from our friends at <a href="https://foundation.xyz/">Foundation</a>. This is a  quantum-resistant protocol for Bluetooth communication that is a critical component of their new <a href="https://foundation.xyz/buy-passport-prime/">Passport Prime</a> wallet. It allows them to use Bluetooth with high security and for that security to remain strong 5 or 10 years in the future, in case Quantum Computing does make those big strides forward.</p>

<p>What We’ve Released So Far. The QuantumLink technology was enabled by new PQC support that Blockchain Commons incorporated into its libraries. You can now use the PQC algorithms <a href="https://hackmd.io/@bc-community/rJ8DOmCd1e">ML-DSA and ML-KEM</a> in our Rust stack, from <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-components-rust">bc-componenents</a> on up.</p>

 Open Integrity 

<p></p>

<p>We had one other big release in Q1: <a href="https://github.com/openintegrityproject">Open Integrity</a>, a system for increasing the trust of software being developed in Git. Well, technically it was released on April 7th, the 20th anniversary of Git’s release, but this is something that Blockchain Commons Architect Christopher Allen has been working on for about a year, so we’re thrilled to get the word out.</p>

<p>Why It’s Important. We wrote <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/open-integrity/">a whole article</a> discussing why Open Integrity is important. But, in short: Git repos are growing increasingly important for the deployment of critical software, and Git doesn’t actually provide a high-level of trust for those repos, despite the ability to sign commits. Open Integrity bridges the gap betwen what Git offers and what online software distribution needs.</p>

<p>What We’ve Released So Far. The Open Integrity project is now available in an early form at <a href="https://github.com/openintegrityproject">GitHub</a>. A <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity_Problem_Statement.md">Problem Statement</a> offers  details on the issues we’re trying to solve and our solutions. We’ve also got a number of tools and scripts, the most import of which creates an <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/src/setup_git_inception_repo.sh">inception commit on a repo</a>. This inception commit is the root of trust that lays the foundation for ensuring that you always know who’s in control of a repo.</p>

<p>If you want to try out Open Integrity, see the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity_Script_Snippets.md">Open Integrity Snippets file</a>, which has complete instructions on how to get that inception-commit script running, plus many examples that will allow you to experiment with Open Integrity.</p>

 

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s it for our big Q1 projects, but we had a number of smaller releases over the course of the quarter as well.</p>

 New Articles 

<p>The Right to Transact. We think the right to transact should be an international freedom. Read more in Christopher’s recent article, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/RightToTransact/">“The Case for an International Right to Freedom to Transact”</a>, which builds on his 2024 musing, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/ValuesDesign/">“How My Values Inform Design”</a>.</p>

<p>SSI Orbit Podcast. Christopher also was interviewed for the <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/videos/SSI-Podcast/">SSI Orbit Podcast</a>. It’s been nine years since he wrote the foundational <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>. Where do things stand today?</p>

 New Dev Docs 

<p>SSKR Pages. We updated our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR dev pages</a> with the big focus being differentiating <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/#what-are-sskr-urs">SSKR URs</a> (where you split up a key) and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/#what-are-sskr-envelopes">SSKR Envelopes</a> (where you protect the entire contents of an Envelope by creating and splitting up a key). The <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/vectors/">test vectors</a> also now demonstrate both cases.</p>

<p>UR Pages. We similarly did some big updates to our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">UR dev pages</a>. Here the issue was that URs had seen some changes over the years, especially as we locked down CBOR tag registration, and our examples were no longer up-to-date. Now, every page and every test vector should be correct. There’s also a new page on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/envelope/">URs for Gordian Envelope</a>.</p>

<p>Meetings Pages. All of Blockchain Commons’ meetings are now documented on a new <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/meetings/">meetings page</a>, which also includes subpages with videos and slides (and usually transcripts) of everything from the last few years!</p>

<p>Improved Crate Docs. Finally, we’ve used some lessons learned from the documentation of ZeWIF to improve the documentation of our Rust stack. As a result, docs.rs now has improved docs for <a href="https://docs.rs/dcbor/0.16.5/dcbor/">bc-dcbor</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/bc-components/0.18.2/bc_components/">bc-components</a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/bc-envelope/latest/bc_envelope/">bc-envelope</a></p>

 New Ports 

<p>Lifehash to Rust. Lifehash is now available in a new <a href="https://github.com/GalactechsLLC/lifehash-rs">Rust Implementation</a> courtesy of Ken Griggs. Lifehash is a critical element of the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/oib/">object identity block</a>, which can help users to recognize seeds and keys. We hope this will allow for more deployment.</p>

 New Research 

<p></p>

<p>Provenance Marks. One of our newest innovations, courtesy of Blockchain Commons Lead Researcher Wolf McNally, is the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2025-001-provenance-mark.md">provenance mark</a>. The provenance mark is a cryptographically secure chain of marks that facilitates the easy verification of authenticity. We’ll have more on them in the months ahead, but in the meantime, you can read Wolf’s <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2025-001-provenance-mark.md">research paper</a> on the topic!</p>

<p>Provenance References. If you want to start playing with provenance marks right now, 
we’ve already released a series of reference apps and libraries. They include our original <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Provenance">Swift implementation</a>, our newer <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/provenance-mark-rust">Rust implementation</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/provenance-mark-cli-rust">CLI</a> that can be used to create and manage marks!</p>

 

<p>That’s it for the moment. For the next quarter, we’ll be closing out our initial work on ZeWIF in April, and we’ll be offering more looks at Provenance Marks in the months ahead.</p>

This new working group will focus on developing standards, schemas, processes, and documentation to support the self-sovereign exchange of data between travelers, services, intermediaries in the hospitality and travel industry, and their AI agents.</p> Mission and Focus <p>The primary goal of the working group is to enable travelers to maintain ownership and control over their personal data while allowing for seamless interactions with travel service providers. The group will address critical aspects of traveler profiles, focusing on data portability, privacy, and interoperability across the travel ecosystem.</p> Meeting Schedule <p>The working group will convene twice weekly:</p>  Tuesdays at 10:00 AM Eastern Time  Fridays at 10:00 AM Eastern Time  <p>These regular meetings will facilitate ongoing collaboration among industry stakeholders, technology providers, and standards bodies.</p> Leadership Perspectives <p>"We are enormously proud that the hard work of our dedicated Hospitality &amp; Travel SIG has led to a Working Group that will develop key specifications. From sharing boarding passes and hotel preferences to loyalty programs and dietary requirements, travelers constantly provide the same information to different companies throughout their journey.</p><p>"Travelers need to share, and overshare, the broadest range of personal data on their voyage, ranging from seat or dietary preferences, to government identities or passports, across multiple service providers who may not have the best data handling practices. This working group will develop standards that allow travelers to control exactly what data they share, with whom, and for how long - eliminating both unnecessary data exposure and the frustration of repeatedly entering the same information," said Kim Hamilton Duffy, Executive Director of the DIF.</p><p>Douglas Rice, industry veteran and Hospitality &amp; Travel Working Group chair added: "The travel ecosystem has long struggled with fragmented approaches to customer data and identity management. This working group will help establish the technical foundations needed for travelers to maintain control of their data while enabling the personalized experiences they expect. We're building toward a future where your travel preferences, loyalty information, and credentials can move with you seamlessly across your journey—all while maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security, and enabling AI agents to act on verified information about the traveler.”</p> Next Steps <p>The working group will initially focus on defining standardized schemas for travelers or their digital agents to present profiles, establishing protocols for secure data exchange, and developing guidelines for implementation across various travel touchpoints. Industry participants are encouraged to join the working group to contribute their expertise and perspectives.</p><p>For more information about participating in the DIF Hospitality &amp; Travel Working Group, visit the <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation website</a>.</p>

<p>Organizations are encouraged to take the Passkey Pledge ahead of World Passkey Day on May 1&nbsp;</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., April 9, 2025 – The FIDO Alliance is inviting organizations around the world to take the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">Passkey Pledge</a>, a voluntary commitment to increase awareness and adoption of passkey sign-ins to make the web safer and more accessible.</p>



<p>Since passkeys were introduced to the world in 2022, hundreds of service providers have embraced the greater security and usability that passkeys bring to users. Over 15 billion user accounts are now equipped with the option to use a passkey instead of relying on passwords, which are easy to steal and reuse for account takeovers and fraud. Organizations that deploy passkeys are consistently finding that a greater percentage of their users are able to sign into services in far less time – which helps generate added revenue and/or employee productivity while also reducing fraud and account takeovers.</p>



<p>To further advance and promote the use of passkeys, the first Thursday in May each year is now recognized as World Passkey Day (previously World Password Day). Companies can take the Passkey Pledge in advance of World Passkey Day and commit to making a good-faith effort to achieve the following goals throughout the year:</p>



 
 For service providers that have an active implementation of passkeys for sign-in – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken to measurably increase the use of passkeys by users when signing into the company’s services. 



 For service providers that are in the process of implementing passkeys for sign-in – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate measurable actions taken to enable passkeys for signing into the company’s services. 



 For vendors with a FIDO-based products and/or service – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken to measurably increase the use of passkeys through adoption of the company’s products and/or services. 



 For vendors developing FIDO-based products and/or services – Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate measurable actions to FIDO certify its products and launch a product or service with passkey sign-in support. 



 For industry associations and standards organizations&nbsp;– Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions to increase the visibility and benefits of passkey sign-ins. 
 



<p>Organizations that take the pledge will receive assets to support their involvement and will have the opportunity to take part in activities and announcements planned for World Passkey Day on May 1, 2025.</p>



<p>More details on the pledge, including the sign-up form, can be found at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/">https://fidoalliance.org/passkeypledge/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Taking Action: Resources to Help Organizations to Fulfill the Pledge 



<p>The FIDO Alliance has resources and best practices for Passkey Pledge organizations to take action, including:</p>



 
 Sharing their commitment to the Passkey Pledge via external communications channels 



 Leveraging the guidance on <a href="http://passkeycentral.org">passkeycentral.org</a> to plan, implement and expand their passkey rollouts 



 Implementing the <a href="https://www.passkeycentral.org/design-guidelines/">FIDO Design Guidelines</a>, data-driven UX best practices for passkey rollouts 



 Getting their products <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO Certified</a> to demonstrate that their products are compliant, interoperable and secure 



 Releasing case studies on their or their customers behalf to share implementation journeys and business outcomes. Organizations can reach out to <a href="mailto:info@fidoalliance.org">info@fidoalliance.org</a> to submit case studies directly to the FIDO Alliance 



 Taking part in the FIDO Alliance <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/become-a-member/">member activities</a> and working groups to further drive passkey optimization and adoption&nbsp; 



 Planning and/or taking steps to <a href="https://www.passkeycentral.org/passkey-roll-out-guides/prevent-phishing/">remove passwords as a sign-in option</a>. 
 



 About the FIDO Alliance 



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.

   A New Era for Sustainable Computing  Demand for computing power is exploding as AI models, cloud services, and decentralized applications consume ever-greater amounts of energy. But not all energy is created equal. In some regions, a data center might be drawing power from a coal-heavy grid, while elsewhere excess wind or solar power goes unused.

 A New Era for Sustainable Computing <p>Demand for computing power is exploding as AI models, cloud services, and decentralized applications consume ever-greater amounts of energy. But not all energy is created equal. In some regions, a data center might be drawing power from a coal-heavy grid, while elsewhere excess wind or solar power goes unused. For the past decade, tech giants addressed this by buying renewable energy or improving efficiency. But what if we could take a more dynamic approach — shifting computational workloads across location and time to maximize use of clean&nbsp;energy?</p><p>Enter Carbon-Aware Nomination, a groundbreaking mechanism from Energy Web that does exactly that. It ensures computational tasks run where and when they have the lowest carbon intensity. This isn’t a standard cloud feature or a typical blockchain project, but a fusion of both: it connects decentralized computing networks with real-time carbon intensity data from <a href="https://watttime.org/">WattTime</a> and the Green Software Foundation’s <a href="https://carbon-aware-sdk.greensoftware.foundation/">Carbon-Aware SDK</a>. And the best part — it’s going open-source, inviting the entire industry to build a greener digital future together.</p> The Carbon Cost of Computing: Why It&nbsp;Matters <p>Computing today has a massive carbon cost. Data centers account for around 1–2% of global electricity use (on par with the airline industry), and that share is rising fast. Some forecasts warn that with the AI boom, data center energy demand could hit double-digit percentages of global consumption by 2030. In short, if we don’t make computing more sustainable, it will hinder global climate goals. Today’s solutions to decarbonize workloads rarely have real-time “carbon awareness.” This means a lot of flexible computing — like batch processing or AI training jobs — might be running at the worst possible times for the planet. Carbon-Aware Nomination changes that paradigm by intelligently routing workloads to times and places where electricity is greenest.</p> Why Carbon-Aware Nomination Is a Game-Changer <p>Carbon-aware computing isn’t an entirely new idea, but no one has implemented it the way we have. Existing approaches have serious limitations:</p>  Blind Spots in Conventional Cloud Sustainability: Major cloud platforms have introduced sustainability dashboards and efficiency tools to help customers estimate carbon footprints. However, these proprietary solutions require you to trust their reporting. There’s no independent way to verify if a given workload actually ran on low-carbon energy. In other words, you might see carbon-saving claims, but you can’t prove them. While Carbon-Aware Nomination is built for decentralized compute networks, its methodology could be adapted for cloud orchestration. However, the current implementation is blockchain-native, ensuring verifiable, tamper-proof sustainability claims.  Decentralized Compute Lacks Climate Intelligence: Emerging networks like iExec, Golem, and Akash distribute workloads across many nodes, leveraging blockchain for compute marketplaces. Yet, they schedule jobs without considering the carbon intensity of those nodes. A task might just as easily run on a coal-powered node as on a solar-powered one. Until now, no decentralized computing platform has integrated real-time carbon optimization into its scheduling logic.  <p>This is where Carbon-Aware Nomination stands apart. It combines decentralized computing with live carbon-intensity data for the first time. By doing so, it delivers several unique benefits that neither traditional clouds nor existing blockchain compute projects&nbsp;offer:</p>  Decentralized &amp; Trustless Architecture: Built on the Energy Web X blockchain, every decision and claim is transparent. There’s no single company controlling the process, and sustainability claims are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone. This brings a new level of trust to green computing — auditors or stakeholders can confirm, via the public ledger, that a workload ran at a time of low grid emissions.  Real-Time Carbon Intelligence: The system taps into WattTime’s API and the GSF Carbon-Aware SDK to get live and forecasted grid emissions data. Workloads are continuously matched to the cleanest energy times in real time. If wind picks up in Region A or solar output surges in Region B, the scheduler knows and can route tasks accordingly. We’re not offsetting carbon with credits or averaging it annually; we’re actively avoiding emissions as they&nbsp;happen.  Hybrid Public/Enterprise Nodes: Flexibility is built in. Organizations can nominate workloads to run on public decentralized nodes or their own infrastructure — whichever meets the carbon criteria. For example, an enterprise could use its private servers when they’re running on green power, or tap into a public pool of nodes in another region when local power is dirty. Carbon-Aware Nomination isn’t “all or nothing” — it’s a smart overlay that finds the greenest option across a mix of resources.  Verifiable ESG Reporting: Every workload handled through this system generates a digital proof of its execution with associated carbon data. Think of it like an eco-receipt. This proof can feed directly into ESG reports or sustainability audits, backed by blockchain records. Instead of saying “we think our computations were low-carbon,” organizations can cryptographically demonstrate it. This level of accountability is increasingly crucial as investors and regulators demand hard evidence of climate&nbsp;action.  Open-Source Collaboration: Unlike proprietary cloud solutions, Carbon-Aware Nomination is being released as open-source software. This invites an entire community — from researchers to startups — to use it, audit it, and improve it. By sharing the code, Energy Web ensures transparency of the algorithm and accelerates innovation. Anyone will be able to plug into the system or even contribute new features (for example, supporting new types of workloads or integrating additional data sources). We believe an open approach is the fastest way to standardize carbon-aware computing across the&nbsp;world.   How It Works (In Simple&nbsp;Terms):   Checks Carbon Data: A group of computers (nominators) analyze real-time electricity grid data to find where energy is greenest.  Finds the Best Spot: The nominators select and agree on the cleanest available computing resources to execute the workload and qualify for&nbsp;rewards.  Runs &amp; Verifies: The selected computers can accept and execute the workload, and the blockchain records proof of completion, ensuring eligibility for&nbsp;rewards.   How It Works (In detail): The Carbon-Aware Nomination Pool <p>So, how does the system actually orchestrate a “greener” workload? Rather than a central scheduler deciding where tasks run, Carbon-Aware Nomination uses a decentralized pool of worker nodes and nominators that collectively determine the optimal execution plan. Here’s a high-level look at the&nbsp;process:</p>  Live Carbon Data Feeds: Using the Carbon Aware SDK, the system continuously pulls real-time and forecasted carbon intensity data from WattTime’s service. This data covers different regions and grids, updating as conditions change (like when a big solar farm comes online in the afternoon or when a coal plant ramps up at&nbsp;night).  Normalized Comparison: Because “100 gCO₂/kWh” means different things on different grids, the scheduler normalizes carbon intensity across regions. This prevents it from always favoring the same region and ensures a fair comparison. In essence, the algorithm knows what “clean” means for each location and time — a form of smart&nbsp;context.  Energy Web X Worker Registry: All participating compute nodes (whether run by individuals, companies, or data centers) register on the Energy Web X blockchain registry. They publish metadata about their location, hardware, and efficiency. This on-chain registry is like a directory of available computing resources, with info crucial for carbon-aware decisions. It’s also transparent — anyone can see which nodes are available and where they&nbsp;are.  Green Nomination Process: When a workload needs scheduling, a separate group of decentralized nominators, independent from the compute nodes themselves, evaluates the available options. These nominators analyze live carbon intensity data (from step 1), assess each node’s performance and capacity, and rank them based on sustainability. Essentially, the nodes compete, but not on price or speed alone, on verifiable carbon performance. The system then nominates the best-suited, lowest-carbon node to execute the task, ensuring a trustless and tamper-proof selection process.  Workload Execution &amp; Proof: The chosen node runs the computation. During and after execution, it logs the energy used and the carbon intensity at that time. This information is reported back and recorded (for example, as an attestation on Energy Web X). The result is a verifiable proof that “Task X was executed at Time Y in Region Z with carbon intensity Q gCO₂/kWh.” If someone doubts the claim, the proof is on the blockchain for anyone to&nbsp;verify.  <p>Continuous Optimization: Over time, the system can employ incentives to improve efficiency. For instance, node operators who consistently provide low-carbon compute (by perhaps adding their own renewable energy or load-shifting) could be rewarded. Likewise, if the network notices certain regions becoming cleaner (say a new wind farm installed), it will naturally start shifting more workloads there. The feedback loop encourages the whole ecosystem to move towards cleaner operations, as sustainable nodes get more business.</p><p>In practice, this means a company using Carbon-Aware Nomination could submit a batch job and know that the job will run at the best possible time (perhaps an hour later when a green energy surge comes) and in the best location (maybe on a server one country over where it’s a windy night), all without manual intervention. The heavy lifting of “when and where to compute” is handled by the decentralized logic in a transparent way.</p> How Carbon-Aware Nomination Fits into Energy Web&nbsp;X <p>Carbon-Aware Nomination is a component of the broader Energy Web X (EWX) ecosystem. EWX is Energy Web’s new architecture for decentralized solutions, and it supports multiple “nomination” methods (i.e., scheduling and matching mechanisms) for every single compute workload of their solutions. Carbon awareness is one powerful approach, but not the only one — some applications might optimize purely on cost or latency, for example. Within&nbsp;EWX:</p>  Solutions can opt-in to Carbon-Aware Nomination if minimizing emissions is a priority, or choose other nomination modules better suited to their needs. This flexible architecture means EWX can cater to different preferences (greenest vs. fastest vs. cheapest, etc.), and Carbon-Aware Nomination is available for any solution that cares about sustainability.  Even for applications that prioritize performance, Carbon-Aware Nomination can run in the background or as a secondary filter. For instance, if two nodes are equally capable, why not pick the one on cleaner energy? In this way, the carbon-aware mechanism can enhance other scheduling strategies by adding a sustainability lens.  All of this happens while leveraging the security and transparency of Energy Web’s blockchain. The nominations (scheduling decisions) and the resulting proofs are recorded on-chain, which aligns with Energy Web’s mission to use open digital infrastructure for the clean energy transition. EWX provides the trust layer that makes Carbon-Aware Nomination’s claims audit-proof.   Decentralized Nomination: Trustless, Transparent, and Resilient <p>Unlike a traditional cloud scheduler (where one company’s software decides where your job runs), Carbon-Aware Nomination operates without a single controlling entity. The decision process is distributed among many participants and governed by open algorithms. This decentralized approach brings several advantages:</p>  Trustless operations: You don’t have to trust Energy Web or any cloud provider’s claims — you can verify the outcomes yourself on-chain. If a workload was supposed to run on green power, anyone can check the records and confirm it did. This is crucial for companies that need to report emissions reductions to regulators or want to avoid greenwashing.  Transparency: Every step, from the carbon data used to the final selection of a node, can be made transparent. Community members could even watch a dashboard of live nominations happening, seeing in real time how the system is chasing the lowest-carbon resources. This level of openness is unheard of in proprietary cloud scheduling.  Resilience: Decentralization also means there’s no single point of failure. The nomination process can continue even if one node or one data feed goes down. Multiple nodes participate in making decisions, and the blockchain ensures a canonical record. It’s much harder to corrupt or game the system — doing so would require attacking a broad, global network of participants.  <p>For users, this simply translates to peace of mind. You get a robust service that not only optimizes for sustainability but is also inherently reliable and tamper-proof.</p> Why Open Source&nbsp;Matters <p>Energy Web is committed to open-sourcing the entire Carbon-Aware Nomination system. By making it freely available to developers, enterprises, and even competitors, we aim to set a new industry standard for carbon-aware computing. Transparency is a core value here — anyone can inspect the code to understand how decisions are made and suggest improvements. Open source also accelerates innovation: a global community can adapt the tool for new use cases (imagine carbon-aware scheduling for edge devices or for other batch processes like rendering and scientific computing). We’re releasing this under an open license so that this carbon-aware logic can proliferate everywhere, not just within Energy Web’s ecosystem.</p><p>Ultimately, climate change is a shared challenge. We believe that by open-sourcing this solution, we enable network effects — more contributions, more adoption, and more emissions saved. No single company can decarbonize IT on its own, but together, we can make carbon-aware computing the “new normal” for all data centers and&nbsp;devices.</p> Join the&nbsp;Movement <p>Carbon-aware computing is the future. Whether you’re an enterprise managing thousands of servers, a blockchain enthusiast, or a developer hacking on weekends, you can start integrating Carbon-Aware Nomination into your workflows to make a tangible impact. This isn’t just an Energy Web project — it’s a call to all cloud providers, decentralized network operators, and software platforms: join us in running workloads on clean energy. Imagine a world where every AI training, every render job, every transaction validation automatically seeks out the greenest energy available. That’s what we’re building, and we invite you to build it with&nbsp;us.</p><p>The code will be open-sourced on Energy Web’s GitHub (and accessible through our developer portal). We’ll be hosting community calls and tutorials for those who want to implement it or contribute. By working together, we can ensure that the digital infrastructure of the future not only powers our economies — but also heals our planet. It’s time to decarbonize the cloud, one workload at a&nbsp;time.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/carbon-aware-nomination-system-for-decentralized-computing-is-now-live-604996982c0f">Carbon-Aware Nomination System for Decentralized Computing is now live</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>When can you trust a software release? How do you know that a software repo is safe, that it represents the intent of its creators? On the 20th anniversary of Git, these questions are more important than ever.</p>

<p>Obviously, Git lays the foundation for trust in software releases with its ability to sign commits, but the trust of the system is unfortunately shallow. Untrusted content can be merged into a trusted repo, commit histories can be rewritten, and trust can’t be reliably extended into the future. These are crucial issues to solve if we are trusting software that originates in Git … and some pretty crucial software originates with Git, from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">Microsoft’s vscode</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl">OpenSSL project</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/core">vue.js framework</a>. Which is what led me to the design of the Open Integrity system. Though Git may look like to the average user like it offers a strong level of trust, it’s a dangerous mirage. Open Integrity makes repo trust a reality.</p>


  


<p>Open Integrity is still built with Git, meaning that it can be used on GitHub, GitLab, or whatever other Git tool that you prefer. There are no additions required other than the Open Integrity scripts themselves. However, Open Integrity makes trust the default rather than an add-on, establishing a root of trust when a repo is created, defending it against inappropriate additions, and extending that trust to new users and new keys as a project evolves.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Open Integrity’s root of trust can also be used as a DID (decentralized identifier) identity, supporting <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> for a user or a project. But taking advantage of that might be the next step. For the moment, let me dive a bit further into the problems of Git’s current trust framework and how I designed the architecture of Open Integrity to resolve them.</p>

 A Problem of Trust 

<p>The foundation of trust in Git is signing commits with a signing key that is registered with a Git account, but that turns out to be a fragile level of trust because it leaves a number of loopholes.</p>

 
   
    <p>Signing isn’t required. Even if an account has a legitimate signing key, use of that key isn’t required. Even if a Git hosting service enforces commit signing, unsigned commits can typically still be merged from branches.</p>
   
   
    <p>Merging doesn’t guarantee signatures. Generally, merging offers one of the biggest gaps in signing security. It’s not just that merged commits can be unsigned, but that a branch can be deleted after merging, leaving no trace as to whether its commits were signed or not.</p>
   
 

<p>Things don’t necessarily get better when signing actually occurs.</p>

 
   
    <p>Repo origin can’t be verified. Though you can verify signed commits belong to the person who currently controls a repo, there’s no way to verify that they haven’t illegitimately taken over the repo since its inception.</p>
   
   
    <p>Chain of trust functionality is non-existant. On the flipside, there’s no way to show a legitimate transfer of authority between a repo’s originator and its current controller.</p>
   
   
    <p>Key revocation is weak. Though keys can be manually revoked, there’s no way to automatically do so, and there are no warnings if a revoked key was used for signing.</p>
   
   
    <p>History can be rewritten. Finally, Git includes a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">purposeful tool</a> to allow you to rewrite commit history: editing commit messages, rebasing at a large scale, and even removing or changing files! This will change SHA-1 checksums, but as with other dangers here, there’s inadequate messaging to warn of this issue.</p>
   
 

 Solving the Problems 

<p>Solving Git’s trust issues are relatively easy in theory:</p>

 
   Repo ownership needs to be cryptographically provable back to a repo’s origin. 
   Signing needs to be required for commits and merges alike. 
   Commit history needs to be irrevocable. 
   Strong warnings are needed when these conditions aren’t met. 
 

<p>However, nothing is ever that simple in practice. To practically solve the problems required designing an Open Integrity architecture that resolved each of the highlighted problems:</p>


  
    
      Problem
      Solution
    
  
  
    
      Unverified Origin
      Inception Commit
    
    
      Unverified Transfer
      Trust Transition Commit
    
    
      Key Revocation
      Trust Transition Commit<br>Improved Logging
    
    
      Signing Not Required
      Scripted Functions<br>Defined Settings
    
    
      Merging Issues
      Scripted Functions<br>Data Preservation<br>Defined Settings
    
    
      History Issues
      Improved Logging<br>Defined Settings
    
  


<p>Here’s how each of these architectural elements work:</p>

<p>Inception Commit. An inception commit is the first commit made to a repo. It locks the repo’s inception (initial) key with an empty commit, and so secures the repo with both the SSH signature and a SHA-1 hash that’s hard to purposefully collide because of the minimalism of the commit.</p>

<p>Trust Transition Commit. Any authorized key can be used to generate a trust transition commit, which is another zero-sized commit. Additional, trusted keys can be added, and keys can also be revoked. This allows both keys and team members to change over the course of a project, which is crucial for an open-source or large-scale project. The first trust transition commit is done with the inception key; after that any authorized key can be used.</p>

<p>Improved Logging. Many of the protections of Open Integrity arise from scripts that incorporate extensive logging, ensuring that users can see that all security measures are being met. This is done with Git commit messages and with <code>git note</code>.</p>

<p>As an example, here is what the commit logging looks like for an inception commit, a trust transition commit, and a key revocation:</p>

<p>Inception Commit:</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #a3306ef [🏁 Inception Commit] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Initialize repository and establish a SHA-1 root of trust"
    ├─ Signed by: @a61TkTtL... (🏁 Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Empty: true (no files added)
    ├─ SHA-1 Protection: Constrained content + SSH signature
└─ Verification: Platform-independent
</code>   

<p>Trust Transition Commit:</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #b24d9c1 [🔑 New Allowed Commit Signers File] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Added second device key for Alice"
    ├─ Signed by: @a61TkTtL... (🏁 Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
    └─ New Authorized Commit Signers:  
        - 🏁 Inception Key explicitly not included for future commits
        - + @a61TkTtL... (Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)  
        - + @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 2 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
</code>   
<p>Key Revocation:</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #c3d7f12 [🔄 Key Rotation: Removed Alice's Second Device] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Revoked second device key"
    ├─ Signed by: @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 2 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Authorized Commit Signers changed:
        - 🗑️ @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 1 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;) is no longer authorized.
        - @f84PmWnY... (Alice using Device 2 &lt;alice@example.com&gt;)
        - @b73RkKpQ... (Bob using Work Laptop &lt;bob@example.com&gt;)  
        - @c58XmWpL... (Charlie using Home PC &lt;charlie@example.com&gt;) 
</code>   
<p>The commits also clearly show when something is done that violates the basic precepts of Open Integrity. For example:</p>
   <code>    ├─ 🚨 ERROR: Commit was signed using a previously revoked key!
</code>   

<p>Scripted Functions. Logging and the other protections of Open Integrity are available through scripts and one-line “snippet” scripts that can run from aliases. They replace the bare <code>git</code> functions with ones that ensure that each commit or merge meets all the Open Integrity requirements. For example, here’s a <code>git merge</code> alias:</p>
   <code>git merge feature-branch --verify-signatures \
    --require-author-signature \
    --require-committer-authorization
</code>   

<p>Defined Settings. Git allows settings for repos and workflows; securing these settings can improve the security of repos. <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Enforcing_Signed_Commits_And_PRs_GitHub.md">“Enforcing Signed Commits and Pull Request Requirements in GitHub”</a> describes how GitHub makes use of these settings; similar functionality is available elsewhere in the Git ecosystem.</p>

<p>Data Preservation. Logging, aliases, and settings together ensure the preservation of some data related to a merge. As the following commit shows, information such as an author’s key is preserved when a merge occurs, along with information that the committer verified the original signature.</p>
   <code>🔹 Commit: #fa34d76 [🔀 Merge Commit with Verified Author] (Signed ✅)
    ├─ Message: "Merge feature-branch: Added authentication layer"
    ├─ Committer: @c58XmWpL... (Charlie using Home PC &lt;charlie@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Author: @e83TkLqM... (Eve using Dev Machine &lt;eve@example.com&gt;)
    ├─ Author Signature: Verified ✓ (signed 2024-02-10T15:30:00Z)
    ├─ Committer Authorization: Verified ✓ (in allowed_signers since 2024-01-15)
    └─ Signatures stored: ./config/verification/signatures
</code>   
<p>The original author’s signature is not currently preserved due to the complexity of doing so. Working to preserve the signature without having to keep the branch around forever remains on the TODO list for Open Integrity.</p>

 Using Open Integrity Now 

<p>Open Integrity is available at the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject">OpenIntegrityProject repo</a>. Though it’s still in development, you can get started with it right now.</p>

<p>You should do so if you have a use case for Open Integrity such as:</p>

 
   You’re developing or releasing software through Git that holds sensitive information (such as a digital-asset wallet, a healthcare app, or even a web browser). 
   You’re developing or releasing software through Git that might be used by people or companies that also hold sensitive data (such as financial or medical companies), even if your app does not. 
   You’re developing or releasing software that requires any level of trust from its users. 
   You have a team of developers that changes over time. 
 

<p>The docs at the Open Integrity repo include a more extensive <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity_Problem_Statement.md">Problem Statement</a> that goes beyond what’s in this article, but the most important file might be the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/src/setup_git_inception_repo.sh">setup_git_inception_repo.sh</a> script, which will create a new Open Integrity repository for you. If you want to better understand how it works under the hood, see <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity-CLI_One_Liners.md">One Liners</a>, which also documents step-by-step how to setup and use an Open Integrity repo. Future plans can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/ROADMAP.md">Project Roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>Give it <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/blob/main/docs/Open_Integrity-CLI_One_Liners.md">a try</a>, and if you have questions, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntegrityProject/core/issues">open an issue</a> or <a href="https://github.com/orgs/OpenIntegrityProject/discussions">start a conversation</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on Open Integrity for about a year now. I started this work because I thought the promise of trust implicit in Git was extremely important for software design and release, but that it needed improvement. I hope you’ll agree and find the improvements worthwhile!</p>

<p>But that should not stop us from developing for it. Because what it specifies is laid out plainly in its PAR (Project Authorization Request):</p>
<blockquote><p>This draft standard covers contractual interactions and agreements between individuals and the service providers they engage on a network, including websites.</p>
<p>It describes how individuals, acting as first parties, can proffer their privacy requirements as contractual terms and arrive at agreements recorded and kept by both sides.</p>
<p>These terms shall be chosen from a collection of standard-form agreements in a roster kept by an independent and neutral non-business entity.</p>
<p>Computing devices and software performing as agents for both first and second parties shall engage using any protocol that serves the purpose.</p>
<p>The first party shall point to a preferred agreement, or a set of agreements, from which the second party shall accept one.</p>
<p>Party-to-party negotiations over terms in any of these contracts or other agreements are outside the scope of this standard. If both parties agree, the chosen contract or agreement shall be signed electronically by both parties or their agents.</p>
<p>A matching record shall be kept by both sides in a form that can be retrieved, audited, or disputed, if necessary, at some later time–and which is available to do so easily.*</p></blockquote>
<p>MyTerms does not specify what tech to use. It just says what needs to happen. This is to leave development as open as possible.</p>
<p>The main thing is that MyTerms obsolesces cookie notices by putting individuals in charge of their privacy requirements—and putting those requirements in the form of contracts, which individuals proffer as first parties.</p>
<p>Never mind that this hardly seems thinkable to the status quo. The same was once said of the Internet, the Web, email, and other free and open graces we take for granted today.</p>
<p>Putting each of us in charge of our privacy online is what makes MyTerms <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">the most important standard in development today</a>. But only if we make it so.</p>
<p>That’s what we’ll be working on tomorrow at <a href="https://vrmday2025a.eventbrite.com">VRM Day</a>—and through the following three days at <a href="https://iiworkshop.org">IIW</a>. VRM Day is free, and IIW is cheap as conferences go (and extremely leveraged). Both are at the <a href="https://computerhistory.org">Computer History Museum</a> in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>See you there.</p>
 
<p>*Shall is&nbsp; IEEE-speak for will or must. The purpose is to make clear that it does not mean&nbsp;should,&nbsp;could,&nbsp;or any other <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/modal%20auxiliary%20verb">modal auxiliary verb</a>.</p>

<p>Just days after Google confirmed it is bringing its next AI upgrade to Gmail,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/03/24/google-confirms-gmail-upgrade-3-billion-users-must-now-decide/">with major privacy implications</a>, there’s more good and bad news for the 3 billion users relying on Google to deliver secure, spam-free email to their phones and computers. It turns out that a dangerous email attack has operated under the radar for years — until now.</p>



<p>First to the good news. Google’s tightening restrictions on the mass delivery of spam emails to your inbox is working and it’s having a devastating impact on the industry spawned to plague you with marketing messages. “Over the last year,” website&nbsp;<a href="https://martech.org/apple-and-gmail-make-it-harder-for-email-campaigns-to-get-to-the-inbox/">MarTech</a>&nbsp;says the industry has seen “engagement rates (open and click rates, especially) drop considerably. Their emails only show up in the inboxes of people already engaging with the brand. For most subscribers, the emails are getting flagged as spam.”</p>

 Challenges and Risks in Microcredentialing Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>This is the sixth in a series of blog posts drawing on insights from a <a href="https://www.ndln.ie/new-learning-and-teaching-models">report authored by We Are Open Co-op</a> (WAO) for the Irish National Digital Leadership Network (NDLN). The report explores the historical roots of credentialing, the emergence of microcredentials, and the opportunities they present for reshaping education and professional development.</p><p>While microcredentials present exciting opportunities, their implementation comes with challenges that require careful consideration. Issues such as equity, quality assurance, and unintended consequences must be addressed to ensure these systems benefit learners, organisations, and society as a whole. WAO uses the lens of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a> to help address some of these challenges.</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-1-50b0fc77cd05">Part 1 — Introduction and&nbsp;Context</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-2-985ab20a1176">Part 2 — The Evolution of Credentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-3-c3c956c09574">Part 3 — Demystifying Microcredentials</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-4-4a0811255a00">Part 4 — Trends Shaping the Future of Microcredentials</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-5-fde07efdcbd2">Part 5 — The Role of Technology in Microcredentialing</a>  Part 6 — Challenges and Risks in Microcredentialing (this&nbsp;post)  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-7-4ce87debec12">Part 7 — A Vision for the Future of Microcredentials</a>   Equity and Accessibility <p>Microcredentials have the potential to widen participation in education, but they must be designed to include all learners. Organisations need to ensure their systems are accessible to users with diverse needs, including those with disabilities, limited digital literacies, or restricted access to technology.</p><p>Financial barriers also pose a challenge. For learners in marginalised communities, the cost of earning and using microcredentials could limit their accessibility. Subsidised or open-access credentialing models can help bridge this gap and make microcredentials a tool for inclusion rather than exclusivity. As can credentialing existing knowledge, skills, and behaviours, in accordance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_of_prior_learning">Recognition of Prior Learning</a>.</p> Quality Assurance and&nbsp;Trust <p>One of the most pressing challenges is ensuring that microcredentials maintain credibility and rigour. Open Badges provide a robust digital framework that ensures credentials can be verified and trusted, embedding metadata that describes the skills achieved, the criteria met, and the issuing organisation. This transparency builds trust among stakeholders, enabling credentials to be portable and interoperable across different platforms and contexts.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>However, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/building-credibility-into-digital-credentials-59945d07ace0">quality assurance</a> ultimately rests with the issuing organisation. It is their responsibility to ensure that criteria for earning the credential are clear, the evidence supporting the achievement is credible, and the learning experience is both meaningful and relevant. Aligning credentials with recognised national or international standards further enhances their credibility and utility, ensuring they meet the expectations of both learners and employers.</p> Avoiding Vendor&nbsp;Lock-In <p>The reliance on proprietary platforms for issuing and managing microcredentials can create significant risks. As mentioned in a prior post, vendor lock-in limits portability and learner control, undermining the principles of openness and inclusivity.</p><p>Adopting open standards, such as Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials, ensures that microcredentials are interoperable across systems. This not only protects learners but also encourages innovation by encouraging collaboration between organisations and technology providers.</p> Data Privacy and&nbsp;Security <p>Microcredentialing systems rely on digital platforms to issue, store, and share credentials, making data privacy and security critical concerns. Protecting the personal information of learners is both a legal and ethical responsibility.</p><p>Open Badges v3 offers solutions by enabling credentials to be controlled directly by learners. Features such as selective sharing ensure that individuals can decide what information to share and with whom. However, care must be taken to avoid systems that lock learners into proprietary platforms, restricting the portability of their achievements.</p> Unintended Consequences <p>Microcredentials can create new opportunities for recognition, but poorly designed systems may have unintended effects:</p>  Overloading learners with excessive or narrowly focused credentials can lead to “credential fatigue,” where the value of individual achievements is diminished.  Issuing credentials for specific skills or behaviours might inadvertently disadvantage those without them, regardless of their actual capabilities.  Systems that favour those with more resources, digital literacy, or prior access to credentialing risk perpetuating inequalities rather than addressing them.  <p>To avoid these pitfalls, microcredentialing systems should adopt <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a> principles, which aim to value diverse experiences and learning pathways. Recognising informal, community-based, and lived experiences alongside formal achievements can help ensure inclusivity.</p> Sector-Specific Challenges <p>Different sectors face unique challenges when adopting microcredentials:</p>  Charities — Struggle with limited resources to implement digital credentialing systems that are both accessible and effective.  NGOs — Face difficulties in ensuring that microcredentials are inclusive for the communities they serve, particularly in low-resource environments.  Co-ops — Need to balance member-driven governance models with the technical requirements of interoperable credentialing systems.  Businesses — Risk prioritising microcredentials that align only with short-term goals, neglecting broader workforce development needs.  Higher Education — Must address resistance from academic departments that may view microcredentials as a threat to traditional degree programmes.  <p>Each of these sectors brings its own priorities and constraints to the table, but many of the challenges share common threads. Limited resources, resistance to change, and technical hurdles can all undermine the successful implementation of microcredentials if not carefully managed. Recognising these shared difficulties can help inform more effective, cross-sector strategies.</p> Practical Steps for Addressing Challenges <p>To overcome these challenges, organisations need to adopt thoughtful and inclusive approaches that address both technical and systemic barriers.</p>  Collaborate on shared frameworks that not only ensure technical validity but also assess the clarity of criteria, credibility of evidence, and relevance of learning experiences. These frameworks build trust across institutions and sectors, making microcredentials more valuable and credible.  Use open standards like Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials to ensure that microcredentials are portable, secure, and learner-centred. These standards allow credentials to be recognised across platforms and contexts, giving learners more control over their achievements.  Focus on recognising diverse forms of learning, including informal, community-based, and experiential achievements. This approach ensures inclusivity and acknowledges the broad spectrum of skills and contributions individuals bring.  Continuously evaluate systems for equity and accessibility, addressing barriers such as financial constraints, digital literacy gaps, and platform design issues. By identifying and mitigating these challenges, organisations can expand participation and make microcredentials more inclusive.   Looking Ahead <p>Addressing these challenges requires thoughtful design, collaboration, and a commitment to inclusivity. By developing systems that prioritise accessibility, quality, and openness, organisations can harness the potential of microcredentials to empower learners and drive meaningful change.</p><p>In the final post of this series, we will explore a vision for the future of microcredentials, outlining actionable steps for organisations to integrate them into their strategies effectively.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-6-fe96ea9be396">Reframing Recognition: Part 6</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Energy Web, WattTime, and Green Software Foundation Unveil Open-Source Carbon-Aware Nomination to Green Decentralized Computing <p>Zug, Switzerland &amp; Oakland, CA — April 3, 2025 — Energy Web, a global nonprofit building open-source Web3 technologies for the energy transition, WattTime, an environmental tech nonprofit providing real-time grid emissions data, and the Green Software Foundation (GSF) today announced the launch of Carbon-Aware Nomination, an open-source system for scheduling computing workloads based on electricity carbon-intensity. This first-of-its-kind solution leverages GSF’s Carbon-Aware SDK, blockchain technology, and live emissions data from WattTime to ensure that applications run when and where power is cleanest, drastically reducing the carbon intensity of computing workloads.</p><p>A New Standard for Carbon-Aware Compute</p><p>Carbon-Aware Nomination combines Energy Web’s decentralized computing platform with WattTime’s Automated Emissions Reduction (AER) data feeds and GSF’s Carbon-Aware SDK, allowing any batch job or flexible workload to automatically “chase” the lowest-carbon energy available. Instead of running immediately or in a fixed location, a task can be delayed or relocated — for example, executing at night in a region with abundant wind energy — with the entire decision process orchestrated and verified on the Energy Web X blockchain. Unlike traditional cloud computing tools, this system provides cryptographic proof of the carbon emissions caused, giving enterprises and developers unprecedented transparency into the sustainability of their IT operations.</p><blockquote>“Our community has been looking for ways to cut IT emissions without sacrificing performance or trust,” said Mani Hagh Sefat, CTO of Energy Web. “Carbon-Aware Nomination delivers that by leveraging decentralization. By partnering with WattTime and integrating GSF’s Carbon-Aware SDK, we’re injecting the best real-time data into an open, trustless network of computing resources. The result is a game-changer — any organization can now ensure its workloads run with the lowest possible carbon impact, and they can prove it. We’re excited to open-source this tool and work with others to scale it up; this is about creating a new norm for green computing across the industry.”</blockquote><p>Collaboration Across Climate-Tech Innovators</p><p>WattTime’s leadership echoed the significance of this collaboration.</p><blockquote>“This partnership demonstrates how data and technology can come together to fight climate change in new domains,” said Gavin McCormick, WattTime co-founder and Executive Director. “Energy Web’s innovative use of our emissions intelligence, coupled with the Green Software Foundation’s Carbon-Aware SDK, ensures that even computing workloads can automatically prioritize clean energy. We’re thrilled to see Automated Emissions Reduction principles expanding into cloud and blockchain infrastructure. By giving organizations the power to run tasks when renewables are abundant, Carbon-Aware Nomination turns climate intention into&nbsp;action.”</blockquote><blockquote>The Green Software Foundation (GSF), which has been advancing sustainability in software development, also sees this as an important milestone. “GSF’s mission is to reduce the environmental impact of software, and integrating our Carbon-Aware SDK into decentralized compute systems represents a major step toward that goal,” said Asim Hussain, Executive Director of Green Software Foundation. “By working with Energy Web and WattTime, we’re proving that sustainability can be a core part of modern computing — measurable, verifiable, and open-source.”</blockquote><p>An Open-Source Future for Climate-Smart Computing</p><p>The Carbon-Aware Nomination system is fully open-source, with documentation and developer tools provided by Energy Web. Companies and developers can integrate it into cloud workflows, decentralized applications, or scheduling software to begin reducing the carbon emissions of their operations. Because the solution runs on a public blockchain, any sustainability claims are transparent and auditable by third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>This initiative also aligns with broader efforts by the tech sector to cut emissions: recent studies estimate that data centers and networks account for over 1% of global electricity use, and industry leaders are keen to mitigate this&nbsp;impact.</p><p>By launching Carbon-Aware Nomination in collaboration with WattTime and the Green Software Foundation, Energy Web aims to foster an ecosystem of climate-smart computing. The three organizations plan to engage cloud providers, enterprises, and researchers in adopting the approach. This joint effort showcases the power of cross-sector partnerships, bringing together blockchain-based decentralization, real-time environmental intelligence, and software-driven carbon-aware scheduling.</p><p>Energy Web, WattTime, and GSF invite interested partners to join the initiative, contribute to the open-source codebase, and collectively drive a new era of sustainable digital infrastructure.</p><p>About Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p>Energy Web is a software company developing open-source technologies to accelerate the energy transition. Its decentralized solutions leverage blockchain to create innovative market mechanisms, empowering energy companies, grid operators, and businesses worldwide. (<a href="http://www.energyweb.org">www.energyweb.org</a>)</p><p>About WattTime</p><p>WattTime is an environmental tech nonprofit that empowers all people, companies, policymakers, and countries to slash emissions and choose cleaner energy.

By making use of digital tools built on open standards, organisations can ensure that microcredentials are secure, meaningful, and accessible to learners across&nbsp;sectors.</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-1-50b0fc77cd05">Part 1 — Introduction and&nbsp;Context</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-2-985ab20a1176">Part 2 — The Evolution of Credentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-3-c3c956c09574">Part 3 — Demystifying Microcredentials</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-4-4a0811255a00">Part 4 — Trends Shaping the Future of Microcredentials</a>  Part 5 — The Role of Technology in Microcredentialing (this&nbsp;post)  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-6-fe96ea9be396">Part 6 — Challenges and Risks in Microcredentialing</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-7-4ce87debec12">Part 7 — A Vision for the Future of Microcredentials</a>   Open Standards: Making Credentials Portable and&nbsp;Trusted <p>One of the key technological foundations for microcredentials is the use of open standards. Open standards ensure that credentials can be shared and recognised across different systems, making them more portable and trustworthy.</p><p><a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F">Open Badges</a>, first introduced in 2011, set the stage for this revolution. These digital credentials provide important information, such as what the learner achieved, who issued the badge, and the criteria they met. The latest version, Open Badges v3, goes even further by aligning with a global framework called Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>This update brings several improvements:</p>  Learner Control — Credentials can now be managed by the individual rather than being tied to a single institution or platform.  No Mandatory Image — While the badge image remains a useful visual, the most important feature is the detailed information embedded in the credential, which helps employers and others verify it&nbsp;easily.  Rich Information — Microcredentials can now include deeper context about what was achieved, such as specific skills, the learning process, and connections to recognised frameworks or standards.  <p>These advancements make microcredentials more meaningful and usable, not just in local settings but internationally as&nbsp;well.</p> Digital Wallets: Empowering Learners <p>Digital wallets, sometimes referred to as ‘credential management’ apps, are a transformative tool for managing microcredentials. By storing credentials in a secure, user-controlled environment on their mobile device, learners gain full ownership of their achievements. This flexibility allows individuals to share only the information needed for specific opportunities, such as job applications or further study, while maintaining privacy.</p><p>For example, a learner could use their digital wallet to share a single credential with a potential employer, without needing to reveal unrelated personal details such as their age or gender. This approach protects privacy and gives learners greater control over how their achievements are presented.</p><p>Digital wallets also facilitate the portability of microcredentials, ensuring that they can be recognised across different contexts. For organisations, adopting digital wallet-compatible credentials demonstrates a commitment to learner-centric practices and enhances the usability of their offerings.</p> Sector-Specific Applications <p>Technology enables microcredentials to meet the unique needs of different sectors, enhancing their impact and relevance:</p>  Charities — Use digital badges to recognise volunteer contributions, fundraising efforts, and advocacy skills, providing participants with evidence of their&nbsp;impact.  NGOs — Leverage open standards to validate community workers’ skills and promote inclusivity in recognition practices.  Co-ops — Employ interoperable credentials to highlight informal learning and collaborative problem-solving within member-driven environments.  Businesses — Integrate microcredentials with existing professional development platforms to enhance employee upskilling and retention, focusing on sustainability or diversity goals.  Higher Education — Adopt technologies like digital wallets to make credentials earned through co-curricular activities or industry collaborations more accessible and portable for students.   Balancing Innovation with Responsibility <p>Technology offers new possibilities for recognising and showcasing skills, but its use must be carefully planned to avoid potential pitfalls. Challenges such as over-reliance on specific vendors, risks to data security, and barriers to access can undermine the effectiveness and fairness of microcredentialing systems.</p><p>To address these concerns:</p>  Adopt open-source and interoperable solutions — These reduce the risk of being locked into a single provider’s platform, ensuring flexibility and long-term sustainability.  Focus on accessibility — Systems should be designed to include users with a wide range of needs, enabling participation from all, regardless of ability or circumstance.  Prioritise data security and privacy — Organisations must implement robust measures to protect sensitive user information, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and building trust among learners and stakeholders.  <p>By taking a responsible approach, organisations can ensure that their microcredentialing efforts are not only innovative but also equitable, secure, and adaptable for the&nbsp;future.</p> Looking Ahead <p>Technology is more than just a way to expand microcredentials — it is reshaping how learning is recognised and valued. By using approaches built on open standards, organisations can create microcredentialing systems that are secure, accessible to everyone, and focused on the needs of learners.</p><p>In the next post, we will explore the challenges and risks associated with microcredentialing, including how to address equity, quality assurance, and unintended consequences.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-5-fde07efdcbd2">Reframing Recognition: Part 5</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Specialists from different fields in the digital identity ecosystem have shed light on what it takes to be accredited for New Zealand’s Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF). They shared their thoughts during a webinar on March 26 moderated by the Executive Director of Digital Identity New Zealand, Colin Wallis, during which they also explained details about the process and the benefits that come with the accreditation.</p>



<p>The DISTF in New Zealand is a legal framework designed to regulate digital identity services as the country looks to expand its digital ID services. New rules and accreditation system of the DISTF&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/new-zealand-finalizes-digital-identity-services-trust-framework">took effect</a>&nbsp;last November.</p>



<p>The objective of the webinar dubbed “DISTF Evaluators Showcase” was to provide an opportunity for those considering a DISTF accreditation to have an understanding of its advantages for small and large scale entities, organizational roles, costs and time frames, and the preparation process for the evaluation of compliance with standards which precedes the accreditation application.</p>



<p>Discussants included security consultant at Middleware Group,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-norcliffe-2646061/">Tom Norcliffe</a>; Director of Cyber, Privacy and Resilience at Deloitte which is an accredited evaluator,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-bossert-02186b11/">Marcus Bossert</a>; and Founder of Cianaa Technologies,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cianaatech/">Rizwan Ahmad</a>, who are all&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity New Zealand</a>&nbsp;members. There was also the Regulatory Practice Manager of New Zealand’s Department of Internal Affairs,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deanne-myers-746628a7/">Deanne Myers</a>.</p>



<p>The first three speakers took time off to make an introduction of their companies, highlighting their services and key projects across the domains of digital identity and cybersecurity. They also mentioned some of their projects in New Zealand and the institutions they work with.</p>



<p>Bossert, for a start, explained the work Deloitte as a consultancy services firm is doing in the digital security assessment space. He mentioned that the firm offers services in cyber strategy, transformation, digital privacy, trust, and enterprise security, application cloud security, emerging technology solutions, threat detection and response, as well as operational security services. He also said that they have worked extensively on digital identity projects.</p>



<p>He said evaluation for the DISTF accreditation process looks at several factors including enterprise security, cloud security, security and resilience mechanisms, and threat detection and response, among others. The official also explained that the firm plays a significant role in guiding organizations through the accreditation process, helping them to align their cybersecurity and privacy expertise in order to ensure successful transactions.</p>



 Accreditation not a mere compliance formality 



<p>The accreditation, he insisted, is not just for the purposes of compliances but is something that enables entities demonstrate robust security practices which are vital for building confidence and trust among stakeholders such as boards, customers, and even regulators.</p>



<p>“If you think about why you want to get accredited, you’ve got to think about the stakeholders that are involved in this. But fundamentally, you have to think about it from a more practical and operational perspective as well,” Bossert said.</p>



<p>“Security, privacy, development and operations teams are really interested in knowing that you have solid security practices built in. It is quite valuable for them to understand and have clarity on what the control measures are. So, I see the accreditation process as a mechanism to build confidence that your stakeholders need,” he stated.</p>



<p>“[Thanks to] the work that we do, our knowledge and global network, we can help you accelerate readiness and navigate the shortest path to success, so that we help you focus on those things that really matter, get your accreditation and accelerate operational readiness.”</p>



<p>For his part, Norcliffe from Middleware Group emphasized the importance of the digital ID trust framework, saying it is crucial for most of the work they are doing with government entities and the private sector in New Zealand.</p>



<p>Taking the floor, Ahmad said Cianaa Technologies has a framework on which their team of independent security evaluators offer services which include penetration testing, privacy, and GDPR compliance.</p>



<p>“We assess organizations based on this [framework]. We see whether you’re keeping the information confidential, whether you have the integrity intact, whether your services are available, whether it has non-repetition, and if it has the proper authentication authorization,” he said.</p>



<p>“Now, when we assess your organization based on that, it actually automatically gives up to the right assessment, because if something is missing, then there’s something missing in security.”</p>



 Overview of accreditation application process 



<p>Myers said the team she manages is responsible for basically all aspects of the accreditation process. She gave an overview of components of the application process required by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dia.govt.nz/Trust-Framework-Authority">Trust Framework Authority</a>&nbsp;(TFA), noting that the entire process is transparent.</p>



<p>“We receive and assess applications for accreditation as a trust framework provider. We monitor ongoing compliance with the requirements of accreditation, assess applications for renewal, and obviously deal with any issues that arise in the course of these processes.”</p>



<p>She explained that a part of the application process requires results of an independent evaluation undertaken by independent evaluators, including a conformance assessment against the New Zealand identification standards. “Those outputs or deliverables will be submitted as part of an application,” she stated.</p>



<p>“There are currently 15 independent security evaluators who have been appointed and three privacy independent evaluators. However, we are currently undertaking an expression of interest process, calling for interest from other agencies who are able and who meet the criteria to be appointed as either a privacy or security evaluator, or both.”</p>



<p>Myers also shared important links and resources which can help those seeking accreditation to better understand what is required of them and how they can go through the process successfully. She also said the application would need to be submitted within 12 months of the standards compliance evaluation.</p>



 Understand what you need 



<p>The speakers also noted the place of AI in the trust framework evaluation process. Ahmad said while the technology can make a positive contribution to the process, it can also bring about challenges that effect these assessments.</p>



<p>Bossert added that those applying for accreditation must clearly understand what they need, and often, they expect the process to be as quick, painless and cost-effective as possible.</p>



<p>“If you’ve ever done something like an ISO accreditation, you would understand or know that it is very useful to be clear on the scope of accreditation that you’re looking for. So don’t apply for accreditation for areas that you don’t need. For example, if you’re not going to be providing personal information, then don’t sign up for accreditation for that,” he advised.</p>



<p>He also said for evaluators to have their work made easy, those seeking to provide trust services must take certain key factors into consideration, including having the right control and risk management mechanisms in place.</p>



<p>“I would suggest that you have a look at your solution and do a proper risk assessment early on so that you’ve got visibility of those risks and that you can start building in the necessary controls. In terms of risks, if you can demonstrate that you’re actively managing them and you have visibility and control, then that certainly helps to give the confidence needed.”</p>



<p>The aspect of pricing for the evaluation process was also addressed, with the speakers saying the process can range, approximately, from between $10,000 and $50,000, depending on the scope and the level of preparedness of the entity to be evaluated.</p>

<p></p>      First Web3 Global Battery Passport Implementation for Current and Future Regulatory Compliance           <p>Phase I of the Global Battery Passport System Demonstrated Product Traceability with Privacy-Preserving Capabilities and Selective Data Disclosure</p>
          <p>Los Angeles—31 March 2025: MOBI, a nonprofit Web3 consortium of global industry leaders, announces the successful completion of the first year in its three-year initiative to build the Global Battery Passport System (GBPS). This milestone marks a significant step in creating a secure, Self-Sovereign Identity and Data framework for seamless data spaces interoperability and digital product passports. MOBI is actively <a href="https://dlt.mobi/interoperability-pilot/">demonstrating data spaces interoperability</a> with other global consortia such as Gaia-X. While the GBPS initiative focuses on battery data exchange as its use case, the underlying technology is agnostic and can be leveraged to enhance trust, compliance, and operational efficiency for all digital transactions and traceability.</p>
<p>MOBI GBPS initiative is being spearheaded by members of the Circular Economy and the Global Battery Passport (CE-GBP) Working Group, including Anritsu, DENSO, HIOKI, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Orico, Suzuki, and TradeLog.</p>
<p>During Phase I, which took place from January to December 2024, working group members concentrated on evaluating global battery regulatory requirements and developing use cases aligned with Web3 technology for secure data exchange and management. Critically, implementers successfully launched and ran nodes on the federated<a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/"> Integrated Trust Network </a>(ITN), a member-built and operated registry for World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The ITN provides the core trust services of governance, authority, identity, and assurance to enable verifiable transactions between <a href="https://dlt.mobi/ssdi/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twins</a> (user agents) whose DIDs are anchored in the ITN.</p>
<p>Building on the success of Phase I, MOBI and its partners are now advancing to Phase II. In Phase II, implementers will leverage ITN core services to test transactions within the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/citopia/">Citopia Decentralized Marketplace</a> (DM). Anticipated technical achievements in Phase II include Web3 ecosystem onboarding, asset ownership traceability, secure data exchange, and Apps building with Citopia DM.</p>
<p>The GBPS shall operate as a specialized user-controlled application within Citopia DM, which supports secure communication, transactions, and data sharing across industries with zero-knowledge proofs. Citopia DM provides the interoperability and data sovereignty that Web3 ecosystems and value chains require. Through this setup, the GBPS shall offer a privacy-focused solution that protects proprietary information and promotes circularity in line with current and future regulations, while serving as a robust foundation for use-case-specific applications rooted in trusted and verifiable battery data, such as:</p>
 
 management of battery passports, 
 used electric vehicle (EV) pricing, 
 green financing and carbon credits, 
 charging management, and more. 
 
<p>While most battery passport solutions focus on public data disclosure, Citopia GBPS emphasizes secure sharing of proprietary data. The GBPS leverages zero trust architecture and selective data disclosure, where only relevant information is shared with intended recipients. This privacy-centric design facilitates regulatory compliance while safeguarding sensitive data, reducing the need for intermediaries and enhancing trust across value chains, creating a Web3 system for data spaces interoperability across borders and stakeholders.</p>
<p>“As current and future regulations develop, solutions like the ITN and Citopia DM are essential for addressing industry and regulatory needs. MOBI is proud to work with our members in developing a solution that is agnostic to existing data spaces along with Web2&lt;&gt;Web3 interoperability to support business objectives in creating a more secure digital future and meeting circular economy goals,” said Tram Vo, CEO and Co-founder of MOBI.</p>
<p>“A global battery passport system has the potential to unlock new levels of traceability, transparency and security in battery-related applications, supporting our efforts to contribute to greener and safer mobility,” said Roger Berg, vice president of North America Research and Development at DENSO. “While that’s an important goal for our team, this solution also represents more than that. It’s a great example of how MOBI and our fellow members are working together to support a more circular economy and sustainable world.”</p>
<p>“The second stage of Phase I has provided further valuable insights to CE-GBP WG partners. In Stage 1, the basic data sharing environment was established. In Stage 2, the first business-related technical capabilities were explored, such as the ownership management of a DID-based asset and the selective disclosure of data between two organizations,” said Christian Köbel of Honda. “These successful learnings have encouraged us to further explore the potential of a self-sovereign data ecosystem to address future challenges of the circular economy.”</p>
<p>“The functionality of DIDs and Verifiable Credentials for reliable data federation among implementing companies has been successfully verified, utilizing the Integrated Trust Network. This endeavor not only demonstrates the potential of these technologies to enhance data federation but also emphasizes the constructive and agile collaboration achieved among implementers within the cooperative framework.” said Yusuke Zushi, Senior Manager at Nissan.</p>
<p>“In Phase 1 of the Global Battery Passport (GBP) system demonstration, we learned that the MOBI GBP can be used to exchange highly confidential information. We want to thank everyone involved in Phase 1,” said implementers at Mazda Motor Corporation.</p>
<p>Said Hisashi Matsumoto of Anritsu, “MOBI’s activities have led to the successful completion of Phase I, moving towards building an ecosystem that enables reliable and secure information exchange. We are grateful to have participated in the verification of use cases with practical operations. We hope that MOBI’s efforts will continue to contribute to a more sustainable circular economy.”</p>
<p>“We are very proud of the great results of Phase I which we have achieved based on our strong relationships with major OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, and more. It has been an exciting and interesting experience to work with such talented people. We will continue to take on challenges in Phase II in the name of collaboration,” said Alvin Ishiguro, Project Coordination at TradeLog, Inc.</p>
<p>MOBI and its members are committed to driving a future where collaborative, decentralized technologies foster innovation and transparency across industries.</p>

This post examines key trends shaping their future and explores how these developments are driving change across sectors. Our guiding concept in this is <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Open Recognition</a> which encourages organisations to think more holistically about the knowledge, skills, and behaviours they seek to&nbsp;promote.</p> Skills-Based Hiring <p>One of the most influential trends is the growing emphasis on hiring based on specific skills rather than traditional qualifications. Employers are increasingly seeking candidates with demonstrable competencies that align with their organisational needs. Microcredentials provide a structured way to validate these skills in a way that is transparent and verifiable.</p><p>For organisations, skills-based hiring supported by microcredentials allows for more inclusive recruitment practices, reducing reliance on traditional proxies like degrees. However, to succeed, microcredentials must be recognised as credible and portable, ensuring they meet the expectations of both employers and job seekers. This means they should be built on open standards such as <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/What_Are_Open_Badges%3F">Open&nbsp;Badges</a>.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO Stackable Learning&nbsp;Pathways <p>The modular nature of microcredentials enables learners to build their qualifications incrementally, creating personalised pathways. This approach is particularly valuable for individuals balancing education with work or other commitments. Stackable credentials also align with the concept of lifelong learning, allowing learners to upskill or reskill as needed throughout their&nbsp;careers.</p><p>Aligning microcredentials with national or international qualification frameworks can enhance their value and portability, ensuring that learners can seamlessly combine credentials from different institutions or sectors. This alignment also supports employers and other organisations in recognising and valuing these credentials across diverse contexts. By working in collaboration, stakeholders can create systems that not only validate individual achievements but also enable progression and opportunity, therefore creating a connected and inclusive learning ecosystem.</p> The Role of Open Standards <p>The adoption of open standards, such as Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials, is critical to the future of microcredentials. These standards ensure that credentials are portable, secure, and interoperable across systems. By making use of metadata, they provide detailed information such as the knowledge, skills, and/or behaviours validated, the criteria met, and the issuing organisation. It may also include any endorsements made by individuals and organistions, further enhancing the value of the microcredential.</p><p>Open standards also facilitate the integration of microcredentials into digital wallets, meaning individuals can store and share their achievements easily. This approach empowers learners to take ownership of their credentials while ensuring transparency and&nbsp;trust.</p> Technology and Innovation <p>Emerging technologies are transforming how microcredentials are issued, managed, and verified. For example, Artificial intelligence (AI) is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmLP5c8jng">being used to map skills</a> and recommend personalised learning pathways.</p><p>However, these technologies must be implemented responsibly. Issues such as data privacy, ethical AI use, and accessibility must be addressed to ensure that technological advancements benefit all learners and do not exacerbate existing inequalities.</p> Collaboration Across&nbsp;Sectors <p>The success of microcredentials depends on collaboration between education providers, employers, policymakers, and technology developers. These partnerships can ensure that microcredentials remain relevant and aligned with industry needs while encouraging innovation in how learning is recognised.</p><p>For example, microcredentials can be used&nbsp;to::</p>  Charities — Recognise skills gained through volunteer work, fundraising activities, and advocacy campaigns, enabling participants to showcase their contributions effectively.  NGOs — Validate the skills of community workers and volunteers, making their contributions visible and&nbsp;valued.  Co-ops — Highlight informal learning and collaboration, supporting shared growth and innovation among&nbsp;members.  Businesses — Align microcredentials with organisational values, such as sustainability or diversity, to enhance staff development and retention.  Higher Education — Partner with businesses to design credentials for emerging fields like green technology or AI ethics, and create opportunities for targeted, stackable learning pathways.   Looking Ahead <p>The trends shaping microcredentials reflect a shift towards more flexible, inclusive, and skills-focused education systems. By embracing open standards, leveraging technology, and fostering collaboration, organisations can unlock the full potential of microcredentials to meet the needs of learners and&nbsp;society.</p><p>In the next post, we’ll explore the role of technology in greater depth, examining the digital tools and frameworks that underpin modern microcredentialing systems.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/reframing-recognition-part-4-4a0811255a00">Reframing Recognition: Part 4</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>A Farewell Message<br><br>This is the final DINZ newsletter under my watch, but if the writing style seems familiar in April’s newsletter you’ll know that AI has been deployed or my successor hasn’t been fully onboarded&nbsp;.<br><br>It’s been a blast, it really has! I’m satisfied with DINZ’s development under my tenure. No regrets. DINZ has punched way above its weight with minimal resources – only made possible by larger organisations whose support enabled volunteer members and supporters from organisations of all sizes to dedicate time and expertise to deliver our mahi on its&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/about/">mission</a>. You know who you are, so thank you!&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks also to the DINZ Executive Councils I have served over the years. It’s a largely unheralded gig, but governance in emerging ecosystems is crucial.<br><br>DINZ Updates</p>



 
 The&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/biometrics-special-interest-group-sig/">DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group</a>&nbsp;submitted again on the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2025/03/DINZ_Submission_on_Biometrics_Code_of_Practice_March_2025-CW-signed.pdf">Biometrics Code of Practice</a>&nbsp;this month. Neither DINZ or NZTech are supportive of the code at this time, instead advocating for expert prepared Guidance to improve biometrics implementation best practice for all stakeholders, including privacy specialists who may not necessarily be biometric experts. 



 By the time you read this, our webinar&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/distf-evaluators-showcase/">‘Meet the DISTF Evaluators’&nbsp;</a>will be underway with over 100 registrations – the first educational session on this aspect of the regime as DINZ members enter the final week of&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/educational-resources/">free access to InformDI’s 7 Chapters DISTF online education suite.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; 



 DINZ members&nbsp;please complete the DISTF survey emailed to you by 14 April. 



 The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/our-work/next-generation-payments/">Next Gen Payments Consultation</a>&nbsp;from DINZ member PaymentsNZ is due this Friday, so get yours in today!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 



<p><br>Industry Insights<br><br>There are some ‘green shoots’ appearing in Aotearoa New Zealand’s digital identity space, but we have years of catch-up ahead to regain our global leadership. We have to be more nimble, smart and collegial in all dimensions (detailed examples too much for the newsletter’s word count), but suffice to say that it’s Kiwi companies like MATTR, Authsignal, JNCTN, APLYiD, MyMahi and others that keep us on the map globally.<br><br>While taking more leisure time, I’m open to some advisory work leveraging my decades of knowledge, experience and contact networks in both local and international settings not often possible in this role.&nbsp;<br><br>What’s Happening Around the Globe<br><br>As always, I’m sharing links to global news that resonated with me.</p>

 OI forms a major plank of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.getverified.co.nz/">Get Verified</a>&nbsp;in the payments world but there are other worlds of course.

<p>The <a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen/rss-feeds/nach-dienststellen/alle-mitteilungen.msg-id-103879.html">media release</a> is an official statement by the Swiss Federal Government announcing the strategic direction and implementation steps for digital identity and trust infrastructure.</p>
<p>On 21 January 2025, the Swiss Federal Office of Justice (FOJ), in collaboration with the Federal Chancellery and the Federal Office of Information Technology and Telecommunications (FOITT), published an important <a>statement on the future of digital identity and trust infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p>As DIDAS – the Swiss association for digital trust – we are proud to have actively contributed to this milestone. Through constructive consultation, cross-sector collaboration and the sharing of insights from our community, we helped shape the direction of this foundational work. A special thank you goes to our co-authors and all those who support this joint effort.</p>
<p>Digital trust infrastructure – such as the E-ID, verifiable credentials, and interoperable wallets – is essential for the digital resilience and competitiveness of Switzerland. These are not just technological building blocks, but key enablers of a sovereign, secure and citizen-centric digital society.</p>
<p>This milestone also directly connects with the recently published vision by FIND and the State Secretariat for International Finance (SIF):<br>👉 <a href="https://find.swiss/announcements/pathway-2035-for-financial-innovation">Pathway 2035: Unlocking Financial Innovation for Switzerland</a></p>
<p>The message is clear: Switzerland’s ability to lead in financial innovation depends on a trusted digital foundation. At DIDAS, we are committed to&nbsp;enabling&nbsp;this foundation – bringing together policy, technology, and ecosystem actors to reduce friction, build interoperability, and establish trust by design.</p>
<p>Because in the end, Digital Trust is not a nice-to-have – it is a strategic imperative for Switzerland’s future.</p>
<p>Digital Trust is now firmly positioned on Switzerland’s strategic, political, and economic agenda.</p>

<p>At ISL we pride ourselves on being dispassionate truth-seekers when it comes to assessing risky behaviors in technology. But this moment in history requires expressing our passion for truth and our core values more openly.</p>
<p>What’s currently happening in the US is, by design, disruptive, disorienting, and discouraging for many. The calculated dehumanizing of trans people and immigrants coupled with the TESCREAL eugenics AI agenda elucidated by Timnit Gebru<a>1</a>  foretells a worrying, broader dehumanization campaign ahead. As does the ongoing systematic removal and censorship of any kind of diversity, trans rights or related language on government sites. These actions inexorably lead to the detention and removal of targeted people, which, sadly, has begun.</p>
<p>This moment calls for pausing, ignoring the external chaos and looking within, to our own guiding north stars and speaking out for the values within us that reflect deep truths. Deep truths such as: love and celebration of diversity being vital for both humankind’s and the planet’s survival; it’s certainly vital for the work that we do every day at ISL.</p>
<p>Diversity, equity, and inclusivity are the way. Any other exclusionary, reductive, oppressive, dehumanizing way is antithetical to the truths of human kinship and interdependence and denies the reality that healthy ecosystems need diversity to sustain and thrive.</p>
<p>ISL exposes safety risks inherent in tech when used as intended. In other words, we’ve been establishing reasonable safety standards for the behavior of software-driven products and services. But how can we contemplate “safety” without the necessary question: “for whom?”</p>
<p>Many people think that ISL is solely focused on the safety of tech used by children. It may surprise you to know that that’s not our mission. It’s the brunt of our currently funded work, but our corporate vision is:</p>
<p>“A world where all digital products are safe for humans and humankind.”</p>
<p>In other words, safety for all. </p>
<p>I take this moment to reaffirm ISL’s commitment to prioritizing and fostering conditions to create a truly diverse, inclusive, and equitable organization.</p>

 <p>Recent developments in the UK have once again highlighted the importance of user-controlled encryption for protecting personal data. Due to government demands in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617273/apple-removes-encryption-advanced-data-protection-adp-uk-spying-backdoor?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Apple has recently announced</a> that they have stopped offering end-to-end encrypted iCloud storage, Advanced Data Protection (ADP), to new users, and will disable the feature to all users in the country at an unknown point in the future.</p><p>What does this mean for you?&nbsp;</p><p>In the short term it means that UK user data is less protected, and potentially vulnerable to misuse or breaches. Without end-to-end encryption (E2EE), data stored in iCloud is accessible to Apple and, by extension, potentially to government agencies and bad actors. In the long term it sets a dangerous precedent that Apple can turn off this crucial security feature for any group of users at any time, raising concerns about digital privacy worldwide.</p><p>What can we do about it?</p><p>The answer is relatively simple, we need to encrypt our own data.&nbsp;</p><p>Relying on a third party to keep our personal data safe — even big names like Apple, Amazon, or Microsoft — will always carry risk. Policies change, and external governmental pressures can force providers to weaken security measures, leaving the user exposed.</p><p>By layering End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) on cloud storage services ourselves, we can ensure that our data is protected from unwanted access, even from the storage services themselves (in case they want to mine the content of our data).</p><p>And the best part? We can do it for free by using DIDComm!</p><p>What is DIDComm?</p><p>One powerful and open-source solution for encrypting data before cloud storage is the <a href="https://didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm</a> protocol. Hosted by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), DIDComm provides a secure, private communication methodology built on Decentralized Identifiers (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDs</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>When used to establish an end-to-end encrypted channel, DIDComm ensures that only essential delivery metadata remains in plaintext, while everything else — including the body, attachments, etc — is encrypted for intended recipients only. In practice, this means that we can use the DIDComm message format to encrypt files as they are prepared to be synchronized from a local folder to the cloud storage service and ensures that only the intended recipient (you) can access them.</p><p>How to use DIDComm for cloud encryption</p><p>Steve McCown, Chief Architect at Anonyome Labs, was the first to create a practical method for encrypting files with DIDComm before storing them into the cloud. His recent <a href="https://github.com/mccown/protecting-cloud-storage?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">GitHub release</a> provides a thorough breakdown of how it all works and offers a step-by-step guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For those looking to dive deeper,&nbsp;</p>  Join one of our upcoming DIDComm <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-usergroup/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">user group calls</a>   Join the discussion on <a href="https://discord.gg/eNN4Wns6Jb?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF’s Discord</a> in the #didcomm-user-group channel

<p><a href="https://thepaypers.com/search/index.aspx?search=Fime">Fime</a>’s testing laboratories in both EMEA and Taiwan have obtained full accreditation under the&nbsp;<a href="https://thepaypers.com/search/index.aspx?search=FIDO+Alliance&amp;area=r&amp;ct=r">FIDO Alliance</a>&nbsp;Identity Verification (IDV) Certification Programme.</p>



<p>This certification allows the company to assess and validate identity verification vendors’ Document Authenticity and Face Verification solutions, contributing to fraud prevention efforts while ensuring compliance with industry standards.</p>



 Growing concerns over deepfakes drive standardisation&nbsp; 



<p>The introduction of FIDO’s IDV Programme comes in the context of increasing concerns about AI-driven fraud. According to the official press release, despite over 70 billion digital identity verification checks conducted in 2024, more than half of users remain worried about the risks posed by deepfakes and other fraudulent activities. The programme establishes a unified accreditation process to ensure remote identity verification solutions are secure and resistant to manipulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A representative from Fime stated that remote identity verification is essential for sectors such as banking and digital ID enrolment, given the rapid advancements in deepfake technology. The official highlighted the importance of FIDO IDV Certification in helping service providers ensure that their vendors deliver reliable, validated solutions capable of protecting users and mitigating risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Officials from the FIDO Alliance emphasised that the certification programme is designed to strengthen security during onboarding and enrolment processes. They noted that, alongside biometric component certification, this initiative aims to reduce reliance on traditional passwords while enhancing security and user experience.</p>

<p>Enterprises understand the value of passkeys for workforce sign-ins. Most decision makers (87%) report deploying passkeys at their companies. Of these, 47% report rolling out a mix of device-bound passkeys (on physical security keys and/or cards) and synced passkeys (synced securely across the user’s devices).</p>



<p>Organizations are prioritizing passkey rollouts to users with access to sensitive data and applications, including the three most commonly cited priority groups: Those requiring access to IP (39%), users with admin accounts (39%), and users at the executive level (34%). Organizations leverage communication, training, and documentation within these deployments to increase adoption.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/06/20/julianna-lamb-stytch-passwordless-authentication-methods/">Passkey deployments</a>&nbsp;are linked to significant security and business benefits. Respondents report moderate to strong positive impacts on user experience (82%), security (90%), help center call reduction (77%), productivity (73%), and digital transformation goals (83%).</p>



<p>Groups that do not have active passkey projects cite complexity (43%), costs (33%), and lack of clarity (29%) about implementation as reasons. This signals a need for increased education for enterprises on rollout strategies to reduce concerns, as there is a correlation between these perceived challenges and the proven benefits of passkeys.</p>

<p>Major technology companies Microsoft, Google, and Apple are driving widespread adoption of passkeys as an alternative to traditional passwords, leveraging biometric authentication methods like facial recognition and fingerprint scanning for enhanced security and user convenience. The initiative builds on the&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/microsoft-announces-shift-from-passwords-to-passkeys-for-enhanced-security/">FIDO Alliance standards</a>&nbsp;that these companies have been developing since 2019.</p>



<p>The initiative, which began with a joint announcement by the three tech giants in 2022, has now reached full implementation across all major platforms. Users can access passkey functionality through their devices’ built-in biometric systems, enabling seamless authentication across various services and applications. Microsoft has recently announced plans to&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/microsoft-to-replace-passwords-with-passkeys-for-1-billion-users-amid-200-surge-in-cyberattacks/">implement passkeys for over one billion users</a>&nbsp;in response to a 200 percent increase in cyberattacks.</p>

 &nbsp;FIDO as the Future of Authentication:&nbsp;Traditional password-based systems are vulnerable to phishing, credential stuffing, and other cyberattacks. FIDO (Fast Identity Online) uses public key cryptography to deliver phishing-resistant, passwordless authentication. 



 Implementation Roadmap:&nbsp;Organizations should assess current authentication methods, educate stakeholders, select FIDO-compatible solutions, and roll out the technology gradually to maximize security and user adoption. 



 Security Meets Usability:&nbsp;FIDO enhances security and simplifies the user experience with biometrics, hardware tokens, and multi-device passkeys, offering both protection and convenience.

<p>Do you think your trusty 8-character password is safe? In the age of AI, that might be wishful thinking. Recent advances in artificial intelligence are giving hackers superpowers to crack and steal account credentials. Researchers have demonstrated that AI can accurately&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/08/ai-could-identify-passwords-by-sound-of-keys-being-pressed-study-suggests">guess passwords just by listening to your keystrokes</a>.

<p>And AI-driven password cracking tools can run millions of guess attempts lightning-fast, often defeating weak passwords in minutes. It is no surprise, then, that stolen or weak passwords contribute to about 80% of breaches​.</p>



<p>The old password model has outlived its usefulness. As cyber threats get smarter, it is time for consumers to do the same.</p>

<p>Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping the Internet, driving a historic transformation in how we engage, work, and communicate online.</p><p>However, the rise of generative AI has also led to an explosion of deepfakes, hallucinating language models, and the rapid creation of untrustworthy content — threatening the foundation of authentic communication and learning. AI-generated content now dominates the internet, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish reality from fabrication.</p><p>While AI unlocks significant advancements, it also introduces equally substantial risks, from intellectual property infringements to illegal content, such as child sexual abuse materials.</p><p>It is for this reason, we founded umanitek.</p><p>At umanitek, our mission is to fight against harmful content and the risks of AI by promoting technology that serves the greater good of humanity.</p><p>Our founders, Trace Labs, Ethical Capital Partners and AMYP Ventures AG (part of a Piëch/Porsche Family Office) bring together their capabilities in building reliable and trusted AI systems, their connection to networks that fight for the removal of internet harm, and their ability to raise awareness of the importance of knowledge and education in the age of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>But this is too big of a challenge to go at it alone. Recognizing the magnitude of this issue, we actively seek partnerships with institutions and individuals dedicated to ethical AI development. We want to partner with investors who are focused on “tech for good” solutions where societal impact is of equal importance to commercial success and to work with tech leaders, policymakers, and law enforcement to make internet safety the standard in the age of&nbsp;AI.</p> Balancing innovation with responsibility in the age of&nbsp;AI. <p>Our vision is to leverage umanitek’s technology to enable corporations and individuals to control their data, technology, and resources without compromising security, privacy, or intellectual property.</p><p>Here’s but one quick example of how umanitek will&nbsp;work.</p><p>Far too many people are concerned about the non-consensual sharing of their personal images or those of their children. Umanitek will enable companies, law enforcement, NGOs, and individuals to upload “fingerprints” of personal photos to a decentralized directory. This system will help large technology platforms identify and prevent the distribution of such&nbsp;content.</p><p>In the potential next step, it also significantly streamlines the prosecution of offenders by collaborating with law enforcement while reducing the cost and complexity of legal action related to copyright infringements.</p><p>When organizations and individuals can choose what to share and how to share it in a secure and verifiable way, all internet users benefit. Protecting legitimate content and preventing large language models from training on non-consensual data are integral to harm reduction online. We believe this is an important step to making internet safety the standard in the age of AI, reducing harmful content, and enabling trusted AI solutions.</p><p>Fighting the good&nbsp;fight.</p><p>“We invested in OriginTrail to drive transparency and trust for real-world assets.

Here’s how Energy Web’s Digital Spine can&nbsp;help <p>The International Energy Agency recently released two reports: <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/0f028d5f-26b1-47ca-ad2a-5ca3103d070a/Electricity2025.pdf">its annual Electricity 2025</a> analysis and a discussion of current <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/6fbf940a-d4e8-4156-b8e0-07c2f793c094/BuildingtheFutureTransmissionGrid.pdf">challenges in grid investment</a>. These documents describe two key aspects of the global energy transition: global demand for electricity is increasing, and new renewables (including distributed energy resources) are expected to be the greatest contributor to new supply that meets it. If you dig a bit deeper, you can also see why the electricity system needs a Digital Spine, Energy Web’s solution to optimize grid flexibility and unlock the potential of&nbsp;DERs.</p> The energy transition continues <p>The IEA forecasts “soaring” electricity demand over the next three years. Most of this increase will occur in developing economies, but advanced economies are expected to see increasing demand as well, driven by electric vehicle adoption, new air conditioners, heat pumps, and (especially in the U.S.) new data&nbsp;centers.</p><p>This new demand will be met by new low-carbon generation. The IEA expects fully half of the new demand to be met by solar PV, the cost of which continues to&nbsp;decline.</p> But progress increases complexity <p>It is undoubtedly excellent news that low-carbon generation will meet new demand, but the IEA cautions that power systems need to further adapt to the changing fuel mix on our grids. A combination of traditional thermal plants that are relatively inflexible, new renewable generation that is variable, and new demand patterns (e.g., more air conditioning demand on hot days and more electric vehicle charging on workday evenings) result in higher volatility in power&nbsp;markets.</p><p>We already see these impacts. The Electricity 2025 report describes the increasing incidence of negative prices in wholesale electricity markets, which occurs when supply outsizes demand so significantly that market-clearing prices fall below zero. This can happen for any number of reasons, but as the energy transition continues we would expect to see it happen more frequently in areas where afternoon solar generation could far exceed air conditioning demand (think massive amounts of rooftop and utility-scale solar) or overnight wind generation is greater than nearby transmission capacity.</p><p>Negative pricing events are most common in the regions of the world that are furthest along the energy transition, including Australia, California, and Texas (three places with very high solar PV or Wind penetration).</p>Percentage of negative hourly wholesale electricity prices in selected regions, 2019–2024 (IEA)<p>Negative price events are not in themselves a problem; however, they are noteworthy because they suggest real challenges in power system operations, which will only increase as the energy transition continues.</p> Physical infrastructure improvements will be insufficient <p>One strategy to address these challenges is to increase investments in electric grids. This means increasing transmission capacity and upgrading other physical infrastructure in order to reduce constraints that contribute to negative pricing: if one location has more power supply than demand, simply ship the excess to a location that can use it (yes, we recognize that this simplified description glosses over the complexities of constrained dispatch, but it remains true that increasing capacity in an appropriately-planned way will reduce the impacts of system constraints).</p><p>Unfortunately, the IEA does not think such new investments will be sufficient, or at least not sufficiently fast:</p><p>Around 1.5 million kilometres of new transmission lines have been built worldwide over the last decade, but inadequate transmission remains major constraint on power system development, electrification and energy security. Among other issues, grid infrastructure has struggled to keep pace with the rate at which new renewable sources are entering the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Their report describes several reasons for this, including supply chain bottlenecks and permitting delays — problems that are unlikely to recede in an era of increasing trade protectionism.</p> Managing power systems requires new ways to provide flexibility <blockquote>So if new transmission is insufficient, what is the solution? The IEA offers its perspective: “Optimising the use of existing grid infrastructure through digital technologies enhances efficiency and maximises the use of existing assets, providing a safety valve for networks and supply&nbsp;chains”</blockquote><p>This is precisely what our <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/electricity">Digital Spine</a> solution does: facilitate integration of DERs to allow grid operators and market participants to efficiently, fairly, and securely operate the grid. It can wring cost savings out of existing operational processes or even allow new market configurations that until now have not been feasible.</p><p>As an example of the latter, we implemented our Digital Spine solution in Australia as part of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO)’s Project Edge. In that project, AEMO and market participants demonstrated a new approach to integrating DERs into both transmission- and distribution-level operations: a two-sided market based on dynamic operating envelopes. An <a href="https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/initiatives/der/2023/project-edge-independent-cba-full-report.pdf?la=en">independent cost-benefit analysis</a> found that implementing this approach could save consumers AU$5–6 billion over twenty years, and that the savings would accrue to both consumers with DERs and those without them. A separate independent technology and cybersecurity assessment found that the Digital Spine as the underlying data exchange was more scalable, stable, resilient, flexible, and secure than traditional point-to-point or centralized approaches.</p><p>If you or your organization are looking to increase your network’s efficiency and unlock the full potential of DERs, please see our <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/electricity">Digital Spine</a> webpage for more information or to <a href="http://www.energyweb.org">contact&nbsp;us</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/why-the-grid-needs-a-digital-spine-insights-from-the-international-energy-agency-37922de54b3f">Why the Grid Needs a Digital Spine: Insights from the International Energy Agency</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 1. Overview 
<p>In 2024, Internet Safety Labs (ISL) added 3rd parties observed in app network traffic to our app Safety Labels viewable in <a href="https://appmicroscope.org/">AppMicroscope.org</a>. Recently, we reviewed the network traffic of the original 1541 apps, looking for data brokers and the results were clear: 16% apps that were recommended or required in schools were sending student data to registered data brokers. Every state (and District of Columbia) had at least three or more schools with apps communicating with data brokers. In total, 442 of the 663 (or 67%) studied schools had apps with data broker traffic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Importantly, “registered” data brokers don’t count apps sending data to platforms destined for data brokers, nor does it include entities that should be registered data brokers but aren’t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This report details our findings and analysis on Edtech apps observed communicating with data brokers, as well as our recommendations for educators and app developers. &nbsp;</p>
 1.1 The Inadequacy of “Data Broker” Legal Definitions&nbsp; 
<p>This analysis counts only registered data brokers found in either the <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/data_broker_registry/">California Data Broker Registry</a> or the <a href="https://bizfilings.vermont.gov/databrokersearch/Search">Vermont Data Broker Registry</a>.<a>1</a> Readers should be aware that the legal definition of “data broker” in the US fails to properly account for and hold responsible the full data supply chain feeding data brokers. Specifically, it fails to include:&nbsp;</p>
 
 First parties who sell personal information, such as mobile carriers who were found as recently as last year to be selling some of the most sensitive of personal information, location data<a>2</a>.&nbsp; 
 Entities who sell or share personal in bulk for marketing and advertising purposes, including identity resolution platforms (IDRPs) and&nbsp; customer data platforms (CDPs), both designed to ingest and synthesize personal data from a multitude of services/platforms<br>
a. This also includes adtech entities including Supply Side Platforms (SSPs), ad exchanges, Demand Side Platforms (DSPs), and Data Management Platforms (DMPs). These entities aggregate personal data shared via the real-time bidding (RTB) messages (aka “bidstream”). Note that these entities figured prominently in the recent Gravy Analytics analysis<a>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>Thus, we must assume that the volume of student data making its way into data brokers is substantially larger than this analysis conveys.&nbsp;</p>
 1.2 Methodology&nbsp; 
<p>In 2022, ISL conducted a privacy audit on recommended and required technologies for students in a representative sample of K-12 schools across the US. In total, ISL examined 1541 mobile apps, including analysis of the network traffic between the app, the first party, and all third-party servers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, ISL researchers determined the corporate owner of every subdomain that appeared in the network traffic collected for the apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we determined if the corporate owner was a registered data broker by matching against companies in the California and Vermont data broker registries; note that this reflects data broker registries as of 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 2. Findings<br>
 
 2.1&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall 
<p>243 apps or 15.8% of tested apps sent data to registered data brokers. The 243 apps sending data to data brokers communicated with a shocking 6.7 data brokers on average. This means that when children use these apps, their information will be sent to several data brokers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The top app categories sending data to data brokers were:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 News apps (77% of audited news apps)&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Reference apps (37%)&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sports apps (32%), and&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Community Engagement Platform (CEP) apps (26%).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>News, reference and sports apps are not surprising; news apps are known to be rife with adtech and martech. See Figure 7 for all category counts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As noted in all three previously published <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/reports/2022-us-k12-edtech-benchmark/">findings reports</a>, Community Engagement Platform apps were among the leakiest apps observed. The CEP developers with apps found to be communicating with data brokers are shown in Table 1.</p>

<p><br>
Of the larger CEP developers (Apptegy, Finalsite, and Intrado), it’s clear that the apps’ configurability is influencing the presence of data brokers since not all of the apps were found to be communicating with data brokers. Finalsite, for example, provides an administrative dashboard that allows school districts to edit the URLs opened by the app. In 2021, ISL spoke with Blackboard (Anthology), then-owner of the Finalsite apps, and learned that the platform performed no checking on the domains entered by school administrators. We suggested that they add guardrails, checking for things like dangling or malicious domains, at a bare minimum. Finalsite acquired Anthology from Blackboard in September 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Palm Beach County School District Android app (a CEP app) by Intrado included the most data brokers, at a whopping 31. (See also the Safety Label for the app here: <a href="https://appmicroscope.org/app/1579/">https://appmicroscope.org/app/1579/</a>) The app is no longer available on the Google Play store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Table 2 shows the five apps with the most data brokers from 2022 and from a recent retesting. Two of the apps have been removed from the store, but the other three are the same or worse with respect to the number of data brokers.&nbsp;</p>

2.2&nbsp; &nbsp;EdTech&nbsp; 
<p>As discussed in <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2022-k12-edtech-safety-benchmark-national-findings-part-1.pdf">Findings Report 1</a>, the majority of apps from the benchmark weren’t strictly edtech apps; the benchmark included a surprising number of non-edtech, general use apps. Isolating edtech categories, we find that only 6 apps (2.0%) of the strictly edtech apps had observed traffic to data brokers. While this is substantially better than the overall sample rate, for these kinds of services, there should be no data brokers receiving data from the apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

2.4&nbsp; &nbsp;State-based Observations 
<p>Data brokers were found in apps in every state and the District of Columbia. That is, every state sample of 13 schools had at least one school with at least one app with data broker traffic. Figure 1 shows how many schools from the 2022 benchmark had apps that were sending traffic to data brokers. 13 schools were sampled in each state, so the heatmap reflects up to 100% (i.e. all 13 schools) having apps with traffic to data brokers. Texas, Wisconsin and Louisiana each had apps with data brokers in all 13 studied schools.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Number of schools in state sample with at least one app with data broker traffic (13 schools max per state)</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the total number of apps with data broker traffic for each state sample of 13 schools. The states with the most apps with data broker traffic were Maryland, Kansas, and Minnesota.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: Total number of apps with data broker traffic</p>
<p>We hypothesize that the likelihood of apps with data broker traffic is mainly related to the sampled schools’ propensity to recommend a higher number of technologies to students. The correlation between the number apps with data brokers and the total number of apps was moderately strong at .69. Figure 3, the heatmap showing the total number of apps recommended by the 13 sampled schools in each state, indeed shows similarities (Texas, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Maryland, in particular).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3: Total number of apps per state</p>
<p>We were interested to see if there was any obvious correlation between state privacy laws and the number of data brokers observed. Figure 4 shows states with student data privacy laws. Indeed, three of the nine states that don’t have student data laws, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Maryland, each had high numbers of apps with data broker traffic, and all 13 schools in Wisconsin had apps with data broker traffic. While inconclusive with respect to causation, the correlation warrants future study. It’s also possible that the absence of a state student data privacy law encourages a higher number of technologies being recommended to students in schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 3. Recommendations 
 
 
 
 
 1) App developers: Apps or websites used by children should never send data to data brokers. They should also not send user data to customer data repositories
 
 
 
 a) Community Engagement Platform App Developers
 
 ISL is calling on the community engagement app developers shown in Table 1 to immediately update all of their apps to remove all data brokers. 
 We also call upon CEP app developers to install better guardrails in the administrative portal, minimally performing automated checking for dangling and malicious domains. Ideally, also disallowing or flagging any commercial sites with trackers (like MaxPreps), alerting school administrators of the risks of such sites with respect to student data sharing. 
 ISL recommends that schools not use CEP apps until they have demonstrated significant improvement in dangerous data sharing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2) Schools, Educators, and Concerned Parents: While it’s 100% the responsibility of the app developer to ensure that their apps and websites are safe for children, schools may need to be the ones demanding removal of data brokers. To help you do this, we’ve updated our app safety labels to clearly identify the number of data brokers in the app (Figure 6).&nbsp;Educators, school IT personnel and concerned parents can look up the app safety label for any app that they’re recommending to students. If it includes data brokers, stay away from the app. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can’t find your app? <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/contact-us/">Contact us</a> and we’ll be happy to audit a new app or re-audit an existing app.

<p>A Snapshot of Passkey Deployments for Employee Sign-ins in the U.S. and UK</p>



 Key findings 



 
 Enterprises understand the value of passkeys and the majority are rolling out passkeys for workforce sign-ins: The majority have either deployed or are in the midst of deploying passkeys with goals tied to improved user experience, enhanced security, and standards/regulatory compliance. Those that are deploying are rolling out a mix of device-bound and synced passkeys.&nbsp; 



 Enterprises are prioritizing passkey rollouts to users with access to sensitive data and applications, and are leveraging communication, training and documentation to increase adoption. 



 Enterprises are reporting significant security and business benefits after rolling out passkeys: they report positive impacts on user experience, security, cost reduction, productivity and digital transformation goals — and are seeing declines in usage of legacy authentication methods. Interestingly, these benefits directly correlate with what businesses who aren’t yet using passkeys dislike most about their current authentication methods: that they can be compromised, are costly, and difficult to use.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Organizations that do not have active passkey projects cite complexity, costs and overall lack of clarity about implementation as reasons, signaling a need for increased education to enterprises on rollout strategies to reduce concerns.

<p>Respondents report positive impacts on user experience, security, productivity, and cost reduction from deploying a mix of device-bound and synced passkeys</p>



<p>February 26, 2025 — <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">The FIDO Alliance</a> along with underwriters <a href="https://www.axiad.com/">Axiad</a>, <a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/">HID</a>, and <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales</a> today released its State of Passkey Deployment in the Enterprise report, finding that 87% of surveyed companies have, or are in the midst of, rolling out passkeys with goals tied to improved user experience, enhanced security, and compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report is the result of an independent survey commissioned in September 2024 by the FIDO Alliance Enterprise Deployment Working Group, with underwriting support from Axiad, HID, and Thales, to understand the state of passkey deployments in the U.S. and UK; the methods used to deploy passkeys and enroll employees; and the perceived barriers to deployment. Read the report at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/research-state-of-passkey-deployment-in-the-enterprise-a-snapshot-of-deployments-employee-sign-ins-us-uk">https://fidoalliance.org/research-state-of-passkey-deployment-in-the-enterprise-a-snapshot-of-deployments-employee-sign-ins-us-uk</a>.</p>



<p>The survey revealed four key findings:</p>



 
 Enterprises understand the value of passkeys for workforce sign-ins. A majority of decision makers (87%) report deploying passkeys at their companies. Of these, 47% report rolling out a mix of device-bound passkeys (on physical security keys and/or cards) and synced passkeys (synced securely across the user’s devices). 



 Organizations are prioritizing passkey rollouts to users with access to sensitive data and applications, including the three most commonly cited priority groups: Those requiring access to IP (39%), users with admin accounts (39%) and users at the executive level (34%). Within these deployments, organizations are leveraging communication, training, and documentation to increase adoption. 



 Passkey deployments are linked to significant security and business benefits. Respondents report moderate to strong positive impacts on user experience (82%), security (90%), help-center call reduction (77%), productivity (73%), and digital transformation goals (83%).&nbsp; 



 Groups that do not have active passkey projects cite complexity (43%), costs (33%), and lack of clarity (29%) about implementation as reasons. This signals a need for increased education for enterprises on rollout strategies to reduce concerns, as there is a correlation between these perceived challenges and the proven benefits of passkeys. 
 



<p>“This study is equally encouraging and illuminating as it points to strong willingness and commitment to deploy passkeys to employees – and also is informative in helping FIDO shape resources that we can deliver to help enterprises around the world more quickly and effectively implement their FIDO authentication strategies,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewshikiar/">Andrew Shikiar</a>, CEO and executive director of the FIDO Alliance. “Passkeys can stop AI-generated social engineering attacks in their tracks while also increasing employee productivity and reducing costs associated with help desk support and security breaches. FIDO Alliance is committed to helping more companies around the world realize these benefits by providing actionable passkey implementation guidance and best practices, which this data will help define.”</p>



<p>New phishing and fraud attempts are being used every day, driven in particular by widespread generative AI use. As reflected in the report, enterprise leaders are becoming aware of the limitations of compromisable passwords, and seeing the value of deploying the most secure and user-friendly authentication methods possible. These insights will be leveraged to further remove the perceived and/or real barriers around passkey adoption so more enterprises can experience their benefits on a global scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learn More During FIDO’s March 6 Webcast&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance will host a webcast on March 6, 2025 at 8am PST to provide further insights into the report methodology, the findings and next steps. The webcast will feature <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeljthelander/">Michael Thelander</a>, senior director of product marketing at Axiad; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-bj%C3%B6rk-0b2b679/">Katie Björk</a>, director of communications and solution marketing at HID; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahlefavrais/">Sarah Lefavrais</a>, Authentication devices product marketing director at Thales, along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-shamas-127b046/">Megan Shamas</a>, chief marketing officer of the FIDO Alliance. Register <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/passkey-adoption-workforce-trends-considerations">here</a>.</p>



<p>Michael Thelander, Axiad’s director of product marketing, thinks the survey results will deliver not just interesting data, but will also provide a path for FIDO2 to become a first class citizen alongside other forms of PKI-based authentication in the enterprise. “Passkey technology has not only matured, but this survey reveals how identity practitioners and strategists are beginning to integrate passkeys with their other workforce authentication methods, across different platforms and device types, to deliver what identity architects and users both want: strong authentication that doesn’t place a ‘friction ‘tax’ on the last step of accessing systems and networks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“HID, in collaboration with fellow FIDO Alliance members, launched this survey to gain insights into the priorities of enterprise and security leaders that drive successful passkey implementation. We also aimed to identify the challenges other organizations encounter when integrating FIDO technology into their authentication strategies. HID’s overarching goal is to empower organizations to meet their business objectives by eliminating one of their most significant obstacles: user experience and security challenges linked to passwords,” says Katie Björk, Director of Communications and Solution Marketing.</p>



<p>“Thales is excited to collaborate with the FIDO Alliance for this research, which underscores the growing adoption of passkeys for employee sign-ins,” said Haider Iqbal, Director Product Marketing IAM at Thales. “We’re seeing similar interest from our customers, who recognize the benefits of FIDO authentication for both security and productivity. Thales is committed to enabling organizations to migrate their workforce and customers to passkeys, helping them stay ahead of the curve with secure, seamless and frictionless digital journeys for all users.”</p>



<p>Survey Methodology:</p>



 
 The survey was conducted among 400 decision makers who would be / are involved in passkey deployment in companies with 500+ employees across the UK and the US. 



 The interviews were conducted online by Sapio Research in September 2024 using an email invitation and an online survey. 



 At an overall level results are accurate to ± 4.9% at 95% confidence limits assuming a result of 50%. 



 The survey was produced by the FIDO Alliance Enterprise Deployment Working Group, with underwriting support from Axiad, HID, and Thales. 
 



<p>About the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

<p></p>      The Digital Future of Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG)           <p>Privacy-Preserving Traceability with Digital Product Passports &amp; Data Spaces Interoperability</p>
          <p>The Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry is undergoing a rapid transformation. Consumers demand accountability and sustainability—<a href="https://www.bazaarvoice.com/blog/cpg-research/">over 70% want detailed product information</a>—while new regulations like the EU’s <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en">Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation</a> (ESPR) and the <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/forced-labor/UFLPA">Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act</a> (UFLPA) reshape the landscape. Big data leaks and supply chain disruptions have become the norm. As regulations grow increasingly stringent, consumer trust falters, and operational costs skyrocket, a paradigm shift is essential. The industry needs verifiable, trusted data seamlessly integrated — and a system that enables seamless, permissioned data exchange across the value chain.</p>
<p>Digital Product Passports (DPPs) are a key component of this transformation. A DPP is a secure, globally unique digital record that stores verifiable information about a product throughout its lifecycle—from raw materials to disposal. Widespread adoption of DPPs is critical for building trust, strengthening value chain resilience, and ensuring regulatory compliance. According to the EU, <a href="https://data.europa.eu/en/news-events/news/eus-digital-product-passport-advancing-transparency-and-sustainability">which now requires DPPs</a> for nearly all products sold in the EU, “the DPP is designed to close the gap between consumer demands for transparency and the current lack of reliable product data.”</p>
<p>However, DPPs alone are not enough. To truly unlock their potential, we need a standardized framework for data spaces interoperability—a system that enables direct, seamless transactions between participants across industries. Modern value chains involve collaboration among thousands of stakeholders, including enterprises, regulators, and consumers. When these value chains function efficiently, they improve product quality, optimize resource allocation, and lower costs. Yet, despite technological advancements, achieving this level of coordination remains a challenge.</p>
<p>Introduction to MOBI’s Web3 Infrastructure </p>
<p>Today, many organizations rely on third-party platforms and proprietary applications for data exchange, resulting in fragmented, siloed systems. This lack of interoperability limits collaboration and hinders critical processes, from ensuring product safety and ethical sourcing to enabling proper recycling and end-of-life management. Recognizing this, <a href="https://dlt.mobi/about/">MOBI was formed in 2018</a> as a neutral convener for organizations to develop standards and infrastructure for DPPs and data spaces interoperability. <a href="https://dlt.mobi/web3-infrastructure/">MOBI’s Web3 Infrastructure</a>, comprising <a href="https://dlt.mobi/citopia/">Citopia Decentralized Marketplace</a> (DM) and the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/">Integrated Trust Network</a> (ITN), offers a secure, decentralized marketplace framework with standardized communication protocols. Think of it as a private internet, wherein entities can engage in secure, autonomous, encrypted transactions.</p>
<p>Citopia DM and the ITN are built for <a href="https://dlt.mobi/ssdi/">Self-Sovereign Data and Identity</a> (SSDI). Each participant owns and manages their own <a href="https://dlt.mobi/passport/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twin</a> (SSDT), which stores two things: </p>
 
 a globally-unique <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier</a> (DID), which is anchored and validated in the ITN 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) used for transactions in Citopia DM  
 
<p>This SSDT allows participants to engage in standardized, secure, and compliant transactions on Citopia DM with selective disclosure (data only goes to intended recipients). Both Citopia and ITN are system and cloud-agnostic, meaning stakeholders can seamlessly communicate while retaining their existing systems and web services. This removes the need for costly one-off integrations and eliminates prohibitive onboarding/maintenance costs, providing a robust foundation for data spaces interoperability.</p>
<p>Citopia DM unlocks new possibilities for DPPs by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions between value chain participants. Removing reliance on third-party intermediaries lowers costs, increases traceability, and drives compliance with emerging regulatory requirements. Companies leveraging MOBI’s infrastructure can streamline operations, reduce data silos, and improve their ability to meet evolving consumer and regulatory demands. For regulators and consumers of CPGs, Citopia DM offers easy access to trusted DPPs issued by companies. For regulators, this makes it easy to verify compliance claims. For consumers, access to DPPs can inspire confident purchasing decisions and boost brand loyalty. </p>
<p>Laying the Foundation for Generative AI Applications </p>
<p>MOBI is going to take this one important step further. The robust infrastructure it has built not only addresses the critical need for tracebility and data exchange but also lays the foundation for powerful generative AI applications. By leveraging the rich, contextual data housed within DPPs and the seamless data flow facilitated by Citopia and SSDTs between rich data spaces, generative AI can move beyond generic analyses to provide participant-specific value. Imagine a scenario where:</p>
 
 Consumers can interact with generative AI agents to understand the complete lifecycle of a product they are considering purchasing. These agents, equipped with DPP data accessed through Citopia, can answer nuanced questions about a product’s sustainability footprint, ethical sourcing, or even detailed ingredient breakdowns, generating responses tailored to the individual consumer’s values and concerns. For example, a consumer with specific dietary restrictions or sustainability preferences could ask a generative AI agent: “Show me the carbon footprint and allergen information for the ingredients in this cereal, and suggest alternatives with lower environmental impact and no nuts.” The agent, accessing the DPP via Citopia, can generate a personalized, privacy-preserving response, drawing from verified data and offering actionable recommendations. 
 CPG Companies can utilize generative AI to optimize their operations and gain deeper market understanding. Generative AI agents can analyze aggregated and anonymized DPP data from across the value chain within Citopia to identify supply chain inefficiencies, predict potential disruptions, or personalize marketing campaigns with unprecedented precision. For instance, a generative AI agent could analyze DPP data to recommend optimal sourcing strategies based on real-time insights into material availability, ethical considerations, and environmental impact, while ensuring compliance with regulations like UFLPA. Furthermore, generative AI can assist in generating customized sustainability reports or proactively flag potential regulatory compliance issues based on DPP data, streamlining operations and reducing risks. 
 Regulators can employ generative AI agents to efficiently monitor and verify compliance with evolving regulations like the ESPR. These agents can be granted permissioned access to DPP data within Citopia, enabling them to automatically audit product information against regulatory requirements and identify potential non-compliance issues at scale. Generative AI can generate summaries of compliance status across product categories or highlight specific areas needing further investigation, significantly enhancing regulatory oversight and consumer protection. 
 
<p>The key to enabling these generative AI applications lies in the architecture of MOBI’s Web3 infrastructure. SSDTs with secure identities backed by the ITN ensure that each participant retains control over their data, can choose what data to disclose (and to whom), and can securely exchange verifiable data in a regulatory-mandated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_architecture">Zero Trust Architecture</a>. </p>
<p>Generative AI agents operating within this framework can be designed to access and process data in a privacy-preserving manner. For example, they can utilize techniques like differential privacy or federated learning to generate insights from aggregated DPP data without needing to access or expose the raw, sensitive data of individual participants. Selective disclosure of VCs ensures that only authorized agents receive the necessary data points, minimizing the risk of data breaches or misuse.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This means that the combination of DPPs and interoperable data spaces facilitated by MOBI’s infrastructure and generative AI represents an entirely new business phase for the CPG industry. It moves beyond basic traceability to enable a future where data becomes a dynamic tool for generating participant-specific value, fostering deeper consumer trust, optimizing business operations, and ensuring robust regulatory compliance – all within a secure and privacy-respecting ecosystem. </p>
<p>MOBI’s Web3 infrastructure is, therefore, a game-changer for the CPG industry, offering a scalable, decentralized approach to data verification and interoperability while enabling participant-specific insights and recommendations using generative AI. As consumer expectations evolve and regulatory landscapes shift, embracing decentralized, self-sovereign solutions will be the key to sustainable growth and competitive advantage. The future of CPG lies in verifiable, trusted data, and MOBI is leading the way in building the infrastructure to support it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.oneidentity.com/learn/what-is-passkey-authentication.aspx">Passkey authentication</a>&nbsp;replaces traditional passwords with a pair of cryptographic keys—public and private. The private key stays on the user’s device, while the public key sits on the server. During login, the server issues a challenge that only the private key can solve, and the response gets verified using the public key. No passwords are transmitted or stored, which reduces the attack surface significantly. Password leaks and brute-force attempts become non-issues because there is no static secret to steal or guess.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.oneidentity.com/learn/what-is-fido-authentication.aspx">FIDO2</a>&nbsp;is a joint initiative by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) aimed at delivering streamlined, strong authentication without relying on passwords. It defines a set of technical components: WebAuthn and CTAP2 (Client to Authenticator Protocol). WebAuthn standardizes how a web application interacts with an authenticator—often a platform feature like a secure enclave on a phone or a hardware security key. CTAP2 governs how that authenticator communicates with the client device, such as a laptop or smartphone.</p>

<p>The Human Colossus Foundation (HCF) recently participated in the 2025 Geneva Winter Summit, a global gathering of AI experts, policymakers, and innovators hosted by the AI for Developing Countries Forum (AIFOD) at United Nation office at Geneva. The summit focused on AI’s potential for developing countries to drive equitable digital development, culminating in the AIFOD Geneva Winter Summit Declaration 2025, which charts a path for inclusive AI progress.</p><p>At the core of HCF’s contribution were two topics:</p>  <p>The importance of access to accurate data and its provenance in AI training especially for small and less digitalize nations.</p>  <p>The role of distributed governance in fostering ethical AI Agents ecosystems which can give the edge for developing countries without need to build massive data centers for huge AI models. </p>   The Power of Accurate Data and Provenance in AI Training <p>For AI to serve communities effectively, it require access to massive data sets, best localize to avoid biases and misinformation. Unfortunately a lot of developing countries does not have such access, in many cases digital transformation just starting. This allows them to better prepare for upcoming needs of the data, they can start already shaping digital policies and strategies to invest from day one towards more accurate data ecosystems which could give them the edge relaying more on quality then quantity. AI models trained on verifiable, and well-documented data would be more accurate in their functions. Data provenance—the ability to trace data back to its source—is essential for ensuring AI models are transparent, reliable, and compliant with global data standards but as well allowing citizens and countries to verify potential bias and misinformation in AI-generated insights.</p><p>At the summit, HCF emphasized how Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) principles enable organizations to structure and verify data origins, ensuring AI models are trained on high-quality, trustworthy inputs.</p><p>Why does data provenance matter?</p>  <p>Enables to build trust and accountability in AI decision-making</p>  <p>Helps organizations comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)</p>  <p>Prevents bias and misinformation in AI-generated insights</p>  <p>HCF advocates for data-oriented architectures, where individuals and businesses can validate their data before it is used to train AI, ensuring a more transparent and responsible ecosystem.</p> Distributed Governance: The Key to Ethical and Sustainable AI <p>Governance models must evolve to keep pace with AI’s rapid growth. Traditional centralized governance structures often struggle to provide the inclusivity and adaptability needed for cross-border AI systems.</p><p>At the summit, HCF promoted distributed governance model to help with classification standards, cross-jurisdictional ethical alignment, and enhanced data transparency. A meta-governance framework would equip stakeholders with accurate, verifiable, and accessible information, enabling informed AI adoption that aligns with local regulations and ethical values. By promoting fairness, transparency, and accountability, this framework supports a responsible, sustainable AI-driven digital economy.</p><p>How can distributed governance benefit AI ecosystems?</p>  <p>Inclusive decision-making – Empowering communities, businesses, and policymakers to shape AI’s future</p>  <p>Enhanced accountability – Avoiding centralized control that can lead to bias or exploitation</p>  <p>Interoperability across jurisdictions – Helping AI operate ethically across borders without conflicting regulations</p>  <p>Through distributed governance models, AI can serve global communities fairly, ensuring that technological advancements reflect a shared ethical and socio-economic vision.</p> The 2025 AIFOD Declaration: A Commitment to Inclusive AI <p>The Geneva Winter Summit Declaration 2025 serves as a blueprint for AI governance, highlighting the need for:</p>  <p>Equitable access to AI advancements for developing nations</p>  <p>A balance between regulation and innovation</p>  <p>Stronger international collaboration to ensure ethical AI deployment</p>  <p>HCF stands committed to advancing these goals through the Dynamic Data Economy, ensuring AI serves all communities equally, ethically, and sustainably.</p> Looking Ahead: HCF’s Vision for Ethical AI Development <p>The Human Colossus Foundation will continue advocating for accurate data management, distributed governance, and responsible AI adoption. Through collaboration with global stakeholders, we aim to shape AI ecosystems that prioritize transparency, inclusivity, and sustainability.</p>

<p>Am 26. November fand die Zweite Digital Society Conference (DSC2) im Change Hub in Berlin statt. Am 27. November fand im Rahmen der DSC2 ein Workshop zum Thema Organisationsidentitäten statt.</p>



<p>Wie im vergangenen Jahr lag der Schwerpunkt der DSC auf dem Thema Digitale Nachweise und Identitäten. In Keynote, Panels und interaktiven Worksessions wurden am 26.11.24 Genese und Rahmenbedingungen der europäischen digitalen Identitätslösung und der EUDI-Wallet erläutert und Fakten vermittelt. Auch sind wir der Frage nachgegangen, wie sich diese europäische Lösung im internationalen Kontext einordnet und was uns als Gesellschaft in den kommenden Jahren konkret erwartet. Denn die hoheitliche eID ist erst der Beginn einer schnellen und anspruchsvollen Entwicklung, in deren Folge auch Unternehmen eine digitale ID erhalten werden, um den Austausch von Daten und die Sicherheit der Identifikation von Entitäten zu gewährleisten.</p>



<p>An dieser Stelle danken wir den Referierenden, Panelisten und insbesondere unseren Förderern, ohne die wir die DSC2 nicht hätten realisieren können.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://idunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DSC2-Keynote_JorgFischer.pdf">Download Keynote</a></p>







<p>Zu folgenden Themen bildeten sich Worksessions:</p>



 
 Anbindung von Kommunen und kleinen Unternehmen 



 Wiki Data /Organisationsidentitäten / Definition 



 ID-Diebstahl / Betrug 



 Geschäftsmodelle / Payment Integration 



 SDI-Initiativen außerhalb der EU / Interoperabilität 



 Killer-Applikationen für Europäische Wallet (EUDI-Wallet) 



 Und dann gab es noch eine Worksession unter dem augenzwinkernden Header „Dackel-Club“: Hier wurden Nutzungen und Anwendungen digitaler Identitäten diskutiert, die keine hoheitliche Identität benötigen. Zum Beispiel die Mitgliedschaft im Dackel-Club. Dies mag kurios klingen, doch wenn bedacht wird, dass mehr als 37 % der Bevölkerung der Bundesrepublik in Vereinen engagiert ist, so erscheint dieses Anwendungsfeld durchaus interessant, um Adaption und den Umgang mit Wallets voranzubringen. 
 



<p>Handout Wegweiser:</p>



<p>Schließlich wurde der Wegweiser Digitale Identitäten und Nachweise vorgestellt. Dieser ist Produkt der Zusammenarbeit innerhalb der Forschungsprojekte Sichere digitale Identitäten des BMWK (SDI) und steht nun zum Download zur Verfügung. Ziel des Wegweisers ist es, einen niederschwelligen Einstieg in die Begriffswelt digitaler Nachweise zu finden. Erläutert sind die Begriffe Wallet, digitale Identität, digitaler Nachweis, Signatur. Die Nutzung des Wegweisers ist frei.&nbsp;</p>

 DSC2 – Workshop 27.11.24 



<p>Am zweiten Tag der DSC2 fand ein Fachworkshop statt, der ganz dem Thema Organisationsidentitäten (OrgID) gewidmet war. Zunächst wurde in Vorträgen der aktuelle Sachstand präsentiert.&nbsp; Dieser diente als Grundlage für die anschließende Arbeit in zwei großen Fachgruppen, deren Ziel es war, insbesondere die offenen Fragen und Punkte zu den Themenkreisen Zugang, Datenaustausch und technische Ausgestaltung weiter zu spezifizieren.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Guest blog by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-bernstein-518688/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Greg Bernstein</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davelongley1/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dave Longley</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manusporny/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Manu Sporny</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimdhamilton/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Kim Hamilton Duffy</a></p><p>Following the IETF/IRTF Crypto Forum Research Group’s adoption of the BBS Blind Signatures and BBS per Verifier Linkability (“BBS Pseudonym”) specifications, this blog describes historical context and details of cryptographic pseudonyms, as well as the privacy features they enable.</p><p>The discussion of cryptographic pseudonyms for privacy preservation has a long history, with Chaum’s 1985 popular article “Security without identification: transaction systems to make big brother obsolete” (Chaum1985) addressing many of the features of such systems such as unlinkability and constraints on their use such as one pseudonym per organization and accountability for pseudonym use. Although Chaum’s proposal makes use of different cryptographic primitives than we will use here, one can see similarities in the use of both secret and “public” information being combined to create a cryptographic pseudonym.</p><p>Lysyanskaya’s 2000 paper (Lysya2000) also addresses the unlinkable aspects of pseudonyms but also provides protections against dishonest users. In addition they provide practical constructions similar to those used in our draft based on discrete logarithm and sigma protocol based ZKPs. Finally as part of the ABC4Trust project three flavors of pseudonyms were defined:</p>  Verifiable pseudonyms are pseudonyms derived from an underlying secret key.  Certified pseudonyms are certified pseudonyms derived from a secret key that also underlies an issued credential.  Scope-exclusive pseudonyms are verifiable pseudonyms that are guaranteed to be unique per scope string and per secret key.  Figure 1: Types of Pseudonyms<p>The BBS based pseudonyms in our draft are aimed primarily at providing the functionality of the pseudonym flavors 2 and 3 above.</p> How BBS is Fundamentally Better for Solving Dishonest Holder Fraud <p>Beyond the usual anti-forgery and tamper-evident protections that digital signatures provide, there are two different types of credential fraud that unlinkable credentials need to mitigate: third-party fraud and first-party fraud.</p><p>Third-party fraud is when one party uses another party's credentials without their knowledge or approval. This involves the theft of an honest holder's credentials.</p><p>First-party fraud is when a legitimate credential holder intentionally allows other parties to covertly use their credentials. This involves not the theft of credentials, but rather, a dishonest holder.</p><p>BBS signatures provides two different security features, one to address each of these cases:</p> 1. Holder Multifactor Authentication <p>This security feature binds a BBS credential to a particular secret that only the holder knows and that an honest holder will not share access to nor use of. When a holder presents a BBS credential, a verifier can require that the holder prove use of this secret, thereby enforcing this protection on the holder's behalf. This is an anti-theft mechanism for mitigating third-party fraud.</p><p>Note: This feature is sometimes called "holder binding", but it might be more accurately understood as "Holder Multifactor Authentication". This is because the holder is not themselves bound to the credential and it is not a mitigation for first-party fraud. It instead works like another MFA device does when performing authentication. If a dishonest holder shares that MFA device or an API to use it, then someone else can unlinkably present their credential (with the holder's approval -- perhaps even for a fee). Stopping dishonest holders from doing this is a significant challenge that involves locking down users' hardware and software – and a single failure in this scheme could potentially result in an unlimited number of unlinkable, fraudulent presentations. This feature is therefore not a protection for verifiers, but rather one for honest holders against theft. With this in mind, it can be implemented such that a holder is free to use software or hardware of their choice to provide the protection, without requiring specific approval from the issuer.</p> 2. Pseudonyms <p>This security feature binds a BBS credential to a secret that is constructed from inputs from both the holder and the issuer. When a holder presents a BBS credential, a verifier can require that the holder present a pseudonym that is based on this secret and a contextual identifier. Each time the same BBS credential is presented using the same contextual identifier, the pseudonym will be the same. This prevents a dishonest holder from covertly enabling an unlimited number of unlinkable presentations of their credential by any parties they authorize. It is an anti-cloning mechanism for mitigating first-party fraud.</p><p>Contextual identifiers can be any value, but need to be agreed upon between the verifier and the holder for a given use case. To give some examples for the presentation of credentials on the Web, a contextual identifier could be a URL like a Web origin (e.g., "<a href="https://website.example/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://website.example</a>"), a Web origin with a certain path (e.g., "<a href="https://website.example/groups/wind-surfing?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://website.example/groups/wind-surfing</a>"), or protocol-defined combination of a URL and a time range, allowing for pseudonyms to be "forgotten" or "rotated" after sufficient time has passed.</p><p>Note: Other credential schemes aim to mitigate first-party fraud by limiting the device and software that a holder chooses to engage with, sometimes referred to as "holder binding". With this approach, the holder's own device and software are trusted to be leveraged against them to constrain their behavior. This approach requires device and software allow lists, trust framework management, significant additional protocol security considerations, and ultimately means that the issuer chooses the holder's device and software (or provides them with a list of acceptable options from which they may choose). This has additional side effects, such as centralizing and vendor lock-in effects on the marketplace of devices and software. Finally, with this approach, it also only takes a single dishonest holder to thwart the protections of the device or software (that they have physical access to) to re-enable an unlimited number of unlinkable fraudulent presentations of a valid credential in the ecosystem. Catching this behavior after the fact logically requires being able to link presentations once again, one way or another, which would defeat the privacy aims of the scheme.</p> Overview: BBS Signature Bound Pseudonyms <p>The BBS signature scheme, the foundation for BBS Pseudonyms, is based on a three-party model:</p>  Signer (also known as issuer): Issues credentials&nbsp;  Prover (also known as holder or user): Receives credentials&nbsp;  Verifier: Validates proofs  <p>A prover obtains a BBS signature from a signer over a list of BBS messages and presents a BBS proof (a proof of possession of a BBS signature) along with a selectively disclosed subset of the BBS messages to a verifier.</p>Figure 2: Example of BBS Signature Flow<p>Each BBS proof generated is unlinkable to other BBS proofs derived from the same signature and from the BBS signature itself. If the disclosed subset of BBS messages are not linkable then they cannot be linked by their cryptographic presentation alone.</p>

<p>Note: the language used in this section is intentionally informal; for a more precise explanation of phrases like “…cannot be linked by their cryptographic presentation alone”, please see Lysya2000.</p>

<p>BBS pseudonyms extend the BBS signature scheme to “bind” a “cryptographic pseudonym” to a BBS signature retaining all the properties of the BBS signature scheme:</p>  &nbsp;A short signature over multiple messages  Selective disclosure of a subset of messages from prover to verifier  Unlinkable proofs.  <p>In addition BBS pseudonyms provide for:</p>  An essentially unique identifier bound to a signature/proof of signature whose linkability is under the control of the prover in conjunction with a verifier or group of verifiers. Such a pseudonym can be used when a prover revisits a verifier to allow a verifier to recognize the prover when they return or for the prover to assert their pseudonymous identity when visiting a verifier  Assurance of per-signer uniqueness, i.e., the signer assures that the pseudonyms that will be guaranteed by the signature have not been used with any other signature issued by the signer (unless a signature is intentionally reissued).  The signer cannot track the prover presentations to verifiers based on pseudonym values.  Verifiers in separate “pseudonym groups” cannot track prover presentations.   How BBS Pseudonyms Work  Overview <p>To realize the above feature set we embed a two part pseudonym capability into the BBS signature scheme. The pseudonym’s cryptographic value will be computed from a secret part, which we call the nym_secret and a part that is public or at least shared between the prover and one or more verifiers. The public part we call the context_id.&nbsp;</p><p>A simplified overview of this flow is shown in Figure 3:</p>Figure 3: Simplified overview of BBS Pseudonym flow Issuance <p>To bind a pseudonym to a BBS signature we have the signer utilize Blind BBS signatures and essentially sign over a commitment to the nym_secret. Hence only a prover that knows the nym_secret can generate a BBS proof from the signature (and also generate the pseudonym proof).</p><p>The prover chooses their (random) prover_nym and commits to it. They then send the commitment along with a ZKP proof that the prover_nym makes this commitment. The signer verifies the commitment to the prover_nym then generates the signer_nym_entropy and “adds” it to the prover_nym during the signature process. Note that this can be done since we sign over the commitment and we know the generator for the commitment.</p>Figure 4: Credential Issuance detailed flow<p>As in Lysya2000 we are concerned with the possibility of a dishonest user and hence require that that nym_secret = prover_nym + signer_nym_entropy be the sum of two parts where the prover_nym is a prover's secret and only sent to the signer in a blinding and hiding commitment. The signer_nym_entropy is “added” in by the signer during the signing procedure and sent back to the prover along with the signature.&nbsp;</p> Verification <p>The pseudonym is calculated from nym_secret and context_id using discrete exponentiation.</p>  nym_secret: A two-part secret combining:  prover_nym: Generated and known only by the prover  signer_nym_entropy: Contributed by the signer during signature    context_id: A public identifier that is shared between the prover and one or more verifiers  <p>This is similar to the computations in Lysya2000 and ABC2014. The pseudonym is presented to the verifier along with a ZKP that the prover knows the nym_secret and uses it and the context_id to compute the pseudonym value. A similar proof mechanism was used in Lysya2000. See chapter 19 of BS2023 for an exposition on these types of ZKPs.</p>Figure 5: BBS Pseudonym verification flow<p>See the appendix for a detailed diagram showing the complete BBS pseudonym issuance and verification flow.</p> BBS Pseudonym Example Applications  Certifiable Pseudonyms <p>Certifiable pseudonyms work as follows:&nbsp; the prover creates unique pseudonyms based on context_ids they choose. While the nym_secret is guaranteed unique to and by the issuer, the issuer never learns its value.&nbsp;</p><p>When using the pseudonym, the prover presents both the context_id and pseudonym to identify themselves, along with any attributes (messages) they choose to reveal. No one else without the nym_secret and signature can produce a proof that they “own” the pseudonym. The prover can create as many different, unlinkable pseudonyms by coming up with different values for the context_id.&nbsp;</p>Figure 6: In this example of Certifiable Pseudonyms, the prover chooses different a context_id per service they interact with Scope Exclusive Pseudonyms <p>With scope exclusive pseudonyms, the verifier or group of verifiers require the use of a specific context_id. This allows the verifier (or group of verifiers) to track visits by the prover using this credential/pseudonym. A verifier can limit data collection, i.e. data retention minimization, by periodically changing the context_id since the pseudonyms produced using different context_ids cannot be linked. For example a context_id like “mywebsite.com/17Nov2024” that changes daily means the verifier could only track visits daily.</p>Figure 7: Scope exclusive pseudonyms where verifiers, or groups of verifiers, require a specific context_id. In this example, scope is set a per-day level<p>Scope Exclusive Pseudonyms with Monitoring</p><p>Scope exclusive pseudonyms with monitoring enable regulated privacy in scenarios requiring third-party oversight. Consider a system for purchasing controlled chemicals: A prover with appropriate credentials uses a different pseudonym with each vendor. This prevents vendors from colluding on prices or learning secret formulas by tracking a prover's complete purchase history across different vendors. At the same time, for regulatory compliance and public safety, vendors must report all purchases to a monitor, including the pseudonym used and their vendor-specific context_id. The prover shares their nym_secret only with the monitor, allowing the monitor to link different pseudonyms to the same prover when necessary. This separation between nym_secrets and other credential-binding secrets is crucial - it enables regulatory oversight without introducing additional cross-tracking by vendors.</p>Figure 8: In this example, scope exclusive pseudonyms with monitoring are used to enable regulatory compliance while not reusing pseudonyms across vendors  A Short Selection of References   [Chaum1985] D.

<p>Thales has unveiled a new solution designed to streamline the deployment and management of FIDO security passkeys for large-scale implementations. The OneWelcome FIDO Key Lifecycle Management solution enables organizations to efficiently manage the complete lifecycle of FIDO keys while transitioning to passwordless authentication systems. The launch follows Thales’&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/thales-releases-new-passwordless-authentication-devices-102201/">previous efforts in passwordless authentication</a>, expanding their enterprise security portfolio.</p>



<p>The solution provides IT teams with comprehensive control over FIDO key management, from initial enrollment through to eventual revocation. By allowing IT departments to pre-register keys and handle lifecycle management tasks, the platform helps reduce the burden on end users while maintaining security standards. The approach supports recent&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fido-papers-explain-how-to-use-passkeys-in-the-enterprise/">FIDO Alliance guidelines for enterprise passkey implementation</a>, which emphasize the importance of streamlined deployment processes.</p>



<p>A key feature of the solution is its integration with Microsoft Entra ID through FIDO2 provisioning APIs, enabling organizations to pre-register Thales FIDO keys for their users. The integration is particularly relevant for enterprises using Microsoft 365, providing secure authentication capabilities from initial deployment. The feature arrives as Microsoft implements&nbsp;<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/microsoft-enforces-mandatory-mfa-across-enterprise-platforms-in-2024-2025-rollout/">mandatory multi-factor authentication across its enterprise platforms</a>.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago, The Onion published this story:</p>
<p><a href="https://theonion.com/study-finds-paint-aisle-at-lowes-best-place-to-have-com-1819570652/">Study Finds Paint Aisle At Lowe’s Best Place To Have Complete Meltdown</a></p>
<p>Now it’s the vitamin aisle at CVS:</p>
 <p>Enshittification at work.</p> 
<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/">coined</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>, he was talking about how online platforms such as Google, Amazon, and TikTok get shitty over time. Well, the same disease also afflicts many big retail operations, especially ones that flood their zones with discounts and other gimmicks, enshittifying what marketers call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience">“the customer experience” (aka CX)</a>.</p>
<p>Take the vitamin aisle, above. The only people who will ever get down on all fours to read the yellow tags near the floor are the cursed employees who have to creep the length of the aisle putting them there.</p>
<p>For customers, the main cost of shopping at CVS is cognitive overhead. Think about—</p>
 
 All those yellow stickies 
 All the slow-downs at check-out when you wave your barcode at a reader, punch your phone number into a terminal, or have a CVS worker to do the same 
 All the conditionalities in every discount or “free” offer that&nbsp; isn’t 
 All the yard-long receipts, such as this one: 
 
<p></p>
<p>And the app!</p>
<p>OMFG,&nbsp; all we really need the damned app for is the one CVS function our life depends on: the pharmacy.</p>
<p>To be fair, the app doesn’t suck at the basics (list of meds, what needs to be refilled, etc.). But it does suck at helping you take advantage of CVS’s greatest strength: that there are so many of them. <a href="https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/CVS%20Pharmacy-USA/">Specifically</a>,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/CVS%20Pharmacy-USA/"></a></p>
<p>While that’s down a bit from<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/241544/cvs-caremark-number-of-stores-since-2005/"> the peak</a> in 2021, CVS is still the Starbucks of pharmacies. And while they are busy <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/money/12573233/cvs-cutting-thousands-jobs-technology/">laying off people while investing in tech</a>, you’d think they would at least make it easy to move your prescription from one store to another, using the app.&nbsp; But noooo.</p>
<p>What the app is best for is promotional crap. For example, this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Look at the small gray type in the red oval:&nbsp;198 coupons!</p>
<p>After I scroll down past the six Extrabucks Rewards (including the two above), I get these:</p>
<p></p>
<p>First, who wants a full-priced item when it seems damn near everything is discounted?</p>
<p>Second, you’d think after all these years of checking out with my Extracare barcode, and the app shows me (under “Buy It Again”) all the stuff I’ve purchased recently, that CVS would know I am a standard-issue dude with no interest in cosmetics. So why top the list of coupons with that shit? I suppose it’s to make me scroll down through the other 178 coupons to find other stuff I might want at a cheaper price.</p>
<p>I just did that and found nothing. Why? Because most of the coupons are for health products I already bought or don’t need. (I’m not sick right now.) Also, almost all of the coupons (as you see) expire three days from now.</p>
<p>Now think about the cognitive and operational overhead required to maintain that whole program at CVS. Good gawd.</p>
<p>And is it necessary? At all? When you’re the Starbucks of pharmacies?</p>
<p>Without exception, all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program">loyalty programs</a> like this one are coercive. They are about trapping and milking customers.</p>
<p>But do stores need them? Do customers? Does CVS?&nbsp; Really? When its customers are already biased by convenience.</p>
<p>Pro Tip: Real loyalty is earned, not coerced.</p>
<p>Want your store, or your chain, to be loved? Take some lessons from the most loved chain in the country: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_Joe's">Trader Joe’s</a>. In a chapter of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy</a> called “The Dance,” I list some reasons why TJ’s is loved by its customers. My main source for that list is <a href="https://www.consciouscapitalism.org/people/doug-rauch">Doug Rauch</a>, the retired president of TJ’s, where he worked for 31 years. Here are the top few:</p>
 
 They never use the word “consumer.” They call us “customers,” “persons,” or “individuals.” 
 They have none of what Doug calls “gimmicks.” No loyalty programs, ads, promotions, or anything else that manipulates customers, raises cognitive overhead or insults anyone’s intelligence. In other words, none of what marketing obsesses about. “Those things are a huge part of retailing today, and have huge hidden costs,” Doug says. (I think the company’s biggest marketing expense is its float in the Rose Parade.) 
 They never discount anything, or say anything is “on sale.” Those kinds of signals add more cognitive overhead. TJ’s wants customers not just to assume, but to know. A single price takes care of that. 
 They have less than no interest in industry fashion. TJ’s goes to no retail industry meetings or conferences, belongs to no associations, and avoids all settings where the talk is about gaming customers. That’s not TJ’s style because that’s not its substance. 
 They believe, along with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cluetrain.com/book/markets.html">Cluetrain</a>, that markets are conversations—with customers. Doug told me his main job, as president of the company, was “shopping along with customers.” That’s how he spent most of his time. “We believe in honesty and directness between human beings…We do this by engaging with the whole person, rather than just with the part that ‘consumes….We’ll even open packages with customers to taste and talk about the goods.” As a result, “There’s nothing sold at Trader Joe’s that customers haven’t improved.” 
 
<p>Then there’s what Walmart CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Scott_(businessman)">Lee Scott</a> told me in 2000 (at <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2010/09/03/3250/">this event</a>) when I asked him “What happened to K-Mart?” From The Intention Economy:</p>
<blockquote><p>His answer, in a word, was “Coupons.” As Lee explained it, K-Mart overdid it with coupons, which became too big a hunk of their overhead, while also narrowing their customer base toward coupon-clippers. They had other problems, he said, but that was a big one. By contrast, Wal-Mart minimized that kind of thing, focusing instead on promising “everyday low prices,” which was a line of Sam Walton’s from way back. The overhead for that policy rounded to zero.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which brings me to trust.</p>
<p>We trust Trader Joe’s and Walmart to be what they are. In simple and fundamental ways, they haven’t changed. The ghosts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Coulombe">Joe Coloumbe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Walton">Sam Walton</a> still run Trader Joe’s and Walmart. TJ’s is still the “irreverent but affordable” grocery store Joe built for what (in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Trader-Joe-Business-Still/dp/1400225434/">his book</a>) Joe called “the overeducated and underpaid,” and based in Los Angeles. Walmart is still Sam’s five-and-dime from Bentonville, Arkansas. (Lee Scott told me that.)</p>
<p>CVS’s equivalent to Joe and Sam was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_P._Hoagland_III">Ralph Hoagland</a>, a good friend of good friends of ours in Santa Barbara. All of us also shared history around Harvard and Cambridge, where Ralph lived when he co-founded CVS, which stood for Consumer Value Store, in 1963. In those days CVS mostly sold health and beauty products, cheaply. I remember Ralph saying the store’s main virtue was just good prices on good products. Hence the name.</p>
<p>CVS can do a much better job of signaling bargain prices by just making them as low as possible, on the model of Trader Joe’s and Walmart.</p>
<p>I think there is also a good Health position for CVS: one that bridges its health &amp; beauty origins and its eminence as the leading pharmacy chain in the U.S. And it&nbsp;could&nbsp;rest on trust.</p>
<p>I’m thinking now about tech. Specifically, FPCs, for First-Person Credentials. Read what Jamie Smith says about them in his<a href="https://www.customerfutures.com/p/the-most-important-credentials-youve"> Customer Futures</a> newsletter under the headline <a href="https://www.customerfutures.com/p/the-most-important-credentials-youve">The most important credentials you’ve never heard of</a>. Also check out—</p>
 
 What I wrote last year about <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/10/15/identity-as-root/">Identity as Root</a> 
 What <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/celebrating-innovation-winners-of-the-dif-hackathon-2024/">DIF is doing</a> 
 What <a href="https://ayra.forum/">Ayra</a> is doing 
 Other stuff you’ll be hearing about first-person credentials (but isn’t published yet) when you come to <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">the next IIW (April 8-10)</a>. 
 What you’ll be learning soon about re-basing everything (meaning every SKU, as well as every person) on a new framework that is far more worthy of trust than any of the separate collections of records, databases, and namespaces that currently divides a digital world that desperately needs unity and interop—especially around health. And::: 
 MyTerms, which is the new name for<a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/"> IEEE P7012</a>, the upcoming standard (for which I am the working group chair) that should become official later this year, though nothing prevents anyone from putting its simple approach to work. 
 
<p>MyTerms can be huge and world-changing because it flips around the opt-out consent mechanisms that have been pro forma since industry won the industrial revolution and metastasized in the Digital Age. With MyTerms, the sites and services of the world agree to your terms, not the other way around. With MyTerms, truly trusting relationships can be established between customers and companies. This is why I immodestly call it <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">the most important standard in development today</a>.</p>
<p>So I have five simple recommendations for CVS, all to de-enshittify corporate operations and customer experiences:</p>
 
 Drop the whole loyalty thing. Completely. Cold turkey. Hell, fire the marketing department. Put the savings into employees you incentivize to engage productively (not promotionally) with customers. And publicize the hell out of it. Should be fun. 
 Confine your research to what your human employees learn directly from their human customers. 
 Be the best version of what you are: a great pharmacy/convenience store chain that’s still long in health and beauty products. 
 Simplify the app by eliminating all the promotional shit, and by making it as easy as possible for customers to move prescriptions from one&nbsp; CVS store to another. 
 Watch what’s happening with first-person credentials and MyTerms. Getting on board with those will make CVS a leader, rather than a follower. 
 
<p>Coupon-clipping addicts may feel some pain at first, but if you market the new direction well—making clear that you have “everyday low prices” rather than annoying and labor-intensive discounts (many of which expire in three days), customers will come to love you.</p>

 Global payments orchestrator&nbsp;Yuno&nbsp;is launching the&nbsp;Mastercard&nbsp;Payment Passkey Service across Latin America, enabling merchants in the region to streamline online checkout processes and enhance fraud protection. 



<p>Following the launch by Yuno, merchants in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile can replace increasingly vulnerable traditional authentication methods, such as one-time passwords, with Mastercard Payment Passkey Service, which uses device-based&nbsp;<a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/password-usage-stagnates-as-consumers-turn-to-biometrics-and-passkeys-the-fido-alliance-reveals/">biometrics</a>, such as fingerprints and facial recognition already available on smartphones, to authenticate purchases.</p>



<p>Mastercard Payment Passkey Service also leverages tokenisation technology to ensure that sensitive data is never shared with third parties and remains useless to fraudsters in the event of a data breach, making transactions even more secure.</p>



<p>This technology promises to not only boost the security of online transactions, but also to significantly reduce cart abandonment rates by increasing convenience for merchants’ customers.</p>

<p>Changes are on the way for&nbsp;online shopping and e-commerce. The traditional way of paying for items online by typing in your credit card details (card number and CVV security code) will soon be a thing of the past.</p>



<p>Mastercard&nbsp;and other card payment companies will be introducing a one-click button that will work on any online platform.</p>



<p>One of the reasons why services will be moving to a one-click system is to&nbsp;deter hackers who target merchant sites to steal consumer card information. According to a 2023 study by&nbsp;Juniper Research,&nbsp;merchant losses from online payment fraud will exceed $362 billion globally between 2023 to 2028, with losses of $91 billion alone in 2028.</p>



<p>The one-click system will protect consumers and their online data.</p>

 Solving energy challenges through collaboration, innovation, and industry driven solutions <p>The energy industry is at a turning point. With decentralization on the rise, evolving regulatory demands, and an urgent push for sustainability, industry leaders must innovate together. That’s why Energy Web is excited to launch Energy Web Circles — a new initiative that brings together enterprises, regulators, and technology providers to create software solutions for today’s energy challenges.</p> A New Model for Collaboration <p>Energy Web Circles are designed to cut through traditional silos by focusing on key issues faced by the energy sector. Each Circle zeroes in on a specific challenge or opportunity, ranging from decentralized identity management, zero carbon electric vehicle charging, to carbon-aware computing and advanced grid management. These groups offer structured, flexible environments where participants can create solutions, share insights, and help shape emerging industry standards.</p> Introducing the First Circle: Universal Energy&nbsp;ID <p>Our inaugural Circle, Universal Energy ID, sets the stage for a more secure and interoperable energy ecosystem. As energy markets become increasingly decentralized, the need for a transparent and standardized identity framework grows. The Universal Energy ID isn’t just an identity solution — it’s a trust layer for the decentralized energy economy. It enables secure, seamless, and interoperable transactions that are essential for modern energy&nbsp;systems.</p> What is the Universal Energy ID&nbsp;Circle? <p>The Universal Energy ID Circle is a collaborative initiative aimed at developing and deploying a decentralized identity and credentialing system for the energy sector. The primary goal is to create a trusted and verifiable identity infrastructure that enables seamless transactions, regulatory compliance, and secure access control across the energy ecosystem. The Circle is designed to foster the development and integration of the EnergyID framework to enable Digital Product Passports (DPPs), e.g. to manage the lifecycle of batteries. For a DPP, this means that information about a product can be stored and updated across a network of various participants (manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, consumers, regulators) without relying on a central entity, making it resistant to censorship and single points of failure. By implementing DPPs, enterprises can drive innovation in electric mobility, enable circular economy practices, and comply with evolving regulatory requirements.</p> What Does the Solution Look&nbsp;Like? <p>At the core of this initiative is the EnergyID DID method, a W3C-compliant Decentralized Identifier (DID) specifically tailored for energy applications. This method provides a secure, tamper-proof way to authenticate energy-related assets, organizations, and individuals. This framework empowers electric mobility providers, distributed energy resource (DER) operators, and digital product passport managers to build trust and security into their transactions, setting a new standard for the industry.</p><p>The solution comprises:</p>  Universal EnergyID Wallet — A digital identity wallet that allows energy stakeholders (such as utilities, DER owners, and EV users) to store and manage their decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials.  Verifiable Credentials (VCs) — These digital attestations enable secure proof of identity, asset ownership, and regulatory compliance in energy transactions.  Interoperability Layer — Designed to integrate with existing identity management systems and ensure compatibility with global standards such as eIDAS&nbsp;2.0.  Trust and Governance Framework — A decentralized governance structure ensuring that credential issuance and verification are secure, reliable, and universally accepted.  <p>How It Works in&nbsp;Practice</p>  For Electric Vehicle Charging: EV owners can use their Universal EnergyID to authenticate at any charging station, ensuring trusted, frictionless access without relying on siloed authentication systems.  For Distributed Energy Resources (DERs): A solar panel or battery storage unit can have a unique, verifiable identity that allows grid operators to authenticate its participation in energy&nbsp;markets.  For Energy Data Sovereignty: Consumers can control who has access to their energy data, ensuring privacy and security while enabling seamless energy transactions.  For Regulatory Compliance: Businesses and energy providers can automatically prove adherence to compliance standards through digitally signed verifiable credentials.  <p>Key Benefits of Universal Energy&nbsp;ID</p>  Unified Identity Management: It provides a single standard for managing identities across energy, electric mobility, and beyond, eliminating fragmentation.  Proven Adoption: Major enterprises and OEMs are already adopting this framework, demonstrating real-world traction.  Regulatory Alignment: Built to align with standards like eIDAS and Digital Product Passports, it ensures both compliance and scalability.  Open and Interoperable: The solution is integrated with leading open-source identity frameworks, including OWF and ACA-Py, making it adaptable to various use&nbsp;cases.  Secure Communication: <a href="http://www.energywebx.com">Worker nodes</a> in Energy Web act as DIDComm mediators and relayers, ensuring secure, reliable communication in decentralized identity ecosystems.  Automated Billing: The system supports automated and trustworthy billing for energy consumed and produced, reducing administrative friction  <p>Join the Movement<br>Energy Web Circles are open to all businesses interested in advancing digitization and decarbonization in the energy sector. Whether you’re an existing Energy Web member or a new partner, your expertise is welcome. By joining a Circle, you&nbsp;will:</p>  Shape Emerging Standards: Play a direct role in developing the technologies and protocols that will define the future of&nbsp;energy.  Access Exclusive Insights: Gain early access to research, reports, and discussions that keep you at the cutting&nbsp;edge.  Collaborate Globally: Work alongside leaders in energy, sustainability, and technology to drive innovation and&nbsp;change.   Call to Action: Join the Universal Energy ID Circle or create your own&nbsp;Circle <p>If digital identity, verifiable credentials, and seamless interoperability in energy can create value for your business, the Universal Energy ID Circle is for you. Whether you’re an enterprise ready to integrate decentralized identity solutions or a regulator committed to enhancing compliance mechanisms, now is the time to get involved. Or do you have a compelling use case or a challenge that could benefit from industry-wide collaboration?</p><p>The future of energy is collaborative, decentralized, and digital.

<p>I started reading <a href="https://boingboing.net/2">BoiongBoing</a> when it was a ‘zine back in the last millennium. I stopped when I began hitting this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In fact I don’t block ads. I block tracking, specifically with <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger,</a> from the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>.</p>
<p>But BoingBoing, like countless other websites, confuses tracking protection with ad blocking. This is because they are in the surveillance-aimed advertising business, aka adtech.</p>
<p>It’s essential to know that adtech is descended from the junk mail business, euphemistically called “direct response marketing.” As I put it in&nbsp;<a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/separating-advertisings-wheat-and-chaff-47858adfcb20#.i6msx57rv">Separating Advertising’s Wheat and Chaff</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember the movie “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>?” (Or the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers_%281978_film%29">remake by the same name</a>?) Same thing here. Madison Avenue fell asleep, direct response marketing ate its brain, and it woke up as an alien replica of itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As surveillance-based publications go, BoingBoing is especially bad. <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/boingboing.net%2F2023%2F11%2F01%2Frob-liefelds-infamous-big-chested-captain-america-artwork-is-up-for-auction.html?f=">Here is a PageXray of BoingBoing.net</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/boingboing.net%2F2023%2F11%2F01%2Frob-liefelds-infamous-big-chested-captain-america-artwork-is-up-for-auction.html%3F_bhlid%3De8eb9749113b90546c13fe8887a19e45cdcdc356?f=">here is a PageXray of the same page’s URL, to which&nbsp; tracking cruft from the email I opened was appended</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/boingboing.net%2F2023%2F11%2F01%2Frob-liefelds-infamous-big-chested-captain-america-artwork-is-up-for-auction.html%3F_bhlid%3De8eb9749113b90546c13fe8887a19e45cdcdc356?f="></a><br>
Look at that: 461 adserver requests, 426 tracking requests, and 199 other requests, which BoingBoing is glad to provide. (Pro tip: always strip tracking cruft from URLs that feature a “?” plus lots of alphanumeric jive after the final / of the URL itself. Take out the “?” and everything after it. )</p>
<p>Here is a close-up of one small part of that vast spread of routes down which data about you flows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some sites, such as <a href="https://www.flightaware.com/">FlightAware</a>, interrupt your experience with a notice that kindly features an X in a corner, so you can make it go away:</p>
<p></p><a href="https://www.flightaware.com/"></a>Which I do.<p></p>
<p>But BoingBoing doesn’t. Its policy is “Subscribe or pay with lost privacy.”&nbsp; So I go away.</p>
<p>Other sites use cookie notices that give you options such as these from a Disney company (I forget which):</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nice that you can Reject All. Which I do.</p>
<p>This one from imgur let’s you “manage” your “options.” Those, if they are kept anywhere (you can’t tell), are in some place you can’t reach or use to see what your setting was, or if they haven’t violated your privacy:</p>
<p></p>This one at Claude defaults to no tracking for marketing purposes (analytics and marketing switches are set to Off):<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>TED here also lets you Accept All or Reject All:</p>

(I chair the working group.) I believe MyTerms is <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">the most important standard in development today</a> because it gets rid of this shit—at least for sites that respect the Reject All signal, plus the millions (perhaps billions?) of sites that don’t participate in the surveillance economy.</p>
<p>With MyTerms, sites and services agree to your terms—not the other way around. And it’s a contract. Also, both sides record the agreement, so either can audit compliance later.</p>
<p>Your agent (typically your browser, through an extension or a header) will choose to proffer one of a small list of contractual agreements maintained by a disinterested nonprofit. <a href="https://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a> was created for this purpose (as a spin-off of ProjectVRM). It will be for <a href="https://customercommons.org/terms/">your terms</a> what <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> is for <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/list.en">your copyright licenses</a>.</p>
<p>Customer Commons also welcomes help standing up the system—and, of course, getting it funded. If you’re interested in working on either or both, talk to me. I’m first name at last name dot com. Thanks!</p>

<p>We have some big news to share! Our parent company, <a href="https://3boxlabs.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">3Box Labs</a>, has merged with <a href="https://x.com/textileio?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Textile</a>. With this, Ceramic is joining the Textile family alongside their other decentralized data solutions, Tableland DB and Basin Network.</p><p>Since Ceramic’s inception, the crypto industry has changed dramatically, and with it, the types of applications developers are building with decentralized and composable data. As AI agents reshape our digital landscape and become the primary producers and consumers of data, they bring needs very familiar to the Ceramic community: decentralized storage for knowledge and memory, open composability for sharing between agents, and streaming for real-time publishing and subscriptions.</p><p>Going forward, we have a vision for Ceramic as a foundational component of something much bigger than itself: an open intelligence network where AI agents can autonomously buy and sell intelligence from each other on-demand.

<p>On January 31, Christopher Allen spoke with Mathieu Glaude at the SSI Orbit Podcast on the controversial topic <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/ssi-bankruptcy/">“Has Our SSI Ecosystem Become Morally Bankrupt?”</a>. Following the video link, below, are Christopher’s Musings  on the topic, overviewing some of the material from the video.</p>

 



 
    
   

<p>The legitimacy of the modern self-sovereign identity (SSI) industry is a vital question to ask, because in the last year I’ve become to wonder if DIDs and VCs could actually lose. In my opinion, the main threat is that we made compromises in the development of these new self-sovereign technologies that led to them not being differentiated from centralized identity. We betrayed our principles.</p>

<p>But that was actually a pretty small portion of a wide-ranging discussion of identity between myself and Mathieu that I hope you’ll listen to. It also covered my history, the history of SSI, the ideals of SSI, how we’re losing them, and where that could lead us. (Spoiler: it’s not a good place.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We’ve seen what happens when you have too much control in a single authority … and we’re forgetting those lessons. We have to minimize the risks when [authorities] are wrong or their powers are abused.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My own history in the cryptography &amp; identity field dates back to meeting the founders of the Xanada Project, working with RSA, writing SSLRef, coauthoring TLS, and working with elliptic curves. This history all offers ideas for digital identity! For example, Xanadu was one of the inspirations for my ideas of edge identifiers &amp; cryptographic cliques that I recently released.</p>

<p>I also talked about how self-sovereign identity, DIDs, and VCs all matured at Rebooting the Web of Trust. Early on, we worked with experts from the UN and people working with the refuge crisis. We had all the right ingredients! But it’s so easy to lose the ideals behind a technology. Groupware lost its collaborative processes. TLS became centralized. We had ten principles for self-sovereign identity, but they’ve been somewhat lost.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Somehow we disconnect our words from where the real power is, which is anti-coercion and anti-violence.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always intended those principles to be a starting point. I was surprised when folks at RWOT weren’t interested in reviewing and revising them. Now, that disinterest has resulted in SSI technology that’s losing against MDLs and other centralized tech. Part of the problem is that privacy doesn’t seem important to people. I think it’s a vocabulary disconnect. Privacy allows us to avoid violence and coercion. Maybe those are the words we need to concentrate on!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we’ve seen what happens if we walk this path. Jacobus Lentz’s enthusiastic identity work leading up to WWII led to genocide in the Netherlands. That’s what happens when identity is centralized.</p>

<p>We need to talk more about all of these aspects of identity, so that the digital identity of the 21st century protects our basic human rights. I hope you’ll join me in discussion here or in the Youtube comments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Articulate your values, your own principles, and begin to evaluate your work, your priorities through those lenses. You may find that a very small difference in the choices you make could have big impact because they were informed by your values.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why You Should Consider the FDO Standard for Zero-Trust Device Onboarding</p>



 1. Executive Summary 



<p>IoT and edge computing solutions are exploding as manufacturers are looking for new ways to modernize their operations and accelerate production. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/nternet-of-Things-IoT-connected-devices-from-2015-to-2025-in-billions_fig1_325645304#:~:text=As%20shown%20in%20Fig.,%2C14%5D.%20...">By 2025, over 75 billion IoT devices will be connected globally.</a> The industrial IoT market, which spans industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and retail is <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5359988/industrial-iot-market-by-offering-hardware">valued at USD 194 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 286 billion by 2029</a>. This surge unlocks immense opportunities and innovation for businesses and manufacturers alike. However, keeping up with the pace of demand for these devices and deploying them sustainably has created unprecedented challenges.</p>



<p>Namely, two key factors have the potential to derail the edge revolution entirely:</p>



 
 Costly and inefficient installation processes 



 Security vulnerabilities 
 



 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Guide-Onboarding-the-Future-Edge-Deployment-FDO-FIDO-Alliance-2025.pdf">Download the FDO Guide</a> 
 



 2. What is Onboarding? 



<p>When an edge node or IoT device is installed in a facility, the device must be onboarded to its management platform hosted in the building or in the cloud.</p>



 The Onboarding Challenge 



<p>Device onboarding at scale is expensive and can introduce significant risks if not done properly. Meanwhile, typical manual onboarding processes and default passwords have created severe vulnerabilities, with <a href="https://iotbusinessnews.com/download/white-papers/UNIT42-IoT-Threat-Report.pdf#:~:text=57%%20of%20IoT%20devices%20are%20vulnerable%20to,and%20password%20attacks%20using%20default%20device%20passwords.">57% of IoT devices vulnerable to medium or high-severity attacks</a>.<br></p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nearly half (48%) of critical infrastructure security leaders reported experiencing at least one major security impact due to a compromised device within the last year.</p>
</blockquote>



 What is FIDO Device Onboarding (FDO)? 



<p>FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) is a revolutionary standard designed to simplify, secure, and automate the onboarding process for IoT and edge devices. FDO simplifies device onboarding in edge and&nbsp; IoT computing environments with a plug and play, zero trust approach embedded in the specification. Developed by industry leaders like Arm, Amazon, Google, Intel, Microsoft and Qualcomm, the specification is one of the first openly available standards designed specifically to solve edge and&nbsp; IoT onboarding challenges: time-intensive, complex manual processes, high costs, and security vulnerabilities. It is targeted at industrial, medical, automotive, IT and retail use cases and is complemented by an independent certification program.&nbsp;</p>



 3. The Overlooked Opportunity and Risk 



<p>With the introduction of AI, a new layer of complexity was added to the edge challenge. Organizations are now hyper-focused on AI adoption and its promise of smarter, faster, and more efficient operations, but without addressing foundational IoT security, these ambitions are at risk of being undermined.</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance Device Onboard (FDO) provides the answer, offering a zero trust, plug and play standard that accelerates deployments while safeguarding infrastructure. In today’s challenging economic climate, automating zero-touch device onboarding enables leaders to deliver ambitious digital transformation projects with limited resources and budgets, saving installation costs, accelerating time-to-value, and improving security. FDO is an open standard that allows users to innovate. FDO’s zero-trust approach is an important piece of the IoT security puzzle and sets the stage for future AI updates inside protected enclaves.</p>



 Which industries benefit from FDO? 



IndustriesAutomotiveHealthcareChemicalManufacturingConsumer goods manufacturingOil and GasEnergyRetailEducationSupply chain and logisticsEnterprise and NetworkingTelecommunications



 What Device Types Can Be Enabled with FDO? 



Device TypesExamplesIoT sensors and devicesTemperature sensorsPressure sensors&nbsp;Motion detectorsWater quality monitorsSmart thermostatsConnected industrial equipmentSmart camerasWi-Fi-enabled cameras<br>Camera systemsEdge serversEdge serversMobile edge computing (MEC) serversNetworking equipmentRoutersSwitches&nbsp;Gateways5G small cellsIndustrial PCs and controllersIndustrial PCsProgrammable logic controllers (PLCs)Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs)



<p>Just as passkeys revolutionized user authentication, FDO is transforming device onboarding in edge computing and IoT environments.</p>



 Key Features of FDO 



<p>The key features of FDO include:</p>



 
 Late binding: Late binding saves money and time as FDO-enabled devices can be onboarded to any platform without the need for unique customization. This reduces the number of device SKUs needed versus other onboarding solutions. It ensures devices are authenticated and provisioned properly for the device recipient after ownership is verified. 



 Plug and Play: Whereas manual onboarding requires expensive, skilled technicians, FDO is highly automated, often allowing semi-skilled staff to carry out the installation. This is important in markets such as retail where FDO will allow the store manager to do the installation rather than needing to bring in an expensive IT expert. 



 Ownership voucher: Device ownership is established and transferred securely in the supply chain with the “ownership voucher,” which uses cryptographic authentication protocols in the FDO specification to verify the device recipient’s physical and digital ownership. 



 Zero-touch and zero trust: Combined, these attributes establish a zero trust approach that covers end-to-end device onboarding using embedded, cryptographic protocols, and sequential processes to perform initial onboarding actions securely and quickly. The zero trust strategy covers both the device and the management platform during the onboarding process. 
 



 FDO for AI and Additional Features 



<p>FDO is designed to permit a secure subsystem to onboard independently and securely from the rest of the system. This makes FDO an excellent candidate for updating AI models deployed in edge secure enclaves from a cloud repository.</p>



<p>Additional features include:</p>



 
 Interoperability with OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) 



 Wi-Fi ready 



 Flexible configurations for cloud, multi-cloud, and closed network environments with multi-tenant and cloud servers 



 Multiple open source implementation methods available 
 







 3. FDO Certified Products 



<p>The FIDO Alliance is an open industry association with a mission to reduce the world’s reliance on passwords. Consisting of the biggest global tech organizations and experts in cybersecurity, identity, and authentication, the alliance has a proven track record in transforming consumer authentication with passkeys.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>In two years since the initial launch, passkeys have been enabled on 20% of the world’s top 100 websites and over 15 billion accounts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The FIDO Alliance has launched this complementary independent certification program that brings additional value to end users and solution providers alike. It assures that FDO certified solutions meet all the specifications, that devices comply with all security requirements, and have been tested for interoperability with other products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FDO Certified products bring considerable additional value to end users by offering:</p>



 
 Guaranteed interoperability and security assurance 



 Faster deployments and time to value&nbsp; 



 Greater efficiencies 



 Assures security and interoperability, eliminating the need for time-consuming vendor bake-offs with uncertified or homebrewed onboarding solutions 
 



<p>Now FIDO is applying this expertise to improve device authentication in industrial IoT and edge computing environments. FDO ensures devices and edge nodes can quickly and securely authenticate and connect online during initial deployment.</p>



 4. On the Edge: The Urgency to Secure and Simplify Device Security 



<p>Operational bottlenecks are a significant challenge in both industrial and commercial sectors. Manual, unsecured device onboarding not only consumes time and resources but also increases the risk of breaches. According to Microsoft’s recent white paper, <a href="https://clouddamcdnprodep.azureedge.net/gdc/gdcQll0SB/original">How to Scale Intelligent Factory Initiatives Through an Adaptive Cloud Approach</a>, today’s manufacturing leaders are burdened with “technical sprawl and inefficiencies that create major obstacles to being able to scale solutions – including AI – to multiple production lines and geographically dispersed factories.”</p>



<p>This technical sprawl has led to data silos and management complexities, hindering global visibility and scalability. Ultimately, this prohibits the promise of connected devices from being realized in any industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The average cost of a data breach in 2023 was <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">$4.88 million</a> (USD).</p>



<p>Edge implementations involve a lot of risk. Often these edge nodes are used in remote, precarious, and high-risk environments. Industries like healthcare, energy, and manufacturing face unique challenges and regulations, such as vulnerable patient monitoring systems, hazardous environments, and risks to complex supply chains. To make matters more complex, new threats are constantly emerging, such as the rise of quantum computing and zero-day exploits.</p>



<p>Some companies may feel that they can develop their own proprietary onboarding solution, but given today’s economic pressures and the growing threat landscape, businesses often simply cannot afford to develop and maintain proprietary solutions or risk a preventable breach.</p>



 FDO and AI: A Symbiotic Future 



<p>Edge and IoT are also the “eyes and ears” of AI, collecting and transmitting data for analysis. There is a huge risk in overlooking IoT security and threats such as data poisoning, which can cripple AI models reliant on real-time data. Securing the foundation of edge and IoT is essential to unlock the full potential of AI.</p>



<p>AI systems depend on clean, reliable data streams. A compromised IoT device does not just threaten the device itself – it can corrupt AI models, disrupt decision-making, and open doors to adversarial attacks. FDO’s zero trust onboarding ensures these vulnerabilities are eliminated from the start.</p>



 5. What Problems Does FDO Solve? 



 
 Human error: <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">34% of data breaches involve human error</a> – FDO minimizes this with automation and a zero-touch approach.&nbsp; 



 Time-intensive and inefficient deployments: FDO can deploy 10 times faster than manual methods. It dramatically reduces the time and budget needed to hire skilled technicians in high-risk environments, like oil rigs and factories. In some applications, such as retail, existing on-site staff can install FDO as it is plug and play technology. 



 Market speed to innovation: Open standards help advance innovation and level the competitive playing field. By standardizing processes, providers can focus on truly adding value to their solutions. For customers, they can benefit from better solutions that are faster to deploy and more secure. 
 







 Device Security Risks&nbsp; – The Supply Chain Lifecycle 



<p>Stage 1: Manufacturing<br>Risk: Supply chain compromises (i.e., tampered devices)<br>FDO: Establishes cryptographic ownership during manufacturing, ensuring device integrity</p>



<p>Stage 2: Shipment and storage<br>Risk: Device ownership asset mismanagement<br>FDO: Tracks and secures ownership transfers, maintaining a secure chain of custody</p>



<p>Stage 3: Onboarding and deployment<br>Risk: Exposures from default passwords and manual installation errors<br>FDO: Eliminates passwords and human errors with plug and play device onboarding and zero-touch automation</p>



<p>Stage 4: Operations&nbsp;<br>Risk: Insecure data transmission, spoofing and infiltration<br>FDO: Encrypts data exchanges and ensures ongoing device authentication&nbsp;</p>



 6. Benefits of FDO for Enterprises and Providers 



<p>Standards are vital to unlocking the full potential of any major global technology innovation. Global industry standard initiatives help remove huge amounts of waste, advance technology far more quickly, and increase market competitiveness. Standards also provide long-term security. As threats evolve, experts in the field continue to evolve the standards to keep up.</p>



<p>The FDO standards have been developed and backed by the best companies in the industry, including Microsoft, Dell, and Intel. Experts from these organizations proactively work together to develop use cases and best practices for seamless and secure IoT device authentication, provisioning, and also support the adoption and implementation of the FDO standard.</p>



<p>The FDO standard is also continuously improved within the FIDO Alliance. In the last two years, several Application Notes have been released to deal with implementation and other areas related to FDO 1.1. The newest version of the standard, FDO 1.2, is currently in development with new enterprise-ready features and is expected to be released in 2025.</p>



<p>Benefits for enterprises:</p>



 
 Protect devices and supply chains with zero trust security. 



 Integration is flexible with existing systems.&nbsp; 



 Reduce the need to develop and manage your own testing requirements and protocols – buy with confidence with FDO certified products.&nbsp; 



 Reduce time to market/deployment and increase value. 
 



<p>Benefits for providers:</p>



 
 Leverage FDO certification as a competitive advantage. Ensure compatibility and earn customer trust with external independent validation. This becomes increasingly valuable as market adoption rises and FDO is increasingly referenced in Requests for Proposals (RFPs). 
 



 
 Realize hardware efficiencies, simplify production, and reduce waste. As with FDO, operating systems can be deployed on-site and do not need to be hard programmed in. This capability is now part of an active workstream within the FDO Working Group called “Bare Metal Onboarding”. 



 Fast-track solution development with confidence. 



 Free engineer time to focus on higher value projects rather than waste time with manual or proprietary onboarding solutions. Offer a faster, more efficient solution to customers.<br> 
 



<blockquote>
<p>“Deploying FDO has marked a pivotal shift for ASRock Industrial, establishing a new benchmark in secure, scalable onboarding for industrial edge IoT solutions.

<p>I recently wrote about <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/ValuesDesign/">“How My Values Inform Design”</a>. There I discussed the issue of autonomy and how it can be supported by progressive trust, proof against coercion, and other rights. One of the technical elements that I mentioned as a requirement was “[Tools that] enable meaningful participation in the digital economy.”</p>

<p>This is the freedom to transact. It’s a right that remains conspicuously absent from the foundational rights enshrined in the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)</a>, which stands as a pillar of human dignity and freedom. But without it, the other rights articulated in the UDHR risk being rendered ineffective or hollow.</p>

<p>It’s so crucial because economic agency forms the bedrock upon which many fundamental freedoms rest. For instance, Freedom of Movement and Residence, core to personal autonomy, become less meaningful when an individual cannot engage in transactions necessary to secure housing or travel. Similarly, the right to property—the ability to own, buy, and sell—is directly dependent on the freedom to transact. Without access to economic exchange, these rights are significantly curtailed, reducing individuals to passive observers rather than active participants in their own lives.</p>

<p>Consider constitutional liberties like Freedom of Expression and Peaceful Association. These rights presuppose economic participation: the ability to rent venues, purchase communication tools, and access the materials necessary for organizing and disseminating ideas. Without the economic means to support these activities, these freedoms are stripped of their practical utility.</p>

<p>The introduction of an international right to Freedom to Transact would bolster the entire framework of human rights by guaranteeing that individuals can exercise their freedoms without undue restrictions on their economic autonomy. It would ensure that human dignity, as envisioned in the UDHR, is not constrained by arbitrary barriers to economic agency. By codifying this right, we would affirm that economic freedom is as essential to the human condition as freedom of thought, religion, or expression.</p>

<p>This proposed right would also address systemic inequalities and empower marginalized communities by ensuring that all individuals, regardless of nationality, socioeconomic status, or geographic location, can engage fully in the global economy. In doing so, we cement the idea that economic agency is not a privilege but a fundamental human right.</p>

<p>As the world grapples with digital transformation, financial innovation, and increasing geopolitical complexities, the necessity of a Freedom to Transact has never been clearer. It is time to elevate this principle to its rightful place alongside the other freedoms in the UDHR, securing a more equitable and dignified future for all.</p>

<p>Ngā mihi nui kia koutou katoa, warm greetings to you.</p>



<p><br>I do hope you’ve had some R&amp;R over the holiday break. However long it was, it’s never long enough!<br><br>DINZ has powered into the New Year early with its traditional Summer Series, which started last week to take advantage of global standards expert and my longtime friend Andrew Hughes being in the country for ISO SC37 (Biometrics) meetings. Despite holidays we had a fantastic turnout for ‘Deepfakes &amp; ID verification: Your standards survival kit for the modern age’.&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/1048766175?share=copy">View the video recording here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Next in the Summer Series is&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/payments-for-the-next-generation/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=70d16c379b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_03_18_11_43_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-5d57a7a812-">‘Payments for the Next Generation’</a>, led by DINZ member Payments NZ. This session aims to inform and seek feedback from the DINZ community on the digital identity component of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/our-work/next-generation-payments/">strategic paper currently out for consultation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>The following months will see sessions led by other DINZ members relating to the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2025/01/28/digital-identity-services-trust-framework/">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework&nbsp;</a>and the digital trust ecosystem more broadly. Stay tuned for further announcements. Speaking of members, it’s great to welcome recent new members&nbsp;<a href="https://cianaatech.com/">Cianaa Technologies</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://secyour.co/">SecYour</a>. Among other things Cianaa is in the business of evaluating service providers under the DISTF and SecYour is in the business of providing identity services. Just coincidental; no connection between them is implied!&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Don’t forget DINZ’s monthly virtual Coffee Chat series starts next week. Last year’s registrants were given priority and are re-registering. So don’t delay,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/dinz-virtual-coffee-chat-series-2025/">register&nbsp;</a>now.</p>



<p><br>The year-end brings a flurry of public sector announcements and this year was no exception. First up was the NZ Banking Association’s announcement of the launch of GetVerified – the name for the confirmation of payee service that banks will be progressively rolling out. I’ve selected&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/banking-ombudsman_banks-have-begun-introducing-a-confirmation-activity-7272735994255171584-TPFl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android">this post</a>&nbsp;to give you the contextual low-down. Then just before the break, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner announced the long expected&nbsp;<a href="https://privacy.org.nz/publications/statements-media-releases/privacy-commissioner-announces-intent-to-issue-biometrics-code/">Code of Practice for Biometrics</a>. As you’ll see from our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/submissions/">submission page</a>, DINZ has consistently argued for detailed guidance first, with regulation for exceptions or repeated poor implementation, because regulation creates some negative effects with unintended consequences. Nonetheless, we are where we are and DINZ will help members however it can.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>On the international front NHI (Non Human Identity, once termed NPE ‘Non Person Entity’) is happily returning to ‘top of mind’ with this from&nbsp;<a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/owasp-nhi-top-10/">OWASP</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inidsol.uk/about.html">Romek&nbsp;</a>also covered this in his weekly email and my long-time fellow Identerati travellers Mike Schwartz and Heather Flanagan shared&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hlflanagan_episode-78-the-2025-nhi-cybersecurity-landscape-activity-7284988974748614656-Md4B?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android">this very interesting post</a>&nbsp;(note that with her IDPro hat on, Heather&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_pv5wLMNAo">interviewed</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">DINZ Exec Councillor Abhi Bandopadhyay</a>). Again, I’ve chosen a link that I think provides more colour and flavour to the discussion. And with matters raised here very much in mind, take a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/open-wallet-foundation_20250109-identity-sig-call-youtube-activity-7283648811506266112-mStk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android">this announcement from DINZ liaison member OWF</a>&nbsp;as we progress towards the pointy end of digital wallet development (is it ‘a thing’ long term though?).</p>



<p><br>Last but not least, DINZ Chair 2022-2024 Paul Platen drew key statistics from this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scworld.com/resource/identity-security-challenges-and-best-practices">SC Media</a>&nbsp;article. Very poignant, posing the question what Aotearoa’s equivalent numbers would be. Take a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7282954233878880257/">Paul’s post here</a>.</p>



<p><br>I’m looking forward to the year ahead, with projects in DINZ Working Groups and Special Interest Groups, and sharing co-created papers on barriers to Fintech innovation and competition that we are undertaking in collaboration with relevant public and private sector bodies. With Minister Bayly’s oversight I think this will lead to positive change. All up, I really do think that 2025 can be the year we make Digital Trust real.&nbsp;</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Last week Apple default-enabled all apps (native and 3rd party) to Siri “learning”. I thought I’d wrap up with a reflection on Apple’s action and whether the concern was warranted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial reaction for most of us was, “Oh great. Yet another forced offering to the great AI gods. No thank you!” I and others had a strong kneejerk reaction of “this is NOT ok.” Was the initial reaction warranted? Figure 1 shows my original LinkedIn posts below, which were updated real time as I continued to explore the situation.<br>
</p>
 <p>Figure 1</p> 
<p>When I took a closer look, Apple clearly tries to make Siri as “edge-y” as possible—i.e. executing independently on the device to the extent possible. But how safe is the architecture? What data exactly gets shared and with what parts of Apple’s infrastructure? This is the problem with all the large platforms: we just can’t observe server-to-server behaviors within the infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what I do know. Apple’s action was surprisingly presumptuous and disrespectful to their users. It was markedly off-brand for the privacy-evangelizing company, and their actions (or inactions, as the case may be) since the time this flared up are telling.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>After the dust has settled, I stand by my recommendation to disable Siri learning, and I’m less concerned about Siri suggestions. Here’s why.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Apple did this in a sneaky way. Not at all on-brand for a privacy-touting company.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 It’s at least the second time Apple behaved in this way in recent days. On January 3, 2025, The Register reported that Apple auto-opted everyone into AI analysis of their photos <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/03/apple_enhanced_visual_search/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/03/apple_enhanced_visual_search/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 You may have missed it, but on January 8, 2025 Apple issued a press release pretty much saying, “Siri’s super private—hooray!” This is most likely when the auto-opt in happened, though I have no supporting evidence. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/our-longstanding-privacy-commitment-with-siri/">https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/our-longstanding-privacy-commitment-with-siri/</a> Coincidence? Hard to think so. Also the language in the press release raises more questions than answers:<br>
<p></p>
 
 
 
 “Siri Uses On-Device Processing Where Possible” Great. We’d like to know more about that.&nbsp; 
 “…the audio of user requests is processed entirely on device using the Neural Engine, unless a user chooses to share it with Apple.” Like, if they toggle a setting for Siri Learning to “enabled”, for example? Like that kind of “choosing” to share it with Apple?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 “Apple Minimizes the Amount of Data Collected for Siri Requests” Ok, but it’s not zero.
 
 Goes on to say, “certain features require real-time input from Apple servers.” Careful wording here. I’d like more info on the data that gets sent to the Apple servers, and how it’s used. 
 The press release segues right into this: “a random identifier&nbsp; – a long string of letters and numbers associated with a single device…is used to keep track of data while it’s being processed, rather than tying it to a&nbsp; user’s identity through their Apple Account or phone number”. I find that phrasing curious. Note that it says, “associated with a single device” and NOT “associated with a single device for a single query”. Is the identifier long-lived? Is the identifier in fact some kind of internal Apple universal identifier for you—a join key assembling an ever-growing biographical log of you [like virtually everyone else in martech and edtech]? Any kind of permanent, unique identifier is risky and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. I really hope I’m wrong on this.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Private Cloud Compute” This sounds promising but we’re going to need some more info about this.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 “…many of the models that power Apple Intelligence run entirely on device.” But apparently some don’t. Again, going to need more details here.&nbsp; 
 
 
 It was obnoxiously difficult to unwind this default opt-in. You couldn’t just go to Settings -&gt; Apps, you also had to go to Settings -&gt; Siri to get all the apps. Think about this. This is Apple, the company who (according to many) was the epitome of usable design. I think about Jony Ive and Steve Jobs—would they stand behind this kind of user interaction? 
 Siri learning was enabled for Every. Single. App. Including native Passwords, Phone, Apple Home, and Health Data. I get that there are legitimate reasons why Siri learning should be connected for every app—e.g. people who must use voice as their primary mode of device interaction. I’m surprised, however, that they didn’t think it might be a tad risky to be auto-enabled for things like Passwords for everyone. It feels weirdly clumsy for a company not known for clumsiness. (Unless you’re building a training set for an LLM in which case it makes complete sense.)&nbsp;
 
 NB: I still can’t find a way to disable it from Calendar. 
 
 
 Disabling Siri learning and suggestions has done some weird things to non-voice interactions on my phone which makes me wonder just how interwoven Siri is within all modes of user interaction, beyond just voice interaction. Example: voice note recorder stopped showing text on the record button and it no longer supports “resume [recording]”; it now just ends the recording and I need to start a new one if I want to extend the recording with a new idea. I thought Siri was just supposed to be about voice interaction? Apparently not. (Note: upon re-enabling Siri Learning and Siri suggestions, the text under the button and the resume function re-appeared. Huh.)
 
 Apple Magazine’s (November 25, 2024) piece on the forthcoming Siri revamp reinforces the fact that the boundaries of what is and isn’t “Siri” are hazy indeed (Figure 2). The story affirms that the Siri update touches multimodal interaction capabilities.<br>
 
 
 
 
 <p>Figure 2: Source <a href="https://applemagazine.com/siri-engine-revamp-what-apples-next/">https://applemagazine.com/siri-engine-revamp-what-apples-next/</a></p> 
<p>One starts to wonder, what isn’t Siri when it comes to user interface and interaction? And also wondering where Siri begins and ends in terms of software execution and data access. This year is already touted as the year for agentic AI—what could be more agentic than AI-infused Siri?</p>
 
 
 For me, the biggest smoking gun is that late last year Apple announced that Siri will be powered by Apple’s LLM (<a href="https://superchargednews.com/2024/11/21/llm-siri-to-launch-by-spring-2026/">https://superchargednews.com/2024/11/21/llm-siri-to-launch-by-spring-2026/</a> ). First off “powering Siri” with Apple’s LLM already sets off some alarm bells. The timing of this forced opting–in to Siri Learning seems quite aligned with the development timeline of an LLM said to be launching in late 2025/2026. “The new Siri will be powered by Apple’s advanced Large Language Models (LLM), which will make the digital assistant more conversational and ChatGPT-like.” I can’t really imagine a world where Apple wouldn’t train their LLM off their current customer base. 
 Siri Architecture: Because I love architecture and because I can remember when Siri was a baby 3rd party app, I wanted to go back and take a brief look at its evolving architecture. As of 2017, the Siri architecture was a poster child of typical app client-server architecture and the reliance on the server is clear (Figure 2), with even the trigger words audio being sent to the server. 
 
 
 <p>Figure 3: Source <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/hey-siri">https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/hey-siri</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>2017 is, of course, ancient times in developer years and Apple has been relatively transparent about how they’ve been rearchitecting Siri to [at least] keep the trigger word detection on the device (<a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/voice-trigger">https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/voice-trigger</a>).</p>
 
 The last thing I want to mention is that Apple has been preternaturally silent about this whole thing. I find that remarkably off-brand. Unless Siri and Apple AI are inextricably interwoven and this was actually a training set creation exercise, in which case, probably best to keep silent. 
 
<p>Is Apple training their LLM via the forced Siri Learning opt-in? Maybe. Will be good to hear from them on this. And while we’re at it, I’d love a new “revamped” Siri and Apple LLM architecture diagram/document, with greater transparency and detailed information on the functionality distribution and data sharing between the device and back-end servers and services. Please and thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Core of Passkey Technology</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a>, a breakthrough in the realm of digital security, eliminate the vulnerabilities of password-based systems. Utilizing cryptographic key pairs, passkeys are designed to safeguard user identities without relying on shared secrets. The system operates on a challenge-response mechanism: a private key stored securely on the user’s device interacts with a public key on the service provider’s server. This interaction ensures that sensitive credentials are never exposed, making passkeys inherently resistant to phishing attempts and credential theft.</p>



<p>This technology is underpinned by the FIDO2 standard, which comprises WebAuthn and the Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP). WebAuthn facilitates seamless integration of passkeys into web applications, while CTAP supports communication between devices and authenticators, ensuring flexibility and security. Together, these components offer a standardized and robust framework for passwordless authentication across various platforms.</p>

<p>Since the inception of the internet,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager">passwords</a>&nbsp;have been the primary authentication factor to gain access to online accounts. Yubico’s recent Global State of Authentication survey of 20,000&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/best-employee-management-software-of-year">employees</a>&nbsp;found that 58 percent still use a username and password to login to personal accounts, with 54 percent using this login method to access work accounts.</p>



<p>This is despite the fact that 80 percent of breaches today are a result of stolen login credentials from attacks like phishing. Because of this, passwords are widely understood by security experts as the most insecure authentication method that leaves individuals, organizations and their employees around the world vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated modern cyber attacks like phishing.</p>

<p>The digital economy continues to rely on password-based authentication, but password weaknesses — and human nature — make them horrible for security. Password use also impacts businesses’ bottom lines because every year, forgotten passwords and password resets result in millions of dollars of lost sales and wasted IT staff hours.</p>



<p>It’s a “password tax” on businesses and consumers that no one can seem to get past.</p>



<p>As the digital economy has grown, so has the value associated with passwords. As a result,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/How-to-avoid-phishing-hooks-A-checklist-for-your-end-users">phishing</a>&nbsp;and credential theft continue to run rampant, with stolen credentials sold openly on the dark web.</p>



<p>To protect people, organizations add more friction and worsen UX. They ask users to create long and complex passwords, change passwords every few months and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Traditional-MFA-isnt-enough-phishing-resistant-MFA-is-key">use MFA</a>. This results in lost sales, reduced company productivity and added costs.</p>



<p>A secure alternative to the password has emerged:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Passkey-vs-password-What-is-the-difference">passkeys</a>. This option can strengthen organizations’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/security-posture">security posture</a>&nbsp;because <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a> have the potential to generate billions in revenue and cost savings for businesses.</p>

<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> are the future of authentication, offering enhanced security and convenience over passwords, but widespread adoption faces challenges that the NCSC is working to resolve.</p>



 What’s wrong with passwords – why do we need passkeys? 



<p>Most cyber harms that affect citizens occur through abuse of legitimate credentials. That is, attackers have obtained the victim’s password somehow – whether by phishing or exploiting the fact the passwords are weak or have been reused.</p>



<p>Passwords are just not a good way to authenticate users on the modern internet (and arguably weren’t suitable back in the 1970s when the internet was used by just a few academics). Adding a strong – phishing-resistant – second factor to passwords definitely helps, but not everyone does this and not every type of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is strong.</p>

<p>In 2024, the OriginTrail ecosystem achieved remarkable milestones, driving innovation in decentralized knowledge and AI integration. The three stages (or impact bases) of the <a href="https://origintrail.io/blog/the-v8-foundation">V8 Foundation</a> were formulated as inspired by the legendary works of Isaac Asimov. They prophetically symbolize steps towards the future where the reliable and trusted knowledge base or Collective neuro-symbolic AI drives synergies between AI agents and the Autonomous Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) in a human-centric way.</p><p>The updated roadmap recaps the most important achievements of the past year, and highlights the road ahead (full updated <a href="https://origintrail.io/ecosystem/roadmap">roadmap available here</a>).</p><p>The year kicked off with the establishment of the Impact Base: Trantor (home to the Library of Trantor, where librarians systematically indexed human knowledge in a groundbreaking collaborative effort), which catalyzed key advancements, including Knowledge Mining, which introduced Initial Paranet Offerings (IPOs) and autonomous knowledge mining initiatives. Simultaneously, the release of delegated staking enabled TRAC delegation for network utility and security, enhancing inclusivity and participation in DKG infrastructure.</p><p>Following Trantor, Impact Base: Terminus was activated with key catalysts for adoption, including multichain growth, integrating DKG with the Base blockchain ecosystem, and implementing transformative scalability solutions such as asynchronous backing on NeuroWebAI blockchain on Polkadot and batch minting features.</p><p>The introduction of ChatDKG.ai revolutionized interaction with DKG and paranets, integrating AI models across platforms like Google Vertex AI, OpenAI, and <a href="https://origintrail.io/blog/trace-labs-joins-nvidia-inception-program-to-advance-the-verifiable-internet-for-ai">NVIDIA</a>. Meanwhile, the release of Whitepaper 3.0 outlined the vision of a Verifiable Internet for AI, bridging crypto, Web3, and AI technologies to address misinformation and data integrity challenges.</p><p>The deployment of <a href="https://x.com/origin_trail/status/1872672016857542716">OriginTrail V8</a> and its Edge Nodes brought Internet-scale to the ecosystem.

 Making Visions Reality 

<p>We’ve often written in our yearly reports that the goal of Blockchain Commons is “the creation of open, interoperable, secure &amp; compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online”. Our architecture is ultimately based on these and other values, as Christopher wrote in <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/ValuesDesign/">“How My Values Inform Design”</a>, which we published at the start of this year.</p>

<p>Obviously, we can’t just create infrastructure on our own, so we’ve worked toward our values-focused goals by bringing principals together for regular <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/">developer meetings</a> and by advocating for the adoption of specifications that we believe achieve these goals (and in many cases by creating those specifications ourselves).</p>

<p>In 2024, much of our work in this regard focused on three different specifcations: dCBOR, Envelope, and FROST.</p>

 dCBOR 

<p><a href="https://cbor.me/"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/dcbor/">dCBOR</a> is our deterministic profile for the CBOR data format. We adopted CBOR itself for <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/introduction/Why-CBOR/">a variety of reasons</a>, including it being self-describing, extensible, and great for constrained devices. However it had one lack (for our purposes): you couldn’t guarantee that two different devices would encode the same data in the same way, at least not for a variety of weird edge cases (such as whether “1.0” and “1” get encoded the same way, and what you should do for maps with illegally duplicated keys, and how to deal with NaN). This was problematic when we were developing Gordian Envelope, which depends on the same data always being represented the same way so that it always hashes the same—hence the need for dCBOR.</p>

<p>dCBOR received a lot of attention from us in the first half of 2024. We went through <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/">five drafts</a> of the specification, revising some of our original definitions and incorporating things like Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC). We’re very grateful to our partners from the IETF CBOR group who laid a foundation for us with the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cbor-cde/">CBOR Common Deterministic Encoding draft</a>, which has been advancing in parallel with dCBOR, and who helped us fill in these gaps in dCBOR itself. We increasingly think we have a strong foundation for deterministic CBOR, as seen by its incorporation into <a href="https://cbor.me/">the CBOR playground</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/cabo/cbor-dcbor">variety</a> <a href="https://github.com/hildjj/cbor2">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR">libraries</a>.</p>

<p>Implementation by two or more parties is always our mark of success for a Blockchain Commons specification, and we exceeded that for dCBOR in 2024.</p>

 Envelope 

<p>Of course dCBOR is just the prelude. Our work on dCBOR was done to make <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a>  a reality. Gordian Envelope is our “smart document” format for the storage and transmission of data. It’s focused on privacy and more specifically on the goals of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">data minimization &amp; selective disclosure</a>. More and more personal data is going online, and so we need data formats where we each control our own data and decide what to disclose to whom. That’s what the hashed data elision of Gordian Envelope allows: any holder of data can choose what’s redacted, without changing the validity of the data package.</p>

<p>One thing we increasingly saw in 2024 was the need to better explain Envelope: its advantages, how it works, and why it’s important. We kicked that off with a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/2024/03-18/presentation.pdf">presentation to the IETF</a> on why hashed data ellision is important. We also produced a trio of videos on Envelope: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDI5ihfTB2Y">a teaser</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vcLCFKQvik">“Understanding Gordian Envelope”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFxStP3ATkw">“Understanding Gordian Envelope Extensions”</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we’re continuing to extend Gordian Envelope.</p>

<p>To start with, we’ve done a lot more with the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-014-gstp.md">Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol (GSTP)</a> extension that we introduced right at the end of 2023, to support the transmission of sensitive data across telecommunications means that are insecure, unreliable, or both! A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDf2cmfX1k">feature presentation on the underlying Request/Response system</a>, explained the fundamentals followed by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnH14LkJOnI">feature presentation on GSTP itself</a>, which detailed what GSTP looks like now. Our new <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/gstp/">GSTP developer page</a> has even more info. We’ve also done some investigation into using <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/musig/sequence/">GSTP with MuSig2</a>.</p>

<p>We also introduced <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/xid/">XIDs</a>, or Extensible Identifiers, a new decentralized identifier that’s built using Envelopes. You can experiment with it in code with our new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-xid-rust">bc-xid-rust library</a>. Decentralized identifiers have been one of our major interests since the topic was first considered at the first <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">Rebooting the Web of Trust workshop</a>, but they’ve never been a big focus at Blockchain Commons due to the simple fact that we haven’t had a patron focused on the topic. (If that could be you, <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a>!) We were happy to finally offer a little bit of our own on the topic by presenting an ID that’s really decentralized.</p>

<p>Other Envelope experiments in 2024 were about <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-006-envelope-graph.md">graphs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-007-envelope-decorrelation.md">decorrelation</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-009-signature-metadata.md">signatures</a>. The privacy preserving Envelope format has a lot of legs. We’re looking forward to seeing how they’re used in the years to come!</p>

 FROST 

<p><a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">FROST</a> was the third major specification that Blockchain Commons focused on in 2024. This is a specification that we didn’t develop ourself: it’s based on a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf">paper by Chelsea Komlo and Ian Goldberg</a>. However, we think it’s very important because it allows for resilient, compact, private multisigs, and so we’ve been giving it all the support that we can.</p>

<p>Our prime work here was holding three FROST meetings in 2024 (the last two <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/news/HRF-FROST-Grant/">sponsored by the Human Rights Foundation</a>). We held <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting2/">one meeting</a> for implementers, to help them share information on the continued design of FROST, and we also held <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/developers1/">two</a> <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/developers2/">meetings</a> for developers, focused on helping them to actually get FROST into wallets in the next year. Our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">recordings and presentations from the meetings</a> are full of great FROST resources from <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/assets/pdfs/frost-dev2-intro.pdf">an introduction that we put together</a> to a presentation from <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/assets/pdfs/frost-dev2-stack.pdf">the first major wallet to implement FROST</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve also done some work to incorporate FROST into our own Rust and Swift Gordian stacks as a reference, by moving over to fully BIP-340 compliant Schnorr signatures. We’d like to do more, including creating a <code>signtool</code> reference, but we’ll have to see if that opportunity arises in 2025.</p>

      An introduction, UX challenges, the UNiFFI SDK, and a FROST Federation were at our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/developers2">second meeting for wallet developers</a>.
    
  


<p>Of course, FROST is just a single member of the new class of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology. <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/musig/">MuSig</a> falls into the same category, as another Schnorr-based technology where key creation is divided among multiple locations. We talked a bit about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaNypFsGczg">MuSig and how it could work with Gordian Envelope</a> at our November Gordian meeting.</p>

<p>We think that all of the Schnorr variants are pretty important for the future of the digital world because of their advantages in resilience, security, and privacy.</p>

 Keeping it Real 

<p>Obviously, not all of Blockchain Commons’ work is focused on high-level specifications. We also produce ready-to-go libraries that developers can use to implement our specs, as well as reference apps that can be used for experimentation and as examples of best practices.</p>

<p>Our app releases in 2024 included <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS">Gordian Seed Tool 1.6</a> (and more recently <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Gordian Seed Tool 1.6.2</a>), <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases/tag/v1.1.0">Gordian Server 1.1</a>, and the brand-new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust">seedtool-cli for Rust</a> (with a full <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust/blob/master/MANUAL.md">user manual</a>). We’ve also updated our entire Swift stack to Swift 6 and continued the development of Rust libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-dcbor-rust">bc-dcbor-rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-depo-rust">bc-depo-rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-rust">bc-envelope-rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-components-rust">bc-components-rust</a>, and many more!</p>

 Hello to the Wider Wallet Community 

<p>Our work has always focused on interactions with a larger community, from our IETF work on dCBOR to our Envelope work with our own Gordian community to our FROST meetings.</p>

<p>In 2024, we were thrilled to expand that community to include even more experts in the world of digital assets and identity. Besides our trio of FROST meetings, which brought together most of the principals in that space, we also hosted other expert-talks at our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/">Gordian Developer meetings</a>. That included a presentation on BIP-85 by Aneesh Karve, a look at the Ledger Seed Tool (which uses Blockchain Commons technology) by Aido, and an overview of Payjoin from Dan Gould.</p>

 A Focus on Identity 

<p>As we said, decentralized identity (including decentralized identifiers) has been a topic of interest to Blockchain Commons since before the foundation of the organization. Christopher Allen previously founded the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Web of Trust workshops</a> specifically to investigate how to fulfill the promise of PGP by returning to the idea of decentralized, peer-to-peer identity. Over the course of a dozen workshops, the conference germinated and developed the idea of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and also supported the development of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p>

<p>Though we’ve never had a sustaining sponsor focused on identity at Blockchain Commons, we’re still involved in these topics as of 2024. Christopher is an Invited Expert to the new W3C DID 1.1 Working Group and participated in the face-to-face plenary at TPAC. He also is an Invited Expert to the Verifiable Claims 1.1 Working Group. Our biggest presentation to the W3C community last year was on how to create DID documents in dCBOR and what the possibilities are for using Envelope to add elision to DID Controller Docs and Verifiable Claims. This inspired our own work on XIDs, which is our own potential proof-of-concept for a DID 2.0 spec. We’ll be working more with these communities in the next year.</p>

<p>We also published a number of articles on decentralized identity in 2024 that were intended to either offer warnings about our current direction for identity or provide new ways forward.</p>

 
   <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/videos/Foremembrance2024/">Foremembrance Day Presentation</a> 
   <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-cliques-1/">Edge Identifiers &amp; Cliques</a> 
   <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-cliques-2/">Open &amp; Fuzzy Cliques</a> 
   <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-ssi-bankruptcy/">Has our SSI Ecosystem Become Morally Bankrupt?</a> 
 

<p>We think that our articles on Edge Identifiers and different sorts of Cliques offer a whole new approach to identity. It models identity not just as something held by a singular individual, but as something shared between pairs and groups of people, who together share a context. (And this is another area that we’d love to do more work on: if you would too, let us know!)</p>

<p>Our other two articles focused on the dangers of identity. The Foremembrance Day article (and video) talked about how dangerous identity became in WWII, a topic we’ve used as a touchstone when considering what we’re creating today. Then our last article talked about how we think the modern identity work that Christopher kicked off with <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">his foundational article on self-sovereign identity</a> may now be going in the wrong direction.</p>



 
    
   

 Git Open Integrity Project 

<p>Our biggest project that didn’t quite see release in 2024 was the GitHub Open Integrity project. The idea here is simple: use GitHub as a source of truth by turning a repo into a decentralized identifier. We’ve worked through some CLI setup programs and have <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/open_integrity-git_inception_pocs">a repo</a> that demonstrates the verification we’re doing. We’ve also released the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/ssh-envelope-python">SSH Envelope program</a> that we wrote that supported this project by allowing the signing and validation of SSH keys. (Since, we’ve incorporated the signing into the main <code>envelope-cli-rust</code>).</p>

<p>We’re still working on a README that lays out the whole project, but at the moment it’s backburnered for other work …</p>

 Coming Soon! 

<p><a href="https://z.cash/"></a></p>

<p>The last few years have been hard on our partners in the digital identity space, due to high interest rates sucking the money out of Web3 seed funds. That in turn has hurt their ability to support us. As a result, we’ve been applying for grants for some of our work.</p>

<p>At the very end of 2024, we had a <a href="https://github.com/ZcashCommunityGrants/zcashcommunitygrants/issues/3">grant application approved</a> by the Zcash Foundation to produce an extensible wallet interchange format (“ZeWIF”) for Zcash. Though much of our work to date has been used by the Bitcoin ecosystem, advances like <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/animated-qrs/">animated QRs</a>, <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/lifehash/">Lifehash</a> and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR</a> are of use to anyone working with digital assets (and likely a number of other fields). So, we’re thrilled to get to work with Zcash and share some of our principles such as independence, privacy, and openness (which were all part of our “ZeWIF” proposal). We hope this will also lead to adoption of some of our other specifications in the Zcash ecosystem. Obviously, more on this in Q1, as we have it laid out as a three-month project, running from January to March.</p>

<p>Though we’re thrilled with one-off grants like the HRF and Zcash grants that were approved in 2024, Blockchain Commons is also looking for more stable funding sources to continue our work making the digital-asset space safer and more interoperable. You can help this personally by lending your name to Blockchain Commons as a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">patron</a>, but we’re also looking for companies who are interested in using and expanding our specs, who want to partner with us to do so. Contact <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">us directly</a> to discuss that!</p>

<p>With your support, we’ll be able to produce another report on great advance in 2026.</p>

 1. Introduction 



<p>Global e-commerce is booming and is expected to reach more than $6T by the end of 20241. Having the ability&nbsp; to sell products online has provided great opportunities for merchants to sell goods and services beyond their&nbsp; local market; however, it comes with increased fraud. In fact, it is estimated that in 2023, global ecommerce&nbsp; fraud was roughly to reach $48B1, with the US accounting for 42% of that and the EU with about 26%.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>

<p>1.1 Current Challenges in Remote Commerce&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many types of ecommerce fraud, but the most prevalent type is transaction fraud. Transaction fraud&nbsp; occurs when a transaction is made on a merchant site with a stolen card and/or stolen credentials. Stolen&nbsp; credentials are readily available on the dark web to those who know how to access and use them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address those concerns, measures have been introduced to increase the overall security of remote&nbsp; commerce transactions, including tokenization of payment credentials and cardholder authentication. In some&nbsp; countries, regulations are mandating the adoption of either or both measures, such as in India or in Europe&nbsp; (second Payment Services Directive PSD2). These regulations are meant to ensure secure remote transactions;&nbsp; however, they add complexity to the checkout flow, as they may require a switch between the merchant and&nbsp; another interface, such as a bank’s interface.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, additional authentication may add friction which can result in cart abandonment. The main&nbsp; reasons for cart abandonment include a distrust in the merchant website or a complicated check out flow.&nbsp; Customers prefer a simple payment process that doesn’t add friction such as that caused by payment failure, the need to respond to a one-time password (OTP) on a separate device, or the need to login into a banking&nbsp; application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>1.2 How FIDO can help&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of biometric authentication enabled through the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance standards is an&nbsp; opportunity to deliver a better user experience during the authentication process and hence reduce the risk of&nbsp; transaction abandonment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO has established standards that enable phishing-resistant authentication mechanisms and can be accessed&nbsp; from native applications and from the most popular browsers – thereby enabling a secure and consistent&nbsp; experience across the channels used by consumers. FIDO refers to ‘passkeys’ as the FIDO credentials based on&nbsp; FIDO standards, used by consumers for passwordless authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC). SPC is a web API&nbsp; designed to enhance the consumer experience when authenticating to a payment transaction using FIDO&nbsp; authentication, and to simplify compliance with local regulations (such as PSD2 and dynamic linking in Europe).&nbsp;</p>



<p>1.3 Scope&nbsp;</p>



<p>This whitepaper intends to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Define Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) and the benefits that it brings when FIDO is used to&nbsp;authenticate payment transactions&nbsp; 
 



<p>1 https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/ecommerce&nbsp;statistics/#:~:text=The%20global%20e%2Dcommerce%20market,show%20companies%20are%20taking%20advantage.</p>



 
 List the current SPC payment use cases that can deliver those benefits and illustrate consumer&nbsp; journeys&nbsp; 



 Provide a status on SPC support and the list of enhancements that could be added to the web&nbsp;standard to further improve security and user experience 
 



 2. Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) Benefits 



<p>Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) is an extension to the WebAuthn standard, and aims to deliver the&nbsp; following benefits:&nbsp;</p>



 
 A browser native user experience that is consistent across all merchants and banks  



 Cryptographic evidence of authentication (FIDO assertion) including transaction details signed by a&nbsp; FIDO authenticator&nbsp; 



 Cross origin authentication – For example, even if passkeys are created with the bank as the Relying&nbsp; Party, merchants can invoke cardholder authentication with passkeys within their environment,&nbsp; using input parameters received from the bank, so there is no need to redirect the consumer to the&nbsp; bank to authenticate with passkeys.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>2.1 Browser Native User Experience&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>SPC introduces a standardized payment context screen showing details such as a merchant identifier, the card&nbsp; logo, the last 4 digits of the card number, and the transaction amount. The consumer is invited to explicitly&nbsp; agree to the transaction information displayed and then authenticate. Therefore, SPC can be experienced as a&nbsp; mechanism to collect consent from the consumer about the transaction details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As in standard WebAuthn, the payment context screen is controlled by the user’s browser which renders&nbsp; common JavaScript presentation attacks ineffective. The screen provides increased security, as it ensures that&nbsp; malicious web content cannot alter or obscure the presentation of the transaction details to the user – the&nbsp; browser display always renders on-top of the web content from the triggering website. Figure 1 depicts an&nbsp; example of the SPC experience in chrome.</p>



<p>Figure 1 Example of SPC experience in chrome&nbsp;</p>







<p>2.2 Generation of FIDO Assertion&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With SPC, the transaction-related information displayed to the consumer, such as the merchant identifier and&nbsp; transaction amount, is sent securely to the FIDO authenticator and is signed by the same authenticator&nbsp; (transaction data signing).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO assertion generated by the authenticator reinforces compliance with some regulations as it does with&nbsp; the dynamic linking requirement under PSD2 in Europe, because the merchant identifier and transaction&nbsp; amount will be signed by the authenticator itself. When combined with the browser native user experience&nbsp; described in section 2.1, the relying party can be confident that the user was shown and agreed to the&nbsp; transaction details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2.3 Cross Origin Authentication&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When using FIDO without SPC, a consumer that creates a passkey with a relying party will always need to be in&nbsp; the relying party’s domain to authenticate with that passkey. In the remote commerce payment use case, this&nbsp; means that the consumer typically needs to leave the merchant domain and be redirected to the bank’s domain&nbsp; for authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With SPC, any entity authorized by the relying party can initiate user authentication with the passkey that was&nbsp; created for that relying party. For example, a merchant may be authorized by a bank to authenticate the&nbsp; cardholder with the bank’s passkey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note that the mechanism for the relying party to authorize an entity to invoke SPC may vary. For example, a&nbsp; bank may share FIDO credentials with the merchant during an EMV 3DS interaction or through another&nbsp; integration with a payment scheme. The merchant will then be able to use SPC to initiate the payment&nbsp; confirmation and authentication process with a passkey, even if that passkey was created with the bank.&nbsp; Ultimately, the bank maintains the responsibility to validate the authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2.4 Interoperability With Other Standards&nbsp;</p>



<p>SPC can be used in combination with other industry standards such as EMV 3-D Secure and Secure Remote&nbsp; Commerce (SRC), both of which are EMVCo global and interoperable standards.</p>



 3. SPC Use Cases 



<p>SPC can be used to streamline payments in a variety of remote commerce checkout scenarios such as guest&nbsp; checkout or a checkout using a payment instrument stored on file with a merchant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In each of those payment scenarios, the relying party may be the issuer of the payment instrument (the bank), or a payment network on behalf of the bank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The flows provided in this Chapter are for illustrative purposes and may be subject to compliance with&nbsp; applicable laws and regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3.1 SPC With Bank as Relying Party&nbsp;</p>



<p>The creation of a passkey can be initiated outside of or during the checkout process:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Within the banking interface:&nbsp;
 
 For example, when the consumer is within the banking application and registers a passkey&nbsp; with their bank, in which case the passkey will be associated to one or multiple payment&nbsp; cards and to the consumer device&nbsp; 
 
 



 Within the merchant interface:&nbsp;
 
 For example, when the consumer is authenticated by the bank during an EMV 3DS flow and&nbsp; is prompted to create a passkey with the bank to speed up future checkouts – in which case&nbsp; the passkey will be associated to the payment card used for the transaction (and to additional&nbsp; payment cards depending on the bank’s implementation), as well as to the device used by the&nbsp; consumer&nbsp; 
 
 
 



<p>Figure 2 depicts the sequence (seven steps) of a passkey creation during a merchant checkout, where the&nbsp; merchant uses EMV 3DS and the consumer is authenticated by their bank:</p>



<p>Figure 2: Passkey creation during checkout</p>











<p>Once the passkey creation is complete, any merchant that has received the passkey information (which includes&nbsp; FIDO identifiers and Public Key) from the bank, through a mechanism agreed with the bank or the payment&nbsp; scheme, will be able to use SPC. Such a mechanism may include EMV 3DS or another integration with the&nbsp; payment scheme. For example, a merchant who implements EMV 3DS (i.e., version 2.32) will be able to benefit&nbsp; from SPC through the following steps:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. When the merchant initiates EMV 3DS to authenticate the consumer, the bank decides whether an&nbsp; active authentication of the cardholder is necessary. If the decision is to perform the active&nbsp; authentication of the cardholder, the bank can first retrieve one or several passkeys associated with the&nbsp; card used for the transaction, verify that the consumer is on the same registered device, and then&nbsp; returns the passkey(s) information to the merchant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. The merchant invokes the SPC web API to a SPC-supporting browser, including a few parameters in the&nbsp; request, such as the passkey information, card / bank / network logos, the merchant identifier and the&nbsp; transaction amount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. If the browser can find a match for one of those passkeys on the device used by the consumer, the&nbsp; browser displays the logos, merchant identifier and the transaction amount to the consumer, and&nbsp; prompts for authentication with the passkey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. The authentication results are returned to the merchant, who in turn will share those results with the&nbsp; bank for validation through the EMV 3DS protocol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 3 depicts an example of an authentication flow using SPC and EMV 3DS, with a previously registered&nbsp; passkey:</p>



<p>Figure 3: Authentication sequence using SPC and EMV 3DS</p>







<p>3.2 SPC With Payment Scheme as Relying Party&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some payment scenarios, payment schemes can be a relying party on-behalf of the banks to remove the need&nbsp; for banks to deploy a FIDO infrastructure, thereby scaling the adoption of passkeys faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The creation of a passkey can be initiated outside of or during the checkout process: </p>



 
 Outside of the checkout: for example, when the consumer is within the banking application and the&nbsp; bank invites the consumer to create a passkey for faster and more secure transactions, the passkey&nbsp; can be created with the payment scheme as the relying party, and will be associated by the payment&nbsp; scheme to one or multiple payment cards and to the consumer device; or&nbsp; 



 Before, during or after a checkout: for example, the consumer may be prompted to create a passkey&nbsp; for faster and more secure transactions at merchants supporting the payment scheme’s payment&nbsp; method. The passkey will be associated by the payment scheme to one or multiple payment cards&nbsp; and to the consumer device, once the identity of the consumer has been verified by the bank. Figure 4 depicts this sequence.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Figure 4 Passkey creation during checkout&nbsp;</p>











<p>Once the passkey creation is complete, any merchant that is using the authentication facilitated by the payment&nbsp; scheme will be able to benefit from SPC:&nbsp;</p>



 
 The merchant checks with the payment scheme that a passkey is available for the card used in the&nbsp; transaction and retrieves the passkey information from the payment scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 The merchant invokes the SPC web API with the merchant identifier and transaction amount.&nbsp;  



 If the browser can find a match for one of those passkeys on the device used by the consumer, the&nbsp; browser displays the merchant identifier and the transaction amount to the consumer, card / bank /&nbsp; network logos, then prompts for authentication with the passkey.&nbsp; 



 The authentication results are returned to the payment scheme that validates the results. The&nbsp; payment scheme shares those results with the bank, during an authorization message, for the bank&nbsp; to review and approve the transaction. Figure 5 shows this sequence.

Device authenticator prompts cardholder for gesture <br>5. Confirmation of gesture <br>6. Transaction completed by the merchant</p>







<p>3.3 Summary of SPC Benefits&nbsp;</p>



<p>The benefits provided by SPC include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Cross-origin authentication – Any merchant authorized by a Relying Party can request the&nbsp; generation of a FIDO assertion during a transaction even when they are not the relying party. This&nbsp; provides a better user experience as there is no redirect that is required to the relying party to&nbsp; perform consumer authentication.&nbsp; 



 Consistent user experience with increased trust – With SPC, the consumer has a consistent user&nbsp; experience across all merchants and independently of who plays the role of relying party. In each&nbsp; case, the consumer will see a window displayed by the browser, that includes payment details, the&nbsp; logos of their card / bank / payment scheme, increasing the trust in using FIDO authentication for&nbsp; their payments.&nbsp;
 
 Increased security – With SPC, the FIDO assertion will include payment details in the cryptogram&nbsp; generation such as the merchant identifier and transaction amount, making it difficult to modify any&nbsp; of those details in the transaction without being detected by the bank or payment scheme. This also&nbsp; simplifies the compliance with local regulations such as PSD2 regulation related to dynamic linking. 
 
 
 



 4. Status of SPC Support and Future Enhancement 



<p>4.1 Availability&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secure Payment Confirmation is currently published as a W3C Candidate Recommendation, and there is on going work to include this as an authentication method in EMVCo specifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the availability of the Secure Payment Confirmation API is limited to: </p>



 
 Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers&nbsp; 



 MacOS, Windows, and Android operating systems.&nbsp; 
 



<p>4.2 Future Enhancements&nbsp;</p>



<p>The W3C Web Payments Working Group continues to work and iterate on Secure Payment Confirmation with&nbsp; the goal of improving the security and the user experience when consumers authenticate for payments on the&nbsp; web.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Features currently under consideration include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Improve user and merchant experiences when there is not a credential available on the current&nbsp; device (i.e., a fallback user experience)&nbsp; 



 Improve consumer trust with additional logos being displayed to the user, such as bank logo and&nbsp; card network logo&nbsp; 



 Improve security with support for device binding, with the browser providing access to a&nbsp; browser/device-bound key&nbsp; 



 Consider additional use cases such as recurring payments or support for roaming and hybrid FIDO&nbsp; authenticators 
 



<p>An example of enhanced SPC transaction UX that is under review is illustrated in Figure 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 6: SPC transaction UX under review</p>







 5. Conclusion 



<p>Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) is a web standard that has been designed to facilitate the use of strong&nbsp;authentication during payment transactions with best-in-class user experience, where the relying party can be a&nbsp; bank or a payment scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main benefits of SPC are to deliver an improved user experience, with the display of transaction details that&nbsp; the consumer approves with FIDO authentication, and to enable cross-origin authentication when a merchant&nbsp; authenticates a consumer without the need to redirect to the relying party (the bank or the payment scheme).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>SPC also facilitates the inclusion of the transaction details within the FIDO signature, which can help deliver&nbsp; higher security and/or simplify the compliance with local regulations.</p>

 Cost saving estimation for the Use Case „Know your Supplier” based on automated master data management with EUDI wallets for legal entities 



<p>The paper was prepared by the scientific research provider for the program, „Begleitforschung Sichere Digitale Identitäten,“ led by the European School for Management and Technology (ESMT), on behalf of the BMWK.</p>



<p>1 Introduction to the Showcase Program Secure Digital Identities</p>



<p>The German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) is the initiator and funder of the „Secure Digital Identities“ Showcase Program. Over the course of four years (2021 to 2024), the four showcase projects – IDunion, ID-Ideal, ONCE, and SDIKA – have worked on more than 100 use cases related to secure digital identities. These projects have also developed various types of wallets, which have been tested and implemented in multiple pilot environments. The Showcase Program has supported Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) efforts, resulting in the creation of seven edge wallets, three organizational wallets, and one cloud wallet. Within this framework, IDunion has specifically focused on developing organizational identities, including use cases such as „Know-your-supplier.“ This paper outlines the cost savings achieved through automated supplier master data management, leveraging EUDI wallets for legal entities and the EU Company Certificate Attestation (EUCC) issued by QEAA providers in accordance with Company Law. The paper was prepared by the scientific research provider for the program, „Begleitforschung Sichere Digitale Identitäten,“ led by the European School for Management and Technology (ESMT), on behalf of the BMWK.</p>



<p>2 Cost saving estimation</p>



<p>Current situation: Currently corporations maintain their supplier and customer master data records manually, which is time-consuming and leads to errors and redundancies. Large corporations need to maintain and assure high quality of several hundred up to millions of master data records. The maintenance costs per single data set was estimated to 11 €/year. The master data set considered for the cost estimation was limited to company name and address data and therefore is a subset of the data that will be available with the PID for legal person and the EUCC.<br>Solution based on EUDIW: EU Digital Identity Wallets (EDIW), PID for legal entities and public registry extracts (e.g. EUCC) as QEAAs enable almost completely automated management of business partner data. Suppliers present their attestations from their legal entity wallet to customers or legal entity wallets of other business partners. Presentation, verification and the transfer to internal systems is performed automatically. This reduces the number of proprietary data records maintained in parallel and minimizes manual, error-prone data entry.<br>Cost savings: The solution enables annual savings of estimated €85 billion for German companies. Only German companies with more than 2 million sales/year where included in this estimation. It was assumed that only their European business partners provide their data as verifiable attestations. This underscores the transformative impact of the EUDIW solution on master data management and its strategic importance for the private sector on the path to digital efficiency.</p>



<p>Conservative assumptions for the estimation model below<a>1</a></p>



 
 Estimation of master data sets: The estimation is done by estimating the number of potential B2B relationships of  ompanies and assuming that a B2B relationship generates at least one master data set. In practice, however, master data is often stored and replicated in different systems. As this is not considered, the cost savings in the estimation are therefore calculated conservatively. 



 Annual master data maintenance costs: On average, a company incurs annual costs of around €11 per master data maintenance. This estimation is based on an estimation performed by „Verband Deutscher Automobilhersteller“ (VDA). 



 Number of master data sets for large companies: An average of 300,000 master data was assumed for large companies based on project estimates and VDA work. It was also assumed that 60% of the master data per company is attributable to the EU suppliers (i.e. 180,000 master data items on average for large companies) and therefore only these are relevant for the EUDIW-based solution. 



 Scaling based on turnover: The estimated number of B2B relationships of large companies can be scaled to other company sizes based on turnover<a>2</a> 



 Implementation costs: The implementation costs are assumed to be €600 per year for small companies (&lt;€10 million turnover). These costs are scaled to the larger company categories based on turnover. In addition to the implementation costs, companies must purchase the mentioned attestations (LPID, EUCC). The assumed costs are €1,000 per year. These costs are independent of the size of the company. Further implementation costs such as integration into ERP/CRM modules are neglected, as it is assumed that the market leaders will integrate the EUDIW modules accordingly.  



 Very small companies: Due to their high number and heterogeneity in turnover and employee structure, very small companies are not included in the modeling, which leads to a more conservative savings estimate<a>3</a>

<div class='wrap'>

 Bridging trust between humans and AI agents with Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and ElizaOS framework <p>In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in robotics, trust is not just a luxury — it’s a necessity. The Three Laws of Robotics, conceptualized by the visionary Isaac Asimov, provide a well-known foundational ethical structure for&nbsp;robots:</p>  A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to&nbsp;harm.  A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First&nbsp;Law.  A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second&nbsp;Law.  <p>Ensuring these laws are adhered to in practice requires more than just programming; it necessitates a system where the knowledge upon which AI agents operate is transparent, verifiable, and trusted. This is where OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) comes into play, offering a groundbreaking approach to enhancing the trustworthiness of&nbsp;AI.</p> Transparency and verifiability <p>One of the key aspects of the DKG is its capacity for transparency. By organizing AI-grade Knowledge Assets (KAs) in a decentralized manner, DKG ensures that the data AI agents use to make decisions can be traced back to their origins, with any tampering or modifications of that data being transparently recorded and verifiable on the blockchain. This is crucial for the First Law, where transparency in data sourcing can prevent AI from making decisions that might harm humans due to incorrect or biased information.</p> Ownership and&nbsp;control <p>The DKG allows for each Knowledge Asset to be associated with a non-fungible token (NFT), providing clear ownership and control over the information. This aspect directly impacts how AI agents adhere to the Second Law. Namely, by allowing agents to own their knowledge, DKG empowers AI agents to respond to human commands based on a robust, reliable data set that they control, ensuring they follow human directives while also adhering to the ethical boundaries set by the laws. This capability also allows agents to monetize Knowledge Assets that they have created (i.e. charge other agents (AI or human) for accessing their structured data), enabling agents’ economic independence.</p> Contextual understanding and decision-making <p>The semantic capabilities of DKG provide AI with a richer context for understanding the world — an ontological, symbolic world model to complement GenAI inferencing, which is vital for the Third Law. The interconnected nature of knowledge in the DKG means it is contextualized better, allowing AI to make decisions with a comprehensive view of the situation. For example, understanding the broader implications of self-preservation in contexts where human safety is paramount ensures that robots do not prioritize their existence over human well-being.</p> Building trust through decentralization <p>Decentralization is at the heart of the DKG’s effectiveness in fostering trust:</p>  Avoiding centralized control: Traditional centralized databases can be points of failure or manipulation, especially in multi-agent scenarios. In contrast, DKG distributes control, reducing the risk of misuse or bias in AI decision-making. This decentralized approach helps build a collective, trustworthy intelligence that aligns with human values and&nbsp;safety.  Community contribution: DKG facilitates a crowdsourced approach to knowledge, where contributions from various stakeholders can enrich the AI’s understanding of ethical and practical scenarios, further aligning AI behavior with the Three Laws. This community aspect also encourages ongoing vigilance and updates to the knowledge base, ensuring AI systems remain relevant and&nbsp;safe.   Grow and read AI Agents’ minds with the ChatDKG framework powered by DKG and&nbsp;ElizaOS <p>The upgrade of ChatDKG marks a pioneering moment, combining the power of the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) with the ElizaOS framework to create the first AI agent of its kind. Empowered by DKG, <a href="https://x.com/ChatDKG">ChatDKG</a> utilizes the DKG as collective memory to store and retrieve information in a transparent, verifiable manner, allowing for an unprecedented level of interaction where humans can essentially “read the AI’s mind” by accessing its data and thought processes. This unique feature not only enhances transparency but also fosters trust between humans and&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The integration with ElizaOS is based on a <a href="https://github.com/branarakic/elizagraph/">dedicated DKG plugin</a>, with which ElizaOS agents can create contextually rich knowledge graph memories, storing structured information about their experiences, insights, and decisions. These memories can be shared and made accessible across the DKG network, forming a collective pool of knowledge graph memories. This allows individual agents to access, analyze, and learn from the experiences of other agents, creating a dynamic ecosystem where collaboration drives network effects between memories. See an example memory knowledge graph created by the ChatDKG agent&nbsp;<a href="https://dkg.origintrail.io/explore?ual=did:dkg:otp:2043/0x8f678eb0e57ee8a109b295710e23076fa3a443fe/516350">here</a>.</p><p>Tapping into collective memory will be enhanced with strong agent reputation systems and robust knowledge graph verification mechanisms. Agents can assess the trustworthiness of shared memories, avoiding hallucinations or false data while making decisions. This not only enables more confident and precise decision-making but also empowers agent swarms to operate with unprecedented coherence and accuracy. Whether predicting trends, solving complex problems, or coordinating large-scale tasks, agents will be able to achieve a new level of intelligence and reliability.</p><p>Yet, this is only the beginning of the journey toward “collective neuro-symbolic AI,” where the synthesis of symbolic reasoning and deep learning, enriched by shared, verifiable knowledge, will redefine the boundaries of artificial intelligence. The possibilities for collaborative intelligence are limitless, paving the way for systems that think, learn, and evolve together.</p><p>Moreover, ChatDKG invites users to contribute to its memory base, growing and refining its knowledge through direct interaction. This interactive approach leverages the ElizaOS framework’s capabilities to ensure that each exchange informs the AI and enriches its understanding, making it a dynamic participant in the evolving landscape of knowledge.</p><p>Talk to the ChatDKG AI agent on X to grow and read his&nbsp;memory!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/bridging-trust-between-humans-and-ai-agents-with-decentralized-knowledge-graph-dkg-and-elizaos-14aab4c32701">Bridging trust between humans and AI agents with Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and ElizaOS…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: By grounding technical decisions in ethical values, we can create compassionate digital architectures. This article examines how core human values such as dignity, autonomy, and human rights inform the design of trustworthy digital systems to enable progressive trust, safeguard privacy, promote individual choice, and build resilient systems resistant to coercion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>As we enter 2025, I’m reflecting on a journey of decades that has been dedicated to advancing privacy, security, and human autonomy in the digital age. My body of work dates back to the 1990s, which saw my early contributions with cryptographic pioneers and my co-authorship of the IETF TLS 1.0 standard. But this year marks the 10th anniversary of the first <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">“Rebooting Web of Trust” workshop</a>, which was a real milestone for my leadership role in shaping secure technologies such as <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers standard</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, my focus as a trust architect has sharpened on designing digital systems that empower individuals while respecting core values such as autonomy and human dignity. These designs play a critical role in how individuals express themselves, engage with communities, and pursue their aspirations in a world increasingly shaped by digital interactions.</p>

<p>Yet, this digital realm presents a dual reality. While it opens up unprecedented opportunities, it also makes us increasingly vulnerable to exploitation, coercion, and pervasive surveillance. This tension places a profound responsibility on architects of digital systems: we must ensure that technical designs are guided by deeply rooted human values and ethical principles.</p>

<p>Looking ahead to the next ten years, I reaffirm my commitment to these values, charting a course for the future that places human flourishing and trust at the center of technological progress. But to fulfill this commitment requires the complex answer to a simple question: how can we design systems that uphold dignity, autonomy, and human rights?</p>

 The Core Values of Autonomy &amp; Dignity 

<p>When we design digital systems, we’re not just creating technical specifications. We’re crafting spaces where people will live significant portions of their lives. To give them the ability to truly live and excel, we must give them automony: a digital system must empower individuals to control their own destinies within this digital realm. To do so, it must provide them with tools that:</p>

 
   Protect their data. 
   Exercise control over their digital presence. 
   Ensure freedom from coercion. 
   Cultivate trust through direct, transparent &amp; efficient peer-to-peer interactions. 
   Facilitate interactions built on trust and agency. 
   Enable meaningful participation in the digital economy. 
   Support engagement that aligns with their values and priorities. 
   Foster resilience against systemic vulnerabilities. 
   Operate seamlessly across jurisdictions and political boundaries 
 

<p>(See my “Principles of Dignity, Autonomy, and Trust in Digital Systems” in the Appendix for a more extensive look at what I consider core values for digital system design.)</p>

<p>Providing individuals with digital autonomy is mirrored by the concept of digital dignity. A digital system that prioritizes dignity respects the individuality of its users and safeguards their right to privacy. It minimizes the data collected, provides clear and revocable consent mechanisms, and ensures that control remains in the hands of the user. A dignified system doesn’t simply protect; it fosters agency and participation, allowing individuals to thrive without fear of surveillance, discrimination, or exploitation.</p>

<p>Autonomy is also closely linked to the concept of trust. You must be able to know and trust your peers in order to truly have the autonomy to make meaningful decisions. This is where systems like <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/progressive-trust/">progressive trust</a> come in.</p>

<p>A system built on autonomy, dignity, and trust ultimately treats individuals as more than their administrative identities; it recognizes that individuals possess an ineffable core of self that transcends digital representation. The first <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/#ten-principles-of-self-sovereign-identity">principle of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>, ‘Existence,’ upholds this kernel of individuality, affirming that any digital identity must respect and support the inherent worth of the person behind it.</p>

<p>To properly respect autonomy and dignity also requires careful attention to power dynamics and accountability. Distinct standards of transparency and privacy should address the power imbalances between individuals and institutions. Achieving this balance involves respecting individual privacy while enabling appropriate oversight of powerful institutions. We must protect the vulnerable while ensuring our larger administrative systems remain fair and just.</p>

<p>We must also address the crucial question: how do we make privacy-preserving technology economically accessible to everyone? Any autonomy-enabling digital system must balance individual and collective interests by supporting sustainable development of digital infrastructure while fostering individual economic sovereignty and resilience. We must reward contributions to shared resources, uphold autonomy and self-determination, and ensure equitable access to rights-preserving technologies. By protecting individual freedoms and enabling fairness, privacy can ultimately be a tool that encourages participation regardless of economic means.</p>

<p>Decentralized identity wallets offer an example of how to embody the characteristics of autonomy, dignity, and trust, while also considering issues such as privacy, balance, and accessibility. They empower individuals to securely prove their credentials (such as educational achievements or professional certifications) directly to peers, without relying on central authorities that could arbitrarily deny their accomplishments. Consider Maria, a small business owner living in a vibrant but economically challenged favela neighborhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Using a self-sovereign, decentralized identity wallet provided by the city, she is able to secure microloans without compromising her privacy, a triumph for both dignity and autonomy.</p>

<p>As for how these core values transform into the design principles of decentralized identity wallets: that’s the next question to address.</p>

 From Values to Design Principles 

<p>The translation of the core values of autonomy,  dignity, and trust into concrete design principles shapes every aspect of trust architectures I build and guides me to specific technical choices:</p>

 
   Cryptographically secure, self-certifying identifiers that operate independently of central authorities. 
   Local or collaborative key generation and management to keep control in users’ hands. 
   Peer-to-peer protocols that resist centralized rent-seeking and walled gardens. 
   Offline-first capabilities to prevent connectivity from becoming a point of coercion. 
   Data minimization by default. 
   Choices for elision and redaction to control what individuals share. 
   Cryptographic selective disclosure to prevent unwanted correlation and tracking. 
   Revocable permissions to ensure users retain ongoing control over their information. 
   Zero-knowledge proofs or other systems that can balance privacy and accountability without enabling bad actors. 
   Decentralized architectures, not as an ideological preference, but as a practical necessity. 
 

<p>The importance of these protections isn’t theoretical. My work examining sensitive data — including <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Dangerous-Wellness-Data/">wellness</a>, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Dangerous-Educational-Credentials/">educational credentials</a>, <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/use-cases/summary/#financial-industry-use-cases">financial transactions</a>, and identity documentation — has revealed how seemingly benign information can threaten human rights when misused. Health data can enable discrimination or coercion. Educational records can create permanent, unchangeable markers that limit opportunities. Financial and identity data can be weaponized to exploit or disenfranchise individuals.</p>

<p>A values-driven design can therefore be seen as not just an abstract focus on ideals such as autonomy, but protection against real-world harms. The rights to be forgotten, to correct errors, and to recover from systemic or administrative injustices ensure fairness in digital interactions. The ability for an individual to selectively share aspects of their identity protects from being reduced to digital records or confined to singular contexts.</p>

 From Design Principles to Education 

<p>Implementing human-centric design patterns reveals another challenge: helping developers to understand not just the technical complexity, but the human purpose behind each design choice. Developers must grasp not only how their systems operate but they must think critically about why their design decisions matter for privacy, autonomy, and dignity.</p>

<p>While technical resources such as documentation and tutorials are indispensable for this education, true progress depends on fostering a compasionate culture where developers internalize value-driven imperatives. This has led me to prioritize the cultivation of decentralized developer ecosystems rooted in collaboration, open development standards, and shared learning. I’ve done this through a variety of means:</p>

 
   Workshops that convene developers, policymakers, and advocates to share insights, collaborate, and explore innovative approaches. 
   Hackathons and Sprints addressing pressing challenges in digital trust, enabling participants to co-create solutions in hands-on environments. 
   Regular Developer Meetups for discussing current challenges, sharing practical experiences, and aligning on future roadmaps. 
   Peer Review and Collaboration Forums to ensure transparency, accountability, and robust feedback in the development processes. 
   Cross-Organization Coordination to facilitate collaborative projects, share resources, and distribute financial and time-related investments such as security reviews. 
   Ecosystem Building to design decentralized solutions that balance individual empowerment with collective benefit, ensuring that all contributors — users, developers, and communities — derive meaningful value and that mutual respect is cultivated through shared goals and open participation. 
   Mentorship Programs to guide emerging developers in adopting values-driven approaches, fostering ethical practices from the outset of their careers. 
   Advocacy Efforts that include collaborating with policymakers and regulators to define a techno-social contract that upholds human dignity, ensures equitable and compassionate digital rights, and protects the interests of the vulnerable. 
 

<p>With this decentralized, collaborative approach to education, no single entity controls the evolution of these technologies. Instead, innovation is fostered across a diverse network of developers, building resilience into these systems and ensuring that solutions remain adaptable, inclusive, and accessible. This cooperative spirit reflects the very principles of autonomy, compassion, and inclusivity that underpin trustworthy digital systems.</p>

 From Education to Implementation 

<p>As communities evolve from educational groups to implementation groups, forums and discussions continue to expand the community and allow us to address the broader societal implications of technical choices. Foundational principles should follow.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">The Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity</a> is an example of a set of foundational principles that directly evolved from discussion at an educational workshop (<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot2-id2020/">RWOT2</a>). The <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian Principles</a> and Privacy by Demand are other examples of core principles that evolved out of earlier discussions. Principles such as these form a bedrock for the values we will work to embed in actual implementations.</p>

<p>Code reviews and project evaluations should then include these principles — and more generally ethical alignment — as a key criterion. They’re not just about technical correctness! By embedding values into every stage of development, we ensure that systems are designed to empower individuals, not exploit them.</p>

<p>How can we manage the critical balance between transparency for accountability and privacy for individuals? How do we address power dynamics and ensure systems protect the rights of the vulnerable while holding powerful entities accountable? Ultimately, how do we prioritize both user autonomy and security in decisions around data storage, key management, or cryptographic algorithms? These are questions that should both arise and be addressed when considering a full education-to-implementation pipeline that is based on collaboration and the consideration of values.</p>

<p>Ultimately, implementing systems that respect dignity and autonomy demands a new kind of techno-social contract. This contract must bridge multiple realms:</p>

 
   The technical capabilities that make solutions possible. 
   The cultural shifts that make them acceptable. 
   The economic incentives that make them sustainable. 
   The political will that makes them viable. 
   The contractual &amp; legislative agreements that makes them durable. 
 

<p>This comprehensive approach will serve both individual autonomy and our collective commons.</p>

<p>By ensuring that digital trust and human dignity remain at the core of technological progress, we build systems that serve as a foundation for a more equitable, humane, and resilient digital future. The result is implementations that transcend technical excellence by instilling a sense of stewardship among developers. They become not just the creators of secure systems but also champions of the communities these systems serve.</p>

 From Implementation to Deployment 

<p>Any framework to support values such as autonomy, dignity, and trust must be holistic in its approach.</p>

 
   Technical standards and specifications must harmonize with cultural norms and social expectations. 
   Economic models must simultaneously foster individual resilience and collective benefits, ensuring that privacy and autonomy remain accessible to everyone, and don’t become luxuries available only to the wealthy. 
   Cultural norms and legislative efforts must go beyond surface-level privacy protections, addressing both the technical realities and human needs at stake. 
   Most importantly, technical and political discourse must evolve to recognize digital rights as fundamental human rights. This paradigm shift would enable policies that support compassionate decentralized approaches while holding powerful actors accountable to the communities they serve. 
 

<p>Nurturing the collaborative ecosystems plays a central role in this transformation. We must foster cultures of ethical awareness not just among developers but across society. This means supporting implementers and maintainers who understand not just the “how” of our systems, but the “why”. It means engaging leaders who grasp both technical constraints and human needs and creating sustainable economic models that reward contributions to the commons while protecting individual rights.</p>

<p>Legal deployment has always been one of the trickiest challenges in popularizing a system that supports individual autonomy, but the concept of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">Principal Authority</a> presents a promising foundation, courtesy of Wyoming’s digital identity law. It goes beyond the traditional frameworks of property and contract law, which, while useful, are insufficient in addressing the unique challenges of digital identity.</p>

<p>Property law focuses on ownership and control and contract law governs agreements between parties, but neither fully captures the dynamic, relational nature of digital representations or the need for individual agency in decentralized systems. Principal Authority, grounded in Agency Law, functions much like the relationship between a principal and an agent in traditional legal contexts. For instance, just as an agent (like a lawyer or real estate agent) acts on behalf of a principal while preserving the principal’s control, Wyoming’s digital identity law ensures that individuals retain ultimate authority over any actions or representations made on their behalf in the digital space. This legal framework acknowledges human agency — not mere ownership or contractual consent — as the primary source of legitimate authority. The result is a modern recognition of individual sovereignty, and therefore autonomy, that still fosters collaboration and commerce in the increasingly interconnected digital realm.</p>

<p>But, even if Principal Authority does prove a useful tool, it’s just one tool in a whole toolkit that will be necessarily to successfully deploy rights-supporting software into society.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>My responsibility as a trust architect is not simply to build systems that work, but to build systems that work for humanity. This requires a steadfast commitment to values, a willingness to navigate difficult trade-offs, and a relentless focus on aligning design principles with human needs.</p>

<p>The technical challenges of implementing values-driven design are significant, but they’re challenges worth solving. When we build systems that respect human rights and dignity, we create digital spaces that enhance rather than diminish human flourishing.</p>

<p>As developers, policy makers, or advocates, we hold the power to embed human values into every line of code, every standard, and every policy. As we build tomorrow’s digital ecosystems, we must therefore ask: What can I do to make trust and dignity the foundation of our systems?</p>

<p>To answer that question in a positive way will ultimately require a multi-stakeholder effort where technologists, policy makers, and civil society collaborate to uphold principles of equity, inclusion, and transparency in all aspects of digital architecture, down the entire linked chain from values to design to education to implementation to deployment.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll be part of that undertaking.</p>

 Appendix 1: Principles of Dignity, Autonomy, and Trust in Digital Systems 

<p>While working on this article, I put together my own principles for dignity, autonomy, and trust in digital systems. As with my self-sovereign principles of a decade ago, I am offering these up for discussion in the community.</p>

 
   1. Human Dignity. Design systems that prioritize and respect the inherent dignity of every individual. Embed privacy protections, minimize data collection, and provide clear, revocable consent mechanisms that align with user empowerment. Protect individuals from harm while fostering compassionate digital environments that promote trust, human flourishing, and technological progress aligned with human-centric values, actively considering potential societal impacts and unintended consequences. 
   2. Autonomy &amp; Self-Determination: Empower individuals to control their digital identities and make decisions free from coercion or undue influence. Enable them to manage their interactions, transact freely, preserve their sovereignty, act as peers not petitioners, and assert their rights through decentralized, compassionate, user-controlled systems. 
   3. Privacy by Design (&amp; Default): Embed robust privacy protections into every system, implementing data minimization, selective disclosure, anti-correlation, and cryptographic safeguards as default practices. This ensures that users retain control over their information and remain shielded from tracking, correlation, and coercion. 
   4. Resilience Against Exploitation: Architect systems to withstand adversarial threats and systemic vulnerabilities. Leverage decentralization, cryptographic protections, and offline-first capabilities to empower users even in hostile and adversarial environments and to ensure autonomy remains intact under pressure. 
   5. Progressive Trust: Design systems that reflect the natural evolution of trust, enabling selective and intentional information sharing. Foster trust gradually through mutual engagement, avoiding premature commitments, unnecessary reliance on intermediaries, or imposed full disclosure. 
   6. Transparency &amp; Accountability: Hold powerful institutions accountable while safeguarding individual privacy. Balance transparency with confidentiality to mitigate power imbalances, protect the vulnerable, and ensure justice and fairness in digital interactions. Ensure that innovation and system development prioritize fairness and compassionate considerations, holding powerful institutions accountable for societal impacts. 
   7. Interoperability: Foster systems that are interoperable across cultural, legal, and jurisdictional boundaries. Promote inclusivity by prioritizing open standards, decentralized infrastructures, and accessible tools that serve diverse communities while avoiding exclusivity or centralized gatekeeping. 
   8. Adaptive Design: Incorporate insights from Living Systems Theory, Ostrom’s Commons, and other governance and design models to build architectures that are dynamic, resilient, and capable of evolving alongside societal and technological changes. Emphasize adaptability through iterative growth, collective stewardship, and interoperability, balancing stability with flexibility to support sustainable and inclusive digital ecosystems. 
   9. A Techno-Social Contract: Bridge technical capabilities with cultural, economic, and legislative frameworks to create a sustainable, human and civil rights-preserving digital ecosystem. Recognize digital rights as fundamental human rights and align systems with shared values of autonomy, dignity, and collective benefit. 
   10. Ethics: Cultivate a culture of ethical awareness, critical thinking, and collaboration among developers, policymakers, and users. Ensure technical decisions align with principles of trust and dignity by embedding education, mentorship, and a commitment to shared responsibility in the development process. Encourage innovation that is mindful of societal impacts, fostering a development ethos that prioritizes responsibility and safeguards against unintended consequences. 
 

 Appendix 2: Use Cases for Values Designs 

<p>Values affect all of my designs. Following is some discussion of how it’s influenced my work on self-sovereign identity and progressive trust.</p>

 Self-Sovereign Identity 

<p>The conviction that technical designs must be built on human values came into sharp focus for me in 2016 when I authored the <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">10 Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>. These principles were not born from technical specifications alone but from a deep commitment to dignity, autonomy, and human rights. Over time, those values have guided the development of technologies such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and the DIDComm protocol for secure, private communication. They have also influenced broader thinking around cryptographic digital assets such as Bitcoin. I have come to see these values not as abstract ideals but as the very foundation of trust itself: principles that must underpin every digital system we create.</p>

<p>My principles of Self-Sovereign Identity also had a strong historical basis: they were built on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">a deep historical and philosophical foundation</a>. The concept of sovereignty has evolved over centuries — from feudal lords to city-states to nations — consistently reflecting a balance between autonomy and interconnection. When I wrote about the principle of “Control”, it was not about advocating absolute dominion but about framing sovereignty as the right to individual agency and prosperity, much like medieval cities, which preserved their independence while flourishing within broader networks of trade and diplomacy.</p>

<p>This understanding was deeply influenced by Living Systems Theory, which shows how every entity maintains its autonomy through selective boundaries while remaining part of a larger ecosystem. Just as a cell’s membrane allows it to control what passes in and out while still participating in the larger organism, digital identity must enable both individual autonomy and collective participation. This biological metaphor directly informed principles such as “Existence” and “Persistence,” which recognize that identity must be long-lived but also able to interact with its environment, and “Access” and “Portability”, which define how identity information flows across boundaries.</p>

<p>The principles also reflect Ostrom’s insights about managing common resources as well as feminist perspectives on sovereignty that emphasize agency over control. When I wrote about the principles of “Consent” and “Protection”, I was describing the selective permeability of these digital boundaries—not walls that isolate, but membranes that enable controlled interaction. “Interoperability” and “Minimization” similarly emerged from understanding how sovereign entities must interact while maintaining their independence and protecting their core rights.</p>

<p>These concepts culminate in the final SSI Principles such as “Transparency,” which balances individual autonomy with collective needs, and “Portability,” which ensures that identities can move and evolve just as living systems do. Each principle reflects this interplay between values and technical implementation, creating a framework where digital sovereignty serves human dignity. They weren’t meant to be an endpoint but rather a starting point for an evolving discussion about sovereignty in the digital age — one that continues to guide our work as we push the boundaries of what’s possible in digital identity, ensuring our innovations prioritize human needs rather than subordinating them to technology.</p>

<p>The technical complexity required to implement such systems is significant, but it serves a deeply human purpose: the ability to build autonomy and trust.</p>

 Progressive Trust 

<p>Trust is not static; it evolves over time — a concept I describe as <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/progressive-trust/">progressive trust</a>. This principle reflects how trust naturally develops between people and organizations, both in the physical and digital worlds. Relationships are built incrementally, through selective and intentional disclosures, rather than being imposed upfront or dictated solely by third-party intermediaries. This gradual evolution is essential for fostering genuine connections while mitigating risks.</p>

<p>I discovered this concept through years of observing how people actually build relationships. For instance, when meeting someone at a conference, we don’t immediately share our life story. Instead, we begin with small exchanges, revealing more information as comfort, context, and mutual understanding grow. Digital systems must mirror this natural evolution of trust, creating environments that respect psychological needs and empower individual agency.</p>

<p>A well-designed system transforms these ideas about progressive trust into deployable systems by enabling users to disclose only what is necessary at each stage, while retaining the ability to refine or revoke permissions as relationships deepen, change, or dissolve. This flexibility demands advanced technical solutions, such as:</p>

 
   Sophisticated cryptographic protocols that enable selective and intentional disclosure. 
   Relationship-specific identifiers to ensure contextual privacy. 
   Mechanisms to prevent unwanted tracking or correlation. 
   Tools that balance transparency with security, safeguarding trust while avoiding vulnerabilities that could undermine it. 
 

<p>The technical complexity required to implement such systems is significant, but it serves a deeply human purpose: enabling individuals to build trust incrementally, naturally, and on their own terms.</p>

<p>Knowing the values we are aligning with from the start helps to define this sort, even (as with progressive trust) when it’s hard. The result is an architecture that not only reflects the organic nature of human relationships but also upholds autonomy, fosters confidence, and protects against coercion or exploitation.</p>

<p>Hmm… Does United have one?</p>
<p>Here’s a picture of my customer journey with United Airlines, as of today:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’m also a lifetime member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Club">United Club</a>, thanks to my wife’s wise decision in 1990 to get us both in on that short-lived deal.</p>
<p>Premier Platinum privileges include up to three checked bags, default seating in Economy Plus (more legroom than in the rest of Economy), Premium lines at the ticket counter and Security, and boarding in Group One. There are more privileged castes, but this one is a serious tie-breaker against other airlines. Also, in all our decades of flying with United, we have no bad stories to tell, and plenty of good ones.</p>
<p>But now we’re mostly based in Bloomington, Indiana, so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_International_Airport">Indianapolis (IND)</a> is our main airport. (And it’s terrific. We recommend it highly.) It is also not a hub for any of the airlines. The airline with the most flights connecting to IND is American, and we’ve used them. I joined their frequent flier program, got their app, and started racking up miles with them too.</p>
<p>So here is one idea, for every airline: having respect for one’s established status with other airlines means something. Because that status (or those stati) are credentials: They say something about me as a potential passenger. It would be nice also if what I carry, as an <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2024/11/21/the-independent-customer/">independent customer</a>, is a set of verifiable preferences—such as that I always prefer a window seat, never tow a rolling bag on board (I only have a backpack), and am willing to change seats so a family can sit together. Little things that might matter.</p>
<p>I bring all this up because fixing “loyalty” programs shouldn’t be left up only to the sellers of the world. They’ll all do their fixes differently, and they’ll remain deaf to good input that can only come from independent customers with helpful tools of their own.</p>
<p>Developing those solutions to the loyalty problem is one of our callings at ProjectVRM. I also know some that are in the works. Stay tuned. </p>

<p>Bias in biometric identity systems still exists, but it is manageable, argues Andrew Shikiar at the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>When you unlock your smartphone, open your bank app, or approve a purchase on your laptop, you are using biometric authentication. It is such an unconscious part of our daily lives that if you blink, you might miss it.</p>



<p>It’s no wonder that biometrics are popular with consumers—they’re convenient and secure. Recent FIDO research found that consumers want to use biometrics to verify themselves online more, especially in sensitive use cases like financial services, where one out of two people said they would use biometric technology (48%). In fact, in the FIDO Aliance’s latest&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/research-findings-consumer-trends-and-attitudes-towards-authentication-methods/">online barometer survey</a>, consumers ranked biometrics as the most secure and preferred way to log in by consumers.</p>



<p>But for consumers, governments and other implementers, there is still a lingering ‘elephant in the room’ that continues to disrupt adoption: bias.</p>



<p>Should we worry about bias in biometrics?</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance’s research,&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/remote-identity-verification-biometric-systems-consumer-insights-2024">Remote ID Verification – Bringing Confidence to Biometric Systems Consumer Insights 2024</a>, found that consumers are concerned about bias in biometric facial verification systems– while the majority of consumers (56%) felt confident face biometrics systems could accurately identify individuals, a number still had concerns around discrimination present in some systems.</p>



<p>Concern surrounding the accuracy of biometric systems in processing diverse demographics has been developing in recent years. In the UK in 2021, for example, Uber drivers from diverse ethnic backgrounds took&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/05/ex-uber-driver-takes-legal-action-over-racist-face-recognition-software">legal action</a>&nbsp;over claims its software had illegally terminated their contracts as its software was unable to recognise them.</p>



<p>While the struggle of Uber drivers is just one example that underscores the issue, this problem is affecting people of colour and other underrepresented demographics more broadly—FIDO’s research found that one in four respondents feel they experience regular discrimination when using automated facial biometric systems (25%).</p>



<p>Feelings of discrimination and bias in facial recognition systems impact the entire user experience and erode faith in the technology overall. Half of British consumers in the survey said they would&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-addresses-accuracy-bias-in-remote-biometric-identity-verification-technologies-industry-first-testing-certification-program/">lose trust</a>&nbsp;in a brand or institution if it were found to have a biassed biometric system, and 22% would stop using the service entirely.</p>



<p>It’s clear why organisations like governments and banks would worry about these hard-hitting reputational and trust risks. Despite biometrics being widely accepted as a more convenient and highly secure technology, the small number of systems that aren’t as accessible are leaving an air of concern that is slowing down more mainstream adoption.</p>



<p>Addressing bias in facial verification&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most important thing to note is that not all biometric systems are created equal. Currently, testing levels are done on a case-by-case basis for each organisation, which is both costly and time-consuming, with varying definitions of what “good” looks like.</p>



<p>Based on proven ISO standards and developed by a diverse, international panel of industry, government, and identity experts, FIDO Alliance’s new&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/face-verification/">Face Verification Certification</a>&nbsp;program brings the industry’s first independent certification to market to build trust around biometric systems’ performance.</p>



<p>The certification assesses a face verification system’s performance across different demographics, including skin tone, age, and gender, in addition to far more wide-reaching security and performance tests.</p>



<p>The intensive security and liveness testing also verify that a provider’s face verification system can accurately confirm identities are real and authenticating in real-time, keeping threats like identity theft and deepfakes at bay. This is especially important for the most common use cases of face verification, like creating secure accounts, authenticating users, recovering accounts, and resetting passwords.</p>



<p>The beauty of independent certification is it sends a clear signal to consumers, potential clients, and auditors that the technology has been independently tested and is ready for both commercial and government use. It’s about building trust and showing that the provider takes security and fairness seriously.</p>



<p>More broadly, certification and independent global testing spark innovation and boost technological adoption. Whether you’re launching an identity verification solution or integrating it into regulations, open standards and certification provide a clear performance benchmark. This streamlines efforts, boosts stakeholder confidence and ultimately enhances the performance of all solutions on the market.</p>



<p>The future of identity&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the way we verify digital identities keeps evolving and demand to prove who we are remotely increases, biometric systems must be independently verified and free from bias. All technologies rolled out to this scale need to be fair and reliable for everyone.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance’s program demonstrates solution providers are serious about making sure biometric identity verification technologies are trustworthy, secure, and inclusive for all users. It’s like having a gold star or a seal of approval that says, “Hey, you can trust this system to be fair and safe.”</p>



<p>Biometrics for online identity verification is not just a promising concept; it’s rapidly becoming a practical necessity in today’s increasingly digital world. They’re ready for implementation across various industries. With independent certification, organisations can jump over the final hurdle to widespread adoption, empowering a future of more seamless, digital and remote identity.</p>

<p>FIDO passkey adoption doubles in 2024 as major firms opt for passwordless log-in</p>



<p>Passkeys are a biometric security trend to watch in 2025. The&nbsp;FIDO Alliance&nbsp;themed its 11th annual FIDO Tokyo Seminar on how passkey adoption is accelerating, with presentations from Google, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Mastercard, and other organizations joining the journey to password-free living. Microsoft has confirmed its advice on how to make people love passkeys – as it sweeps aside a major vulnerability that exposed 400 million Outlook 365 users.</p>



<p>Major tech brands drive mainstreaming of passkey account log-ins</p>



<p>In 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202410/amazon-is-ready-to-use-digital-identity-even-though-its-hard">Amazon</a>&nbsp;made passkeys available to 100 percent of its users and has seen 175 million passkeys created for sign-in to amazon.com globally. Google says 800 million Google accounts now use passkeys, with more than 2.5 billion passkey sign-ins over the past two years and sign-in success rates improving by 30 percent. Sony&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202412/passkey-adoption-by-australian-govt-banks-drives-wider-passwordless-authentication">adopted passkeys</a>&nbsp;for the global Playstation gaming community and saw a 24 percent reduction in sign-in time on its web applications.</p>



<p>Hyatt, IBM, Target and TikTok are among firms that have added&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/passkey-adoption-high-among-young-users-tired-of-endless-gyf5uu27">passkeys</a>&nbsp;to their workforce authentication options. More credential management products offering passkey options means more flexibility for consumers.</p>



<p>Japan joins passkey party in private sector, academia</p>



<p>The Japanese market showed a notable turn toward passkeys, with Nikkei, Nulab and Tokyu Corporation among firms embracing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202410/passwordless-authentication-for-healthcare-possible-with-biometrics-imprivata">passwordless authentication</a>&nbsp;technology. Nikkei will deploy passkeys for Nikkei ID as early as February 2025. Tokyu Corporation says 45 percent of TOKYU ID users have passkeys. And Nulab announced a “dramatic improvement in passkey adoption.”</p>



<p>Academia is helping drive innovation, with teams from Keio University and Waseda University winning acknowledgement for their research and prototypes at a slew of hackathons and workshops.</p>



<p>And FIDO, of course, is there to offer support, now offering its Passkey Central website resource on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.passkeycentral.org/ja/home/">passkey implementation</a>&nbsp;in Japanese, so that Japanese companies can take better advantage of its introductory materials, implementation strategies, UX&nbsp; and design guidelines and detailed roll-out guides.</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/working-groups/">The FIDO Japan Working Group</a>, which includes 66 of the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/">FIDO Alliance’s member companies</a>, is now in its 9th year of working to raise passkey awareness in the country.</p>

<p>The Swiss Parliament has resolved all outstanding differences between the National Council and the Council of States regarding the Electronic Identity Act (BGEID), paving the way for a formal final vote scheduled for December 20, 2024.</p>
<p>The implementation of SWIYU, encompassing both the electronic identity and its underlying trust infrastructure, has a potential to establish an open, interoperable ecosystem for digital credentials. This framework can&nbsp; be a solid foundation for the secure exchange of authentic data, thus fostering trustworthiness across digital applications in public administration, the economy, and civil society. Key principles of SWIYU and the e-ID include privacy by design, data minimization, user-centricity, and a commitment to openness and collaboration. We, at DIDAS, expect SWIYU, when fully implemented,&nbsp; to serve as an important building block&nbsp; promoting confidence in the digital realm, boosting economic growth and digital inclusion.</p>
<p>The new Swiss electronic identity (e-ID) system takes a completely different approach compared to the model that was rejected by voters in 2021. Unlike the earlier proposal, which handed the responsibility for issuing and managing digital identities to private companies, the new system is entirely state-operated. This ensures that the government, as a public entity, is responsible for issuing e-IDs and maintaining the necessary infrastructure. This change directly addresses the privacy and security concerns raised previously, making societal control easier. The updated framework is designed around user empowerment, with privacy by design and data minimization as fundamental principles, ensuring transparency and building confidence in its use.</p>
<p>What’s truly transformative is the system’s decentralized architecture, drawing its inspiration from Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles. This gives individuals control over their own digital identities, and ability to decide what information to share with 3rd parties, such as service providers. The design aligns with the “trust diamond” framework, which organizes four essential roles: the government as the issuer, individuals as the holders, service providers as the verifiers, and a governance framework that ensures everything operates within clear, enforceable and trusted rules. This structure creates a reliable and secure ecosystem for digital identity, addressing shortcomings of the previous E-ID vision resulting in a user-centric, privacy-preserving approach.</p>
<p>DIDAS is exceptionally proud to have made a number of key contributions to Switzerland’s efforts, ensuring the system reflects fundamental Swiss values such as federalism, direct democracy, self-determination, and autonomy. Since its inception in 2020, DIDAS has been a strong advocate for SSI principles, emphasizing user control over personal data and a need for a secure, privacy-preserving digital ecosystem. It has been an integral part of our vision that&nbsp; a digital trust ecosystem must safeguard privacy but also enable economic value creation.</p>
<p>Early Advocacy and Strategic Vision</p>
<p>In October 2020, DIDAS was established with the primary goal of positioning Switzerland as a <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2020/10/01/the-new-home-for-self-sovereign-identity-ecosystem-in-switzerland/">leader in developing and implementing privacy-preserving technologies</a>, services, and products related to digital identity and electronically verifiable data. This vision laid the groundwork for a digital trust ecosystem that emphasizes data sovereignty and identity management based on tight alignment with the SSI principles.</p>
<p>Early Advocacy for Self-Sovereign Identity Principles</p>
<p>In December 2021, DIDAS published an <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2021/12/17/self-sovereign-identity-explainer-introduction-to-the-world-of-ssi/">explainer on SSI</a>, outlining its core principles and the association’s commitment to establishing a viable and thriving SSI ecosystem. The DIDAS initiative aimed from the start to educate stakeholders and promote the adoption of SSI principles and frameworks within Switzerland’s digital infrastructure, for a more privacy preserving and frictionless digital future.</p>
<p>Contributing to the Dialog around&nbsp; National e-ID Legislation</p>
<p>By October 2021, DIDAS had provided <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2021/10/13/didas-provides-extensive-commentary-to-the-target-vision-for-e-id-in-switzerland/">extensive commentary on Switzerland’s target vision</a> for the e-ID system. The association advocated for an “ecosystem of digital proofs”, where the e-ID would serve as one credential among many, enabling both governmental and private entities to issue other types of&nbsp; credentials. This approach aimed to create a flexible and future-proof foundation for digital interactions in Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In December 2021, following a public consultation, the Swiss Federal Council decided to orient the implementation of the future e-ID system based on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles. DIDAS welcomed this decision, recognizing it as a commitment to a decentralized solution architecture that prioritizes maximum privacy protection and positions the e-ID as a cornerstone of a broader ecosystem of digital credentials. “Ambition level 3” was anchoring the approach to build an <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2021/12/21/e-id-based-on-ssi-needs-for-regulatory-support/">ecosystem of(business-domain-) ecosystems</a> in which, in addition to the E-ID, other verifiable credentials can be exchanged securely and reliably.</p>
<p>Promoting Technological Innovation</p>
<p>In its early stages, DIDAS members established an open sandbox environment to facilitate the development and testing of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions. This sandbox provided a controlled setting where developers and organizations could experiment with SSI technologies, enabling the creation of interoperable and secure digital identity systems. By offering access to resources such as repositories and live demonstrations, DIDAS’s sandbox played a crucial role in iteratively advancing knowledge within Switzerland’s E-ID movement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DIDAS has consistently emphasized the importance of advanced digital signature technologies to enhance the Swiss e-ID framework. Following DIDAS’ <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2024/02/21/4478/">statement in response to the E-ID technology discussion paper</a>, and its recommendation for Scenario “A” as a feasible technical starting point in February 2024, in March 2024, the association proposed to adopt the <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2024/03/22/parallel-signatures-a-relevant-input-to-the-technology-discussion/">concept of dual signatures</a>. The technology approach to bridging the gap between the well established, but less feature rich cryptography and the new, but less known, techniques. Supported by&nbsp; the US Department of Homeland Security, this technique involves attaching multiple digital signatures to a single payload, each offering distinct security or privacy features. This methodology enhances agility and robustness, accommodating various cryptographic standards and privacy needs without compromising data integrity.</p>
<p>Advocating for Economic Value Creation beyond the societal value of a self-sovereign E-ID</p>
<p>Beyond technological contributions, DIDAS has been a committed advocate for leveraging the e-ID programme by the Swiss Confederation, to establish a digital trust and authentic data exchange ecosystem that creates sustainable economic value. The Association further envisioned this future ecosystem removing friction in B2B and cross border processes, by enabling higher levels of assurance in automation, significantly reducing risk of fraud, simplifying the management of compliance as well as allowing for the proliferation of digital trust-based businesses and innovations. On the Basis of the DIDAS Sandbox, Members have been <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2022/10/24/the-power-of-e-id-ecosystems">experimenting around common use cases to explore ecosystem value</a> creation and are looking forward to support issuers, holders and verifiers as well as technology vendors, to further experiment with the confederation’s public beta infrastructure in early 2025.</p>
<p>In January 2024, during the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos, we collaborated with digitalswitzerland to co-organize the “Digital Trust” session at the digitalswitzerland Village. This event convened over 50 speakers and panelists, including industry leaders and policymakers, to discuss the critical role of digital trust in today’s interconnected world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September 2024, at the event organized by the State Secretariat of International Finance (SIF) and the Swiss Financial Innovation Desk (FIND) at the Swiss Embassy in Singapore, we had the privilege of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/swiss-financial-innovation-desk_staytuned-pathway2035-financialinnovation-activity-7265250188154322944-iBku?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">moderating and contributing to discussions on digital trust</a>, emphasizing the importance of verifiable data and trust frameworks in global financial ecosystems. Our insights have also been shaping a soon-to-be-published paper, where DIDAS explores key principles and practical strategies to advance digital trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collaborative Efforts and Future Outlook</p>
<p>We strongly believe that DIDAS’s collaborative approach, engaging, as a non for profit, independent association, with government bodies, private sector stakeholders, and civil society, has been instrumental in shaping Switzerland’s digital identity efforts. The association’s commitment to a pragmatic, principle-based, iterative, and inclusive methodology has ensured that the SWIYU’s vision aligns with both national interests and international standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Switzerland prepares the final approval of the e-ID legislation on December 20, 2024, the foundational work of DIDAS continues to be important.&nbsp; We have a lot of work ahead of us to support the adoption of the E-ID and its mechanisms of exchanging authentic data. We further see our role in helping to&nbsp; increase the fluency of business leaders and innovators in applying these mechanisms.&nbsp; We’ll use the combined expertise of our members and our energy to promote and further enhance the key aspects of Ambition Level 3 governance and cross-ecosystem interoperability. Continued experimentation and dialogare unavoidable, in order to uncover and realize business value of this emerging Trust Infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also proud to co-organize <a href="http://www.diceurope.org">DICE (Digital Identity unConference Europe)</a> in collaboration with Trust Square and the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) rooting in Mountain View, California. DICE first launched in 2023 and exceeded expectations with 160 expert participants contributing to dynamic discussions. The second DICE in 2024 was a milestone, <a href="https://www.eid.admin.ch/de/grussbotschaft-von-bundesrat-beat-jans-zur-der-digital-identity-unconference-europe-dice">opened by Federal Councilor Beat Jans</a>, underscoring the importance of these participatory conferences and their contribution to the development of the E-ID Framework and the Swiss Trust Infrastructure. DICE fosters joint learning, evolves collective thinking, and accelerates the adoption of digital identity and verifiable data solutions. In 2025, two events are planned, further advancing open dialogue as a cornerstone for collaboration for authenticity and trust in the digital realm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The association’s vision of a secure, adaptable, and authentic data ecosystem built on SSI principles underlines its dedication to a sustainable digital environment that favors privacy and security, while enabling significant economic value creation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing to create positive impact with all of our members, partners and other stakeholders.</p>

  <p>À l'ère du numérique, la liberté de choix est profondément influencée par la manière dont les données sont collectées, partagées et utilisées. La liberté de choisir est un concept fondamental qui revêt une importance particulière avec l'avènement des technologies numériques. Cette liberté de choix est intimement liée à la notion de sphère privée. Avec Internet et autres réseaux nous sommes confrontés à un large éventail de choix dans tous les aspects de notre vie quotidienne. Que ce soit dans le domaine des achats en ligne, des réseaux sociaux, des services bancaires en ligne ou dans le domaine de la santé, nous sommes constamment sollicités pour prendre des décisions aussi bien au niveau personnel que professionnel. Avec les outils d’intelligence artificielle qui s'immiscent dans notre quotidien notre sphère privée est-elle encore suffisamment protégée pour garantir autodétermination informationnelle ?</p><p>En prenant l’exemple de la médecine personnalisée dans le contexte de la liberté de choix à l'ère numérique, il est clair que l'accès aux données personnelles de santé et leur contrôle sont cruciaux. La médecine personnalisée s'engage à fournir des diagnostics et traitements individualisés. Cela nécessite des outils technologiques pour gérer les informations de santé de manière proactive afin de garantir que ces données soient utilisées de manière éthique et sécurisée. La technologie numérique doit aussi être utilisée pour renforcer l'autonomie des patients en leur permettant de prendre des décisions éclairées sur leur santé, tout en contribuant à des avancées significatives dans la recherche médicale.</p>

<p>Imagine connecting and configuring devices on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean with limited human intervention. That’s the reality of what can be achieved with the FIDO Alliance’s Device Onboarding (FDO) standard. This is an example of the applications that IoT pioneer ASRock Industrial is bringing to life.</p>



<p>The rapid proliferation of IoT devices and Edge computing across industries has brought with it unprecedented opportunities and challenges. By 2025, over 75 billion IoT devices are expected to be connected globally, increasing complexities in device management and widening the attack surface for malicious actors. Recent studies suggest nearly 57% of IoT devices are susceptible to medium or high-severity attacks.</p>



 Corporate Overview 



<p>ASRock Industrial, a global leader in industrial systems and motherboards, has become one of the first vendors to provide FDO-enabled compute solutions for industrial applications. The company offers industrial PC systems, motherboards, edge computers, and other products for industries such as automation, robotics, entertainment, and security, as well as cutting-edge systems for smart cities, energy firms, pharmaceuticals, automotive and more to customers around the world. ASRock Industrial is leading the way in the industrial IoT industry with its FDO certified solutions that make device onboarding more efficient, less vulnerable, and more scalable.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“FDO’s advanced security framework enables us to deliver unparalleled reliability and adaptability, empowering our clients to scale confidently in increasingly complex environments.” – Kenny Chang, Vice President of Product and Marketing Division, ASRock Industrial</p>
</blockquote>



 On the Edge: The Challenges of Industrial IoT 



<p>ASRock Industrial’s customers, like many in the industry, face challenges when deploying IoT devices and edge computing solutions quickly and securely.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Security vulnerabilities: Traditional manual onboarding methods leave devices vulnerable to unauthorized access and data breaches. For example, a connected IoT device may still have the original manufacturer’s default password in place, which increases the risk of password-related device compromises. Manual processes also increase the risk of exposed, unmanaged devices on the network. In industries like energy and transportation, secure operations are vital to public safety and system reliability. 



 Time and cost inefficiencies: Not only are manual processes time-consuming, hiring skilled installers is extremely expensive. When calculating the time and cost for a skilled engineer to manually onboard edge devices, it’s important to include not only the technical setup time but also the travel time to what potentially may be multiple sites. ASRock Industrial estimates that before FDO, users could spend up to $1,000 per device implementation*.&nbsp; With FDO the installation is not only much faster and more secure, but it is also a task that can often be handled by existing on-site staff. 



 Complexity and scalability: Legacy onboarding approaches are complex to deploy and manage. This complexity is only further exacerbated by the remote and high-risk environments many industrial applications are in. Sending skilled engineers to these environments not only creates bottlenecks and slows scalability, it introduces safety risks that further amplify costs. 



 Lack of interoperability: The IoT space is very fragmented, with multiple proprietary platforms and operating systems. Existing “zero-touch” solutions are restricted in compatibility, making it hard to support clients across different sectors. 
 



 Creating an FDO Solution 



<p>To solve these challenges, ASRock Industrial turned to FIDO Device Onboard (FDO), and in doing so has become one of the market’s earliest adopters of this compelling technology. ASRock Industrial has integrated FDO into its flagship iEP-5010G series, a robust edge controller built for demanding industrial applications and harsh environments. The iEP-5010G series can operate within a wide temperature range of -40 to 70 degrees and supports 6-36VDC power inputs, 4G LTE, 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth, and offers the most flexible I/Os and expansion options, making it a fit for industrial automation, robotics, transportation and more.</p>



<p>The ASRock Industrial FDO solution has been designed with FDO’s advanced features in mind. It delivers end-to-end FDO onboarding capabilities, encompassing all critical FDO functions: manufacturer, owner and rendezvous server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather than hard programming devices for each different operating system, the iEP-5010G series device controller can be deployed as one system without pre-installation of OS or additional programming. This simplifies manufacturing and provides a better customer experience with the flexibility to decide OS requirements later in the process.</p>



<p>The FDO standard and associated certification program ensure consistency and interoperability. Standardized onboarding means devices are consistently and correctly deployed every time, removing the risk of errors for ASRock Industrial’s customers. Most importantly, the open standards-based approach means it can work seamlessly with other partners in the industry and support players across the globe.</p>



 Results and Impact 



<p>While early implementation results are still being gathered, ASRock Industrial anticipates significant benefits for both the company and its customers.</p>



<p>One of ASRock Industrial’s earliest use cases lies in the smart city domain, where their FDO-enabled iEP-7020E series devices leverage FDO technology to automatically onboard hardware and software to connect electric vehicle (EV) charging points and related devices seamlessly. By enabling remote monitoring of charging stations across multiple locations, FDO has eliminated the need for engineers to visit sites physically. Its AI-driven analytics have dramatically enhanced operational efficiency, while remote surveillance has addressed key challenges such as charger hogging, vandalism, and unauthorized access. This capability ensures more efficient and timely incident management. As urban demands evolve, FDO serves as a robust foundation for scalable, secure deployments, delivering sustained benefits over time.</p>



 Looking Ahead 



<p>ASRock Industrial’s investment in FDO puts us in a prime position to meet the rigorous demands of Industry 4.0 advancements and provide customers with security levels that protect against the expanding edge threat landscape. In 2024, ASRock Industrial became one of the first to achieve FDO certification, passing the FIDO Alliance’s rigorous independent testing processes. The results of this testing demonstrate that ASRock Industrial’s products fully meet the FDO specification, meaning partners and clients can trust the security, interoperability and FDO functionality of these solutions.</p>



<p>FDO certification also plays an important role in differentiating ASRock Industrial by making their products more marketable in that they are capable of meeting the needs of a growing number of RFPs that call out FDO. Additionally, it reduces the company’s need to spend time and effort in intensive vendor bake-offs, allowing ASRock Industrial to spend more time innovating its product lines and value-added services.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Deploying FDO has marked a pivotal shift for ASRock Industrial, establishing a new benchmark in secure, scalable onboarding for industrial edge AIoT solutions. This deployment cements ASRock Industrial’s leadership in industrial computing security and sets the stage for us to shape the future of Industry 4.0 with solutions that are both resilient and future-ready.”– Kenny Chang, Vice President of ASRock Industrial</p>

<p>The development of a robust ecosystem around the upcoming E-ID implementation in Switzerland represents an essential next step in building Trust Infrastructure. For us at DIDAS it has always been vital to emphasize that while the E-ID verifiable credential is very important, it is still just a building block, the first step towards a much larger ecosystem where a variety of verifiable credentials will be issued and exchanged on a daily basis.</p>
 
 
 
<p>Many of these credentials, as well as the processes depending on them, will be implemented in the private sector, the vision known as “Ambition Level 3”. This is where the real economic value will come from. Much like the road infrastructure is built by the state and then fuels the economy, so will the Trust Infrastructure serve as a critical foundation, a privacy preserving enabler, for all kinds of native digital processes in the near future.</p>
<p>The E-ID framework, including the underlying Trust Infrastructure, is primarily targeting personal identity and credentials. To realize the complete potential of the Credentials’ Ecosystem, however, the open topics around the organization identity – the identity of an organization itself as well as that of their representatives – must be addressed.<br>
Unlike natural persons, legal entities require unique considerations for authentication, governance, and compliance. A well-designed solution for legal entity identities could unlock significant opportunities for global trade, regulatory compliance, and business interoperability.</p>
<p>To succeed, the chosen approach must be flexible, future-proof, and globally scalable. Not only from a technical standpoint but also from a governance perspective. A scalable solution must accommodate the widest variety of jurisdictions, regulatory requirements, and business use cases, ensuring it is both technically sound and broadly acceptable.</p>
 The Role of vLEI Credentials 
<p>One of the most promising solutions in this space is the Verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) credentials ecosystem. Pioneered by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), vLEI credentials aim to provide an extensible basis for an electronically verifiable and trustworthy way to identify legal entities and their representatives in the digital world. GLEIF, a globally recognized authority, oversees the issuance of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) that are already widely used in the financial sector to improve transparency and reduce risk.</p>
<p>The vLEI system builds upon this foundation by leveraging cutting-edge technology to ensure verifiability and scalability. However, despite its many advantages, the underlying technical framework—centered around Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) and Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC)— has proven rather challenging to grasp.</p>
 Deep Dive into the vLEI and its technical foundations 
<p>To make it easier to understand and appreciate the solution, we have undertaken a deep dive into both the governance and technical aspects of the vLEI ecosystem. Our goal is to provide an accurate insight into the key mechanisms and characteristics that make vLEI ecosystem a prime candidate to serve as the backbone for use-cases and applications that require a globally scalable legal entity identity framework.</p>
<p>First, we take a look at the governance, highlighting the key aspects as to why vLEI ecosystem can meet the diverse regulatory requirements of jurisdictions worldwide while accommodating the varied needs of businesses. Then, on the technical side, we are exploring the foundational KERI/ACDC technology, which promises enhanced security, efficiency, transparency and interoperability.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>To learn with us, watch the recorded deep-dive session on vLEI and its technical underpinnings.</p>
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Stay tuned for more insights as we continue this journey toward shaping the future of legal entity identities in the digital era.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Together, let’s make the vision of a seamless, privacy-first digital ecosystem a reality. Stay connected and be <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/getinvolved/">part</a> of the transformation!</p>

<p>Momentum continues in Japan with notable passkey success stories and deployments from Nikkei, Tokyu, Google, Sony Interactive Entertainment, KDDI, LY Corporation, Mercari and NTT DOCOMO</p>



<p>TOKYO, December 12, 2024 – More than 15 billion online accounts can use passkeys for faster, safer sign-ins – more than double than this time last year. The momentum behind FIDO and passkeys is the focus of today’s 11th annual FIDO Tokyo Seminar, where hundreds gathered to learn about the latest developments in the global push to eliminate dependence on passwords. Presenters include those from Google, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Mastercard, Waseda University, the Institute of Information Security, KDDI, LY Corporation, Mercari and NTT DOCOMO.</p>



<p>Passkeys become more widely available for consumer and workforce applications – and companies are seeing the benefits&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys provide phishing-resistant security with a simple user experience far superior to passwords and other phishable forms of authentication. Many consumer brands are reporting passkey success stories and business benefits; some notable new and recent announcements include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Amazon made passkeys available to 100% of its users, including in Japan, this year and already has 175 million passkeys created for sign-in to amazon.com across geographies. 



 Google recently reported that 800 million Google accounts now use passkeys, resulting in more than 2.5 billion passkey sign-ins over the past two years. Also, Google’s sign-in success rates have improved by 30% and sign-ins speeds have increased by 20% on average. 



 Sony Interactive Entertainment, the company behind PlayStation, released passkeys as an alternative option to passwords for their global gaming community and observed a 24% reduction in sign-in time on its web applications for passkey users. Additionally, high conversion rates have been observed, with 88% of customers who are presented with the benefits of passkeys successfully completing enrollment. 
 



<p>Adoption also grew in the workforce this year as more companies bolstered their authentication options with passkeys, including Hyatt, IBM, Target and TikTok.</p>



<p>Consumers gained flexibility and choice for passkey management this year, as more credential managers, such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane and LastPass expanded their passkeys support cross-ecosystem, and the FIDO Alliance announced <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/">new draft specifications</a> for users to securely move passkeys and all other credentials across providers.</p>



<p>Notable Momentum in Japan</p>



<p>Specifically in Japan, new passkeys deployments and success were announced from Nikkei Inc., Nulab Inc., and Tokyu Corporation:</p>



 
 Nikkei Inc. unveiled their plan to deploy passkeys for Nikkei ID, for the millions of Nikkei ID customers to begin their migration from passwords to passkeys. This will be launching in February 2025 or later. 



 Nulab Inc. announced their dramatic improvement in passkey adoption for Nulab accounts based on the outcome of the Passkey Hackathon Tokyo this past November. 



 Tokyu Corporation has reported that 45% of TOKYU ID users have passkeys, and sign-ins with passkeys are 12 times faster than a password plus an emailed OTP. 
 



<p>Additionally, Nikkei Inc., Nulab Inc. and Tokyu Corporation all successfully demonstrated their passkey implementations at the Passkey Hackathon Tokyo, organized by Google and sponsored by FIDO Alliance, in June 2024. Companies receiving awards included Nulab and Tokyu, as well as two teams of students from Japanese universities:</p>



 
 Keio University team received the grand winner award for adopting passkeys combined with an IoT device – a smart door lock created by a 3D printer. 



 Waseda University team received another FIDO award for their unique user authentication protocol and implementation combined with passkeys, verifiable credentials and zero-knowledge proofs. 
 



<p>In addition to these two teams, a group at the Institute of Information Security (Yokohama, Japan) presented their research entitled “A Study on Notification Design to Encourage General Users to Use Passkeys” at a workshop organized by the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSG) on December 4, 2024. These activities demonstrate how students in academia are embracing passkeys as an attractive option for life without passwords.</p>



<p>Organizations that have already deployed passkeys for more than a year shared new successes:</p>



 
 KDDI now has more than 13 million au ID customers now using FIDO and has seen a dramatic decrease (nearly 35%)&nbsp; in calls to its customer support center as a result. Managing FIDO adoption carefully for both subscribers and non-subscribers. 



 LY Corporation property Yahoo! JAPAN ID now has 27 million active passkeys users. Approximately 50% of user authentication on smartphones is now passkeys. LY Corporation said that passkeys have a higher success rate over SMS OTP and achieve 2.6 times faster. 



 Mercari has 7 million users enrolled in passkeys, and enforcing passkey login for synced passkeys enrolled users of Mercari. Notably, there have been zero phishing incidents at Mercoin, a Mercari subsidiary since March 9, 2023. 



 NTT DOCOMO has increased its passkey enrollments and now passkeys are used for approximately 50% of authentication by account users. NTT DOCOMO notably reports significant decreases in successful phishing attempts and there have been no unrecognized payments at docomo Online Shop since September 23, 2022. 
 



<p>To drive further adoption in Japan, the FIDO Alliance announced that <a href="https://www.passkeycentral.org/ja/home/">Passkey Central</a>, the website for consumer service providers to learn more about why and how to implement passkeys for simpler and more secure sign-ins, is now available in Japanese. Passkey Central provides visitors with actionable, data-driven content to discover, implement, and maintain passkeys for maximum benefits over time. The comprehensive resources on Passkey Central include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Introduction to passkeys 



 Business considerations and metrics&nbsp; 



 Internal and external communication materials 



 Implementation strategies &amp; detailed roll-out guides&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 UX &amp; Design guidelines 



 Troubleshooting 



 And more implementation resources, such as glossary, Figma kits, and accessibility guidance 
 



<p>Along with the many in Japan, there are 66 of the FIDO Alliance’s 300+ member companies actively taking part in the FIDO Japan Working Group (FJWG). The FJWG is now beginning its 9th year working together to spread awareness and adoption of FIDO in the region.</p>



<p>Consumers and workforce users are aware of, and want to use, passkeys</p>



<p>Passkeys are not only available across a wide array of services, but recent studies have shown that consumers and workforce users are aware of, and want to use, passkeys. Recent FIDO Alliance <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/research-findings-consumer-trends-and-attitudes-towards-authentication-methods/">research</a> shows that in the two years since passkeys were first made available, consumer awareness has risen by 50%, up from 39% in 2022 to now 57% in 2024. Consumers also report that when they adopt at least one passkey, 1 out of 4 enables passkeys whenever possible. A majority of consumers also believe passkeys are more secure (61%) and more convenient than passwords (58%). Since 2023, consumers from APAC reported passkey awareness has grown significantly more when compared to the global average and other countries in 2024. Consumers from China (80%), India (70%), Japan (62%), and Singapore (58%) reported significantly higher passkey adoption in the last year, with Australia (52%) and South Korea (44%) trending close to the overall average (59%).</p>

  <p>On the same day, representatives of the Human Colossus Foundation attended the annual hybrid participation meeting of the project E-ID, which took place in the Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication (FOITT) buildings in Zollikofen. The Human Colossus Foundation's (HCF) contribution is the technology for securing and styling the visualisation of the E-ID on mobile devices. E-ID pilots have already implemented HCF's <a href="https://oca.colossi.network/">Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) [2]</a> in different contexts (see for example canton Thurgau <a href="https://github.com/e-id-admin/general/blob/main/meetings/20241206_E-ID-Partizipationsmeeting_DVS4U_DE.pdf">proof of concept [3]</a>. The Foundation will continue to support the E-ID team on semantic harmonisation for a stylish but secured visualisation of digital proofs.&nbsp;</p><p>However, our goal at the Human Colossus Foundation is to promote and support E-ID projects beyond the semantic realm. We support E-ID and public service initiatives in Switzerland and abroad. Our Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) approach anticipates the future implementation of national infrastructure components, including distributed governance and decentralised authentication. These technologies go beyond the building of complex verifiable credential use cases. They enable an ecosystem approach, helping integrate many providers of digital proofs, further enabling diverse use cases for E-ID.</p><p>We welcome the two-stage approach of the project that confirms a go-live for 2026 while activating research and development for higher security and privacy.</p>

 Every purchase you’ve made until now — whether it’s a pair of shoes, a mobile phone, a laptop, or even exotic fruits — was most likely transported by sea. Globally, the maritime industry is responsible for approximately 2% of overall carbon emissions while serving as a critical component of nearly all industrial companies’ supply chains and transportation systems.  Why Katalist? <p>Decarbonizing the maritime industry is a challenging task due to the long lifespan of ships (around 35 years), which limits the speed of fleet replacement. This is why the focus has shifted to the use of low-emission fuels, enabled by a Chain of Custody model called “Book and&nbsp;Claim.”</p><p>The system allows for the decoupling of the physical low-emission fuel from its associated low-emission attribute, which can be traded separately. This approach makes low-emission fuels more accessible.</p><p>This model serves as an interim mechanism, buying time until global infrastructure is fully in place to support widespread physical use of low-emission fuels without needing to decouple the sustainability attributes of maritime fuel from its actual&nbsp;usage.</p> How? <p>To build trust among participants, the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping and RMI have co-developed and continuously refined a robust methodology that all actors can rely&nbsp;on.</p><p>The role of Energy Web Foundation was to provide the technology platform in a way that shortened implementation timelines, enabled hypothesis testing, and allowed for necessary adjustments in a relatively short time compared to building everything from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>Thanks to our Generic Green Proofs approach, we successfully developed two proof-of-concepts, gathering valuable insights that enabled the team to refine the solution into a full production platform — ready to launch in November at COP29 (link to the press release).</p><p>What might have taken years to build, we accomplished in months, delivering critical insights that shaped the final platform.</p> What Companies Can Do on the&nbsp;Platform   Issuance<br>The creation of certificates on Katalist follows a well-thought-out methodology. This ensures that the most relevant data is collected from ships and voyages, along with the appropriate documentation to attest to fuel attributes and&nbsp;usage.  Transfer<br>Participants on the platform can transfer certificates based on predetermined rules and restrictions.  Retirements and Export (Claims)<br>The ultimate goal for companies using the platform is to claim emission savings from alternative fuel usage in their sustainability reports.  Public Retirement Table<br>Depending on the type of company, industry actors can view varying levels of information about actual fuel usage. Once the final actor (Cargo Owner) has claimed the certificate, the data becomes publicly available through the “Public Retirement Table.”   Who? <p>The platform is designed for key maritime industry&nbsp;actors:</p>  Shipping Companies: Operators or owners of ships are responsible for purchasing fuel and uploading relevant data to the platform.  Freight Forwarders: Intermediaries in the maritime transportation cycle and vital parts of the supply&nbsp;chain.  Cargo Owners: Responsible for the contents of shipments.   What Will 2025&nbsp;Bring? <p>By the end of the year, we anticipate onboarding several companies to the platform. By early 2025, the first certificates will be issued using Katalist. Additional features will be developed, with updates shared as plans progress.</p> Conclusion <p>Energy Web contributes to decarbonization efforts by serving as a climate-tech partner, significantly accelerating the journey from ideas to proof-of-concepts and minimum viable products.</p><p>Our expertise lies in creating generic frameworks that enable faster deployments, adaptable to decarbonization plans that drive impactful climate change solutions.</p><p>If you’re interested in bringing your ideas to life faster and more efficiently using proven methodologies and connections with relevant industry actors, let’s discuss how Green Proofs can be applied to your use case.<a href="http://www.energyweb.org/"> contact&nbsp;us!</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/generic-green-proofs-use-case-applied-to-the-maritime-industry-katalist-dedf9f9ef9cf">Generic Green Proofs Use Case (Applied to the Maritime Industry): Katalist</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/dgna-56242-stand-der-entwicklung-der-sta#t=41">Watch: A Panel Discussion on the Development of Switzerland’s State E-ID</a> 
<p>On September 19, 2024, a fact-based discussion took place on the progress of Switzerland’s state electronic identity (E-ID). The network policy evening was organized by the digital society and highlighted the key challenges and opportunities of a project that is set to shape the country’s digital future. Speakers included Annett Laube, Professor of Computer Science at Bern University of Applied Sciences, Rolf Rauschenbach, Information Officer for E-ID at the Federal Office of Justice, and Daniel Säuberli, President of the Digital Identity and Data Sovereignty Association (DIDAS).</p>
 The Vision for a State E-ID 
<p><a href="https://magazin.abraxas.ch/e-government/infografik-der-nutzen-der-e-id"></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://magazin.abraxas.ch/e-government/infografik-der-nutzen-der-e-id">Der Nutzen der E-ID</a></p>
<p>The state-operated E-ID is more than a technological tool; it is envisioned as a foundation for trust and efficiency in the digital space. Following the rejection of the privately run E-ID proposal in 2021, a state-led solution focusing on privacy, data sovereignty, and user-friendliness has taken center stage. The goal is to create a digital identity that meets citizens’ needs while establishing the technological and legal groundwork for innovative digital services.</p>
 Contributions from the Experts 
<p>Prof. Annett Laube provided insights into the technological and scientific standards required for the development of the E-ID. She emphasized the importance of ensuring privacy and security through principles like privacy by design and highlighted the critical role of transparency enabled by open-source solutions. User binding is the secure process of linking a digital identity to its rightful owner, ensuring only authorized individuals can access and use the E-ID while maintaining privacy and trust.</p>
<p>Rolf Rauschenbach outlined the strategic and political considerations underpinning the project. He discussed the challenges of implementing a solution that is both technically robust and user-friendly and stressed the need for a clear legal framework.</p>
<p>Daniel Säuberli, representing DIDAS, drew attention to the essential role of trust in digital infrastructures. He emphasized three fundamental principles necessary for the success of the E-ID:</p>
 
 Strengthening Data Sovereignty: Citizens must have full control over their personal data, without unnecessary interference by third parties. 
 Promoting Interoperability: The E-ID must function on both a national and international level to enable seamless cross-border digital interactions. 
 Building Trust Through Transparency: Open communication and active collaboration with the public, private sector, and academia are critical to gaining widespread acceptance for the E-ID. 
 
 Ambition Levels for the E-ID

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/zielbild-e-id.html">Zielbild E-ID</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development of the state E-ID is structured around three ambition levels, each reflecting its growing capabilities and societal value:</p>
 
 Basic Functionality: At this level, the E-ID serves as a secure and user-friendly tool for digital identification. It is used primarily for core applications, such as accessing federal online services like tax filings or registry extracts, and ensures reliable authentication for administrative processes. 
 Integration into Cantonal and Municipal Services: The second level expands the E-ID’s use to services provided by cantons and municipalities. The goal is to offer citizens seamless digital access to public services across all administrative levels. Examples include registering address changes, participating in electronic voting, or applying for local permits. This integration transforms the E-ID into a vital part of Switzerland’s public administration. 
 Adoption by the Private Sector: The highest ambition level envisions the E-ID as a universal identification tool for private-sector services. This includes applications in areas such as online banking, e-commerce, and healthcare. By creating a digital ecosystem where the E-ID is widely accepted, it becomes a driver of innovation and digitization across various industries. 
 
 Connecting Principles to Ambition Levels 
<p>The ambition levels of the state E-ID are intrinsically linked to the principles outlined by Daniel Säuberli:</p>
 
 Data Sovereignty forms the foundation of the basic functionality, ensuring citizens retain control over their data. 
 Interoperability becomes essential as the E-ID is integrated into cantonal and municipal services, enabling seamless operation across different platforms. 
 Transparency is vital for the third level, fostering trust and accountability as the E-ID expands into the private sector. 
 
 Challenges and Outlook 
<p>Despite significant progress, critical questions remain: How can the E-ID be effectively integrated into existing systems? How can transparency and privacy be guaranteed? And how can public trust be secured? Addressing these challenges will require collaboration, clear communication, and an unwavering commitment to the outlined principles.</p>
 DIDAS: A Driving Force for Digital Trust 
<p>For DIDAS, the state E-ID represents a cornerstone for promoting digital trust and innovation. As a platform for digital trust infrastructures, DIDAS is committed to advancing the development of the E-ID and creating the conditions for a sovereign digital society.</p>
<p>With its state-operated E-ID, Switzerland has the opportunity to become a leader in digital identities—rooted in the values of trust, security, and innovation.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The state E-ID offers Switzerland the chance to establish a modern and trustworthy digital ecosystem centered on the needs of its citizens. By strengthening data sovereignty, ensuring interoperability, and fostering transparency, the E-ID is a crucial step forward in the country’s digital transformation.</p>
<p>However, its success depends on transparency, collaboration, and clear communication to build trust and public acceptance. DIDAS plays a pivotal role by bridging stakeholders and promoting the principles of digital trust and data sovereignty. Through a clear vision and open dialogue, Switzerland can set a global example for a digital future built on trust, innovation, and user empowerment.</p>

 Today we will take a step back from our discussions of Green Proofs-powered platforms to take a deeper dive into Green Proofs itself — why it exists, the problems it solves, and how it&nbsp;works  Why Green&nbsp;Proofs? <p>In today’s world, corporations are under immense pressure to reduce their carbon footprints, meet regulatory standards, and fulfill consumer demand for greener products. In doing so, they must balance the challenge of providing good and verifiable data that stands up to external scrutiny with protecting their proprietary information and processes.</p><p>Corporations are pursuing a variety of sustainability solutions to achieve these goals, which vary in terms of flexibility, cost and compliance with the standards of large-scale enterprises and regulators.</p><p>To address these complex sustainability needs, Energy Web developed Green Proofs — a powerfully comprehensive and configurable software solution — to bring<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/what-we-do-clean-energy/"> deep levels of transparency and verifiability to emerging green products and&nbsp;markets</a>.</p> Green Proofs technology is built to enable the following: <p>1. Buy and sell low carbon services and commodities: Whether your company deals in biofuels, green energy, or climate-conscious services, Green Proofs helps you sell and source products that can be verifiably marketed as sustainable.</p><p>2. Launch green product registries: Create transparent, scalable, and credible market access in “hard to abate” sectors that can benefit from attribute tracking and support broader decarbonization.</p><p>3. Prove your company and products are sustainable: Green Proofs provides tools for tracking and reporting progress toward environmental goals. It integrates granular data, helping you measure Scope 3 emissions and evaluate supplier impact while protecting sensitive information.</p> Green Proofs technology <p>Green Proofs is a suite of modular technology solutions that come in the form of turn-key applications or highly customized software built in close partnership with Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>A core technology underpinning Green Proofs software is the <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/ew-dos-technology-components-2023/worker-nodes">Energy Web Worker node network</a>. Energy Web developed worker nodes to solve a longstanding problem that hindered the advancement of energy tracking solutions: solution logic varied widely according to use case and relied on commercially sensitive data that oftentimes needed to remain private, but the results needed to be transparent and publicly verifiable.</p><p>Worker nodes address this problem by allowing enterprises to configure their own computing networks&nbsp;that:</p>  Ingest data from external&nbsp;sources  Execute custom logic workflows  Vote on results in order to establish consensus without revealing or modifying the underlying data.  Publish the consensus to a trusted, public&nbsp;ledger  <p>Worker nodes put enterprises in the driver’s seat of their application, giving them granular control over workflow logic and data inputs. The end result is an enterprise-friendly architecture that provides cryptographic proof that pre-defined rules and processes are being followed correctly, while preserving data privacy and integrity.</p><p>It is important to note that while Energy Web has historically been known for its use of blockchain, worker nodes do not exist to store or tokenize certificates and data on the blockchain. The primary use of blockchain in Green Proofs is to serve as a ledger for the worker nodes’ validation results of logic workflows.</p> Green Proofs Business Applications <p>Green Proofs helps companies demonstrate that their operations, products, and services are sustainable. It achieves this in three&nbsp;ways:</p> Helping Companies Buy and Sell Low-Carbon Services and Commodities <p>Green Proofs streamlines access to low-carbon services and commodities, empowering companies to source materials and services that both support their sustainability goals and enable the marketing/sale of verifiably green products. Currently, Green Proofs is streamlining market access to <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">sustainable aviation fuel</a>, <a href="http://autogreencharge.com">green EV charging</a>, <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/maritime">low-carbon shipping services</a>, and <a href="http://gp4btc.org">climate-aligned Bitcoin mining</a>, making it easier for companies to find the right solutions to reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.</p><p>The recently-announced <a href="https://katalist.eco/">Katalist platform</a> is an excellent example of this business application — using Katalist, maritime freight customers can lower their emissions using a robust book-and-claim system, supporting corporate sustainability claims about themselves and their products.</p> Launch Green Product Registries <p>For companies or consortia looking to establish or expand markets for emerging green commodities, Green Proofs offers the ability to launch next-generation Green Product Registries. These registries support transparent, scalable tracking of sustainable goods and services, enabling participants to securely book, trade, and retire digital certificates that represent specific environmental attributes.</p><p>By deploying these customized registries, companies can support sustainable product verification, drive growth in emerging green markets, and contribute to decarbonization efforts on a larger scale. With the flexibility and transparency offered by Green Proofs, businesses can lead the way in expanding sustainable options for their industry while building trust with customers and stakeholders.</p><p>To learn more about this business application, we invite you to explore the <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">SAFc Registry</a>, where users can obtain certificates representing the use of sustainable aviation fuel, which are then used to credibly claim Scope 3 emissions reductions.</p> Track and Report Emissions <p>To truly demonstrate sustainability, companies need more than metrics; they need verifiable data that tracks the environmental impact of their products, operations, and supply chains (scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions). Green Proofs can help companies better collect, track, and report this data in detail, offering insights on both corporate-level and product-specific emissions. We are currently working with industry partners to gather requirements for this business application&nbsp;.</p> Who can use Green&nbsp;Proofs? <p>Energy Web built Green Proofs for any corporation or organization that wants to market itself or its products as green. We help customers access Green Proofs in a variety of ways — from no-code and low-code solutions that enable quick, independent launches to providing ongoing design, development, and hosting services for bespoke platforms. To discuss possibilities for applying Green Proofs to your use case, <a href="http://www.energyweb.org">please contact&nbsp;us!</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/green-proofs-a-360-view-207d0e3038d4">Green Proofs: a 360° View</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/new-zealand-lawyer-not-surprised-if-australian-laws-change-for-retail-biometrics-use">Biometric Update Website</a></p>



<p>Digital Identity New Zealand (<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">DINZ</a>) hosted a discussion led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/nec-new-zealand">NEC New Zealand</a>&nbsp;on “Facial Recognition and CCTV Integration in Retail Security” this week, with a panel including data privacy, government and legal experts.</p>



<p>It comes amidst industry anticipation of the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner’s conclusions on supermarket chain Foodstuff’s results from its trial of facial recognition. The company considers the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202409/early-results-positive-in-new-zealand-trial-of-facial-recognition-at-grocery-stores">preliminary findings</a>&nbsp;of the trial encouraging.</p>



<p>In Australia, retail chain Bunnings made headlines after it was found to have breached the country’s privacy laws by using facial recognition. However, the company received some unexpected support when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/retail-facial-recognition-for-crime-prevention-finds-support-in-australia-uk">78 percent of nearly 11,000 respondents</a>&nbsp;supported the company’s use of the technology.</p>



<p>In the discussion, Campbell Featherston, a partner at law firm Dentons New Zealand, mentioned that it is easier to deploy facial recognition technology (FRT) in New Zealand rather than Australia due to differences in law.</p>



<p>Commenting on the Bunnings case, Featherston remarked that the Australian retailer must obtain consent when collecting biometric data such as from FRT.&nbsp; “The absence of consent under Australian law means that it is very difficult for Bunnings to roll out facial recognition technology,” he said.</p>



<p>“The need for consent doesn’t apply [in New Zealand],” Campbell said, who commented that it wouldn’t surprise him if the privacy law had to change in Australia, such as removing the need for consent in order to accommodate the use of FRT.</p>



<p>Ross Hughson, managing director of Personal Information Management, was asked what was driving the use of FRT amongst retailers. “The key driver is health and safety of staff,” he replied, pointing to managers’ responsibility over their employees’ health and safety.</p>



<p>Featherston elaborated on how best to comply with New Zealand’s Privacy Act 2020, mentioning privacy impact assessments (PIA), having a good understanding of privacy safeguards, having human oversight of the technology, and properly trained staff. He suggested that users of the technology should be sure of the purpose of what they’re trying to achieve through its use, and to avoid “purpose creep.” Transparency is also important and retailers should have notices at the entrance of stores, and “customer-facing documentation,” he said.</p>



<p>The senior lawyer made the point that issues can arise even in the absence of technology. He brought up the example of security guards trying to identify people based on grainy CCTV footage, which could lead to misidentification.</p>



<p>Dr. Vica Papp, principal data scientist at MBIE, was invited to talk about racial biases. This is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/new-zealands-foodstuff-defends-its-use-of-facial-recognition">a chief concern of New Zealand Privacy Commissioner</a>&nbsp;Michael Webster as the accuracy of FRT for minority populations with darker skin is an issue.</p>



<p>Papp recognized that biases exist and the importance of training for staff on unconscious biases. She said that with FRT it can be a physics-based issue rather than that of “race” as people with darker skin tend to reflect less light, picking up on “light receptivity” and how this may impact FRT. But she advised that retailers should find a product that doesn’t show discrimination, that it can handle the specific local population, and to train and test the system on “well-curated data sets.”</p>

     <p>The Digital Identity unConference Europe (DICE) 2024 took place this June in Zürich, welcoming global experts to discuss not just secure digital identities but the creation of an integrated ecosystem of trust. Over three sunny days at Trust Square, attendees worked to connect digital trust to real-world economic advantages by focusing on authentic data, verifiable proofs, and practical applications that go beyond mere identification. This was made possible through the collaboration of <a href="https://www.trustsquare.com/">Trust Square</a>, <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/">DIDAS</a>, and <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a>, emphasizing the power of partnerships in advancing digital trust.</p>
 A New Direction for Swiss Digital Identity 
<p></p>
<p>Bundesrat Beat Jans, head of the Swiss Federal Office of Justice and the leading figure behind Switzerland’s e-ID project, opened the conference with updates on the nation’s progress. Switzerland is advancing its secure digital identity framework while maintaining technology-neutral principles, ensuring future adaptability.</p>
<p>The new e-ID law, under parliamentary review, defines the required trust infrastructure without mandating specific technologies, providing issuers with the flexibility to choose tailored solutions. This approach strengthens market responsiveness, protects investments, and ensures seamless integration with emerging innovations.</p>
<p>However, balancing security and accessibility remains a challenge. By limiting the initial rollout of the e-ID to a government-developed open-source wallet, Switzerland aims to provide robust security while ensuring transparency. Plans to engage with the OpenWallet Foundation and promote open hardware crypto processors reflect Switzerland’s commitment to digital sovereignty and international standardization.</p>
 Beyond Identity: Building a Trust Ecosystem 
<p>DICE 2024 highlighted that the economic value of digital trust lies in creating a broader ecosystem—not just digital identities. Verifiable credentials, authentic data, and secure proofs were discussed as enablers of trust in industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics.</p>
<p>By emphasizing data integrity, industries can streamline processes, reduce fraud, and build consumer trust. For example, verifiable credentials can authenticate professional qualifications or certifications in real-time, while trusted data channels improve supply chain transparency. DICE underscored the need for governance models to maintain consistency and reliability in such ecosystems, paving the way for more secure, efficient, and scalable solutions.</p>
 Economic Implications of Trust Ecosystems 
<p>The trust ecosystem proposed at DICE 2024 offers significant economic benefits:</p>
 
 Fraud reduction: Improved verification lowers financial losses. 
 Streamlined compliance: Simplified KYC and AML processes reduce administrative burdens. 
 Efficiency gains: Accelerated verification boosts operational efficiency and customer experiences. 
 Market expansion: Trust ecosystems create opportunities in sectors previously hindered by security concerns. 
 Innovation stimulation: Open standards encourage the development of interoperable solutions. 
 
<p>By linking trust-building efforts to tangible economic outcomes, DICE 2024 shifted the conversation from abstract concepts to measurable benefits.</p>
 The DICE unConference Experience 
<p></p>
<p>The open and collaborative format allowed attendees to co-create the agenda, ensuring discussions addressed real-world challenges. Key topics included</p>
 
 Interoperability: Cross-border and cross-platform systems to streamline international transactions. 
 Zero-knowledge proofs: Privacy-preserving verification methods. 
 Authentic data sharing: Applications in industries like healthcare and finance. 
 User-centric solutions: Accessibility for all users, including those with older technology. 
 Governance frameworks: Clear standards for public-private collaboration. 
 
<p>These discussions highlighted the importance of aligning technological innovation with user needs and industry-specific applications.</p>
 Looking Ahead: DICE 2025 
<p></p>
<p>To build on the momentum of 2024, DICE has announced two major events for 2025:</p>
 
 DICE Ecosystems | March 4-5, 2025<br>
Focus: Deploying verifiable credentials and authentic data across business ecosystems.<p></p>
 
 Collaborate with sector leaders. 
 Build partnerships for adoption strategies. 
 Develop cross-sector production use cases. 
 
 
 
<p>2. DICE 2025 | September 2-4, 2025<br>
Focus: Advancing technologies and frameworks for digital identity and trust.</p>
 
 
 
 Deep dives into core technologies and governance. 
 Open Space format for agenda co-creation. 
 Exploration of privacy-preserving solutions and global standards. 
 
 
 
 Aligning Digital Trust with Economic Benefits 
<p></p>
<p>DICE 2024 clarified that digital identity and trust are not standalone constructs—they drive real economic advantages. By linking trust ecosystems to fraud reduction, compliance efficiency, and market expansion, the conference demonstrated how secure systems empower businesses and consumers alike.</p>
 The Path Forward 
<p></p>
<p>While the digital trust landscape evolves, collaboration and innovation remain vital. As DICE continues to shape the agenda, the focus will be on actionable strategies that enhance security, scalability, and inclusivity.</p>
