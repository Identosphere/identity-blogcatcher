             <p>It is estimated that anaesthetic gases account for around 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year across NHS and private hospitals across the UK (covering England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). These highly volatile gases make up 2% of the National Health Service’s (NHS) total carbon footprint and 15-20% of a theatre’s carbon footprint for each operation in England alone.</p>

 Using a design workshop to jump start your&nbsp;CoP <p>At the end of the month, we’ll be gathering a number of community-based organisations, interns and faculty in an online design workshop to jump start a Community of Practice together with Cal State University and <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>. This community, supported through the <a href="https://www.internetforall.gov/funding-recipients/california-state-university-dominguez-hills">Internet for All</a> programme, will provide an online space for those promoting access and training in digital technologies in the CSUDH community.</p><p>We know that building a thriving and supportive online community requires some deliberate efforts. In this blog post, we explore the idea of a “minimum viable community of practice” (MVCoP). Once again, we dive into our Architecture of Participation (AoP) framework, and discuss running design workshops to empower individuals to co-design their community.</p>header in the budding CoP on <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a> What is a&nbsp;MVCoP? cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Let’s start with the value of a Community of Practice. Communities of Practice (CoPs) are important for people to network, share knowledge, and learn from each other. They play a vital role in supporting lifelong learning and helping people level up throughout their careers. By connecting with like-minded peers who share similar interests and expertise, people can tap into a vast pool of collective wisdom and experience. Through active participation in discussions, collaborative projects, and sharing of best practices, community members continuously learn from each other, gaining new insights, perspectives, and opportunities.</p><p>Communities of practice not only foster professional growth but also create opportunities for personal development, encouraging individuals to stay curious, adapt to change, and embrace a lifelong learning mindset. We develop real relationships in these communities, and we learn about belonging and acceptance.</p><p>But before all of that, we have to design spaces that are supportive, interesting, engaging and inclusive. This takes intention. A MVCoP is a community set up to encourage organic and collaborative growth and belonging.</p> The Bare Minimum&nbsp;AoP AoP from&nbsp;WAO<p>We’ve written extensively about one of the tools, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop">the Architecture of Participation (AoP)</a>, that we use to help us build thoughtful, inclusive and empowering communities. Briefly, because we really have written about this all over the internet, the AoP is 8 steps to help people cover all their bases when thinking about volunteering, contributing and facilitating communities.</p><p>But what are the key steps for building a Minimum Viable Community of Practice? Well, we think that the most important to start with&nbsp;are:</p>  Ways of working openly — Even at the very beginning, people need to see what’s happening within the community and how they can get involved. The open principles of transparency, inclusivity, collaboration and adaptability underpin community. Does the project have secret areas, or is everything out in the&nbsp;open?  Backchannels and watercoolers — We need places to share memes, make jokes and chat about the weather. These evolve organically, but including them in your MVCoP design suggests understanding of the social dynamics within groups of people. Are there ‘social’ spaces for members of the project to interact over and above those focused on project&nbsp;aims?  Celebration of milestones — Building a space where people belong means thinking of them as, you know, people. We need motivation and recognition. Does the MVCoP recognise the efforts and input of the community members?   Empowering Co-Design cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Running a design workshop is a great way to empower co-design within a community. By bringing together individuals with diverse perspectives, skills, and experiences, a design workshop creates a collaborative space where participants can actively contribute to shaping the emerging community.</p><p>We facilitate such workshops to encourage open dialogue, brainstorming, and hands-on activities. We aim to help people feel a sense of ownership and engagement because, after all, this is a community. This inclusive approach means that we can work together on the community’s mission, invitations and onboarding. Our intentions and goals are co-created and reflect the collective aspirations and needs of the&nbsp;group.</p><p>By actively involving community members in the design process, a design workshop not only strengthens the sense of belonging but also ensures that the resulting community is truly representative of its members’ interests, resulting in a more vibrant and sustainable community of practice.</p> Conclusion <p>Building a minimum viable community of practice (MVCoP) is a dynamic and iterative process that requires active involvement from community members. Empowering people to co-design their community will help that community evolve. The journey to a thriving community starts with small steps, but with dedication and collective effort, it can lead to a flourishing network of professionals supporting each other’s growth and&nbsp;success.</p><p>Need some community help?

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">Trust Registry Task Force</a> (TRTF) at the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation has released a new version of its ToIP <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-trust-registry-protocol/">Trust Registry Protocol Specification</a> as an Implementers Draft. This draft aims to elicit open public feedback from implementers of any type of online registry service or client software. Instructions for providing feedback are at the end of this post.</p>



 Background 



<p>The TRTF was established in the summer of 2021 in response to the sudden demand for cross-jurisdiction verification of digital health credentials during the COVID crisis. In the fall of 2021, the TRTF produced a preliminary version of the ToIP Trust Registry Protocol Specification to begin public experimentation with the protocol.</p>



<p>As the adoption of digital wallets and verifiable digital credentials has grown, so has the challenge for relying parties to verify the authorized issuers of those credentials. The same applies to credential holders, who need to judge which relying parties they can safely trust with their credential data.</p>



<p>These digital trust decisions are complicated—in both directions. To make them more accessible, participants need trusted sources of information. That’s the job of trust registries. A trust registry is a system of record that contains answers to questions that help drive trust decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of these systems of record already exist. For example, almost any legal jurisdiction has a method of registering and licensing all types of businesses and professionals (CPAs, lawyers, doctors, professional engineers, etc.) And there are hundreds of registries of accredited institutions—universities, hospitals, insurance companies, nursing homes, etc.</p>



<p>New trust registries are also emerging for new online communities, including social networks, blockchains, and peer-to-peer networks. The challenge is that the methods of accessing the information across all these different registries are wildly inconsistent—if such information is available online.</p>



 The Trust Registry Protocol V2.0 



<p>The ToIP Trust Registry Protocol (TRP) V2.0 aims to solve this problem by providing a simple and consistent way to discover who is authorized to do what within a specific digital trust ecosystem. In short, it enables parties to ask programmatically:</p>



<p>Does entity X hold authorization Y under ecosystem governance framework Z?</p>



<p>In addition to that core query type, the TRP V2 also supports queries to:</p>



 
 Assist integrators in retrieving information critical to interacting with the trust registry (e.g. get a list of supported authorizations, namespaces, or resources). 



 Assert the relationships of the queried trust registry with other trust registries, allowing the development of a registry-of-registries capability. 
 



<p>Currently, in this Implementers Draft stage, this question can be asked via a RESTful (OpenAPI Specification 3.1.0) protocol query. Future versions of the TRP may support other underlying protocol specifications (e.g. DIDComm co-protocols, ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is important to note that in V2, the TRP does not manage information inside the trust registry (i.e., the system-of-record). It is a read-only query protocol. Create, update, or delete operations may be specified in future protocol versions if demand exists.</p>



<p>To be clear, a trust registry does not create trust in itself. Your decision to trust the outputs from a trust registry is entirely yours. However, the information provided by trust registries is often required to build trust—especially between parties with no previous relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A trust registry does not create authority. The authority of a trust registry is an outcome of governance.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;– <a href="mailto:Jacques.Latour@cira.ca">Jacques Latour</a>, CTO, CIRA.ca (.ca top-level domain registry)</p>



 How to Provide Feedback 



<p>We invite feedback from implementers: systems integrators, developers, and product leaders who either need to share or access the information necessary to facilitate digital trust decisions within their ecosystem.</p>

<p>Public review ends May 26th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Universal Business Language TC [1] are pleased to announce that Universal Business Language Version 2.4 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>UBL is the leading interchange format for business documents. It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes. The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:<br>– A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.<br>– A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.<br>– A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.</p>



<p>UBL v2.4 is a minor revision to v2.3 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 93.</p>



<p>The TC received three Statements of Use from Efact, Google, and Semantic [3].</p>



<p>The candidate specification and related files are available here:</p>

<p>ToIP invites the public to comment on their newly released document, Issuers Requirements Guide for Governance Framework of Verifiable Credentials.</p>



<p>The mission of the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation is to define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that combines cryptographic assurance at the machine layer with human accountability at the business, legal, and social layers.&nbsp; Part of that mission is to define generally accepted requirements for standard roles that play a critical part in accountability for digital trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Governance Stack Working Group has completed a new deliverable, the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Issuer-Requirements-Guide-V0.01-2024-01-30.pdf">Issuer Requirements Guide for Governance Frameworks of Verifiable Credentials (PDF)</a> and is soliciting public comment using our <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/public-review-process/">public review process</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/PDF-Deliverable-Review/issues/new/choose">this GitHub link</a>. While many schemes in the US, UK and Canada have focused on elements of identity credential issuance and verification, this is the first effort to define standard requirements for issuers of verifiable credential to ensure that their processes are transparent and consistent and meet the needs of relying parties and ecosystem governing bodies.</p>



<p>Verifiable credential ecosystems require both technical trust and human trust where the core requirements for the corresponding issuance processes are captured in this newly released document being circulated for public review and comment. Verifiable credentials are a type of digital representation of claims or attributes about a subject, which can be an individual, organization, or thing. These credentials are tamper-evident, cryptographically secure, and can be verified by relying parties without the need for a central authority.</p>



<p>The Governance requirements of an issuer in a verifiable credential ecosystem can be summarized as follows:</p>



 
 Issuance of Credentials: The issuer is responsible for creating and issuing verifiable credentials to subjects based on certain claims or attributes. These credentials are digitally signed by the issuer using their private key, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the information. 



 Trust and Reputation: The issuer’s reputation and trustworthiness are crucial in the verifiable credential ecosystem. Relying parties (such as service providers or verifiers) rely on the credentials being issued by reputable and trusted issuers. The credibility of the issuer is established through various mechanisms, such as being a well-known organization, being part of a recognized authority, or holding themselves accountable to the requirements of a governing authority. 



 Validation of Claims: Before issuing credentials, the issuer does its due diligence to validate the claims made in the credential. This validation process ensures that the information presented in the credential is accurate and can be trusted by relying parties. 



 Verification of Issuer and Holder: Issued credentials that contain links to the issuer and/or holder should be engineered so they can be cryptographically verified. 



 Privacy Considerations: Issuers need to handle personal data responsibly and in compliance with privacy regulations. They should only collect and use the minimum necessary data required to issue the credentials and should obtain explicit consent from the subjects. 



 Revocation and Expiry: For credentials that require expiration or revocation, issuers must have mechanisms in place to revoke or expire credentials if the claims become invalid or if the credentials are compromised. This is essential to maintain the trustworthiness of the digital trust ecosystem. 



 Interoperability: Issuers need to follow standardized formats and protocols to ensure that the issued credentials are interoperable and can be easily understood and verified by different relying parties. 



 Auditability and Accountability: Issuers should keep records of issued credentials for audit purposes, &nbsp;lifecycle maintenance, including updates to claims, or re-issuance for any reason and revocation. This enables traceability and accountability in case of disputes or issues with the credentials. 



 Transparency: The issuer should publicly disclose all the policies it follows in the process of claim and credential issuance and revocation. This disclosure should be included in a publicly available governance framework.

<p>Elastos ($ELA) presents a compelling narrative in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, paralleling Bitcoin’s disinflationary ethos while charting a unique path through its technological integration and economic modelling. Let’s explore some of the key highlights of ELA and its economic model:</p>
 
 Merge Mining with Bitcoin: ELA’s <a href="https://ela.elastos.io/">merge mining with Bitcoin</a> allows it to benefit from Bitcoin’s substantial hashing power (580.74 EH/s), with ELA itself achieving an impressive 293.69 EH/s, roughly 50%. This synergy <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/ela-queen-of-bitcoin/">enhances security</a> while maintaining energy efficiency. 
 BPoS Validator System: The Elastos BPoS Supernodes add a secondary layer of security by verifying and signing each ELA mainchain block provided by Bitcoin miners. BPoS engages two participant groups: stakers and validators, with staking ELA to vote for validators and APR for both. 
 Fixed Maximum Supply: ELA caps at 28.22 million coins, with the final coins expected to be minted by December 2105. This fixed supply mirrors Bitcoin’s scarcity principle, foundational to its value. 
 Disinflationary Nature: ELA follows a 4-year halving cycle similar to Bitcoin, effectively cutting its annual inflation rate in half. This model ensures a gradual decrease in new ELA supply, enhancing scarcity and potential value over time. Like Bitcoin, ELA’s halving reduces the reward for block production, transitioning incentives towards transaction fees over time, and ensuring long-term network sustainability. The next halving is in December 2015. 
 Current Mining Dynamics: With a block generation time of every two minutes, ELA rewards are distributed among Bitcoin PoW miners (35%), BPoS validators (35%), and the CRC DAO treasury (30%). This distribution model incentivizes diverse participation in the network’s security and governance. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Significance of Merge-Mining with Bitcoin 
<p>Merge mining enables Bitcoin miners to mine both Bitcoin and Elastos by running Elastos code alongside, without additional costs or energy. This leverages Bitcoin’s vast hashing power (580.74 EH/s, with ELA at 293.69 EH/s) to secure both networks efficiently. By integrating Elastos’s mining process with Bitcoin’s infrastructure, miners can earn extra rewards in ELA, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship that enhances ELA’s security and economic incentives. This dual mining opportunity not only augments revenue for Bitcoin miners but also promotes a cooperative ecosystem, highlighting merge mining with Bitcoin as a strategically valuable feature for bolstering network security while being environmentally considerate. ELA today has roughly 50% of Bitcoins security protecting the network’s value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Earning APR with ELA. 
<p>What’s more, you can earn ELA as a community member with Bitcoins security provided. Here are three of the core ways:</p>
 1. Participate in Staking: 
 
 APR: Up to 2-3%. 
 Lockup Duration: 10 to 1000 days. 
 Equity Tokens: 1 staked ELA = 1 voting token. 
 Rewards: Based on amount and duration. 
 Profit Sharing: 25% to node owners, 75% to stakers. 
 Special Nodes: 12 CR Council nodes excluded from voting. 
 
<p>Re-Voting: Necessary at pledge end to continue earning. Here is a detailed guide on <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/bpos-staking-and-voting-guide/">how to stake.</a></p>
 2. Becoming a BPOS Validator: 
 
 APR: Up to 22%. 
 Entry Requirements: 2,000 ELA pledge, $6/month maintenance. 
 Rewards: 25% of block rewards. 
 Yield Factors: Staking amount and time. 
 Selection: Randomly chosen 36 nodes every 36 blocks. 
 Rewards Distribution: Automated by Elastos mainchain. 
 
<p>Here is a detailed guide on <a href="https://elastos.info/tutorial/bpos-node-registration-guide/">how to become a BPOS Validator.</a>&nbsp; Here is additional support on <a href="https://elastos.dev/nodes/requirements/">validator requirements.</a></p>
 3. Cyber Republic Council (CRC) DAO Member: 
 
 APR: Up to 35% (rewards and sidechain transactions). 
 Cyber Republic Consensus: Governance mechanism for community decisions, Elastos sidechain blockchain validation (EVM and Identity), and ecosystem development, utilizing a delegate model for decision-making and proposal voting. 
 CR Council Member Nodes: 12 community-elected delegates using ELA to vote become responsible for decision-making on community affairs, proposal recommendation, and voting. 
 Community Members: Rights include voting in elections, submitting proposals, and monitoring and impeaching council members. 
 Election and Term:
 
 Participants need Elastos DIDs and a 5,000 ELA deposit. 
 Election via ELA voting, top 12 candidates become council members. The election process starts one month (about 21,900 main chain blocks) before the current members’ term ends for seamless transitions. The next election term begins in April 2024. 
 One-year term, with provisions for impeachment and automatic removal under specific conditions. 
 
 
 Rewards and Responsibilities: Council members receive mainchain ELA rewards and Sidechain (EVM and DID) transaction revenue.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elastos and ELA combines Bitcoin’s disinflationary approach with its own technological advancements and economic strategies, enhancing its network security through merge mining with Bitcoin and offering a BPoS Validator System for additional security and APR. With a disinflationary model and a fixed supply limit of 28.22 million ELA, the ecosystem incentivizes participation through mining rewards distribution and provides APR earning opportunities via staking, BPoS validation, and the Cyber Republic Council (CRC) DAO governance. These features, alongside its economic policies, position Elastos as a distinctive and engaging platform in the cryptocurrency realm, aligning with Bitcoin’s ethos and security.

  On a scale of one to ten, how do you rate the&nbsp; Customer Experience Management (CEM) business? I give it a zero.

<p>On a scale of one to ten, how do you rate the&nbsp; <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=customer+experience+management">Customer Experience Management</a> (CEM) business?</p>
<p>I give it a zero.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that every service comes with a bonus survey—one you answer on a phone or fill out on a Web page? And that every one of those surveys is about rating the poor soul you spoke to or chatted with, rather than the company’s own crappy CEM system?</p>
<p>I always say yes to the question “Was your problem resolved?” because I know the human I spoke to will be punished if I say no.&nbsp; Saying yes to that question complies with <a href="https://twitter.com/dmarti/status/1702719520790479099">Don Marti</a>‘s tweeted advice: “5 stars for everyone always—never betray a human to the machines.”</p>
<p>The main problem with CEM is that it’s all about getting service to scale across populations by faking interest in human contact. You can see it all through McKinsey’s <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/the-ceo-guide-to-customer-experience">The CEO Guide to Customer Experience</a>. The customer is always on a “journey” through which a company has “touchpoints.”</p>
<p>Oh please.</p>
<p><a href="https://iuhealth.org/">IU Health</a>, my primary provider of health services, does a good job on the whole, but one downside is the phone survey that follows up seemingly every interaction I have with a doctor or an assistant of some kind. The survey is always from a robot that says it “will only take a few minutes.” I haven’t counted, but I am sure some of those surveys last longer than the interaction I had with the human who provided the service: an annoyingly looooong touchpoint.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2007/06/13/why-surveys-suck/">Why Surveys Suck</a> here, way back in 2007. In it, I wrote,&nbsp; “One way we can gauge the success of VRM is by watching the number of surveys decline.”</p>
<p>Makes me cringe a bit, but I think it’s still true.</p>
 
<p>The <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/create/a-hellscape-of-unhappy-people2c-some-on-phones-and-/6539279055434e699382ea55556b92ee?id=Eyv8KcRtGIyZKnlf8%2b0IIA%3d%3d&amp;view=detailv2&amp;idpp=genimg&amp;FORM=GCRIDP&amp;ajaxhist=0&amp;ajaxserp=0">image above</a> was created by Bing Creator and depicts “A hellscape of unhappy people, some on phones and others filling out surveys.”</p>

  <p>by Hany Farid, UC Berkeley Professor, CAI Advisor</p><p>News and trends shaping our understanding of generative AI technology and its applications.</p><p>Generative AI embodies a class of techniques for creating audio, image, or video content that mimics the human content creation process. Starting in 2018 and continuing through today, techniques to generate highly realistic content have continued their impressive trajectory. In this post, I will discuss some recent breakthroughs in a category of techniques that generate images, audio, and video from a simple text prompt.</p><p>Faces</p><p>A common computational technique for synthesizing images involves the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN). <a href="https://nvlabs.github.io/stylegan3/">StyleGAN</a> is, for example, one of the earliest successful systems for generating realistic human faces. When tasked with generating a face, the generator starts by laying down a random array of pixels and feeding this first guess to the discriminator. If the discriminator, equipped with a large database of real faces, can distinguish the generated image from the real faces, the discriminator provides this feedback to the generator. The generator then updates its initial guess and feeds this update to the discriminator in a second round. This process continues with the generator and discriminator competing in an adversarial game until an equilibrium is reached when the generator produces an image that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real faces.</p><p>Below are representative examples of GAN-generated faces. In two earlier posts, I discussed <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">how photorealistic these faces are</a> and some techniques for <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">distinguishing real from GAN-generated faces</a>.</p>

  <p>Text-to-image</p><p>Although they produce highly realistic results, GANs do not afford much control over the appearance or surroundings of the synthesized face. By comparison, text-to-image (or diffusion-based) synthesis affords more rendering control. Models are trained on billions of images that are&nbsp; accompanied by descriptive captions, and each training image is progressively corrupted until only visual noise remains. The model then learns to denoise each image by reversing this corruption. This model can then be conditioned to generate an image that is semantically consistent with a text prompt like “Pope Francis in a white Balenciaga coat.”&nbsp;</p><p>From Adobe Firefly to OpenAI's DALL-E, Midjourney to Stable Diffusion, text-to-image generation is capable of generating highly photorealistic images with increasingly fewer obvious visual artifacts (like hands with too many or too few fingers).</p>





















  
  



<blockquote><p>You probably saw on the news A.I. generations of Pope Francis wearing a white cozy jacket. I’d love to see your generations inspired by it. <br><br>Here’s a prompt by the original creator Guerrero Art (Pablo Xavier): <br><br>Catholic Pope Francis wearing Balenciaga puffy jacket in drill rap… <a href="https://t.co/5WA2UTYG7b">pic.twitter.com/5WA2UTYG7b</a></p>— Kris Kashtanova (@icreatelife) <a href="https://twitter.com/icreatelife/status/1640583106255003650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2023</a></blockquote>



  <p>Text-to-audio</p><p>In 2019, researchers were able to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/the-weekly/deepfake-joe-rogan.html">clone the voice of Joe Rogan</a> from eight hours of voice recordings. Today, from only one minute of audio, anyone can clone any voice. What is most striking about this advance is that unlike the Rogan example, in which a model was trained to generate only Rogan's voice, today's zero-shot, multi-speaker text-to-speech can clone a voice not seen during training. Also striking is the easy access to these voice-cloning technologies through low-cost commercial or free open-source services. Once a voice is cloned, text-to-audio systems can convert any text input into a highly compelling audio clip that is difficult to distinguish from an authentic audio clip. Such fake clips are being used for everything from <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/january-2024-this-month-in-generative-ai-frauds-and-scams">scams and fraud</a> to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/fake-joe-biden-robocall-tells-new-hampshire-democrats-not-vote-tuesday-rcna134984">election interference</a>.</p><p>Text-to-video</p><p>A year ago, text-to-video systems tasked with creating short video clips from a text prompt like "Pope Francis walking in Times Square wearing a white Balanciaga coat" or "Will Smith eating spaghetti'' yielded <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/will-smith-parodies-viral-ai-generated-video-by-actually-eating-spaghetti/">videos of which nightmares are made</a>. A typical video consists of 24 to 30 still images per second. Generating many realistic still images, however, is not enough to create a coherent video. These earlier systems struggled to create temporally coherent and physically plausible videos in which the inter-frame motion was convincing.&nbsp;</p><p>However, just this month researchers from <a href="https://imagen.research.google/video/">Google</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/sora">OpenAI</a> released a sneak peek into their latest efforts. While not perfect, the resulting videos are stunning in their realism and temporal consistency. One of the major breakthroughs in this work is the ability to generalize existing text-conditional image models to train on entire video sequences in which the characteristics of a full space-time video sequence can be learned.</p><p>In the same way that text-to-image models extend the range of what is possible as compared to GANs, these text-to-video models extend the ability to create realistic videos beyond existing <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2315678121">lip-sync and face-swap</a> models that are designed specifically to manipulate a video of a person talking.</p><p>Text-to-audio-to-video</p><p>Researchers from the Alibaba Group released an impressive new tool for generating a video of a person talking or singing. Unlike earlier lip-sync models, this technique requires only a single image as input, and the image is then fully animated to be consistent with any audio track. The results are remarkable, including a video of <a href="https://humanaigc.github.io/emote-portrait-alive/">Mona Lisa reading a Shakespearean sonnet</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>When paired with text-to-audio, this technology can generate, from a single image, a video of a person saying (or singing) anything the creator wishes.</p><p>Looking ahead</p><p>I've come to learn not to make bold predictions about when and what will come next in the space of generative AI. I am, however, comfortable predicting that full-blown text-to-movie (combined audio and video) will soon be here, allowing for the generation of video clips from text such as: "A video of a couple walking down a busy New York City street with background traffic sounds as they sing Frank Sinatra's New York, New York." While there is much to be excited about on the content creation and creativity side, legitimate concerns persist and need to be addressed.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are clear and compelling positive use cases of generative AI, we are already seeing troubling examples in the form of people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/01/tech-bros-nonconsensual-sexual-deepfakes-videos-porn-law-taylor-swift">creating non-consensual sexual imagery</a>, <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/january-2024-this-month-in-generative-ai-frauds-and-scams">scams and frauds</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/fake-joe-biden-robocall-tells-new-hampshire-democrats-not-vote-tuesday-rcna134984">disinformation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Some generative AI systems have been accused of infringing on the rights of creators whose content has been ingested into large training data sets. As we move forward, we need to find an equitable way to compensate creators and to give them the ability to opt in to or out of being part of training future generative AI models.</p><p>Relatedly, last summer saw a historic strike in Hollywood by writers and performers. A particularly contentious issue centered around <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2315678121">the use (or not) of AI</a> and how workers would be protected. The writers’ settlement requires that AI-generated material cannot be used to undermine a writer’s credit, and its use must be disclosed to writers. Protections for performers include that studios give fair compensation to performers for the use of digital replicas, and for the labor unions and studios to meet twice a year to assess developments and implications of generative AI. This latter agreement is particularly important given the pace of progress in this space.</p>

<p>We are witnessing an important convergence of technologies of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet, and Crypto promising to reshape our digital landscape. This convergence enables a Verifiable Internet for AI, unlocking AI solutions without hallucinations and ensuring full respect for data ownership and Intellectual Property&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Trillion-dollar industries spanning from tokenization of real world assets (RWAs), supply chains, metaverse, construction, life sciences and healthcare, among others, require AI systems to use verifiable information to deliver the multiplication effect to the benefit of users in a safe&nbsp;manner.</p><p>A modular and collaborative approach is necessary to achieve that. OriginTrail and Chainlink are working together to bring the vision of the Verifiable Internet for AI to reality, allowing the transformation of real world asset (RWA) tokenization.</p><p>OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) is already powering trusted AI solutions across multiple RWA industries, such as protecting whisky authenticity with trusted AI and DNA tagging techniques, helping Swiss Federal Railways increase rail travel safety with cross-border rail operator connectivity, increasing EU build environment sustainability with trusted AI, supporting representatives of over 40% of US imports to safeguard data on security audits for overseas factories, etc.</p><p>Expanding the OriginTrail decentralized AI framework with Chainlink oracle capability further extends the strength of RWA solutions by giving them access to real-time real world data. By synergizing the power of the Decentralized Knowledge Graph and Chainlink Data feeds, the capabilities of AI to retrieve verifiable information on RWAs can be applied across any&nbsp;domain.</p> Integrating Chainlink Data Feeds with OriginTrail DKG to create a Trusted AI&nbsp;solution <p>Each knowledge resource on the OriginTrail DKG is created as a Knowledge Asset consisting of knowledge content, cryptographic proofs for immutability, and NFT for ownership. For our example, we will create a Knowledge Asset for Chainlink Data Feed. Once created, Knowledge Assets can be used in <a href="https://x.com/DrevZiga/status/1755625036486988174?s=20">decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG) AI applications</a>. For our showcase, we will use an existing DOT/USD data feed in an AI application using the DKG and dRAG in 3 simple&nbsp;steps.</p> Step 1: Create a Knowledge Asset on the&nbsp;DKG <p>Since we wish to retrieve DOT/USD data feed in our AI application, we need to start by creating a Knowledge Asset linking to the data feed which we will use to retrieve the live&nbsp;price:</p> {<br>  "@context": "http://schema.org/",<br>  "@type": "ChainlinkDataFeed",<br>  "@id": "https://data.chain.link/feeds/moonbeam/mainnet/dot-usd",<br>  "description": "Chainlink DataFeed providing real-time DOT/USD price information on the Moonbeam network.",<br>  "baseAsset": {<br>    "@id": "urn:chainlink:base-asset:dot",<br>    "@type": "ChainlinkBaseAsset",<br>    "name": "DOT_CR",<br>    "description": "Polkadot cryptocurrency (DOT)"<br>  },<br>  "quoteAsset": {<br>    "@id": "urn:chainlink:quote-asset:usd",<br>    "@type": "ChainlinkQuoteAsset",<br>    "name": "USD_FX",<br>    "description": "United States Dollar (USD)"<br>  },<br>  "productType": "price",<br>  "productSubType": "reference",<br>  "productName": "DOT/USD-RefPrice-DF-Moonbeam-001",<br>  "contractAddress": "0x1466b4bD0C4B6B8e1164991909961e0EE6a66d8c",<br>  "network": "moonbeam",<br>  "rpcProvider": "https://rpc.api.moonbeam.network"<br>} <p>The main entities represented in the Knowledge Asset&nbsp;are:</p>  Base asset (DOT_CR) — the first asset listed in a trading pair, this is the asset that is being&nbsp;priced  Quote asset (USD_FX) — the second asset listed in a trading pair, this is the currency the base asset is priced&nbsp;in  <p>Necessary fields for DOT/USD value retrieval:</p>  Contract address (contractAddress)  RPC Provider (rpcProvider)  <p>This Knowledge Asset content can also be visualized in the DKG Explorer:</p> Step 2: Use AI to query the&nbsp;DKG <p>From your application, you can use an LLM to generate DKG queries based on the user prompts. This step can have different degrees of complexity, so for this showcase, we will use the selected LLM&nbsp;to:</p>  Determine if the prompt is relevant for the data feed (in our case, is the user’s question mentioning DOT&nbsp;token)  Use the LLM to structure a SPARQL query for the OriginTrail DKG to retrieve the Data Feed&nbsp;URL  <p>An example of an engineered prompt to determine the relevance of the question for DOT&nbsp;token:</p> Given that the chatbot primarily responds to inquiries about the Polkadot ecosystem, including its native token, DOT, analyze the provided question to determine if there's a direct or indirect reference to DOT. Provide a response indicating 'true' if the question pertains to the value, function, or any aspect of DOT, within the context of discussions related to Polkadot ecosystem, either explicitly or implicitly, and 'false' if it does not. Question: {question} <p>If the above prompt determines the question as relevant (returns true), we proceed with a SPARQL query for the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph. There are various techniques to obtain a SPARQL query with the LLM you’re using. In our case, we seek ChainlinkDataFeed type entities (Knowledge Assets) with DOT as the BaseAsset. The query result in our case will be a single Knowledge Asset containing information about the DOT/USD value. The SPARQL query should look like&nbsp;this:</p> PREFIX schema: &lt;http://schema.org/&gt;<br>SELECT ?dataFeed ?contractAddress ?rpcProvider<br>WHERE {<br>  ?dataFeed a schema:ChainlinkDataFeed ;<br>            schema:baseAsset ?baseAsset ;<br>            schema:contractAddress ?contractAddress ;<br>            schema:rpcProvider ?rpcProvider .<br>  ?baseAsset a schema:ChainlinkBaseAsset ;<br>             schema:name "DOT_CR" .<br>}  Step 3: Retrieve the data and display it in your application <p>Retrieve all the necessary information from the Knowledge Assets obtained through the SPARQL query. Essential information includes the contract address and RPC endpoint, as they are required to execute the code fetching price information from Chainlink. In our case, we are fetching the DOT/USD&nbsp;price.</p> Code execution <p>The following code uses ethers.js to fetch the requested value from the retrieved Data Feed. Here’s a simple&nbsp;example:</p> const { ethers } = require('ethers');<br><br>//Your code that executes SPARQL queries.<br><br>const rpcProvider = sparqlResult.data[0].rpcProvider;<br>const contractAddress = sparqlResult.data[0].contractAddress;<br><br>const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcProvider);<br>const abi = [{<br>    inputs: [],<br>    name: "latestRoundData",<br>    outputs: [<br>      { internalType: "uint80", name: "roundId", type: "uint80" },<br>      { internalType: "int256", name: "answer", type: "int256" },<br>      { internalType: "uint256", name: "startedAt", type: "uint256" },<br>      { internalType: "uint256", name: "updatedAt", type: "uint256" },<br>      { internalType: "uint80", name: "answeredInRound", type: "uint80" },<br>    ],<br>    stateMutability: "view",<br>    type: "function",<br>  }<br>];<br>async function getDOTUSDPrice() {<br>  const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, provider);<br>  const [ , price] = await contract.latestRoundData();<br>  <br>  console.log(`DOT/USD Price: ${ethers.utils.formatUnits(price, 8)}`);<br>}<br>getDOTUSDPrice();  Include Chainlink Data feed into the final&nbsp;response <p>You can modify how the LLM will perform the decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation and include the data feed as a part of the response by engineering the prompt based on your requirements. Here’s one example that appends it at the end of the generated response.</p><p>The next generation RWA solutions will be using the best of what the Internet, Crypto and AI have to offer.

<p>Access to shared open knowledge constructed in a collaborative way is mission-critical for the future of AI, especially since non-AI-generated content is expected to be surpassed in size by synthetic, AI-generated content in the coming period. The importance of it has also been highlighted by the Turing Award winner in the field of Deep Learning, Yann&nbsp;LeCun:</p><p>“The way you train that (AI) system will have to be crowdsourced&nbsp;… if you want it to be a repository of all human knowledge, all humans need to contribute to it.” Yann&nbsp;LeCun</p><p>To achieve that, AI para — networks or paranets, the autonomously operated collections of Knowledge Assets owned by its communities and residing on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), were introduced in the <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf">Whitepaper 3.0</a>.</p><p>Initial Paranet Offerings (IPO) are now introduced as a means of a public launch of a paranet, with a collection of Knowledge Assets and accompanying incentivization structure proposed and voted upon via the NeuroWeb governance mechanism. Each IPO is structured as an initial proposal and an initial set of Knowledge Assets published, along with an incentivization structure set forth by an IPO operator that proposes how the incentives will be split across three&nbsp;groups:</p>  IPO operator  Knowledge miners  Neuro holders that participated in supporting the creation of an IPO and approved the requested allocation of Neuro utility tokens for an IPO’s knowledge mining.  <p>The success of an IPO largely depends on the IPO’s operator ability to wisely propose the incentive structure, taking into consideration the following factors among&nbsp;others:</p>  IPO operator autonomously selects AI services to be used to drive value of a knowledge base, and must undertake an economically and commercially viable approach for both creation and maintenance of a paranet. It is expected that an IPO operator proposes an operator fee that renders the birth of a paranet economically viable (earning a share of allocated emissions), while also setting up a fee structure for both knowledge miners and NEURO holders that partake in&nbsp;voting.  Assuming the cost of mining Knowledge Assets on the DKG in TRAC utility tokens, knowledge miners are to be considered as central to the success of not only an IPO proposal, but even more so as entities that drive incentives in NEURO tokens only as each new knowledge asset is mined. Only when new Knowledge Assets are mined, the allocated emissions of NEURO are executed across the three groups as incentives. When launching an IPO, the paranet operator will define the ratio of NEURO to be earned per TRAC spent to mine each Knowledge Asset. An IPO operator may set the ratio autonomously to target a desired profitability before the proposal is submitted to voting, yet attempts of price gouging might not receive support from NEURO&nbsp;holders.  NEURO holders that support an IPO via governance voting are to lock up tokens for the duration of NEURO emission allocated for the IPO. Though the share of emissions allocated for an IPO is an important factor for NEURO holders’ decision, the duration of the “lock period” can also play an important role. The paranet operator also defines what portion of paranet incentives will be shared with NEURO holders supporting the proposal.   The ecosystem incentivizing the Verifiable Internet for&nbsp;AI <p>The interest to launch the first IPOs has already been pre-registered by several institutional entities and builders, with the inaugural batch nearing the announcement stage.

<p>In the digital identity space, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/trust-establishment/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Trust Establishment</a> (TE) and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/credential-trust-establishment?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Credential Trust Establishment</a> (CTE) specifications play crucial roles in defining how trust is established and managed. CTE, in particular, is gaining traction as we approach the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW), with a plan to advance it to formal V1 status. This article focuses on the CTE, shedding light on its key features that make it a game-changer in building trust within digital credentials.</p><p>Core Aspects of CTE</p><p>CTE builds upon TE by enabling ecosystems to express their trust in the issuers of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and credentials. Credential validation steps of checking the integrity and revocation status are well known and understood, but there are not yet commonly-agreed-upon standards for evaluating the authority of a party to issue a credential’s claims.&nbsp;</p><p>Existing approaches have fallen short in one or more of the following areas:&nbsp;</p>  Ensuring the approach is sufficiently adaptable  Ability to express authorization for a specific role (not just general authorization)  Allows good performance and minimal resources, even eligible for offline use  Low-cost to implement, deploy, and use  <p>This is where CTE comes in: enabling ecosystems to express the credibility of participants, but in a way that meets the above needs. By doing so, it helps avoid “rent-seeking” behavior, in which an ecosystem participant tries to position themselves to collect transaction fees or similar.</p><p>Authority in the Ecosystem</p><p>CTE is non-prescriptive in its stance on defining who is an authority. It operates on the principle that authority is determined by an ecosystem’s existing trust structure, informing the acceptance and recognition of the credentials. This flexibility allows for wide adoption and adaptation, making it a practical solution for managing trust.</p><p>Governance and Flexibility</p><p>CTE introduces a practical governance model that is lightweight and adaptable. It serves ecosystems both large and small. It specifies roles such as credential issuance and verification, and allows grouping by schemas, or type of credential. This allows CTE to adapt well to a wide variety of use cases and simplifies the process of determining who is authorized to issue or verify credentials.</p><p>Trust on Demand</p><p>CTE includes flexible dials in cases where more fluidity is required. For example, instead of being statically included in the registry, an individual can hold credential(s) that assigns them a specific role, and the root authority of that credential corresponds to an entry/role in the registry. &nbsp; This method is not only efficient for offline use but also broadens the compatibility with different protocols, enhancing the flexibility and utility of the trust establishment process.</p><p>Impact</p><p>CTE is designed to counter rent-seeking behaviors and establish a solid trust foundation in digital credentials. It enables organizations and individuals to easily verify the legitimacy of credentials, providing a clear pathway for recognizing valuable credentials for professional development, for example. The specification’s governance model is straightforward and requires minimal technical investment, making it accessible and implementable across various industries.</p><p>How it can be used</p><p>In the wild, CTE files would be used by software representing companies and people. Companies and people will have a collection of governance files they use for different industries and purposes. In general, companies will be interested in software providing an immediate yes or no answer informing whether to accept or reject a credential. For individuals, however, software can use CTE files to advise on whether a credential is recognized by different parties. By indexing different CTE files, software can help individuals decide which ecosystems and credentials are most valuable for them.</p><p>Future Directions</p><p>As CTE heads towards v1, its potential to streamline the verification process and enhance the credibility of digital credentials is becoming increasingly apparent. DIF invites you to learn more about how CTE can revolutionize the digital identity field in providing a scalable, flexible, and trustworthy framework for managing digital credentials.</p><p>Learn more at:</p>  <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Internet Identity Workshop</a>  DIF virtual event (details coming soon)  <p>In summary, CTE is not just about establishing trust; it's about making the process more accessible, adaptable, and reliable for everyone involved in the digital identity ecosystem. Its forward-thinking approach to governance, authority, and risk mitigation positions it as a cornerstone specification in the evolving landscape of digital credentials.</p>

		<p>“FABRIC aims to be an infrastructure to explore impactful new ideas that are impossible or impractical with the current Internet. It provides an experimental sandbox that is connected to the globally distributed testbeds, scientific instruments, computing centers, data, and campuses that researchers rely on everyday,” said Paul Ruth, FABRIC Lead PI. “Edge enables us to support research across many facilities including the COSMOS wireless testbed, Princeton’s experimental P4 testbed, and remotely controlled instruments such as a CyroEM microscope at Rutgers.”</p>
<p>“The integration of FABRIC with COSMOS, both being pivotal national testbeds, opens unparalleled avenues for experimentation that blend wired and wireless networking with edge computing. Supported by Edge’s provision of connectivity between these pivotal national testbeds as well as to other national and international networks in NYC and Philadelphia carrier hotels, it opens unparalleled avenues for experimentation that blend wired and wireless networking with edge computing. This synergy not only enhances our research capabilities but also paves the way for groundbreaking advancements in network infrastructure and distributed systems,” notes Ivan Seskar, Chief Technologist at WINLAB, Rutgers, emphasizing the importance of collaborative efforts in pushing the boundaries of networking and computing research.</p>

 Advocating for a more diverse future for the recognition of talents, skills, and aspirations CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Back in 2016, the Open Recognition Alliance created the <a href="https://openrecognition.org/bord/">Bologna Open Recogition Declaration</a> (BORD). This has helped the community organise around principles relating to the concept of Open Recognition for all. It emphasises the importance of building out technologies and infrastructure to enable Open Recognition, as well as advocating for policies which foster its development.</p><p>Eight years later, the <a href="https://badges.community">Open Recognition is for Everybody</a> (ORE) community has started work on a manifesto for Open Recognition. This will be part of the <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/Open_Recognition_Toolkit">Open Recognition Toolkit</a> and extends the BORD to help people envision and advocate for a future where Open Recognition is commonplace.</p> Unpacking Open Recognition <p>Let’s begin with defining&nbsp;terms:</p><blockquote>Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.</blockquote><blockquote>(<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">What is Open Recognition, anyway?</a>)</blockquote><p>We want to help people understand that traditional approaches to credentialing, while important for unlocking opportunities, are just one part of a wider recognition landscape.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>For example, you could think of traditional credentialing — with courses, modules, and diplomas as like a greenhouse where growth conditions are carefully controlled. Only certain plants thrive in this environment, and they are pre-selected to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Open Recognition, on the other hand, is more like the garden that surrounds the greenhouse where a diverse array of plants grow naturally, adapt to their environment, and flourish in unique ways. Not only that, but there are many different gardens with different types of soil and varying atmospheric conditions.</p> Getting started with a manifesto <p>A manifesto is a call to action. It’s a way of allowing people to sign up to implement specific principles in order to work towards a better&nbsp;future.</p><p>To get started on that road, in a recent <a href="https://lu.ma/ore-community-calls">ORE community call</a> we asked two questions:</p>  What sucks that we want to do the opposite&nbsp;of?  What doesn’t exist that we want to bring into&nbsp;being?  <p>While these are only our first steps towards a manifesto with a subset of the community, we’re keen to share what we’ve discussed so&nbsp;far.</p> What sucks?   Simplifying complex systems — our digital landscape is cluttered with overly complex technologies and terminology. We aim to streamline these technologies, making open recognition accessible to everyone, not just the tech-savvy.  Clearing confusion and enhancing communication — there’s a tendency to overlook past contributions in the field, creating a cycle where new initiatives ignore the groundwork laid by predecessors. We want to provide clear, accurate information about Open Recognition to varied audiences.  Dismantling exclusivity — some forms of recognition and credentials are guarded as if they’re an exclusive membership available only to a select few. It’s important that we break down these barriers to create a more inclusive environment where everyone’s achievements are acknowledged.   What doesn’t&nbsp;exist?   Streamlined badge creation — we want to make creating badges for Open Recognition as easy as filling out a social media profile. This would encourage wider adoption and creativity in badge design/issuing.  Stories of success —examples and case studies help guide and inspire others. This could be part of the Open Recognition Toolkit, allowing stories to be shared and help provide practical and conceptual guidance to&nbsp;others.  Bridging spheres of learning — different forms of learning, for example formal and informal, tend to be siloed. As we know valuable skills can be acquired outside of traditional educational settings, we want to build a bridge to recognise the worth of both formal training and self-taught expertise.   Next steps <p>Creating a manifesto for Open Recognition involves creating something that resonates with a broad audience. It needs to be informative and upbeat, and have an ideological stance which advocates for a better future&nbsp;world.</p><p>Our next community call will continue the work we started this week, helping us work towards a plausible utopia for Open Recognition. If this is something which resonates with you, and you’d like to get involved, <a href="https://lu.ma/ore-community-calls">join&nbsp;us!</a></p> Related posts   <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">How badges can change the world — Part 1: The Two Loops Model for Open Recognition advocacy</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-65395581f90c">How badges can change the world — Part 2: Why we need to transition</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/advocating-for-learner-centric-badge-systems-21a65be4a725">Advocating for learner-centric badge systems: Some thoughts on campaigning for the right&nbsp;things</a>   <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/towards-a-manifesto-for-open-recognition-07b2606efd81">Towards a manifesto for Open Recognition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By: FIDO staff</p>



<p>Passkeys hold the promise of enabling simpler, strong authentication. But first organizations, governments and individuals will have to adopt the technology – and some of them have questions.</p>



<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Demystifying Passkey Implementation on March 13, speakers from the FIDO Alliance, Intercede, IDEMIA, Yubico, Dashlane and 1Password as well as implementers including Amazon and Target, presented on their experiences implementing and working with passkeys. The virtual summit covered the technical perspective on passkeys from the FIDO Alliance, as well as use cases for passkeys in the enterprise, consumer authentication, and the U.S. government. Along the way, attendees asked lots of questions and got lots of insightful answers.</p>







<p>Fundamentally a key theme that resonated throughout the virtual summit was that passkeys are a password replacement – and it’s a replacement that can’t come soon enough.</p>



<p>“Passwords are still the primary way for logging on and they are still easily phished through social engineering and they tend to be very difficult to use and to maintain,” David Turner, senior director of standards development at the FIDO Alliance said. “The consequences are real and the impact is real to the world at large.”</p>



 Passkeys 101 



<p>During his session, Turner provided a high-level overview on what passkeys are and how they work.</p>







<p>Passkeys build upon existing FIDO authentication protocols and simplify the user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys can now be synchronized across devices through the use of passkey providers, removing the need for separate credentials on each device. Passkeys also enable new capabilities like cross-device authentication. Turner demonstrated how a QR code scanned on one device can securely connect to credentials stored on another nearby device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to synced passkeys there are also device-bound passkeys, that rely on technologies like a security key to provide the required credentials.</p>



 The State of Passkeys 



<p>The current and future state of passkey adoption was the topic tackled by</p>



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance.</p>



<p>There are now hundreds of services, including the major platform vendors Microsoft, Apple and Google, representing billions of users, that support passkeys at this point in 2024.</p>







<p>“If you are a service provider and you wish to deploy passkeys, you can do so with high confidence that your consumers will be able to leverage them,” he said.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance aims to drive passkey support over the coming years, in part by sharing best practices and success stories, which is a core part of what the virtual summit was all about.</p>



<p>Usability was emphasized as a key factor for widespread adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Usability is paramount. It must be front and center in what you do,” said Shikiar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance has released user experience guidelines and a design system to help companies implement passkeys in a user-friendly way. Future guidelines will address additional use cases. </p>







<p></p>



<p>Shikiar emphasized that passkeys are not about being a new addition to improve the security of passwords. His expectation is that passkeys will be seen as a true password replacement rather than just an attempt at bolstering existing authentication methods. He emphasized that the fundamental problem is passwords, and the goal should be replacing them, not just adding extra security layers on top of passwords. Shikiar wants people to stop thinking about multi-factor authentication factors and instead think about enabling phishing resistant identities.&nbsp;</p>



 Passkeys are on Target at Target 



<p>Passkeys are already in use at retail giant Target, helping to improve security and optimize authentication for its employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tom Sheffield, senior director cybersecurity at Target, said that the company has been leveraging FIDO for workforce authentication since 2018 and adopted it as a primary authenticator in 2021.</p>







<p>One of the ways that Target has been able to more easily enable passkey support across its platforms is via Single Sign On (SSO).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have a very robust SSO environment across our web application suite,” Sheffield said. “So for us, that made it very easy to integrate FIDO into the SSO platform, and then therefore every application behind SSO automatically got the benefit of it.”</p>



<p>In terms of how Target was able to get its users to adopt passkeys quickly, Sheffield said that the option was communicated to users in the login flow, rather than trying to explain to users what they should do in an email.</p>



<p>Overall, Sheffield emphasized that if an organization is using OTP (one time passwords) today for multi-factor authentication (MFA), any form of FIDO will provide significantly better user experience and security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There have not been many security programs that I’ve been part of in my 25-year career in this space that offer you security and user experience simultaneously,” he said. “So if you’re using anything other than FIDO you’ve got a great opportunity to up your game and provide a great experience for users which should make you a hero.”</p>



 Authenticating a Billion Customers with Passkeys at Amazon 



<p>Among the biggest consumer-facing websites that supports passkeys today is online giant Amazon.</p>







<p>Yash Patodia, senior manager of product management at Amazon, detailed how passkeys were rolled out to hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide. Patodia explained Amazon’s motivation noting that passwords are relatively easy for a bad actor to crack. He noted that passkeys help customers to authenticate more easily than other methods with a better user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amazon implemented passkeys using different APIs for web, iOS, and Android platforms. Now available across devices, Amazon’s goal is to drive awareness and increase passkey adoption among its customer base over the next year. In his view, passkeys are well suited for mass adoption and early indications from Amazon’s user base are very encouraging.</p>



<p>“If you’re a consumer facing company who has a big customer base, definitely explore this option,” he said.</p>



 Considerations for FIDO and Passkeys in the US Government&nbsp; 



<p>The U.S. Government is no stranger to the world of strong authentication, with many staffers already using PIV (Personal Identity Verification) smart card credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teresa Wu from IDEMIA and Joe Scalone from Yubico, who both serve on the FIDO Alliance’s Government Deployment Working Group (GDWG), provided an overview of how passkeys can complement PIV credentials and support a zero trust security model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As government agencies work to implement phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication, passkeys are an option that could provide a more seamless user experience than one-time passwords or hardware tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are not here to replace PIV, we are here to supplement and use FIDO where PIV is not covered,” said Wu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One area they see opportunities for FIDO is for federal contractors and employees who are not eligible for a PIV card due to their job functions. Currently these individuals rely on passwords for system access.</p>







<p></p>



 State of Passkey Portability Set to Improve 



<p>A critical aspect of user experience is the ability to change passkey providers and move from one provider to another, if that’s what the user wants to do.</p>



<p>With existing password managers and legacy passwords, the process of moving credentials isn’t particularly efficient or secure, according to Rew Islam from Dashlane and Nick Steele from 1Password. It’s a situation that the Credential Provider Special Interest Group within the FIDO Alliance is looking to solve with a new standard for securely porting passwords between different password/passkey management applications.</p>



<p>The group is developing a new Credential Exchange Protocol that will use hybrid public key encryption to securely transfer credentials; the effort also includes the development of a standardized data format for credential information.</p>



<p>“By having the standard credential format, it will allow for interoperability of sharing credentials between two different providers in different organizations,” Steele said.</p>



<p>A proof of concept demo for the credential exchange is currently set for May, during the FIDO Member Plenary in Osaka, Japan. Islam noted that the effort represents a real triumph for the power of FIDO to bring different competitive vendors together for common purpose.</p>



 Common Questions about Passkeys&nbsp; 



<p>The virtual summit was concluded with an ‘Ask Me Anything’ (AMA) session where attendees asked their most pressing questions on passkeys.</p>



<p>Among the big questions asked:</p>



<p>How should organizations consider choosing synced passkeys or device-bound passkeys from a security and usability perspective?</p>



<p>Turner answered that the first thing to make really clear is that synced passkeys are probably the right answer for the majority of use cases. That said, he noted that FIDO recognizes that there are some areas where people have a much higher risk profile, and in those cases the device- bound passkeys can provide an extra level of trust.</p>



<p>Can passkeys play a role in transaction signing?</p>



<p>Pedro Martinez from Thales responded that yes, passkeys can be used to sign transactions. He explained that the beauty of the FIDO protocol is that it is based on the signature of a challenge. As such, it’s possible to adjust the challenge in order to contain data related to a transaction that needs to be digitally signed.</p>



<p>When will passkeys be the default mode of authentication?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar said that he doesn’t think that all passwords will go away, but he is hopeful for a passwordless future.</p>



<p>“Sophisticated risk engines and anomaly detectors don’t really think twice about accepting a password,” he said. “But as passkeys become more prevalent and become the default all of a sudden using a password will be anomalous in and of itself.and I think that’s when we’ll be in the fabulous future when using a password is rightfully seen as a high risk and anomalous action.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON,&nbsp;March 22, 2024&nbsp;/PRNewswire/ — World Identity Network (WIN), the leading nonprofit organization advocating for universal identity rights, has released its groundbreaking documentary, Shadows in the Dark: Our Global Identity Crisis, exclusively on Amazon.</p>



<p>“Releasing this film to the public is a moment of great triumph for our organization,”&nbsp;says WIN Founder and CEO,&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Mariana Dahan. “We spent years interviewing undocumented persons and refugees. Telling their stories with the utmost care, precision, and nuance was a tremendous responsibility, and we could not be happier with the final result.”</p>



<p>Shadows in the Dark&nbsp;is a sprawling saga following the stories of undocumented individuals across&nbsp;the United States, the&nbsp;Middle East, and refugee camps in&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;and beyond. The documentary shines a light on those born in the shadows of the formal economy, at the margins of society, lacking common identity documents, such as birth certificates and passports.</p>



<p>The movie highlights the work that Dr.&nbsp;Mariana Dahan&nbsp;has conducted at The World Bank, as the initiator and first global coordinator of the Identification for Development (ID4D) agenda, which celebrates its 10-years anniversary this year.&nbsp;Shadows in the Dark&nbsp;offers a compelling analysis of the successes and the risks associated with this multi-billion dollars program.</p>



<p>The Emmy Award – winning film crew has interviewed decision-makers, technologists and human rights activists, advocating for universal identification and responsible use of digital technologies, such as biometrics, facial recognition and AI.</p>



<p>“Identity is at the heart of many of today’s global challenges,” says&nbsp;Shadows in the Dark Co-director,&nbsp;Brad Kremer. “It is the common thread in immigration and many of the conflict zones existing throughout the world. When Dr.&nbsp;Mariana Dahan&nbsp;approached me to do this film together, I knew it would be a journey of immense meaning. But directing this narration, and telling the stories of everyone this issue impacts, has exceeded all our expectations.”</p>



<p>Produced in partnership with the&nbsp;United Nations, the&nbsp;Human Rights Foundation&nbsp;and&nbsp;Singularity University,&nbsp;Shadows in the Dark&nbsp;features extensive interviews with displaced Ukrainian and Syrian refugees recounting their experiences with the asylum process, along with leading officials at the World Bank and the United Nations, and the founders building new digital identity solutions. The film likewise explores nuances surrounding surveillance, authoritarian regimes, and biometric systems, as well as a dialogue with a group of far-right border advocates in the United States.</p>



<p>“In many ways, this film is a culmination of my life’s work,”&nbsp;continues Dr. Dahan. “Having been born without a birth certificate in Soviet-era&nbsp;Moldova, at the border with&nbsp;Ukraine, I know firsthand how crucial identity is to the preservation of human rights. I encourage everyone to watch the film and learn more about this global issue impacting millions. Identity is the cornerstone of human civilization”.</p>

<p>The launch of<a href="https://swap.bel2.org/orders"> BeL2’s BTC Oracle</a> marks a critical juncture,&nbsp; a paradigm shift in how Bitcoin interacts with the broader ecosystem of decentralised applications (DApps) and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, as the first cryptocurrency, has long been critiqued for its limitations in scalability and flexibility, particularly in the context of smart contracts and DApps. The introduction of <a href="https://bel2.org/">BeL2</a> and its BTC Oracle addresses these critiques head-on by generating zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable secure, private, and efficient communication between Bitcoin and EVM blockchains. This development is crucial because it expands Bitcoin’s utility beyond being a mere store of value to a <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/how-bitcoin-and-elastos-are-redefining-our-world-part-1/">foundational layer</a> upon which complex decentralised applications can be built and managed directly.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Core 
<p>The core of this innovation lies in BeL2’s BTC Oracle. The BTC Oracle generates ZKPs to feed real-time Bitcoin transaction data into EVM smart contracts without compromising the privacy or security of the transactions. This functionality is revolutionary, as it allows for the creation of Bitcoin-denominated smart contracts across any EVM-compatible blockchain, vastly expanding the potential use cases and applications for Bitcoin in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space.</p>
<p>BeL2, or Bitcoin Layer 2, further extends this capability by providing a framework for developing and managing Bitcoin-native smart contracts. It represents the culmination of efforts to integrate Bitcoin more deeply into the ecosystem of decentralised applications, enabling novel financial products and services such as BTC lending, algorithmic stablecoin issuance, and more.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Mechanism 
<p>BeL2’s technology stack comprises a BTC Oracle that inputs Bitcoin-related data into EVM contracts, an upcoming ELA-powered relay network to decentralise and secure the data transmission, and the application layer where the actual development of Bitcoin-native smart contracts takes place.</p>
<p>This approach minimises reliance on intermediaries, reduces points of failure, and enhances the system’s overall resilience and efficiency. BeL2’s BTC Oracle is centred around enhancing Bitcoin’s utility and accessibility, involving innovative cryptographic techniques like ZKPs to deliver a comprehensive solution for Bitcoin and EVM blockchain interoperability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Impact 
<p>By enabling direct development on Bitcoin Layer 2, <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/ela-queen-of-bitcoin/">Elastos</a> is not just augmenting Bitcoin’s functionality; it is redefining the possibilities of the blockchain space. The ability for any EVM blockchain to leverage Bitcoin in smart contracts opens up new avenues for innovation, potentially increasing the market for Bitcoin-based applications sevenfold.</p>
<p>This development aligns with the broader trend of seeking solutions that respect the foundational principles of blockchain technology—decentralisation, security, and user sovereignty—while pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. It embodies a non-consensus, forward-thinking approach that challenges conventional limitations and opens up new opportunities for the entire crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the launch of Elastos’ BTC Oracle and BeL2 platform represents a significant milestone in the evolution of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. By addressing fundamental challenges of interoperability and functionality, Bitcoin’s value is not just in its scarcity and security but in its utility and integration into the decentralised web.</p>

     <p>To enhance the Swiss e-ID framework with selective disclosure while ensuring unlinkability, it’s imperative to incorporate advanced digital signature technologies such as BBS+ signatures. These technologies not only fortify the security of digital credentials but also significantly enhance user privacy. Such capabilities are crucial in minimizing the risk of personal data exposure and ensuring that users retain control over their information. It’s essential to continuously align our Trust Infrastructure with international cryptographic standards while remaining adaptable to emerging norms. This approach will facilitate interoperability across borders and sectors, ensuring that e-ID systems are both secure and universally recognized.</p>
<p>The parallel signatures model involves attaching multiple digital signatures to a single document or payload, with each signature providing different security or privacy features. This approach allows for a flexible and robust security framework, accommodating various cryptographic standards and privacy needs without compromising the integrity of the original document. It’s particularly useful in environments requiring adherence to diverse regulatory standards or in scenarios where resilience and both, high security and privacy are paramount. Cryptographic layering supports adaptiveness by incorporating multiple layers of cryptographic techniques within a system. This approach allows for the seamless integration and removal of cryptographic methods as needed by the Trust Ecosystem governance, enabling the system to adapt to evolving security threats and advancements in cryptographic research. It ensures long-term resilience and flexibility, allowing systems to maintain security without complete overhauls. Applying cryptographic schemes always mandates careful handling of private keys. Preventing their exposure is vital, even more so when using advanced schemes supporting derivative keys, as possible with BBS+. This underscores the need for strict security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the system’s integrity.</p>
<p>Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) represent a proven strategic model to operationalize digital trust and -identity solutions, combining public oversight with private sector efficiency and innovation. Such partnerships should be structured to encourage shared investment and risk, with a clear focus on public interest, global standards and local governance, protection of digital sovereignty and value-based adoption. These initiatives should be complemented by ongoing research into cryptographic innovations, preparing the ground for future advancements in e-ID security and privacy.</p>
<p>To address the challenges comprehensively and to build a continuously improving framework that is not only secure and compliant but also resilient and forward-looking, we must evaluate to invest in an independent body that accompanies the further progress in technology, governance and supports public and private sector adoption – to benefit from the opportunities of a trusted digital economy in the long term.</p>

<p>Marli Lichtman is Managing Director and Head, Digital Strategy and Controls at BMO Financial Group, <a href="https://www.bmo.com/">BMO</a>.</p>



<p>Follow Marli on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marli-lichtman/">LinkedIn</a></p>


 
 


<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>Let me work backwards, starting with my current role as Head of Digital Strategy and Controls at BMO. In this role, I lead two teams accountable for: (1) Strategy: defining and executing BMO’s “Digital First” agenda and (2) Controls: working in partnership with the Financial Crimes Unit to build and enhance digital controls to protect our customers against fraud. </p>



<p>I initially joined BMO’s Corporate Strategy Team in 2013 and since then have worked in progressively senior roles across Finance, Risk, Transformation and Business Operations. </p>



<p>Before joining BMO, I was a consultant in Oliver Wyman’s Finance and Risk Practice and prior to that, I worked in wealth management and earned my CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) designation. My first job out of school was at a boutique investment advisory firm. I graduated from Ivey at Western University with an Honours Business Administration (HBA) degree.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, did you visualize a dream job and if so, why?</p>



<p>I didn’t really know what I wanted to do when I was 20! I focused the early days of my career on finding opportunities where I could be challenged, learn as much as possible, maintain optionality to transition to other industries or career paths, and work with great people who would champion my career.</p>



<p>Have you encountered significant barriers in your career as a woman in leadership, and if so, what were they?</p>



<p>I have experienced many of the usual challenges you hear about concerning women in the workplace. However, my biggest barrier has been getting into my own head and thinking that I don’t deserve the positions I’ve been given (I mean, earned 😊). Through executive coaching, mentors, sponsors, and simply the experience of failing and rebounding, I’ve been able to overcome this (although I would be lying if I said I don’t experience imposter syndrome from time to time!).</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>It’s a constant juggling act, but I try to focus on 5 things: </p>



 
 Regular calendar reviews to “optimize” my time (e.g., which calls can I take from the car on my way to / from the office?)  



 Learning to say “no” and setting clear boundaries (applies to both work and personal life). 



 Finding time for self-care. 



 Working as a team with my partner who is also balancing a demanding schedule.  



 Living my values and knowing what’s important in life. 
 



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue digital trust and identity careers?</p>



<p>We need to start with education – What is Digital ID? What skillsets do you need to enter the space? Why is diversity so important? Who are female trailblazers in the space, and what has their career path looked like? Early exposure, encouragement, and mentorship are key to increasing female representation in this space.</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Build meaningful relationships. Earn the trust of your colleagues. Network within and outside of your industry. Ensure you have a mentor and a sponsor at your organization. Most importantly, stay true to yourself.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>While women have made considerable progress over the past decade, there is still more work to do. The next generation will continue to face the same challenges (e.g., gender bias, pay inequality, balancing personal life) but will benefit from increased female representation and sponsorship at Senior levels.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Be confident – you are in the field for a reason! Trust your instincts, and don’t be too hard on yourself.</p>

<p>We're thrilled to announce that <a href="https://oamo.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">Oamo</a> is partnering with <a href="https://ceramic.network/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">Ceramic</a> as a data provider on the platform. Oamo will issue tens of millions of publicly available credentials based on wallets’ on-chain activity and holdings. This is the first step in a broader initiative to develop and standardize the first decentralized point system, powered by Ceramic and Oamo’s credential models.</p><p>Oamo has been a big supporter of the Ceramic ecosystem from day one. By harnessing Ceramic's innovative DID (Decentralized Identifier) infrastructure and <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">ComposeDB</a> for zero-party data storage, they’re setting the foundation for a future where user data is private by design, perishable at will, and accessible only with explicit permission. Oamo and Ceramic are crafting a path toward a consensual and rewarding digital ecosystem.</p> The partnership so far <p>Since launching on Ceramic in Q3 2023, Oamo has witnessed remarkable results – over 65,000 Oamo Profiles have been created, with more than 200,000 Ceramic documents generated. Additionally, Oamo has distributed over 400,000 credentials spanning Web2 and on-chain behaviors, enriching the digital identity and access privileges of Oamo Profile users across various platforms.</p><p>Oamo credentials cover:</p>  On-chain activity across DeFi, NFTs, staking and gaming;  Wallet holdings including major ERC-20s and NFT collections; and  Social activity across Web2 platforms like Discord, Youtube and X.   Supercharging the Ceramic ecosystem <p>With this partnership and announcement, Oamo aims to enhance digital identity and engagement through:</p>  Credential Distribution <br>Oamo has indexed millions of EVM wallets’ behaviors and holdings, and will be distributing tens of millions of publicly available credentials to enrich user identities across platforms, ensuring the security and verification of online activities.

Feedback from the community is welcome to develop new credentials that track the most relevant on-chain behaviors for builders in the ecosystem.  Compile specific wallet lists for airdrops.  Establish reputation frameworks based on behavioral data points.  Launch strategic user acquisition campaigns by identifying wallets in a specific target audience and contacting them via XMTP for example.    Decentralized Point System <br>Oamo will leverage its credential models to develop the first standardized decentralized point system on Ceramic, with each indexed wallet receiving its own scorecard based on its on-chain activity and holdings. Builders in the ecosystem will be able to leverage these scorecards and customize their own points system with their own credentials and Oamo’s.  Credential &amp; Points Management SDK<br>Oamo will release an SDK to allow any builder to search and leverage Oamo’s credentials and points system easily. This middleware will also allow builders to issue their own credentials and points based on their own models and app activity.   What’s in it for users <p>Anyone creating their Decentralized Identifier (DID) on the Ceramic Network (by creating an Oamo Profile, for instance) will be able to claim their credentials and scorecards seamlessly. This open and inclusive approach democratizes access to digital credentials, ensuring users from all backgrounds and levels of onchain experience can benefit from Ceramic’s ecosystem of builders.</p> What’s in it for developers <p>Oamo's vision includes diverse use cases, transforming how developers interact with consumers. The Oamo platform offers endless opportunities for various types of protocols and apps:</p>  DeFi Protocols<br>Easily find wallets matching their target audience, such as active liquidity providers on leading AMMs or active traders on DEXes across major EVM chains.  NFT Projects<br>Identify potential collectors based on their NFT holdings and distribute collections to the right user base.  Wallet Providers<br>Identify and reach whales holding specific token amounts across multiple chains.  Liquid Staking Projects<br>Identify wallets holding significant ETH amounts and generating yield via lending protocols as high-value acquisition targets.  Game Developers<br>Find gamers in Web3 that hold specific NFTs or have engaged with similar on-chain games.  <p>While the Oamo app provides a hub for user acquisition and relationship development, this publicly available tooling and data will allow anyone to craft their own strategies.</p><p>Builders on the Ceramic Network will have the capability to query, consume, and customize issued credentials and points to power new data-rich use cases, such as targeted airdrops, credential-gated experiences, loyalty programs, and more. To streamline integrations, Oamo will be launching an SDK, making it easier for developers to incorporate these capabilities into their own projects.</p><p>Join the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/+cFzcrY5DZuRhNGNh?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Oamo’s Telegram channel for builders</a> to contribute or be notified about updates and releases.</p> <p>About <a href="https://ceramic.network/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">Ceramic</a></p><p>Ceramic is a decentralized data network for managing verifiable data at scale, combining the trust and composability of a blockchain with the flexibility of an event-driven architecture to help organizations get more value from their data.

 Introduction <p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is already reaching relevant adoption across multiple fields, however, some of its limitations are significantly hurting the potential of mainstream adoption and delivering improvements in all fields of modern humanity. For GenAI to be production-ready for such a scale of impact we need to limit hallucinations, manage bias, and reject intellectual property (or data ownership) infringements. The promise of Verifiable Internet for AI is to address these shortfalls by providing information provenance in model outputs, ensuring verifiability of presented information, respecting data ownership, and incentivizing new knowledge creation.</p><p>Below we’re showcasing the implementation framework called Decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG) on the NVIDIA Build ecosystem, combining an ample amount of powerful models across industries and types. dRAG is advancing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework proposed by Patrick Lewis in an attempt to increase accuracy and reliability of GenAI models with facts fetched from external sources. The RAG framework has gained prominence both among AI developers and the leading tech companies’ leaders, such as NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen&nbsp;Huang.</p><p>The dRAG advances the RAG system by leveraging the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), a permissionless network of Knowledge Assets. Each Knowledge Asset contains Graph data and/or Vector embeddings, immutability proofs, a Decentralized Identifier (DID), and the ownership NFT. When connected in one permission-less DKG, the following capabilities are&nbsp;enabled:</p>  Knowledge Graphs — structural knowledge in knowledge graphs allows a hybrid of neural and symbolic AI methodologies, enhancing the GenAI models with deterministic inputs.  Ownership — dRAG uses input from Knowledge Assets that have an owner that can manage access to the data contained in the Knowledge Asset.  Verifiability — every piece of knowledge on the DKG has cryptographic proofs published ensuring that no tampering has occurred since it was published.  <p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to query the OriginTrail DKG and retrieve verified Knowledge Assets on the&nbsp;DKG.</p> Prerequisites   A <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/">NVIDIA build</a> platform account and API&nbsp;key.  A DKG node. Please visit the <a href="https://docs.origintrail.io/decentralized-knowledge-graph/node-setup-instructions">official docs</a> to learn how to set one&nbsp;up.  A Python project with a virtual environment set&nbsp;up.   Step 1 — Installing packages and setting up&nbsp;dkg.py <p>In this step, you’ll install the necessary packages using pip and set up the credentials for&nbsp;dkg.py.</p><p>Navigate to your Python project’s environment and run the following command to install the packages:</p> pip install openai dkg python-dotenv annoy <p>The OpenAI client is going to act as an intermediary for interacting with the NVIDIA API. You’ll store the environment variables in a file called&nbsp;.env. Create and open it for editing in your favorite&nbsp;editor:</p> nano .env <p>Add the following lines:</p> OT_NODE_HOSTNAME="your_ot_node_hostname"<br>PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key"<br>NVIDIA_API_TOKEN="your_nvidia_api_token" <p>Replace the values with your own, which you can find in the configuration file of your OT Node, as well as your wallet’s private key in order to perform the Knowledge Asset create operation, which needs to be funded with TRAC tokens (more information available in the <a href="https://docs.origintrail.io/">OriginTrail documentation</a>). Keep in mind that this information should be kept private, especially your wallet’s key. When you’re done, save and close the&nbsp;file.</p><p>Then, create a Python file where you’ll store the code for connecting to the&nbsp;DKG:</p> nano dkg_version.py <p>Add the following code to the&nbsp;file:</p> from dkg import DKG<br>from dkg.providers import BlockchainProvider, NodeHTTPProvider<br>from dotenv import load_dotenv<br>import os<br>import json<br><br>dotenv_path = './.nvidia.env' # Replace with your .env file address<br>load_dotenv(dotenv_path)<br>ot_node_hostname = os.getenv('OT_NODE_HOSTNAME')<br>private_key = os.getenv('PRIVATE_KEY')<br><br>node_provider = NodeHTTPProvider(ot_node_hostname)<br>blockchain_provider = BlockchainProvider("testnet", "otp:20430", private_key=private_key) <br><br>dkg = DKG(node_provider, blockchain_provider)<br>print(dkg.node.info) <p>Here, you first import the required classes and packages. Then, you load the values from&nbsp;.env and instantiate a NodeHTTPProvider and BlockchainProvider with those values, which you pass in to the DKG constructor, creating the dkg object for communicating with the&nbsp;graph.</p><p>If all credentials and values are correct, the output will show you the version that your OT Node is running&nbsp;on:</p> {'version': '6.2.3'} <p>That’s all you have to do to be connected to the&nbsp;DKG!</p> Step 2 — Instructing the LLM to create Knowledge assets on the&nbsp;DKG <p>In this step, you’ll connect to the NVIDIA API using the OpenAI Python library. Then, you’ll instruct it to&nbsp;generate</p><p>First, you need to initialize the OpenAI class, passing in the NVIDIA API as the base_url along with your API key. OpenAI acts as an intermediary to the NVIDIA API here, and will be able to use multiple LLM models, such as the Google Gemma and Meta’s Llama which are used in the tutorial.</p> from openai import OpenAI<br><br>client = OpenAI(<br>  base_url = "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1",<br>  api_key = os.getenv('NVIDIA_API_TOKEN')<br>) <p>Then, you define the instructions, telling the model what to&nbsp;do:</p> instruction_message = '''<br>Your task is the following:<br><br>Construct a JSON object following the Product JSON-LD schema based on the provided information by the user.<br>The user will provide the name, description, tags, category and deployer of the product, as well as the URL which you will use as the '@id'.<br><br>Here's an example of an Product that corresponds to the mentioned JSON-LD schema.:<br>{<br>  "@context": "http://schema.org",<br>  "@type": "Product",<br>  "@id": "https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/ai-weather-forecasting",<br>  "name": "ai-weather-forecasting",<br>  "description": "AI-based weather prediction pipeline with global models and downscaling models.",<br>  "tags": [<br>    "ai weather prediction",<br>    "climate science"<br>  ],<br>  "category": "Industrial",<br>  "deployer": "nvidia"<br>}<br><br>Follow the provided JSON-LD schema, using the provided properties and DO NOT add or remove any one of them.<br>Output the JSON as a string, between ```json and ```.<br>'''<br><br>chat_history = [{"role":"system","content":instruction_message}] <p>As part of the instructions, you provide the model with an example Product definition, according to which a new one should be generated. We want to create a Knowledge Asset which will represent the ‘rerank-qa-mistral-4b’ model from the NVIDIA Build platform. You add the contents of that message to chat_history with a system role, meaning that it instructs the model before the user comes in with actionable prompts.</p><p>Then, you define an example user_instruction for testing the&nbsp;model:</p> user_instruction = '''I want to create a product (model) with name 'rerank-qa-mistral-4b', which is a GPU-accelerated model optimized for providing a probability score<br>that a given passage contains the information to answer a question. It's in category Retrieval and deployed by nvidia.<br>It's used for ranking and retrieval augmented generation. You can reach it at https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/rerank-qa-mistral-4b. Give me the schema JSON LD object.''' <p>This user prompt wants the LLM to output a Product with the given name and gives information as to where that model can be&nbsp;found.</p><p>Finally, you can ask the LLM to compute the output and print&nbsp;it:</p> completion = client.chat.completions.create(<br>  model="google/gemma-7b",<br>  messages=chat_history + [{"role":"user","content":user_instruction}],<br>  temperature=0,<br>  top_p=1,<br>  max_tokens=1024,<br>)<br><br>generated_json = completion.choices[0].message.content<br>print(generated_json) <p>The output will look like&nbsp;this:</p> ```json<br>{<br>  "@context": "http://schema.org",<br>  "@type": "Product",<br>  "@id": "https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/rerank-qa-mistral-4b",<br>  "name": "rerank-qa-mistral-4b",<br>  "description": "GPU-accelerated model optimized for providing a probability score that a given passage contains the information to answer a question.",<br>  "tags": [<br>    "rerank-qa-mistral-4b",<br>    "information retrieval",<br>    "retrieval augmentation"<br>  ],<br>  "category": "Retrieval",<br>  "deployer": "nvidia"<br>}<br>``` <p>The LLM has returned a JSON-LD structure that can be added to the&nbsp;DKG.</p> def clean_json_string(input_string):<br>    if input_string.startswith("```json") and input_string.endswith("```"):<br>        cleaned_query = input_string[7:-3].strip()<br>        return cleaned_query<br>    elif input_string.startswith("```") and input_string.endswith("```"):<br>        cleaned_query = input_string[3:-3].strip()<br>    else:<br>        return input_string<br><br>product = json.loads(clean_json_string(generated_json))<br><br>content = {"public": product}<br>create_asset_result = dkg.asset.create(content, 2)<br>print('Asset created!')<br>print(json.dumps(create_asset_result, indent=4))<br>print(create_asset_result["UAL"]) <p>Here you first define a function (clean_json_string) that will clean up the JSON string and remove the Markdown code markup. Then, you load the product by deserializing the JSON and add it to the DKG by calling dkg.asset.create().</p><p>The output will look like&nbsp;this:</p> Asset created!<br>{<br>    "publicAssertionId":

You’ll now learn how to generate SPARQL queries for products using the&nbsp;LLM.</p> Step 3 — Generating SPARQL with the AI&nbsp;model <p>In this step, you’ll use the NVIDIA LLM to generate a SPARQL query for retrieving results from the DKG. The data that we’ll be querying consists of Knowledge Assets that represent each of the models from the <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover">NVIDIA Build platform</a> — with the same properties as the one created in Step&nbsp;2.</p><p>SPARQL is a query language for graphs and is very similar to SQL. Just like SQL, it has a SELECT and a WHERE clause, so as long as you’re familiar with SQL you should be able to understand the structure of the queries pretty&nbsp;well.</p><p>The data that you’ll be querying is related to Products, stored in the DKG as Knowledge Assets.</p><p>Similarly to before, you’ll need to instruct the LLM on what to&nbsp;do:</p> all_categories = ["Biology", "Gaming", "Visual Design", "Industrial", "Reasoning", "Retrieval", "Speech"];<br>all_tags = ["3d-generation", "automatic speech recognition", "chat", "digital humans", "docking", "drug discovery", "embeddings", "gaming", "healthcare", "image generation", "image modification", "image understanding", "language generation", "molecule generation", "nvidia nim", "protein folding", "ranking", "retrieval augmented generation", "route optimization", "text-to-3d", "advanced reasoning", "ai weather prediction", "climate science"];<br><br>instruction_message = '''<br>You have access to data connected to the new NVIDIA Build platform and the products available there.<br>You have a schema in JSON-LD format that outlines the structure and relationships of the data you are dealing with.<br>Based on this schema, you need to construct a SPARQL query to retrieve specific information from the NVIDIA products dataset that follows this schema.<br><br>The schema is focused on AI products and includes various properties such as name, description, category, deployer, URL and tags related to the product.<br>My goal with the SPARQL queries is to retrieve data from the graph about the products, based on the natural language question that the user posed.<br><br>Here's an example of a query to find products from category "AI Weather Prediction":<br>```sparql<br>PREFIX schema: &lt;http://schema.org/&gt;<br><br>SELECT ?product ?name ?description ?ual<br><br>WHERE { ?product a schema:Product ;<br>GRAPH ?g<br>{ ?product schema:tags "ai weather prediction" ; schema:name ?name ; schema:description ?description }<br><br>?ual schema:assertion ?g<br>FILTER(CONTAINS(str(?ual), "20430")) }```<br><br>Pay attention to retrieving the UAL, this is a mandatory step of all your queries. After getting the product with '?product a schema:Product ;' you should wrap the next conditions around GRAPH ?g { }, and later use the graph retrieved (g) to get the UAL like in the example above.<br><br>Make sure you ALWAYS retrieve the UAL no matter what the user asks for and filter whether it contains "2043".<br>Make sure you always retrieve the NAME and the DESCRIPTION of the products.<br><br>Only return the SPARQL query wrapped in ```sparql ``` and DO NOT return anything extra.<br>'''<br><br>limitations_instruction = '''\nThe existing categories are: {}. The existing tags are: {}'''.format(all_categories, all_tags)<br>user_instruction = '''Give me all NVIDIA tools which I can use for use cases related to biology.'''<br><br>chat_history = [{"role":"system","content":instruction_message + limitations_instruction}, {"role":"user","content":user_instruction}] <p>The instruction_message prompt contains the instructions in natural language. You provide the model with a schema of a Product object (in JSON-LD notation) and an example SPARQL query in the appropriate format for the DKG. You also order it to pay attention to the examples and to return nothing else except the SPARQL&nbsp;query.</p><p>You can now define the chat history and pass in a user prompt to get the resulting code:</p> limitations_instruction = '''\nThe existing categories are: {}. The existing tags are: {}'''.format(all_categories, all_tags)<br>user_instruction = '''Give me all NVIDIA tools which I can use for use cases related to biology.'''<br><br>chat_history = [{"role":"system","content":instruction_message + limitations_instruction}, {"role":"user","content":user_instruction}]<br><br>completion = client.chat.completions.create(<br>  model="meta/llama2-70b", # NVIDIA lets you choose any LLM from the platform<br>  messages=chat_history,<br>  temperature=0,<br>  top_p=1,<br>  max_tokens=1024,<br>)<br><br>answer = completion.choices[0].message.content<br>print(answer) <p>The output will look similar to&nbsp;this:</p>  ```sparql<br>PREFIX schema: &lt;http://schema.org/&gt;<br><br>SELECT ?product ?name ?description<br><br>WHERE { ?product a schema:Product ;<br>GRAPH ?g<br>{ ?product schema:category "Biology" ;<br>?product schema:name ?name ;<br>?product schema:description ?description }<br><br>?ual schema:assertion ?g<br>FILTER(CONTAINS(str(?ual), "20430")) }<br>```<br><br>This SPARQL query retrieves all products that have the category "Biology" and returns their names and descriptions. The `GRAPH ?g` clause is used to retrieve the graph that contains the product information, and the `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include products that have a UAL that contains "20430".<br>``` <p>You can employ a similar strategy to clean the result from the Markdown code formatting:</p> def clean_sparql_query(input_string):<br>    start_index = input_string.find("```sparql")<br>    end_index = input_string.find("```", start_index + 1)<br>    if start_index != -1 and end_index != -1:<br>        cleaned_query = input_string[start_index + 9:end_index].strip()<br>        return cleaned_query<br>    else:<br>        return input_string<br><br>query = clean_sparql_query(answer)<br>print(query) <p>The output will now be clean&nbsp;SPARQL:</p> PREFIX schema: &lt;http://schema.org/&gt;<br><br>SELECT ?product ?name ?description<br><br>WHERE { ?product a schema:Product ;<br>GRAPH ?g<br>{ ?product schema:category "Biology" ;<br>?product schema:name ?name ;<br>?product schema:description ?description }<br><br>?ual schema:assertion ?g<br>FILTER(CONTAINS(str(?ual), "20430")) }<br>```<br><br>This SPARQL query retrieves all products that have the category "Biology" and returns their names and descriptions. The `GRAPH ?g` clause is used to retrieve the graph that contains the product information, and the `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include products that have a UAL that contains "20430".  Step 4 — Querying the OriginTrail DKG <p>Querying the DKG is very easy with SPARQL. You only need to specify the query and the <a href="https://docs.origintrail.io/decentralized-knowledge-graph/dkg-sdk/dkg-v6-py-client#querying-knowledge-asset-data-with-sparql">repository to&nbsp;search</a>:</p> query_result = dkg.graph.query(query, "privateCurrent")<br>print(query_result) <p>The privateCurrent option ensures that the SPARQL query retrieves the latest state of Knowledge Assets in the DKG, as it includes the private and public data of the latest finalized state of the&nbsp;Graph.</p><p>An example result for the above query looks like&nbsp;this:</p> [<br>    {<br>        'product': 'https: //build.nvidia.com/nvidia/molmim-generate',<br>        'description': '"MolMIM performs controlled generation, finding molecules with the right properties."',<br>        'name': '"molmim-generate"',<br>        'ual': 'did: dkg: otp: 20430/0x1a061136ed9f5ed69395f18961a0a535ef4b3e5f/2619549'<br>    },<br>    {<br>        'product': 'https: //build.nvidia.com/meta/esmfold',<br>        'description': '"Predicts the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence."',<br>        'name': '"esmfold"',<br>        'ual': 'did: dkg: otp: 20430/0x1a061136ed9f5ed69395f18961a0a535ef4b3e5f/2619597'<br>    },<br>    {<br>        'product': 'https: //build.nvidia.com/mit/diffdock',<br>        'description': '"Predicts the 3D structure of how a molecule interacts with a protein."',<br>        'name': '"diffdock"',<br>        'ual': 'did: dkg: otp: 20430/0x1a061136ed9f5ed69395f18961a0a535ef4b3e5f/2619643'<br>    }<br>] <p>You’ll now be able to utilize the DKG to improve the runtime cost of the LLM model, as well as have it rely on trustable data stored in the Knowledge Assets.</p> Step 5 — Vector search with NVIDIA embed-qa-4 model and the&nbsp;DKG <p>In this step, you’ll build an in-memory vector DB based on the verified data queried from the DKG and invoke the NVIDIA model with it to generate more accurate results for the end-user. Sometimes, using SPARrQL queries may not be enough to answer a question, and you can use a vector database to extract specific Knowledge Assets by semantic similarity.</p><p>First, you initialize the NVIDIA embed-qa-4 model that you’ll use to generate the vector embeddings:</p> import requests<br><br>invoke_url = "https://ai.api.nvidia.com/v1/retrieval/nvidia/embeddings"<br><br>headers = {<br>    "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('NVIDIA_API_TOKEN')}",<br>    "Accept": "application/json",<br>}<br><br>def get_embeddings(input):<br>  payload = {<br>    "input": input,<br>    "input_type": "query",<br>    "model": "NV-Embed-QA"<br>  }<br><br>  session = requests.Session()<br><br>  response = session.post(invoke_url, headers=headers, json=payload)<br><br>  response.raise_for_status()<br>  response_body = response.json()<br>  return response_body["data"][0].embedding <p>Then, you build the vector DB in-memory by making embeddings based on the Product description:</p> from annoy import AnnoyIndex<br><br>def build_embeddings_index(embeddings, n_trees=10):<br>    dim = len(embeddings[0])<br>    index = AnnoyIndex(dim, 'angular')  # Using angular distance<br><br>    for i, vector in enumerate(embeddings):<br>        index.add_item(i, vector)<br><br>    index.build(n_trees)<br>    return index<br><br>def add_text_embeddings(products):<br>    for product in products:<br>        product["embedding"] = get_embeddings([product["description"]])<br><br>add_text_embeddings(products) <p>Then, you can retrieve the Product that is semantically nearest to the user prompt, in order to generate the answer to his question with the following:</p> index = build_embeddings_index([product["embedding"] for product in products])<br>question = "I would like a model which will help me find the molecules with the chosen properties."<br><br>nearest_neighbors = index.get_nns_by_vector(get_embeddings(question), 1, include_distances=True)<br>index_of_nearest_neighbor = nearest_neighbors[0][0]<br><br>print(f"Vector search result: {products[index_of_nearest_neighbor]['description']}")<br>print(f"Product name: {products[index_of_nearest_neighbor]['name']}")<br>print(f"https://dkg.origintrail.io/explore?ual={products[index_of_nearest_neighbor]['ual']}") <p>The output will be similar to&nbsp;this:</p> Vector search result: Predicts the 3D structure of how a molecule interacts with a protein.<br>Product name: diffdock<br>https://dkg-testnet.origintrail.io/explore?ual=did:dkg:otp:20430/0x1a061136ed9f5ed69395f18961a0a535ef4b3e5f/2619643  Conclusion <p>You have now created a Python project which uses tools from the NVIDIA Build platform to help create and query verifiable Knowledge Assets on OriginTrail DKG. You’ve seen how to instruct it to generate SPARQL queries from Natural Language inputs and query the DKG with the resulting code, as well as how to create embeddings and use vector similarity search to find the right Knowledge Assets.</p><p>Additionally, you’ve explored the capabilities of the NVIDIA Build platform and how to use it with the DKG, offering versatile options for both structured data querying with SPARQL and semantic similarity search with vectors. With these tools at your disposal, you’re well-equipped to tackle a wide range of tasks requiring knowledge discovery and retrieval by using the decentralized RAG&nbsp;(dRAG).</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/decentralized-rag-with-origintrail-dkg-and-nvidia-build-ecosystem-62f48d4f3ca4">Decentralized RAG with OriginTrail DKG and NVIDIA Build ecosystem</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>Open standards in artificial intelligence (AI) are important for a number of reasons:</p>



<p>Interoperability: Open standards allow different AI systems to work together seamlessly, regardless of who developed them or what platform they run on. This means that data and services can be shared across different systems, increasing efficiency and reducing costs.</p>



<p>Innovation: Open standards encourage innovation by providing a common framework for developers to work within. This can lead to the development of new AI tools and techniques that can benefit a wide range of users.</p>



<p>Transparency: Open standards can help increase the transparency of AI systems, making it easier for users to understand how they work and how they make decisions. This is particularly important in applications such as healthcare, finance, and legal, where transparency and accountability are critical.</p>



<p>Accessibility: Open standards can help make AI more accessible to a wider range of users, including those who may not have the resources to develop their own systems. This can help democratize access to AI technology and promote inclusivity.</p>



<p>Trust: Open standards can help build trust in AI by establishing a common set of ethical principles and technical standards that developers can adhere to. This can help address concerns around bias, privacy, and security, and promote responsible AI development and deployment.</p>

<p>The Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC) Task Force at the Trust Over IP Foundation is pleased to request public review of the following deliverables:</p>



 
 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) specification</a>&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/">Authentic Chained Data Containers specification</a>&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">Composable Event Streaming Representation specification</a>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Together, this suite of specifications provides a blueprint for creating truly decentralized, authentic, and verifiable ecosystems of identifiers, “credentials” [see footnote], and attestations.</p>



<p>The specifications describe a series of unique, innovative features:</p>



 
 Pre-rotation of keys, enabling truly unbounded term identifiers;

  Most AI news is about what the giants (OpenAI/Microsoft, Meta, Google/Apple, Amazon, Adobe, Nvidia) are doing (seven $trillion, anyone?), or what AI is doing for business (all of Forbes’ AI 50). Against all that, personal AI appears to be about where personal computing was in 1974: no longer an oxymoron but discussed more than delivered. […]

 <p>Prompt: A woman uses personal AI to know, get control of, and put to better use all available data about her property, health, finances, contacts, calendar, subscriptions, shopping, travel, and work. Via Microsoft Copilot Designer, with spelling corrections by the author.</p> 
<p>Most AI news is about what the giants (<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/">OpenAI/Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://ai.meta.com/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/technology/apple-google-ai-iphone.html">Google/Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-launches-ai-tools-to-rival-chatgpt-microsoft-and-google/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly.html">Adobe</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/">Nvidia</a>) are doing (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/09/openai-ceo-sam-altman-reportedly-seeking-trillions-of-dollars-for-ai-chip-project.html">seven $trillion</a>, anyone?), or what AI is doing for business (all of Forbes’ <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/?sh=68b7d3fa290f">AI 50</a>). Against all that, personal AI appears to be about where personal computing was in 1974: no longer an oxymoron but discussed more than delivered.</p>
<p>For evidence, look up “personal AI.” All the results will be about business (see <a href="http://Personal%20AI:%20The%20Technology%20Has%20Hit%20Its%20‘High-Tech%20High-Touch’%20Stage">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/public-ai-vs-private-ai-vs-personal-ai-whats-the-difference/">here</a>) or “assistants” that are just suction cups on the tentacles of giants (Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, Bixby), or wannabes that do the same kind of thing (Lindy, Hound, DataBot).</p>
<p>There may be others, but three exceptions I know are <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a>, <a href="https://www.personal.ai/">Personal AI</a> and <a href="https://pi.ai/talk">Pi</a>.</p>
<p>Personal AI is finding its most promoted early uses on the side of business more than the side of customers. <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/personal-ai/">Zapier</a>, for example, explains that Personal AI “can be used as a productivity or business tool.”</p>
<p>Kin and Pi are personal assistants that help you with your life by surveilling your activities for your own benefit. I’ve signed up for both, but have only experienced Pit,” or “just vent,” when I ask it to help me with the stuff outlined in (and under) the AI-generated image above, it wants to hook me up with a bunch of siloed platforms that cost money, or to do geeky things (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Python on my own computer. Provisional conclusion: Pi means well, but the tools aren’t there yet. [Later… <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2024/03/19/inflection-abandons-chatgpt-challenger-ceo-suleyman-joins-microsoft/">Looks like it’s going to morph into some kind of B2B thing</a>, or be abandoned outright, now that Inflection AI’s CEO, Mustafa Suleyman is gone to Microsoft. Hmm… will Microsoft do what we’d like in this space?]</p>
<p>Open source approaches are out there: <a href="https://www.opendan.ai/">OpenDAN</a>, <a href="https://khoj.dev/">Khoj</a>, <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/">Kwaai</a> , and <a href="https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/build-your-own-ai/">Llama</a> are four, and I know at least one will be at VRM Day and IIW.</p>
<p>So, since personal AI may finally be what pushes VRM into becoming a Real Thing, we’ll make it the focus of our next VRM Day.</p>
<p>As always, VRM Day will precede <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a> in the same location: the Boole Room of the <a href="https://computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a> in Mountain View, just off Highway 101 in the heart of Silicon Valley. It’ll be on Monday, 15 April, and start at 9am. There’s a Starbucks across the street and ample parking because the museum is officially closed on Mondays, but the door is open. We lunch outdoors (it’s always clear) at the sports bar on the other corner.</p>

<p><a href="https://vrmday2024a.eventbrite.com">https://vrmday2024a.eventbrite.com</a></p>

<p>Elastos today announced a partnership with <a href="http://iotex.io/">IoTeX</a>, to deliver ID verification and validation services across the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) specialists’ portfolio including <a href="https://depinscan.io/">DePINscan</a>, DePINasset and <a href="https://w3bstream.com/">W3bstream</a>.</p>
<p>DePINs lie at the intersection between crowd-sourced participation, funding and governance models and so-called Real World Assets (RWA) – tangible infrastructure such as buildings, equipment or other capital-intense assets.&nbsp; They offer a mechanism to recruit and reward participants to maintain these assets, through the Blockchain.&nbsp; When the latter is combined with a physical interface such as IoT, the contributions of these so-called physical ‘node managers’ can be tracked and, in turn, rewarded against tokens whose value itself increases with the development and use of the asset.</p>
<p>DePINscan provides a ready-to-use dashboard with essential visualizations for IoT projects and roll outs; while <a href="https://docs.w3bstream.com/introduction/readme">W3bstream</a> is a decentralized protocol that connects data generated in the physical world to the Blockchain world.&nbsp; IoTeX harnesses its innovative Roll-Delegated Proof of Stake (Roll-DPoS) consensus mechanism, designed to optimize speed and scalability for the seamless integration of IoT devices, while ensuring integrity throughout the entire process. Stakeholders cast their votes to elect specific block producers; block producers receive rewards for their contributions, which they subsequently share with the stakeholders who endorsed them.</p>
<p>Jonathan Hargreaves, Elastos’ Global Head of Business Development &amp; ESG, describes the partnership as Web3 ‘next frontier’.</p>
<p>“Extending the benefits of the SmartWeb in terms of disintermediation, transparency and privacy into the physical domain is a logical but nonetheless exciting next step.&nbsp; Our partnership with IoTeX means that entrepreneurs and businesses of any size will now have access to infrastructure that would otherwise be off limits to them, direct and on their terms.&nbsp; This epitomizes Web3’s promise to level the playing field, thanks to its unique ability to ensure irrefutable identity proof which actually requires neither party to relinquish control of the same,” he says.</p>
<p>Raullen Chai, IoTeX’s co-founder and CEO, explains that DePINs permit an entirely new generation of businesses and entrepreneurs to access and monetize global infrastructure – from buildings to cabling, for instance – that otherwise would be prohibitively expensive or inaccessible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our partnership with <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/how-bitcoin-and-elastos-are-redefining-our-world-part-1/">Elastos</a> represents an important milestone.&nbsp; Extending our offering to the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) offers some compelling advantages, including direct integration with ‘Layer 2’ Bitcoin, meaning that agreements can be embedded and reconciled direct in the World’s most popular and trusted digital currency.&nbsp; This is an essential capability as DePINs become more mainstream,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The challenge&nbsp;</p><p>Interoperability is a basic requirement for secure identity management and seamless communication between identity systems and services.</p><p>However, in a world of multiple digital identity standards and protocols, interoperability doesn’t just happen ‘out of the box’.&nbsp;</p><p>Identity standards and protocols tend to be flexible by design, entailing a range of decisions about how they should be implemented.&nbsp;</p><p>Differences in business priorities, local regulations and how these are interpreted drive divergent implementations, making interoperability hard to achieve in practice. </p><p>This means that standards are a necessary, but not sufficient part of interoperability.</p><p>Interop Profiles: reducing optionality to enable interoperability</p><p>Interop profiles describe a set of specifications and other design choices to establish interoperability. These profiles specify items like</p>  Data models and supported formats  Protocols to transfer Verifiable Credentials (VCs)  Which Decentralized Identifier (DID) methods must be supported&nbsp;  Supported revocation mechanism  Supported signature suites  <p>They also specify what’s out of scope, further reducing optionality and easing implementation.&nbsp;</p><p>Profiles can be developed to achieve interoperability for a variety of needs in order to establish a trusted ecosystem.</p><p>Interop Profiles and Decentralized Identity </p><p>There is growing support for interoperability profiles that enable real-world applications of decentralized identity standards and technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leads the Silicon Valley Innovation Program, which focuses (among other things) on digitization of trade documentation using Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials. To prove interoperability, and help build confidence that the solution doesn’t result in vendor lockin, participants have developed profiles and interoperability test suites to ensure they are able to exchange and verify trade credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) plays a similar role in ensuring interoperability within the travel supply chain (for example, when using verifiable credentials to <a href="https://standards.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AIDM/pages/645267971/IATA+Verifier+implementation+guide+-+Onboarding+using+VC?ref=blog.identity.foundation">onboard travel agents and intermediaries</a> to an airline's agency portal).&nbsp;</p><p>The Jobs for the Future Foundation has hosted a series of interoperability events (called “JFF Plug Fests”) to select profiles and develop test harnesses demonstrating that individuals can receive and share their credentials using their choice of conformant wallets, and that the flows work across conformant issuers and relying parties.</p><p>How DIF is working to make life easier for implementers&nbsp;</p><p>The interoperability challenges highlighted in this article matter for our members.&nbsp;</p><p>For one thing, it’s hard to build workable products, or viable ecosystems, on top of standards and protocols with divergent implementations.</p><p>There’s also a growing need for specific approaches to decentralized identity within different industries, regions, and use cases (such as the trade, travel and employment cases mentioned above).&nbsp;</p><p>Interoperability is a core part of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)’s mission.</p><p>Which is why DIF has hosted collaborative work to develop robust interoperability profiles for a number of years.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples include the JWT VC Issuance Profile, which describes the technical protocols, data formats, and other requirements to enable interoperable issuance of VCs from Issuers to Wallets (see <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jwt-vc-issuance-profile?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jwt-vc-issuance-profile</a> ), and the JWT VC Presentation Profile, which describes the technical protocols, data formats, and other technical requirements to enable interoperable exchange of VCs presentations between Wallets and Verifiers (see <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jwt-vc-presentation-profile?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jwt-vc-presentation-profile</a> ).&nbsp;</p><p>Taking a closer look at these examples, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/jwt-vc-issuance-profile/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#term:vc-data-model-v1.1">VC Data Model v1.1</a> defines the data model of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) but does not prescribe standards for transport protocol, key management, authentication, query language, et cetera. The same is true for DIDs.</p><p>A range of specifications are available, providing options for how these things (transport, key management, etc) are achieved, but if implementers have to support all possible specifications (and combinations), it would be a lot of work.</p><p>So a profile is a way to make choices and even restrictions for a certain use case, allowing all participants to establish interoperability.</p><p>Summary</p><p>Collaboration on interoperability is an essential part of the process of establishing a viable digital trust ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Interop profiles define specific requirements that must be followed by identity providers, relying parties, and other stakeholders.</p><p>DIF provides a neutral venue to collaborate on interop profile development.&nbsp;</p><p>Together with our working group tools, best practices and IPR protection, and our members’ subject matter expertise in decentralized identity technologies, DIF is the destination of choice to host this work.&nbsp;</p><p>Got a question? <a href="mailto:membership@identity.foundation">Email us</a> - we’ll be happy to discuss your requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>If the first two months of 2024 for Digital Identity NZ are anything to go by, this year is certainly turning out to be every bit as busy as 2023. It is a different kind of busy, with more collaboration and partnership engagement needed to ‘get things done’ in the digital identity domain, against a backdrop of regulation and economic headwinds.</p>



<p>A couple of weeks ago, the year’s first Coffee Chat saw good attendance as did last month’s Air New Zealand and Authsignal sponsored webinar on passkeys. This exclusive member-only event shared how DINZ members, Authsignal and Air New Zealand worked together to deliver a world class implementation of passkeys to secure Air New Zealand’s customers accounts. Speaking of Authsignal, founder and DINZ Executive Council Member Justin Soong wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/08/generative-ai-and-the-risk-around-digital-trust/?sh=69e6817c6dcf">this exceptional thought piece on AI published in Forbes last month</a>.&nbsp;And DINZ member SSS – IT Security Specialists&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reseller.co.nz/article/1355990/att-crowns-sss-it-security-specialists-as-its-apac-partner-of-the-year.html">received this accolade</a>!</p>



<p>Next week, members will receive a personal email from me seeking expressions of interest, particularly from digital ID service and attribute providers, to participate in an investigative sprint early next month from DINZ member PaymentsNZ’s. The aim is to surface the digital identity-related issues that people encounter in the payments industry, and develop best practice requirements to overcome them as part of PaymentsNZ’s Next Generation Payments programme. Stay tuned.</p>



<p>We kick off April with a lunchtime fireside chat; Digital Health Identity: History, current state and the future with two Te Whatu Ora specialists. There’s so much happening in this space. You can find out more and register&nbsp;<a href="https://events.humanitix.com/fireside-chat-digital-health-identity-history-current-state-and-the-future">here</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re getting the impression that April is the month for digital identity, you’re correct! Tuesday 9 April is World&nbsp;<a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/identity-management-day/">Identity Management Day</a>! While co-founded by the Identity Defined Security Alliance and the National Cybersecurity Alliance in the US in 2021, the day is recognised in many countries globally. In its fourth year, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/event/identity-management-day-2024/">2024 Virtual Conference</a>&nbsp;brings together identity and security leaders and practitioners from all over the world to learn and engage.</p>



<p>April is also a favourite time of year to publish research that helps to level-set our own strategies and plans, as DINZ did last year. This&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/70-of-australians-dont-feel-in-control-of-their-data-as-companies-hide-behind-meaningless-privacy-terms-224072">Australian research</a>&nbsp;forwarded by a public sector member, would probably show similar results in NZ, as reflected in DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://internetnz.nz/news-and-articles/internet-insights/">InternetNZ’s insights research</a>. And the<a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/.github/blob/main/profile/reference-implementation.md">&nbsp;EU digital wallet is taking shape</a>&nbsp;as it aims to showcase a robust and interoperable platform for digital identification, authentication and electronic signatures based on common standards across the European Union. We hope to continue our research and additional initiatives for 2024, and we’re continually looking for support in the way of sponsorship from our members. <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/01/18/sponsorship-opportunities-for-a-thriving-future/">Click here to find out how you can support DINZ’s research, and future ambitions</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://destinycalls.elastos.info/">Visit Destiny Calls Website Page!</a></p>
<p>Today <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos</a>, a pioneer in blockchain technology announced the launch of its <a href="https://destinycalls.elastos.info/">Destiny Calls Program</a>. Elastos is the creator of BeL2, the first Bitcoin Layer 2 applying zero-knowledge technology to enable the direct development and management of&nbsp; ‘Bitcoin-native’ smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new program is now welcoming applications from the digital entertainment, gaming and leisure sector utilising Elastos’ decentralised infrastructure including BeL2 to deliver Bitcoin- denominated services and experiences. The initial cohort of 6 to 8 projects will be backed by up to 100,000 ELA in funding, equivalent to approximately $378,000 USD to kick start a new and non-invasive approach to Layer 2 solutions. The program is a key part of Elastos’ ongoing mission to accelerate the development of the user-controlled <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/rong-chen-and-the-evolution-of-the-internet-from-arpanet-to-web3-part-2/">SmartWeb</a>.</p>
<p>“With the recent launch of Elastos’ BeL2, innovators and entrepreneurs now have access to the functionality of layer 2 blockchains backed by the unparalleled security of Bitcoin,” said Jonathan Hargreaves, Global Head of Business Development &amp; ESG at Elastos. “Bitcoin Layer 2 promises to unlock various applications that will underpin the SmartWeb and has fundamentally addressed some of the capacity and functionality restrictions that have hindered the mainstream adoption of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Destiny Calls will provide crucial initial funding for teams exploring the potential of BeL2 and Elastos’ other SmartWeb infrastructure, and will accelerate the transformation of the internet into a user-driven and interactive ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Projects will be selected by the Destiny Calls board and reviewed with support by <a href="https://www.questbook.app/">QuestBook</a>, the on-chain grant funding review and administration platform. The initial cohort will be focused on three sectors: digital entertainment, gaming and leisure. In addition to funding, as part of the program Elastos will provide marketing and technical support, along with mentorships to support grantees in reaching their program milestones. Interested applicants are encouraged to visit the Destiny Calls page <a href="http://elastos.info/DestinyCalls">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elastos’ Bitcoin Layer2, BeL2</p>
<p>The launch of Destiny Calls, follows the recent launch of Elastos’ Bitcoin layer 2, <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a>. BeL2 is the first Bitcoin layer 2 to facilitate the creation, recognition, management and exchange of any Bitcoin-denominated smart contract directly between concerned parties, without workarounds like intermediaries, side chains or additional applications. BeL2 promises to unlock the SmartWeb, by providing unprecedented functionality to Bitcoin and is part of growing industry excitement and focus on unlocking layer 2 functionality on Bitcon after the significant growth of L2s in the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pilot Recipients Announced</p>
<p>As part of the launch, Elastos is confirming that <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/beatfarm-elastos-blockchain-music-collaboration/">BeatFarm</a> will join Destiny Calls as an inaugural member, having successfully completed pilot projects with Elastos. Beatfarm is a Decentralised platform to give artists direct access to potential collaborators, promotors, producers and industry professionals on their own terms. In collaboration with Elastos, Beatfarm is working to enable artists to establish Smart Contracts on their own terms with the resulting contracts – eScriptions – secured and assured through Bitcoin that can be traded through a decentralised marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Beatfarm’s success as a pilot project perfectly illustrates the potential of BeL2 to create sustainable business models for decentralised Web3 experiences,” adds Jonathan. “ Beatfarm exemplifies our goal of supporting innovative ideas in digital entertainment, gaming and leisure through Destiny Calls.”</p>

MOBI, a global nonprofit Web3 consortium, is excited to announce its participation in the Electronic Secure Title and Registration Transformation (eSTART) Coalition as a founding member. eSTART is a group of leading auto industry organizations united in advocating for modern solutions to replace the paper-based processes that currently dominate state and local DMV operations.</p>
<p>The eSTART Coalition focuses on three key areas of vehicle transactions:</p>
 
 Permitting electronic signatures on all title and registration documents; 
 Adopting tools for electronic submission and processing of title and registration; and 
 Enabling electronic vehicle records transfers. 
 
<p>Modernizing these processes will result in significant cost and time savings for consumers, state and local DMV operations, and industry participants.</p>
<p>Across the U.S., countless titling/registration service providers maintain unique databases and processes for vehicle registration and titling. While some of these jurisdictions have begun digitizing certain processes, many rely entirely on paper-based and manual workflows. This fragmented approach presents several pain points for Motor Vehicle Authorities (MVAs), private sector participants, and consumers, including:</p>
 
 Lack of standardized processes leading to inconsistencies in data management and accessibility. 
 Incurrence of substantial costs associated with paper-based systems, including storage, processing, and handling. 
 Prolonged processing times and increased risk of errors due to manual verification processes. 
 Missed opportunities for cost savings, efficiency gains, and enhanced customer experiences. 
 
<p>Addressing these pain points requires a solution that can be easily adopted across all jurisdictions rather than a solution that functions at a state, county or municipal jurisdiction level. MOBI and its members are collaborating on a Web3-enabled standardized solution to enhance efficiency and cross-border regulatory compliance in MVA operations with an interoperability framework rooted in self-sovereign data and identities. This unified framework serves as a common language, enabling organizations with diverse business processes and legacy systems to efficiently coordinate in a standardized manner without having to build and maintain new infrastructure.</p>
<p>The implementation of a standardized Web3 ecosystem offers a promising solution to streamline operations, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and greatly improve data permissioned-only-access. The ability to verify identities and transactions in a decentralized way can reduce odometer and titling fraud, eliminate the need for manual identity verification, improve insurance products, and enable more seamless remote transactions (e.g. online sales and road usage charging).</p>
<p>“We’re excited to be part of a coalition that not only shares our vision for a more streamlined and modern automotive industry but is actively working towards making it a reality,” said Tram Vo, MOBI CEO and Co-Founder. “MOBI and its members are proud to bring a unique Web3 standardized approach to this groundbreaking endeavor. Together, we’re setting the stage for a more efficient, interoperable ecosystem that empowers stakeholders through enhanced trust and data privacy for all.”</p>
<p>Other transportation industry organizations, including government agencies, industry partners, and associations, are encouraged to join the eSTART Coalition to advocate for these important changes.

<p>Bitcoin transformed finance by deploying blockchain technology, a decentralised system that replaces central authority with cryptographic trust. At its heart lies the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work">Proof of Work (PoW)</a> consensus algorithm, where miners expend computational energy to compete and solve complex mathematical problems, securing the network and validating transactions for BTC rewards.</p>
<p>This model reflects the natural competition for survival, akin to trees vying for sunlight, businesses vying for market dominance, individuals competing for a mate or the dynamics between predators and prey —each process governed by the relentless pursuit of energy and dominance.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s hashrate represents its own competitive edge in the digital realm. This hashrate, a staggering <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate">595.79 EH/s</a>, signifies a computational battle much like those found in nature, but on a scale that dwarfs the combined power of the world’s supercomputers, underscoring the network’s unmatched security and the near-impossibility of overpowering it.</p>
<p>PoW elevates beyond a simple mechanism, integrating nature’s laws into the digital domain to fortify Bitcoin’s network through electricity, a tangible, physical cost. Bitcoin—becoming the unchallenged cornerstone of digital finance, offers a decentralised alternative that empowers individuals with financial sovereignty and freedom from central authority. It provides a secure, transparent, and accessible financial system for everyone, regardless of location or status.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Satoshi’s Vision for Merged Mining 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merged mining, or Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW), allows two different blockchains to use the same consensus mechanism. Miners can mine blocks on both chains simultaneously, submitting proof of their work to both networks. The key is that the ‘child’ blockchain, while independent in transactions and storage, relies on the ‘parent’ blockchain’s PoW for its security.</p>
<p>The concept of merged mining was introduced in a <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.220">Bitcoin forum post</a> by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010, discussing the possibility of a new service called BitDNS to be mined simultaneously with Bitcoin. Satoshi proposed that by allowing miners to work on both chains at once, without extra effort or splitting the mining community, both networks could benefit from increased security and efficiency. The benefits include:</p>
 
 Economic Assurance of Security: Merged mining with Bitcoin means a ‘child’ blockchain’s security is underwritten by the considerable economic cost of Bitcoin mining. This straightforwardly leverages the existing, well-established energy expenditure of Bitcoin for maximum security with no additional complexity. 
 Resource Optimisation and Environmental Consideration: Utilising Bitcoin’s existing mining infrastructure, merged mining does not require extra energy, making it an efficient and environmentally considerate approach to securing a blockchain. 
 Scalability through Proven Infrastructure: By tapping into Bitcoin’s vast network of miners, merged mining scales a ‘child’ blockchain’s security with the growth of Bitcoin’s network. 
 
<p>Merged mining showcases efficiency and symbiosis, much like the natural cooperation in mycorrhisal networks, bees’ cross-species pollination, and mutualistic relationships between birds and mammals. It mirrors human ingenuity in leveraging established resources, such as start-ups utilising corporate infrastructures and solar panels or trees harnessing the sun’s energy, emphasising the smart utilisation of existing networks to bolster security and growth without additional expenditure.</p>
<p>Notably, <a href="https://www.namecoin.org/">Namecoin</a>, one of the first to adopt this with Bitcoin, aims at decentralising domain-name registration. While <a href="https://dogecoin.com/">Dogecoin</a>, known for being merge mined, actually pairs with <a href="https://litecoin.org/">Litecoin</a> due to the shared Scrypt algorithm, not Bitcoin. <a href="https://myriadcoin.org/">Myriadcoin’s</a> unique approach supports multiple algorithms, including SHA-256, making it compatible with Bitcoin. <a href="https://syscoin.org/">Syscoin</a> and <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/architecture/">Elastos</a> also leverage Bitcoin’s hash power for enhanced security through merge mining.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Elastos and Bitcoin Merged Mining 
<p><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/elastos">Elastos</a>, which began with the vision of creating a secure, decentralised internet, incorporated merged mining with Bitcoin in 2018. <a href="http://btc.com">BTC.com</a> helped mine its first block, and today, its network and currency ELA benefits from over <a href="https://ela.elastos.io/">50% of Bitcoin’s mining security</a>. So, what does this mean?</p>
 
 Elastos Utilises the Strongest Proof of Work Security Model in Existence: By merged mining with Bitcoin, Elastos capitalises on the most extensive PoW network, inheriting Bitcoin’s unparalleled security attributes. This symbiotic relationship means Elastos’ blockchain integrity is as robust as Bitcoin’s, mitigating risks without directly vying for Bitcoin’s mining resources. 
 Elastos Has Achieved an Energy-Efficient Design Without Compromising Security: Energy efficiency is a major concern in cryptocurrency mining. Elastos adds transaction and block validation on its network by piggybacking on the work done by Bitcoin miners, thus maintaining high security with no additional energy requirements. This model serves as a case study in eco-conscious blockchain design. 
 Elastos Offers a Unique Combination of a Decentralised Operating System with Bitcoin-Level Security: Unlike conventional blockchains, Elastos is a fully-fledged operating system for decentralised applications, secured by a blockchain layer. By integrating Bitcoin’s hash power through merged mining, it ensures a fortified environment for running dApps, differentiating itself significantly from competitors. 
 Elastos Is Pioneering the True Decentralised Internet Backed by the Robustness of Bitcoin’s Network: Elastos’ aim to revamp the internet structure into a truly decentralised form is ambitious. By aligning its consensus mechanism with that of Bitcoin, it anchors its network to the tried-and-tested resilience of Bitcoin’s mining power, driving forward a new paradigm for digital communication and interaction. 
 Elastos’s Ecosystem Is Designed to be Self-Sustaining and Independent, Yet Benefits Directly from Bitcoin’s Continued Growth: The design of Elastos’s ecosystem ensures it remains autonomous. As Bitcoin’s network expands and becomes more secure, Elastos indirectly benefits from these enhancements, bolstering its own proposition without the need for additional investment in security. 
 Elastos May Be the Most Direct Implementation of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Vision for Merged Mining: Elastos’s use of merged mining is arguably a direct reflection of Satoshi’s initial musings on the subject. Its broad strategic outlook that includes an operating system, a carrier network, and SDKs for developers, all secured by the hash rate of Bitcoin, makes it a comprehensive and multidimensional implementation of the concept. 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 BTC’s Queen 
<p>Elastos, by merging mining with Bitcoin, can be likened to a queen in the chess game of digital finance, where Bitcoin holds the position of king. Just as a queen’s versatility and power are essential for protecting the king and dominating the board, Elastos’ integration with Bitcoin’s security framework amplifies the ecosystem’s resilience and innovation and gives it’s own ecosystem a plethora of utility. This includes:</p>
 
 Transaction Fees: ELA powers Elastos by covering transaction fees, including smart contracts and asset registrations, ensuring network security and efficiency. 
 Digital Asset Exchange: ELA fuels a decentralised economy in Elastos, enabling direct trade of digital assets and services, cutting out middlemen. 
 Incentive Mechanism: ELA rewards participants, including miners who secure the network via merge mining with Bitcoin, enhancing security and sustainability. 
 Governance: Holding ELA grants governance rights, allowing stakeholders to vote on network decisions through the Cyber Republic, promoting community-driven development. 
 Decentralised Applications (DApps): ELA is essential for using DApps on Elastos, providing access to a broad range of services and expanding the ecosystem’s functionality. 
 
<p>Together, Bitcoin and Elastos form a formidable duo, combining the steadfast security of the king with the dynamic reach and versatility of the queen, setting the stage for a future where digital finance is both secure and boundlessly innovative. What’s more, Elastos is developing <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a>, the Bitcoin Elastos Layer 2 protocol, allowing EVM smart contracts to run directly on top of Bitcoin, a scalable <a href="https://bitvm.org/">BitVM</a> innovation. What if such services enable anyone with their decentralised wallet the ability to generate their own Bitcoin-backed algorithmic stablecoins, free from censorship? If Bitcoin introduces the concept of “Be Your Own Bank,” what if Elastos can expand on the idea to “Be Your Own Central Bank?”, both secured in POW. This could drastically disrupt finance as we know it.</p>

     <a></a>         Overview of the Pilot and the Problem It Solves           <p>Across the United States, there is a diverse array of jurisdictions (numbering in the thousands across states, counties, and municipalities) and titling/registration service providers, each maintaining unique databases and processes for vehicle registration and titling. Many states (AZ, DE, GA, FL, LA, MA, MD, NC, SC, PA, VA, and WI) <a href="https://www.autoremarketing.com/subprime/mandatory-elt-processing-gaining-momentum/">currently mandate</a> the use of electronic lien and title (ELT) systems. Other states have planned ELT mandates in 2024, or more generally are developing a digital approach to electronic vehicle titling. For example, New York and Idaho have or are developing processes for dealer reassignments electronically.</p>
<p>Each of these jurisdictions will maintain their own systems for these varied processes. The challenge lies in achieving interoperability between those systems through standardized communications and data reporting/exchange across jurisdictional, platform, and organizational lines while enabling each jurisdiction to maintain control over its processes. For example, today, each vehicle manufacturer or lender can have hundreds of unique identifiers assigned to them by different jurisdictions, creating confusion, mismanagement, and inefficiency.</p>
<p>Currently, secure digital authentication and communication rely on identifiers issued by centralized platforms to prove their credentials. However, in addition to being vulnerable to fraud, identity theft, and data leaks, centralized approaches to identity management fail to address the trust problems created by the rise of decentralized services, IOT, and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/05/hong_kong_deepfaked_cfo/">Generative AI</a>. As digitization advances, it will become increasingly challenging — and costly — to verify data authenticity, secure digital perimeters, and ensure cross-border regulation compliance. This is critical for state agencies like MVAs as well as dealers and lenders, who are responsible for executing the bulk of the registration/titling process.</p>
                    Stakeholders:    Vehicle Manufacturers (OEMs); Financial Institutions (FIs)/Lenders; Servicers; Dealerships; Motor Vehicle Authorities (MVAs)/Third-party Registration/Titling Providers (RTPs); State Authorized Inspectors; Third-Party Data Consolidators; Fleet Operators; Trade Associations; Vehicle Auctions; and Consumers.                 Our Innovative Solution       <p>Overcoming these challenges calls for a new solution. The White House’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">Federal Zero Trust Strategy</a> (2022) mandates that federal agencies and any organization that works with the federal government adopt a Zero Trust framework by the end of FY 2024. Zero Trust requires every entity to authenticate and validate every other entity for every single digital communication at all times. Since this is not possible at scale through Web2/centralized means, Web3 technologies and principles must be leveraged.</p>
<p>MOBI and its members have developed platform-agnostic standardized “universal translators” that work with any existing legacy system or web service to enable cross-industry interoperable communication through <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) decentralized identity and verifiable credential framework, called <a href="https://citopia.global/technology/">Citopia Passports</a> (Web3 Plug-and-Play). Citopia Passports ensure that organizations’ and customers’ data privacy, which is key for complying with comprehensive data privacy laws being passed by many states (e.g., <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CA</a>, <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2022/act/Pa/pdf/2022PA-00015-R00SB-00006-PA.PDF">CT</a>, <a href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/senatedemocrats/Documents/230620%20SB%20619.pdf">OR</a>, <a href="https://www.dwt.com/-/media/files/blogs/privacy-and-security-blog/2023/07/hb00004f.pdf?rev=d2ece1e4cc0c4a708453ab079b7f00f4&amp;hash=57F39986BC8C2DA88C7F985640CB495A">TX</a>, <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/SB0227.html">UT</a>, <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title59.1/chapter53/">VA</a>).</p>

<p>Infosec &amp; Selective Disclosure: Participants must be able to selectively disclose information for transactions at the edge. Verification must be done at the moment of transaction to eliminate the need for PII storage.</p>
    
<p>Scalability and Extensibility: Cross-industry interoperability requires a shared standards-based framework to enable the creation of globally scalable multiparty applications.</p>
          
<p>Data Privacy Compliance: Cross-industry interoperability requires (1) compliance with existing global data privacy regulations and (2) the flexibility to comply with future directives.</p>
    
<p>Global Standards: Cross-industry interoperability requires a standardized system for frictionless data exchange and collaboration while allowing stakeholders to retain their legacy systems.</p>
    
<p>Decentralization: Cross-industry interoperability requires a community-owned and -operated infrastructure to (1) prevent monopolization and (2) enable consensus-based trust.</p>

            <p>The result is the reduction of errors, streamlined operations, increased efficiency, and reduced costs, as well as greatly improved data permissioned-access. More generally, this cross-industry, platform-agnostic, universal interoperability is part of what has motivated government interest worldwide in implementing and adopting standards-based digital identity and credential systems (e.g., the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/preventing-forgery-and-counterfeiting-certificates-and-licenses">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) in the US; <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/digital-identity-leveraging-the-ssi-concept-to-build-trust">European Union Agency for Cybersecurity </a>(ENISA) and<a href="https://essif-lab.eu/"> European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework</a> (ESSIF) in the EU).</p>
   Proposed Stakeholder Meeting   <p>MOBI is proposing a two-part meeting in the first half of 2024: part one being a meeting between the association stakeholders (e.g. AAMVA, NADA, ATAEs, NIADA, AFSA, MOBI) and their representative members, and part two being a meeting including the titling service providers. The goals of the meeting are:</p>
 
 to bring together the key stakeholders to assess the pain points, needs/requirements, and path forward to achieve interoperability between the numerous centralized systems for registration/titling 
 to jointly address the opportunity to develop standardized communication between each stakeholder to achieve interoperability for registration/titling processes 
 to discuss how secure, verifiable digital identifiers and claims (using open-standard Web3 technologies) can address fundamental problems, such as each lender having hundreds of different identifiers assigned to them by different jurisdictions 
 to finalize the scope and scale of the Standardized Web3 Solution for Titling/Registration Pilot 
 
   Pilot Planning   <p>In Phase 1 of the Pilot, the FSSC WG will demonstrate privacy-preserving cross-industry interoperability for Titling/Registration via standardized universal identifiers and communication/claims without the need to build new infrastructure. This will involve working with MVAs, lenders, dealers, OEMs, and service providers to demonstrate interoperability across different legacy systems and jurisdictions. At the end of Phase 1, stakeholders will have successfully created Citopia Passports and be able to use their Citopia Passport to easily authenticate each other’s identifiers and claims (such as lien release, odometer disclosures, insurance validation, etc.). Stakeholders will be able to examine the code and outputs to verify that all transactions/communications are private and only visible to the intended recipient.</p>
<p>In Phase 2 of the Pilot, each stakeholder will have the opportunity to run nodes, conduct research and development for their own applications, and actively participate in the pilot for a duration of 6-12 months. The FSSC WG will determine the final scope of Phase 2 after the conclusion of Phase 1.</p>

<p>In the latest Elastos Bi-Weekly Update, significant progress has been made across different areas of <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos</a>. Let’s take a look at some of the BeL2 and Elacity innovations!</p>
 <a href="http://Bel2.org">BeL2</a> 
 
 Implementation of Consensus Circuit for BTC Transactions: A significant milestone has been achieved with the implementation of a consensus circuit based on Cairo 0. This circuit is designed to perform basic checks on Bitcoin (BTC) Legacy address transactions. It includes validation of elliptic curve signatures and unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXO) checks, among other crucial verification steps. 
 Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification Contract: A verification contract for zero-knowledge proof of Bitcoin transactions has been successfully implemented. This contract enables the demonstration that a given transaction has passed through the consensus circuit, thereby completing the technical feasibility verification phase. 
 Schnorr Signature Verification Circuit: With the introduction of the Schnorr signature verification circuit, based on Cairo 1, the groundwork has been laid for supporting advanced BTC transactions, including those involving Taproot addresses and Ordinals. This is a foundational step toward enhancing transaction security and efficiency on the blockchain. 
 BTC Oracle Development: The objective is to create a BTC Oracle capable of generating Zero-Knowledge Proofs for all types of BTC transactions. These proofs can then be submitted to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts for verification. The development team has successfully implemented zero-knowledge proof for legacy address transactions using Cairo version 0. This achievement marks a significant step towards building a comprehensive BTC Oracle framework that will eventually support all BTC OP Codes, Segwit transactions, Schnorr signatures, and Taproot transactions. 
 Smart Contract and Proof Verification: The development includes smart contracts and tools for verifying BTC transactions in a decentralized manner. This includes the creation and validation of Merkle proofs for BTC transactions, enabling the secure and efficient handling of BTC assets within the Elastos ecosystem. 
 Infrastructure Enhancements and Tools: The deployment and improvement of various infrastructure components and tools have been noted. This includes the development of contracts for asset exchange, order management, and fraud proof submission. These components are essential for the robust operation of the Elastos infrastructure, ensuring a secure, efficient, and decentralized environment for asset exchange and transaction verification. 
 
 <a href="http://ela.city">Elacity</a> 
 
 Player Update for Flexible Media Streams: The player’s capability has been enhanced to accommodate a broader range of media stream combinations. It now supports playing audio-only or video-only streams, handling multiple streams by selecting the first one available. This update addresses the previous limitation where the player would break if the media was not formatted with one audio and one video stream. This refactoring ensures a more flexible and robust playback experience, catering to diverse media types. A unified signature notification system has been implemented, enhancing the user experience across the platform. 
 Adaptive Streaming Support: Significant work on adaptive streaming support has been completed, ensuring that video playback can dynamically adjust to various internet speeds and device capabilities, optimizing the viewing experience. 
 Android Connection Flow: Enhancements in the connection flow on Android devices have been made to improve usability and performance. 
 ABR Selection Flow: An adaptive bitrate (ABR) selection flow has been developed to further enhance the streaming quality based on the user’s current network conditions. 
 NFT Marketplace Updates: Updates to the filter in the mobile view for the NFT marketplace have been implemented, alongside adjustments to how NFTs opened from search are viewed or routed. Efforts have been made to address sync issues with NFTs, ensuring that collection displays and NFT minting processes are seamless and intuitive. 
 Quality Assurance and Final Preparations: Pre-release testing and quality assurance checks have been conducted, including code reviews and fixes for specific transaction failures and playback issues. Preparations for the release include addressing feedback on collection cover image changes, and ensuring that the mobile filter pop-up experience is consistent across all collection pages. Work on the backend includes fixing RPC call errors, addressing DRM playback issues on iOS, and researching efficient deployment strategies for IPFS nodes.

  In 'Securing Your Digital Future,' Part 1 of this three-part series unveils 
the pivotal role of the Blinding Identity Taxonomy (BIT) and its 
Supplementary Document in fortifying data privacy. Emphasizing the critical 
need to protect sensitive personal data, we explore the foundation of data 
semantics—bolstered by the BIT framework crafted by the Human Colossus 
Foundation and backed by Kantara

<div class='wrap'>

 Part 1: Understanding the Semantic Foundation of Privacy: The Critical Role of BIT and Its Supplementary Document in Data Protection <p>In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, the significance of data protection has never been more pronounced. Recent developments, such as the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-sweeping-executive-order-to-protect-americans-sensitive-personal-data/">presidential order</a> issued by the White House on February 28th, 2024, to prevent access to sensitive personal data by overseas 'bad actors,' underscore the urgency of safeguarding personal information from exploitation. This context sets the stage for a pivotal conversation on protecting sensitive data from a data semantics perspective—the cornerstone of understanding and interpreting data correctly across diverse systems and stakeholders.</p><p>Data semantics supports data interpretability, clarity, and consistency in the digital realm. It includes utilizing data models, vocabularies, taxonomies, ontologies, and knowledge representation to accurately recognize and interpret <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/pii#:~:text=Personally%20identifiable%20information%20(PII)%20is,email%20address%20or%20phone%20number.">Personally Identifiable Information</a> (PII) and sensitive data, ensuring that digital entities comprehend the sensitivity of this information, irrespective of their domain. The <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/blinding-identity-taxonomyreducing-the-risk-of-identifying-governing-entities-in-blinded-datasets">Blinding Identity Taxonomy</a> (BIT) emerges as a beacon of guidance in data protection, supporting the fight against intrusive surveillance, scams, blackmail, and other privacy violations.</p> Celebrating the BIT and Its Evolution <p>Developed by the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/">Human Colossus Foundation</a> (HCF) and supported by <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, the <a href="https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/Blinding-Identity-Taxonomy-Report-Version-1.0.pdf">BIT</a> provides a robust framework for identifying and flagging sensitive information within data sets. Its purpose is not just to adhere to privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA but to fortify the semantic understanding of what constitutes 'sensitive data.' The BIT involves a nuanced comprehension of data attributes that, if mishandled, could lead to privacy breaches or misuse.</p><p>With notable contributions from Paul Knowles, Chair of the HCF <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/decentralised-semantics-wg">Decentralised Semantics WG</a>, the BIT Supplementary Document significantly enhances the comprehension of the taxonomy. As an active contributor to the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/dde-launch">Dynamic Data Economy</a> (DDE), HCF transferred the intellectual property rights of the newly released BIT Supplementary Document on December 13th, 2023, to Kantara Initiative, a global community focused on improving the trustworthy use of identity and personal data. Although not yet incorporated into regulations like GDPR, CCPA, or similar national regulations as an official appendix, the BIT Supplementary Document's publication as an official Kantara Initiative report on March 5th, 2024, significantly enhances the BIT's utility by offering detailed insights into the BIT categories.</p><p>The release of the BIT Supplementary Document marks a significant advancement in this journey. Offering detailed insights into the 49 BIT categories, it serves as an indispensable manual for practitioners aiming to navigate the complexities of data protection. It not only enumerates what constitutes sensitive information but also elaborates on how to interpret and handle this data, ensuring semantic integrity across systems. The BIT is the world's most comprehensive taxonomy for preventing re-identification attacks, with the Supplementary Document adding further depth and clarity.</p> Flagging Sensitive Attributes: A Semantic Safeguard <p>As the BIT report recommends, flagging sensitive attributes in a schema capture base is a practice rooted in semantic precision. This approach enables data protection officers and schema issuers to identify elements that demand cryptographic encoding, thereby minimizing the risk of re-identifying a data principal, where flagging acts as semantic annotation, marking data with an additional layer of meaning—its sensitivity or risk level, which aids in compliance with data protection regulations and enhances the semantic coherence of data handling practices.</p><p>By utilizing the BIT and its Supplementary Document, practitioners have a common guideline for determining which attributes to flag. This standard practice ensures that sensitive data is understood and interpreted consistently, avoiding ambiguities that could lead to data breaches. The BIT framework empowers practitioners to embed data protection principles directly into their semantic models, making privacy a foundational aspect of data interpretation.</p> Conclusion: The Semantic Imperative for Data Protection <p>In a digitally interconnected world, we cannot overstate the importance of data semantics as we navigate the complexities of data protection.

<p>Mercari, Inc. is a Japanese e-commerce company, offering marketplace services as well as online and mobile payment solutions. With Mercari users can sell items on the marketplace, and make purchases in physical stores. In 2023, they implemented passkeys. This article will explain the motivation behind their decision and the results they achieved.</p>



 Motivation 



<p>Previously Mercari was using passwords and faced with real-time phishing attacks, added SMS OTPs as an authentication method to protect their users. While this improved their security, it did not completely eliminate real-time phishing attacks. Sending a high volume of SMS OTPs was also both expensive and not very user-friendly.</p>



<p>Mercari also had a new service Mercoin, a platform for buying and selling Bitcoin with the user’s available balance in Mercari, which had strong security requirements and <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys">passkeys</a> met their needs.</p>



<p>Because passkeys are bound to a website or app’s identity, they’re safe from phishing attacks. The browser and operating system ensure that a passkey can only be used with the website or app that created them. This frees users from being responsible for signing in to the genuine website or app.</p>



<p>Requiring users to use extra authentication methods and perform additional action is an obstacle when what users actually want is to accomplish something else using the app.</p>



<p>Adding passkey authentication removes that additional step of SMS OTP and improves user experience while also providing better protection for users from real-time phishing attacks and reducing the cost associated with SMS OTPs.</p>



 Results 



<p>900,000 Mercari accounts have registered passkeys and the success rate of signing in with them is 82.5% compared to 67.7% success rate for signing in with SMS OTP.</p>



<p>Signing in with passkeys has also proved to be 3.9 times faster than signing in with SMS OTP–Mercari users on average take 4.4 seconds to sign in with passkeys, while it takes them 17 seconds to do the same with SMS OTP.</p>







<p>The higher the success rate of authentication and the shorter the authentication time, the better the user experience and Mercari has seen great success with implementing passkeys.</p>

 Celebrating Open Education Week&nbsp;2024 <p>A couple of days ago we ran our fourth Community Conversations session. This one was timed to coincide with <a href="https://www.oeglobal.org/activities/open-education-week/">Open Education Week</a>, an initiative of OE Global created as “an annual celebration [and] opportunity for actively sharing and learning about the latest achievements in Open Education worldwide”.</p><p>Our focus was on managing knowledge in communities. The version in the video above is a shortened version of the session, which we recorded without the activities. This blog post contains most of the information in the recording.</p> What is Knowledge? <p>Community is key to open education, with an often-overlooked aspect of community management and evolution being how knowledge is stewarded within such networks.</p>Image by <a href="https://www.gapingvoid.com/semiotic-management-systems/">gapingvoid</a><p>Let’s start with the above image, showing the difference between terms and concepts that are sometimes used interchangeably, but actually mean different things.</p><p>When we talk about community knowledge we’re talking about connecting the dots between information being shared between members. This can turn into insight through a process of reflection, and wisdom by connecting together different insights.</p><p>In practice, nothing is ever as simple as the process shown in the above diagram. However, it’s a convenient way to tease apart some of the subtleties.</p> A Simple, Homely&nbsp;Example <p>I went on holiday with my family recently. We ‘favourited’ some places on Google Maps as part of our planning, to help us navigate while we were there, and to be able to share what we enjoyed with others afterwards.</p>Screenshot of Google Maps showing ‘favourited’ and ‘bookmarked’ places in Faro,&nbsp;Portugal<p>What’s represented on the above screenshot is a bunch of data arranged on a map. When you click on each point, there is further information about each place. If I put these together into an itinerary, this could be considered a form of knowledge.</p><p>This is a form of community knowledge management on a very small scale: the community represented by my nuclear family, my extended family and friends, and potentially those people who might in future ask for recommendations on what to do in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faro%2C_Portugal">Faro</a>, Portugal.</p><p>Other proprietary tools that might be used to store data and information with others include <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> and <a href="https://pinterest.com">Pinterest</a>. You are curating these things as individuals for a particular purpose, but there is not necessarily an effort to connect together the dots in any meaningful way.</p> Community Knowledge Management <p>So, what’s the difference between what we’ve discussed so far and managing knowledge within communities?</p><p>In this case, we’re specifically talking about Communities of Practice, which we discuss in the <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">first three Community Conversations workshops</a>. Briefly put, they can be defined in the following way:</p><blockquote>“Communities of Practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.” (Etienne&nbsp;Wenger)</blockquote><p>Harold Jarche has a very clear diagram that he uses regularly in his work around Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) to explore the differences between the spaces in which we interact:</p>Image via <a href="https://jarche.com/pkm/">jarche.com/pkm</a><p>We’re interested in the middle oval in this diagram, with Communities of Practice (CoPs )overlapping with ‘Work Teams’ and ‘Social Networks’. While we might build knowledge within the walls of our organisations, and share things online with strangers, CoPs are intentional spaces for us to build knowledge between organisations with people we get to know better over&nbsp;time.</p><p><a href="https://rosie.land/posts/community-knowledge-management/">Rosie Sherry</a> defines Community Knowledge Management in the following way:</p><blockquote>Community Knowledge Management is a process for collaboratively collecting information, insights, stories and perspectives with the goal of supporting a community and the ecosystem with their own learning and growth. (Rosie&nbsp;Sherry)</blockquote><p>Although she doesn’t mention it explicitly, the inference is that by “collecting information, insights, stories, and perspectives” the idea is that we not only share knowledge, but we also co-create it.</p> Tools for Community Knowledge Management <p>The new version of the Participate platform, to which we are migrating the ORE community, is organised around three types of ‘thing’: Badges, Events, and&nbsp;Docs.</p><p>This is useful for keeping communities organised. But what if you’ve got a lot of information — books worth, almost, and you need to organise that? In this case, it’s worth looking at another tool to augment your community’s ‘home’ and which provides some more specialised features.</p><p>As you would expect from an organisation entitled <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a>, we’re interested in working openly, using openly-licensed resources, open source tools, and cooperating with others. That means we’re going to point towards Open Source software in this section that we know, have used, and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Here are three examples of the types of platforms which can host knowledge created in&nbsp;CoPs:</p>  Wikis — everyone knows Wikipedia, but any organisation or community can have a wiki! You can use the same software, called <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>, or use many other alternatives (we use&nbsp;<a href="https://js.wiki/">wiki.js</a>)  Forums — these are easily searchable so can be used to capture useful information as part of conversations. We’re big fans of <a href="https://discourse.org">Discourse</a> and have used it for several clients projects.  Learning Management Systems (LMS) — can be used to capture information, especially if your community is based around educational resources. Our go-to for this is&nbsp;<a href="https://moodle.org">Moodle</a>.  <p>For the sake of brevity, and to point to our own example, we’re going to show our use of MediaWiki to form <a href="https://badge.wiki">Badge Wiki</a>. This has been around for over six years at this point, and serves as a knowledge base for the Open Badges and wider digital credentials community.</p> Community Knowledge Contribution <p>There are behaviours around this knowledge repository that overlap with those inside the main community platform. But there are also others, specific to it. For&nbsp;example:</p>  Community Calls specifically focused on discussing and planning elements of Badge&nbsp;Wiki.  Barn raisings which focus on co-creation of pages to help establish the knowledge base.  Asynchronous discussions to talk about strategy, and catch up between synchronous events such as the previous&nbsp;two.  Pro-social behaviours are encouraged and recognised through the use of&nbsp;badges.  <p>To dig into the last of these, we know that there are all kinds of reasons why people contribute to Open Source and community projects. We just want to give them a reason to keep doing&nbsp;so.</p>Image taken from work WAO did with Greenpeace. See more in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/10-reasons-why-people-contribute-to-open-source-d13b86b1e9d3">this&nbsp;post</a>.<p>We created a range of badges specifically focused on the community knowledge base. There are attendance badges, for example with the barn raising (and attending multiple times) but also for particular actions such as authoring pages, tidying up existing content, and making it look&nbsp;better!</p>Images CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>Once you’ve got a knowledge base, you can run projects on top of it. So when an ORE community member mentioned that it would be useful to have a ‘toolkit’ for helping people understand Open Recognition… Badge Wiki was the obvious place for it to&nbsp;live!</p><p>We launched v0.1 of the <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/Open_Recognition_Toolkit">Open Recognition Toolkit</a> at the ePIC 2023 in Vienna. As it’s a wiki, this can be easily iterated over time with multiple authors — who can contribute as little or as much as they&nbsp;want.</p><p>There’s so much more we could say, but there’s no substitute for practice! Whether you’re planning to start a new community, in the midst of setting one up, or stewarding an existing one, it’s important to think about good practices around Community Knowledge Management.</p><p>Being intentional and inclusive about what kind of knowledge is captured and shared within communities is crucial. It’s powerful to pool resources and to help generate insights; it helps to provide impact. It also helps fulfil the needs of different members of the community and helps increase the diversity and richness of who gets involved — and&nbsp;how.</p><p>If you would like a thought partner for this kind of work, why not get in touch and have a chat with the friendly people at <a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a>? The first 30 min call is free of charge, and we’ll do our best to help, or point you towards someone who&nbsp;can!</p>CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-power-of-community-knowledge-management-b095a3ac94c4">The Power of Community Knowledge Management</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  We built a Web3 points application on Ceramic to explore the design considerations a successful system requires.

<p>We've made the case in a recent <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/points-how-reputation-tokens-collide-where-it-goes-from-here/">blog post</a> that web3 point systems align the incentives of platforms and their users, acting as reputation systems that allow participants to draw inferences between who's creating value and who's likely to receive rewards for their actions. More importantly, these systems help participants understand what user interactions matter to applications using points. And while points often manifest as objects referred to by different names (badges and attestations, for example), there's a commonality across these implementations relevant to their verifiability. </p> Why Points and Ceramic? <p>Points data requires properties allowing consumers of points (traditionally the same applications issuing them) to trust their provenance and lineage. This is unsurprisingly why most Web3 points systems today are built on centralized rails - not only is a simple Postgres instance easy to spin up, but the only data corruption vulnerability would result from poor code or security practices.</p><p>For readers familiar with Ceramic's composability value proposition, it's likely obvious why we view web3 point systems (and reputation systems more broadly) as ideal Ceramic use cases. Not only does Ceramic offer rich query capabilities, data provenance and verifiability promises, and performance-related guarantees, but both end users and applications benefit from portable activity. We foresee an ecosystem where end users can leverage the identity they've aggregated from one application across many others. In turn, applications can start building on user reputation data from day one.</p><p>To put this into practice, we built a scavenger hunt application for EthDenver '24 that allowed participants to collect points based on in-person event attendance. </p> A Scavenger Hunt for Points <p>Ceramic was officially involved in 8 or so in-person engagements this year at EthDenver, some of which were cosponsored events (such as <a href="https://lu.ma/proofofdata?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Proof of Data</a> and <a href="https://lu.ma/opendataday1?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Open Data Day</a>), while others were cross-collaborations between Ceramic and our partners (for example, driving participants to check in at official partner booths at the official EthDenver conference location). The idea was simple - participants would collect points for checking in at these events, and based on different thresholds or interpretations of participant point data (for example, participants with the most event check-ins) would be eligible for prizes.</p><p>To make this happen, we ideated on various patterns of data control and schema design that presented the best balance of trade-offs for this use case. In simple terms, we needed to:</p>  Track event attendance by creating or updating abstractions of that activity in Ceramic  Provide a crypto-native means for participants to self-identify to leverage Ceramic-native scalar types  Secure the application against potential spoofing attempts  Collect enough information necessary to perform creative computation on verifiable point data  <p>We were also presented with several considerations. For example, should we go through the effort to emulate a user-centric data control design whereby we implement a pattern that requires additional server-side verification and signed data to allow the end user to control their Ceramic point data? Or what's the right balance of data we should collect to enable interesting interpretations (or <code>PointMaterializations</code>) to be made as a result of computing over points?</p> Architecting Document Control <p>Before we jump in, reading our blog post on <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/data-control-patterns-in-decentralized-storage/">Data Control Patterns in Decentralized Storage</a> would help provide useful context. As for the problem at hand, two options stand out as the most obvious ways to build a verifiable points system on open data rails:</p>  Reconstruct the approach that would be taken on traditional rails (the application is the author and controller of all points data they generate). This makes the data easy to verify externally based on the Ceramic document controller (which will always be the same), and data consumers wouldn't have to worry about end users attempting to modify stream data in their favor  Allow the end users to control their points data on Ceramic. In this environment, we'd need a flow that would be able to validate the existing data had been "approved" by us by verifying a signed payload, then update the data and sign it again before having the user save the update to their Ceramic document, thus ensuring the data is tamper-evident  <p>You might've guessed that the second option is higher-touch. At the same time, a future iteration of this system might want to involve a data marketplace that allows users to sell their points data, requiring users to control their data and its access control conditions. For this reason and many others, we went with #2. We'll discuss how we executed this in the sections below.</p> What Data Models Did We Use? <p>When we first started building the scavenger hunt application the <code>SET</code> accountRelation schema option had not yet been released in ComposeDB (important to note due to the high likelihood we would've used it). Keep that in mind as we overview some of the APIs we built to check if existing model instances had been created (later in this article).</p><p>In discussing internally how points data manifests, we decided to mirror a flow that looked like trigger -&gt; point issuance -&gt; point materialization. This means that attending an event triggers issuing point data related to that action. In response, that issuance event might materialize as an interpretation of the weight and context of those points (which could be created by both the application that issued the points and any other entity listening in on a user's point activity). </p><p>As a result, our ComposeDB schemas ended up like this:</p> <code>type PointClaims
  @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A point claim model") 
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["issuer"] }])
  {
  holder: DID! @documentAccount
  issuer: DID! @accountReference
  issuer_verification: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
  data: [Data!]! @list(maxLength: 100000)
}

type Data {
  value: Int!
  timestamp: DateTime!
  context: String @string(maxLength: 1000000)
  refId: StreamID
}

type PointMaterializations
  @createModel(
    accountRelation: LIST
    description: "A point materialization model"
  )
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["recipient"] }]) {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  context: String @string(maxLength: 1000000)
  value: Int!
  pointClaimsId: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "PointClaims")
  pointClaim: PointClaims! @relationDocument(property: "pointClaimsId")
}</code> <p>To provide more context, we built the application to create a new <code>PointClaims</code> instance if one did not already exist for that user, and update the existing <code>PointClaims</code> instance if one already existed (and, in doing so, append an instance of <code>Data</code> to the "data" field). I mentioned above that the <code>SET</code> accountRelation option would've likely come in handy. Since we were hoping to maintain a unique list of <code>PointClaims</code> that only had 1 instance for each user (where the issuer represents the DID of our application), <code>SET</code> would've likely been the preferred way to go to make our lives easier.</p><p>You'll also notice that an optional field called "refId" that takes in a <code>StreamID</code> value exists in the <code>Data</code> embedded type. The idea here was that issuing points might be in response to the creation of a Ceramic document, in which case we might want to store a reference pointer to that document. For our scavenger hunt example, this was the case - points were issued in recognition of event attendance represented as individual Ceramic documents:</p> <code>type EthDenverAttendance
  @createModel(
    accountRelation: LIST
    description: "An attendance claim at an EthDenver event"
  )
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["recipient"] }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["event"] }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["latitude"] }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["longitude"] }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["timestamp"] }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["issuer"] }]) {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  issuer: DID! @accountReference
  recipient: String! @string(minLength: 42, maxLength: 42)
  event: String! @string(maxLength: 100)
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
  timestamp: DateTime!
  jwt: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}</code> <p>Finally, take a look at the "issuer_verification" field in <code>PointClaims</code> and "jwt" field in <code>EthDenverAttendance</code>. Both fields were allocated to store the data our application verified + signed, represented as a base64-encoded string of a JSON web signature. For <code>PointClaims</code>, this entailed just the values within the "data" array (involving a verification, updating, and resigning process each time new point data needed to be appended).</p> Issuing Points - Data Flow <p>For the remainder of the article, feel free to follow along in the following public code:</p> <code>https://github.com/ceramicstudio/fluence-demo</code> <p>You'll notice two environment variables (SECRET_KEY and STRING) scoped only for server-side access, the first of which is meant to contain our secret 64-character seed from which we'll instantiate our application's DID (to be used for filtering <code>PointClaims</code> instances for documents where our application's DID is the issuer, as well as for verifying and signing our tamper-evident fields). To explain STRING, it might be helpful at this point if I dive a bit deeper into what we built to support the user flow.</p><p>Private PostgreSQL Instance (for Whitelisted Codes)</p><p>You'll notice that a <code>findEvent</code> method is called first in the <code>useEffect</code> lifecycle hook within the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/fluence-demo/blob/main/src/components/index.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">main component</a> rendered on our post-login screen, which subsequently calls a <code>/api/find</code> route (which uses our STRING environment variable to connect to our PostgreSQL client). For this application, we needed to quickly build a pattern where we were able to both issue and verify codes corresponding to each in-person event that had been generated beforehand. This ties back to our planned in-person flow:</p>  Participant scans a QR code or taps an NFC disc that contains the URL of our application + a parameterized whitelisted code that hasn't yet been used  The application checks the database to ensure the code hasn't yet been used  <p>While in theory this part could've been built on Ceramic with an added layer of encryption, it was easier to stand this up quickly with a private Postgres instance.</p><p>Determining Participant Eligibility</p><p>If the call to <code>/api/find</code> determines that the code has not been used, <code>findEvent</code> then calls a <code>createEligibility</code> method, passing in the name of the event as the input variable. Notice that the first thing we do is call a <code>getDID</code> method, which calls a <code>/api/checkdid</code> server route that uses our SECRET_KEY variable to instantiate a DID and send us back the did:key identifier. </p><p>This is the second check our application performs to prevent cheating, whereby we query ComposeDB for <code>EthDenverAttendance</code> instances, filtering for documents where the signed-in user is the controller, where the event is the string passed into <code>createEligibility</code>, and where our application is the issuer (as evidenced by the DID). </p><p>Finally, if no matching document exists, we determine that the participant is eligible to create a badge. </p><p>Generating Points Data</p><p>While there's plenty to discuss related to generating and validating badge data, given that the pattern is quite similar when issuing points, I'll focus on that flow. The important thing to know here is that within both our <code>createBadge</code> and <code>createFinal</code> methods found in the same component mentioned above call an <code>issuePoint</code> method if a badge was successfully created by the user, passing in the corresponding value, context, and name of the event corresponding to that issuance.</p><p>What happens next is a result of our decision to allow the end user to control their points-related data, such that we:</p>  Call an API route to access our application's DID  Call yet another <code>/api/issue</code> route, where we   Query <code>PointClaims</code> to see if one already exists or not for the end user where our application is also the issuer     <code>const authenticateDID = async (seed: string) =&gt; {

  }</code> <p>Does this sound a bit tedious? This is the same pattern we're using for issuing and verifying badges as well. And yes, it is verbose compared to what our code would've looked like had we decided not to go through the trouble of allowing our participants to control their Ceramic data.</p><p>Creating Manifestations</p><p>As mentioned above, <code>PointMaterializations</code> represent how points manifest in a platform for reward structures (like a new badge, an aggregation for a leaderboard, or gating an airdrop). Most importantly, the <code>PointMaterializations</code> collection is a new dataset built from our composable piece <code>PointClaims</code>. </p><p>To create <code>PointMaterializations</code>, we use an event-driven architecture, leveraging our MVP EventStream feature. When <code>PointClaims</code> instances are written to Ceramic, we will receive a notification in another application, in this case, a <a href="https://fluence.dev/docs/build-mvm/introducing_fluence?ref=blog.ceramic.network#compute-function">Fluence compute function</a>. </p><p>Our compute function works like this</p>  Determine that the notification is for the model (<code>PointClaims</code>) and the issuer is the DID of our application.  Extract from the notification content the <code>PointClaims</code>  Verify that the <code>issuer_verification</code> is valid for the <code>data</code> field in <code>PointClaims</code>  If the subject of the <code>PointClaims</code> (the document owner) has an existing PointMaterializations, retrieve it, otherwise create a new one.  For the context of the <code>PointMaterializations</code> calculate a new value  <code>unique-events</code> : tally all the <code>context</code> unique entries in the <code>data</code> field  <code>all-events</code> : tally all the entries in the <code>data</code> field  <code>first-all-events</code> : similar to all events, we check all unique <code>context</code> entries in the <code>data</code> field. If they have attended all the events, we then record the latest first event check-in as the value, so that we can rank users by that time    <p>If you want to view the Rust code that implements the sequence above, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/3box/ceramic-fluence/blob/main/calculator/src/calculator.rs?ref=blog.ceramic.network">compute repository</a>. </p><p>At the time of writing, the EventStream MVP does not include checkpointing or reusability, so we have set up a checkpointing server to save our state and then use a <a href="https://github.com/3box/ceramic-fluence/blob/main/fluence/src/spells/event_joiner_periodic/spell.aqua?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Fluence cron job</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/fluencelabs/spell?ref=blog.ceramic.network">spell</a>, to periodically run our compute function. In the future, we hope to trigger Fluence compute functions from new events on the EventStream.</p> What We Learned <p>This exercise left our team with a multitude of valuable learnings, some of which were more surprising than others:</p> Wallet Safety and Aversion to Wallet Authentication <p>We optimized much of the flow and the UI for mobile devices, given that the expected flow required scanning a code/tapping a disc as the entry point to interact with the application. However, throughout EthDenver and the various events we tried to facilitate issuing points, we overwhelmingly noticed a combination of:</p>  Participants intentionally do not have a MetaMask/wallet app installed on their phones (for safety reasons)  If a participant has such a wallet app on their phone, they are VERY averse to connecting it to our scavenger hunt application (particularly if they haven't heard of Ceramic previously)  <p>This presents several problems. First, given that our flow required a scanning/tapping action from the user, this almost entirely rules out using anything other than a phone or tablet. In a busy conference setting, it's unreasonable to expect the user to pull out their laptop, hence why those devices were not prioritized in our design.</p><p>Second, the end user must connect their wallet to sign an authentication message from Ceramic to write data to the network (thus aligning with our user-centric data design). There's no other way around this.</p><p>Finally, our scavenger hunt application stood ironically in contrast with the dozens of POAP NFC stands scattered throughout the conference (which did not require end users to connect their wallets, and instead allowed them to input their ENS or ETH addresses to receive POAPs). We could've quite easily architected our application to do the same, though we'd sacrifice our user-centric data design.</p> SET Account Relation will be Useful in Future Iterations <p>As explained above, the <code>PointsClaims</code> model presents an ideal opportunity to use the SET accountRelation configuration in ComposeDB (given how we update an existing model if it exists). </p> Data Verifiability in User-Centric Data Design Entails More Work <p>Not a huge shocker here, and this point is certainly relevant for other teams building with <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/examples/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Verifiable Credentials</a> or <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EAS Off-Chain Attestations</a> on Ceramic. While there are plenty of considerations to go around, we figured that our simple use of an encoded JWT was sufficient enough for our need to validate both the originating DID and the payload. It was hard to imagine how we would benefit from the additional baggage relevant to saving point-related VCs to ComposeDB.</p> Interested in Building Points on Ceramic? <p>If your team is looking for jam on some points, or you have ideas for how we can improve this implementation, feel free to contact me directly at mzk@3box.io, or start a conversation on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Forum</a>.

<p>Elacity, the pioneering NFT Marketplace built on Elastos, today announces its support for the trading of ERC404 standard NFTs. This technical development enables the buying and selling of fractional NFTs, like <a href="https://ela.city/marketplace/collections/0x1814dde844554e649ee295c767c7a652845a1c0a">Elawings</a>, seamlessly aligning with current token trading standards.</p>
<p>ERC404 addresses the limitations posed by existing NFT trading processes. Designed from the ground up to integrate the characteristics of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens into a single, more flexible model, ERC404 standard NFTs provide customers the ability to buy and sell portions of NFTs rather than previous methods which only allowed for the purchasing of whole NFTs. This capability brings the ability to create liquidity pools for NFTs, creating better markets for NFT trading. It also unlocks new use cases for NFT platforms for example, the buying and selling of fractional royalties for any form of digital content and assets, including music, artwork, books, and the like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sasha Mitchell, the CEO and Founder of Elacity, says about the development, “The adoption of ERC404 a massive step forward in the digital rights and NFT space as a whole. Providing creators unprecedented ownership over the rights to their content, while also allowing users to engage with creators of their choice on a never-before-seen level. Meanwhile, adopting ERC404 is a unique opportunity to enhance trading for NFT markets which can offer utility through access or royalties to services.“</p>
<p>“The addition of fractional NFT ownership will significantly increase flexibility and choice for both buyers and sellers of exclusive content, potentially creating further secondary markets and other forms of value addition,” he says.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult to overstate the technical challenges that have been overcome to deliver genuine interoperability and conformity with multiple standards.&nbsp; But the result will mean more control for creators, and more choice for their audiences.”</p>
<p>This milestone aligns with Elacity’s main vision of becoming a Decentralized Digital Rights Marketplace (DDRM), where creators and users alike can reap the benefits of fractional ownership and royalty generation. DDRM is an extension of existing Digital Rights Management Technology (DRM), a familiar technology that is currently used by industry players to protect creator’s content from unauthorized use and distribution. In essence, DRM systems employ encryption techniques, software licenses, and other security measures to control access to digital content and limit who can use it.</p>
<p><a href="https://ela.city/cinema/explore">Elacity</a> stands as an innovative online decentralized content marketplace, revolutionizing the way users engage in the creation, purchase, and sale of online content through cutting-edge blockchain technology. Elacity’s parent company, Elastos is a public blockchain project that integrates blockchain technology with a suite of reimagined platform components to produce a modern Internet infrastructure that provides intrinsic protection for privacy and digital asset ownership.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic threatened to derail supply chain management completely. Or did it?</p> <p>Yossi Sheffi, distinguished MIT professor and an expert with 49 years in supply chain management, breaks down supply chain resilience into five levels and argues that supply chain managers were unsung heroes during the pandemic. Yossi also touches on balancing resilience with sustainability, pointing out that while essential, both can introduce short-term costs and competitive imbalances. He underscores the delicate balance companies must strike between cost management and maintaining multiple suppliers for risk mitigation.</p> <p>He expounds on the role of AI in supply chains, emphasizing the importance of leveraging artificial intelligence for identifying alternative suppliers and predictive analysis. The conversation also delves into the roles of machine learning, large language models, and robotics in evolving supply chains. Despite skepticism about fully autonomous applications like pilotless planes, Yossi highlights ongoing experiments with AI as potential co-pilots. The episode concludes with reflections on the rapid technological evolution impacting the professional landscape and the fabric of daily life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Key takeaways:&nbsp;</p>     <p>Resilience in supply chains is crucial for navigating disruptions and maintaining operational continuity.</p>     <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is vital for supply chain management despite potential challenges.</p>     <p>Supply chain resilience and sustainability are critical concerns, as are the investments in these areas.</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1 US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guest:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yossi-sheffi-b38b731/">Yossi Sheffi on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>Check out Yossi’s book - <a href="https://sheffi.mit.edu/magicbelt">The Magic Conveyor Belt: Supply Chains, A.I., and the Future of Work</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The advantages are many. Let’s start by saying that Passkeys are more secure than traditional passwords. These are fraud resistant and follow standards Fast Identity Online (FIDO )established by the FIDO Alliance, a global organization of which the Sony Group (owner of PlayStation) is part. The FIDO Alliance is responsible for defining and promoting the more advanced authentication standards for a wide range of devices and platforms. The goal is to reduce the dependence on passwords, which are considered an obsolete method in contemporary times. These standards are supported by leading companies and institutions in the technology sector, with which PlayStation itself has collaborated to offer an optimal access experience.</p>

<p>Sony has introduced passkey support for PlayStation, eliminating the need for traditional passwords. Users can now opt for a more secure and convenient sign-in method by setting up a passkey stored on their phone or laptop. Passkeys use unique cryptographic keys that remain on the device which are phishing resistant, and can be accessed through other devices in case of loss.</p>

 <p>A customer looks at a market where choice rules and nobody owns anybody. Source: Microsoft Copilot | Designer</p> 
<p>I’m in a discussion of business constituencies. On the list (sourced from the writings of <a href="https://substack.com/@dougshapiro">Doug Shapiro</a>) are investors, employees, suppliers, customers, and regulators.</p>
<p>The first three are aware of their membership, but the last two? Not so sure.</p>
<p>Since ProjectVRM works for customers, let’s spin the question around. Do customers have a business constituency? If so, businesses are members by the customer’s grace. She can favor, ignore, or more deeply engage with any of those businesses at her pleasure. She does not “belong” to any of them, even though any or all of them may refer to her, or their many other customers, with possessive pronouns.</p>
<p>Take membership (e.g. Costco, Sam’s Club) and loyalty (CVS, Kroger) programs off the table. Membership systems are private markets, and loyalty programs are misnomered. (For more about that, read the “Dysloyalty” chapter of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527/">The Intention Economy</a>.)</p>
<p>Let’s look instead at businesses that customers engage as a matter of course: contractors, medical doctors, auto mechanics, retail stores, restaurants, clubs, farmers’ markets, whatever. Some may be on speed dial, but most are not. What matters in all cases is that these businesses are responsible to their customers. “The real and effectual discipline which is exercised over a workman is that of his customers,” Adam Smith <a href="https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/smith1776_1.pdf">writes</a>. “It is the fear of losing their employment which restrains his frauds and corrects his negligence.” That’s what it means to be a customer’s constituent.</p>
<p>An early promise of the Internet was supporting that “effectual discipline.” For the most part, that hasn’t happened. The “one clue” in&nbsp;<a href="https://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> said “we are not seats or eyeballs or end users or consumers. we are human beings and our reach exceeds your grasp. deal with it.” Thanks to ubiquitous surveillance and capture by corporate giants and unavoidable platforms, corporate grasp far outreaches customer agency.</p>
<p>That’s one reason ProjectVRM has been working against corporate grasp since 2006, and just as long for customer reach. Our case from the start has been that customer independence and agency are good for business. We just need to prove it.</p>

<p>The OASIS Board of Directors are integral to the organization's success. Read our Q&amp;A to gain a better sense of who they are and why they serve the OASIS community.</p> 


<p>Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jautauwhite/">Jautau “Jay” White, Ph.D.</a>, an accomplished leader with a strong focus on people and teamwork. With two decades of experience, he specializes in building top-notch teams and programs that enhance information security and cybersecurity while reducing risks and ensuring compliance. His expertise spans AI/ML vulnerabilities, supply chain security, data privacy, cybersecurity, and more.</p>



<p>What can you tell us about your current role?<br>At Microsoft, my role involves supply chain security and open source strategy work. My main function is to be the subject matter expert on cybersecurity and information security matters, and take that knowledge and use it to communicate internally to extrapolate ideas, initiatives, and strategies that can be worked on in a collaborative environment such as open source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A large part of my job is going out into the open source ecosystem to see what communities are already in place and to help build communities around work that’s for the betterment of mankind. I seek out opportunities that align with Microsoft’s ongoing projects, identifying areas where Microsoft wants to invest its efforts and finding where those efforts are already underway. We initiate projects within Microsoft and leverage open source collaboration to crowdsource innovative solutions from open source communities. I bring those insights back to Microsoft, advocating for the adoption of these solutions, saying “This is already being done, why don’t we use this?” or “Why don’t we get involved with that?” That’s a large part of my job. I love what I do mainly because it takes everything I’ve learned throughout my entire career to do it.</p>



<p>What inspired you to join the OASIS Board?<br>I love standards, specs, and policies. Having had a hand in writing standards and then using them throughout my entire career, joining the OASIS Board was an excellent opportunity. One of the things I think that I liked most was the fact that I had to run for the board seat. I campaigned and talked to community members and staff; I really put myself out there and I enjoyed that immensely.</p>



<p>I love what OASIS does in terms of the international community. I love its recognition. There are so many specs and technologies that are being used today that people don’t even know originated in OASIS and I just love that I get a chance to be part of it.</p>



<p>Prior to serving on the OASIS Board, were you involved in open source or open standards?&nbsp;<br>For the past few years, I’ve been involved with the Linux Foundation, especially their Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) project. I currently sit on OpenSSF’s Technical Advisory Council (TAC) and I lead a few working groups and special interest groups there as well. Getting involved with OASIS was the next evolution. OASIS does such an amazing job bringing standards and specs to market. I’ve always felt that I want to be involved in this part, because the regulatory part is where I thrive.</p>



<p>What skills and expertise do you bring to the OASIS Board and how do you hope to make an impact?<br>I bring extensive cyber and security knowledge. Unlike many individuals who specialize in one area for the entirety of their careers, I’ve navigated through many roles inside of cyber and information systems. I’ve been a network engineer, a systems admin, a desktop support engineer, and a penetration tester. Also, I’ve done physical security assessments, admin security assessments, and I’ve installed firewalls. I have a software engineering degree, so I’ve written programs. There are so many different places that I’ve touched throughout my entire career across government, healthcare, finance, and professional services sectors. My experiences have enabled me to approach situations from different vantage points and engage meaningfully in conversations. I’m excited to learn about emerging standards and specs from diverse industries.</p>



<p>Why are you passionate about the OASIS mission to advance technology through global collaboration?<br>Global collaboration is key. I spent my last few years working in open source, and it’s so important to work collaboratively. I coined the phrase, “strategically competing through partnership and collaboration.” A lot of these major companies are competitors in nature, but there’s so much out there right now that is affecting every single one of our businesses at the same time, that we have to come together to build these standards, technologies, controls, and safeguards so that our joint customer base remains safe. Trust is huge and our customers have to trust each and every one of us equally.</p>



<p>What sets OASIS apart from other organizations that you’ve worked with in the past?&nbsp;<br>The way OASIS is constructed around Technical Committees and Open Projects is still relatively new to me. I think where OASIS shines is how standards get created and brought to market. That’s the niche.</p>



<p>What would you say to companies that want to bring their projects to OASIS?<br>It would totally be dependent on what that company wanted. If they want to create a spec or a standard around a tool that’s being created, I would definitely say go to OASIS.</p>



<p>Do you have an impact story about your work in open source or open standards?<br>I take great pride in establishing a Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) working group in the OpenSSF where there wasn’t one before. Additionally, I’m proud of the AI work that I’ve been able to bring to Microsoft.</p>



<p>At OASIS, I’m excited to be one of the founding members of the <a href="https://openeox.org/">OpenEoX Technical Committee</a> alongside Omar Santos. I’m extremely excited about OpenEoX’s potential; I think it’s going to be huge in the industry because there isn’t a standard for end-of-life and end-of-support. There’s nothing out there that allows customers to understand when new releases are coming in, when they’re going out, and how things are deprecated. Having been a part of OpenEoX since its inception and participating in the initial meetings thus far has been incredibly fulfilling.</p>



<p>Can you tell me about any exciting changes or trends in open source and standards?<br>The AI space is extremely large and there’s so much room to play in it. I don’t want us to get consumed by one area over the other. There are so many different specs and standards that can be created and I want us to be open to all the possibilities and open to the entire knowledge space.</p>



<p>Where do you see standards going in the future?<br>I see standards becoming more prevalent with respect to these different government regulations coming in. We have more and more regulatory requirements coming out that are beginning to drive standards, for example the EO from the White House, the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and a policy that’s coming out in Germany. I can see that gap closing where you’ll have a standard that could even drive a regulatory requirement at some point which will be something weird to see.</p>



<p>What’s a fun fact about you?<br>I ride motorcycles and I like to work on cars and bikes. More than anything, I enjoy getting under the hood of a car or lifting the bike up and taking it apart and putting it back together.</p>

<p>David Birch is a keynote speaker, a published author on digital money and digital identity, fintech columnist, social media commentator and an international advisor on digital financial services. A recognised thought-leader in digital identity and digital money, he was named one of the global top 15 favorite sources of business information by Wired magazine.&nbsp;</p><p>What was the career path that led to you becoming a thought leader on digital money and identity?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s quite straightforward. I started out in the world of secure electronic communications. I was working in primarily in defence and safety-critical communications when suddenly the financial sector needed to know about this stuff too, which took me into the world of finance and payments.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d edited a book about digital identity and then I was encouraged by the economist Dame Diane Coyle to write <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Identity-Money-Perspectives-David-Birch/dp/1907994122?ref=blog.identity.foundation#:~:text=This%20book%20argues%20that%20identity,phones%20are%20the%20key%20technologies.">Identity Is The New Money</a>. She was the person who pushed&nbsp; me to have a go at writing a book myself. The timing was good, as others were talking about similar ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>The book helped people to rethink some of the problems, and I think it’s stood the test of time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s been ten years since you published Identity Is The New Money. Is this a reality today?&nbsp;</p><p>On one level it is. Some time ago I started to realize that the big problems in payments were identity problems, not payment problems. It doesn't matter if it's push payment fraud or whatever, the problems all come from the lack of identity infrastructure. Why is Elon Musk spending so much on money transmitter licenses, KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering)? Is it because he wants to earn a tiny slice when you pay a friend for concert tickets, or is it because he wants to know who you are and what you’re into? The data about a payment is much more valuable than the transaction fee.&nbsp;</p><p>But in the sense in which I meant ‘identity is the new money’, it still isn't, and that’s surprising.</p><p>What needs to change?&nbsp;</p><p>The lack of privacy is one area. Digital payments are too intrusive, though a lot of people don't care. I get a lot of messages about how terrible it would be for CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) to include not-yet existent features such as the ability to block your spending on certain things, yet when it’s Visa or Twitter being able to see everything you buy, no-one seems bothered.&nbsp;</p><p>Authentication is another area. It bugs me that 10 years later I'm still doing password resets. Recently I needed to book a hotel room, so I tried logging into a brand where I've got points. I got the password wrong and didn’t want to wait for the reset email. Instead I logged into a different brand and booked a room. My product choice was based on which password I remembered!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Do you see a role for decentralized identity in fixing these issues?&nbsp;</p><p>I like the underlying standards, Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials. But the implementation isn’t there yet. From the history of Bitcoin we can see that people lack the competence to manage their keys. When I drop my phone in the canal, how do I get all my stuff back? In a centralized world it’s easy. I buy a new phone and Apple puts all the pictures back. I’ve got my 2FA (2-Factor Authentication) device, so I can easily log into my bank again.&nbsp;</p><p>Otherwise, I'd have to put my secret key on a memory stick and bury it in a biscuit tin in the back garden. For 99 per cent of the population that will never work.&nbsp;</p><p>How can we overcome these challenges?&nbsp;</p><p>I believe the answer is custodial SSI (Self Sovereign Identity), whereby I generate the key on my app and my bank looks after it. That looks like a viable option to me, because banks know how to securely manage keys in distributed hardware, so I trust them not to lose the key. If they do, there’s recourse, as they’re regulated.&nbsp;</p><p>Do I want to control my digital identity? Absolutely. Do I want to hold the keys? No, I want my bank to do it for me.&nbsp;</p><p>What makes you believe people will trust their bank with the keys to their digital identity?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s trust in the legal sense, and then there’s trust in the everyday sense: I trust that my personal data won’t be looted, that I won’t lose access if I lose my phone… I trust the system to regulate my bank and ensure they don’t do stupid things. In the mass market, that’s the kind of trust that matters — the belief that if something goes wrong, it will get fixed.&nbsp;</p><p>What does a good digital identity experience look like, in your view?&nbsp;</p><p>When I log in to the airline, it should ask “Which ID would you like to use?” If I want to use my Avios app, I should be able to. It might call my EU wallet in the background, but I don't see that, everything is embedded. Personally I'd like to never think about managing my identity again.</p><p>In June 2023 you stated that the lack of mass-market digital identity is a drag on the economy. Have you seen much progress since then?&nbsp;</p><p>Lots of companies are experimenting. But is anything mainstream happening? We’re not there yet. For example, I can’t download my Barclays ID and use it to log into my HSBC account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We’re starting to see people storing mDLs (mobile driving licenses) in their Apple wallet, and the EU Digital Identity Wallet is on the horizon. Whether it gets traction or not, it’s driving forward research and development. Does that mean the EU wallet will be all-conquering? I don't know.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ve talked about how machine customers or ‘custobots’ will revolutionize ecommerce. Can you expand on this a bit please?&nbsp;</p><p>I think there’s a good chance this will happen, starting with financial services. A bot can probably do a better job of managing my finances than I can. On April 6 (the start of the UK tax year) I’ll be looking at what are the best ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts). I will spend hours faffing about, researching, applying, waving my phone in front of my face to prove it’s me, figuring out which account to transfer money from… It’s the kind of thing that could be done in nanoseconds by AI.&nbsp;</p><p>I might choose the Martin Lewis bot or the Waitrose bot to do this for me. The idea that they could be regulated by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) and operate under relevant duty of care legislation, with the co-ordinated goal of delivering my financial health, is appealing.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve also proposed that companies will soon need to provide APIs to support the needs of custobots rather than people.</p><p>Where is digital identity headed, in your view?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s energy arriving into the space from two unexpected quarters. One is CBDCs. There’s a need for identity coming from that side, and pressure to get it fixed. The other area is the metaverse. People looked at the lack of obvious progress following Meta’s early pronouncements and thought, it’s not going anywhere. That’s the wrong lesson to take away. For example Apple Vision Pro (Apple’s extended reality headset) is out and there will be no shortage of people wanting to buy it.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital identity is fundamental to make the metaverse a safe space. Assuming this is done right and the metaverse has an identity layer built in from the start, it could become a safer, less expensive, and therefore more desirable, place to transact than the “real world”.&nbsp;</p><p>Money in the Metaverse: Digital Assets, Online Identities, Spatial Computing and Why Virtual Worlds Mean Real Business will be published in late April 2024.

		<p>Beginning his career as a student assistant in technology services, Michel Davidoff was responsible for pulling thin and thick ethernet at Sonoma State University. Upon leaving the University ten years later, Davidoff was in the role of Director of Networking and Telecommunication. “I was responsible for the campus network that we had grown from around three hundred devices to well over 10,000,” says Davidoff. “I left Sonoma State in 2002 and set my sights on California State University (CSU) Chancellors’ Office. They had started a technology strategy program that included at its core digital equity. The Trustees of CSU were looking to implement the Information Technololgy Strategy (ITS) that was represented as the pyramid. IT infrastructure was at the base of the pyramid, the center, called middle world, included initiatives and projects including security and identity management, and the top was student success. CSU’s visionaries, including leadership and trustees, understood very early on the importance of technology to enable education. I was invited to participate in a system wide initiative to determine the standards for the bottom of the pyramid. Following this meeting, I was eager to help further advance this initiative and joined CSU in a new and exciting role.”</p>
<p>Finding Cost-Effective Solutions<br>
Tasked with helping create a consortium of 23 directors of networking at CSU, Davidoff began building working groups of experts. “Along with being a process facilitator for the consortium, I also created guidelines for writing RFPs, particularly outlining the functional requirements,” explains Davidoff. “A large part of my job at CSU was to provide accurate financial projections, both internal and external, and maintain connectivity for all 23 campuses. In 2006 as wireless technology became more prominent, I was tasked with integrating wireless into each campus. Without more money in the budget to do so, I had to get creative.”</p>
<p>“We began by creating a strategy for network rightsizing,” continues Davidoff. “Since I had the data of every single closet at CSU, I knew that more than 50 percent of the switches were not being used, but because of the fear of not having enough as they grow, the network had been built significantly bigger than necessary. I developed a process that if a port has not been used in 90 days, it will not be refreshed. That freed about 50 percent of the budget delegated for switching and routing. We were able to deploy wireless techology on the campuses, and through a RFP, develop the functional requirements. Later when we needed to enhance and standardize security, we went through a similar process and selected a firewall vendor, and became much more systematic and methodical about the deployment process.”</p>
<p>Spanning over two decades, Davidoff’s career at CSU allowed him to become well versed in delivering scalable, ground-breaking strategies and solutions for large scale infrastructure deployments. “I am proud of our accomplishments at CSU, and I believe I was able to bring a few key things to the University,” shares Davidoff. “First, is that collaboration works, even if it might be a little slower. Working together and developing RFPs can offer tremendous cost savings, in fact, at the end of my career, most of the equipment we purchased was at discounts greater than 80 percent.&nbsp; My job was to create the most efficient administrative process that requires the least amount of money, while providing an exceptional student learning experience.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“We need to eliminate complexity to enable innovation. If we keep this complexity in our environment, every time someone wants to innovate, we need to change all these features and configurations. Many vendors or wireless controllers have hundreds of different features and it’s difficult to develop best practices. We need a deterministic network and not a non-deterministic network in order to predict the performance.”</p>

		<p>Encouraging Collaboration<br>
Over the years, Davidoff was responsible for security, log management, and later in 2014, developing the cloud strategy for CSU. “For the next three to four years, I developed the CSU cloud strategy and I believe the biggest selling point for leadership was, unlike networking, the Cloud was a new technology,” explains Davidoff. “Instead of several experts from Amazon Cloud and several Azure experts at CSU, I suggested creating a small team that focused on cloud technology and how to make it the most efficient and automated. Throughout my career, I’ve seen the value of collaboration, especially when making important decisions on how the campus is going to run and ensuring systems are as efficient as possible. From a long-term strategic standpoint, I am a believer in the wisdom of the group, rather than the wisdom of the individual. If everyone feels they have a voice, a successful outcome is more likely. This approach was aligned with my approach that we don’t give a campus a budget, we give them a solution.”</p>
<p>A day after Davidoff was set to retire in March 2020, CSU shut down its physical campuses due to the pandemic. “Leadership knew CSU must prepare for remote learning and I began doing a lot of research, along with forming a working group,” explains Davidoff. “We selected a small company to help us teach online in case we would need to offer remote classes. Part of the contract included free licenses for half a million students for up to ten years, as well as licenses for every faculty and staff member. We trained everyone on the software and ensured we could operate online. When the pandemic hit, CSU was the first university system in the U.S. without any downtime because our processes and strategies were ready to go.”</p>
<p>Bringing Insights to a New Role<br>
After retiring, Davidoff began thinking about where he could have an even larger impact on education and helping students. “It became clear that technology companies, especially in the networking domain, are a place where I could make my mark in creating efficient technology solutions,” shares Davidoff. “I learned of a new company, Nile, and I wanted to bring my knowledge and unique perspective of higher education infrastructure and my vast experience in over two hundred network deployments. I knew I could share how the customer thinks because I had been the customer for thirty years.”</p>

		<p>“The Edge team works hard to stay at the forefront of innovation in the marketplace. In the world of enterprise networking, Nile represents an entirely new approach that enables organizations to offload the often overwhelming complexities of network management while reaping the benefits of a financially predictable, highly adaptable, and supremely secure network environment. We’re proud to have Nile as a new awardee and partner in our fast-growing EdgeMarket co-op.”</p>

		<p>Joining Nile as the Chief Strategist of Education early last year, Davidoff aligns the company’s strategy with an educational lens to ensure all technology and services deliver a superior connectivity experience. “I love the thought leadership part of my role at Nile and writing papers about rethinking networking and higher education,” says Davidoff. “I talk to a lot of students and gather valuable insights about today’s learning expectations. Nile modernizes IT operations through the delivery of a new wired and wireless enterprise network and as a leader in enterprise Network as a Service (NaaS), it allows institutions to stabilize their budgets. From a financial perspective, you’re able to buy a service that assures capacity, availability, and performance. Organizations can plan how much money is needed every year, instead of seeing a huge spike in the budget five years from now to replace the network or to replace routing. Plus, most importantly, using Nile services helps free up staff to focus on other initiatives, like classroom technology or digital transformation.”</p>
<p>“Normally, if an institution purchases a technology solution from a vendor, that system is at max performance on day one,” continues Davidoff. “Six months later, your firewall is upgraded, your core router is not at current code, and you added ten new features. Your capacity and features are now starting to degrade. Without the time to take care of all the maintenance that needs to happen, your investment keeps losing value over time.”</p>
<p>Davidoff says many organizations are not sufficiently leveraging automation in order to efficiently run and maintain the network while creating complexity that no human can solve. “We need to eliminate complexity to enable innovation. If we keep this complexity in our environment, every time someone wants to innovate, we need to change all these features and configurations. Many vendors or wireless controllers have hundreds of different features and it’s difficult to develop best practices. We need a deterministic network and not a non-deterministic network in order to predict the performance.”</p>
<p>Partnering with Edge<br>
Recognizing the important role networking infrastructure plays in the evolution of IT, Edge recently released an RFP to prospective vendors who could provide a NaaS to member organizations. The goal was to provide Edge members with NaaS services that allow these institutions to focus on promoting capabilities and skills, while reducing costs, promoting efficiencies, and improving security. Davidoff led Nile’s response to the RFP and was recently awarded a master contract with Edge (CBTS was the other awardee). “The Edge team works hard to stay at the forefront of innovation in the marketplace,” says Dan Miller, Associate Vice President, EdgeMarket. “In the world of enterprise networking, Nile represents an entirely new approach that enables organizations to offload the often overwhelming complexities of network management while reaping the benefits of a financially predictable, highly adaptable, and supremely secure network environment. We’re proud to have Nile as a new awardee and partner in our fast-growing EdgeMarket co-op.”</p>
<p>Nile helps higher education institutions deliver an uninterrupted wired and wireless experience with a performance guarantee for coverage, availability, and capacity. “Nile can help free up capital and resources to focus on meeting the demands of modern education,” says Davidoff. “We want to help institutions deliver on their mission and provide the strategic value that leadership is looking to achieve. Nile aims to help organizations break free from the traditional constraints of legacy network infrastructures and use IT resources to strategically enhance learning in a digital era.”</p>

		<p>As education institutions and public sector organizations continue to navigate through the critical process of adapting their IT organizations for the digital age, many look for innovative ways to align team members and streamline processes to help advance these objectives. To create an effective strategy, Christopher Markham, Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer, Edge, says starting with a few basic questions can help frame the conversation in how to move forward. “An important question to begin with is how does your organization view information technology? Do you view IT more as an engineering operation or as a service operation? Leadership must also determine if IT is viewed as an art or science, because there are plenty of institutions where IT is expected to be the primary change agent or innovator, not just in the administrative side of the house, but in educational technologies.”</p>
<p>“Organizations should also explore their return on investment from IT, including technology assets and staff,” continues Markham. “Do you have a return on investment and a rate of return? In addition, leadership must explore if technology is informing the business process both on the administrative and academic side, or is technology being informed by those business processes.” Achieving alignment across an IT organization involves several core axioms, including:</p>
 
 Authority and accountability must match 
 Specialization and teamwork 
 Precise domains and clear boundaries 
 The basis of a substructure 
 Avoid conflicts of interest 
 Cluster by professional synergies 
 Business within a business 
 
<p>“The golden rule is that authority and accountability in an IT organization must match,” says Markham. “You want to define clear boundaries with no overlaps or gaps and divide a function into groups based upon its strengths. In addition, cluster groups under a common leader based on similar professions. Institutions must also view higher education and information technology as a business. Faculty, students, and staff are considered customers and every manager is an entrepreneur. An entrepreneur is anyone who brings together all the different pieces to ensure service delivery of IT and high-quality services and solutions.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“IT governance, funding and financial management, and enterprise data and data governance are among the top technology-related domains that impact digital transformation readiness.” </p>
<p>— Christopher Markham<br>
Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer, Edge</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Achieving Digital Transformation Readiness<br>
The first principle of aligning authority and accountability is of top importance and what Markham calls the golden rule in IT organizational design. “This alignment is essential to the success of every IT organization and institution that it is serving. In a particular case study, a CIO appointed a few process owners at the suggestion of process improvement consultants. Each was assigned a process that engaged people from various parts of the organization in producing a specific service. These process owners had authority over those processes, and while they were collaborative and involved stakeholders in designing and implementing the new processes, they were not process facilitators who served others by bringing teams to consensus on how they’ll work together. Process owners didn’t have matching accountability for their effectiveness of those processes and weren’t always the individuals accountable for delivering those services. They were accountable for the delivery of services, but they didn’t have the power to determine the processes they used to do their jobs.”</p>
<p>“If these service delivery groups failed, there was no way to know whether it was due to their own poor performance or due to a bad process,” continues Markham. “Nonetheless, they took the blame. Process owners implemented detailed, rigorous business processes and succeeded at their mission, but the organization became bureaucratic, slow, and inflexible as a result. This structure violated the golden rule. In re-envisioning and restructuring an IT organization, the CIO needs to decide the rules of the game and create the organizational ecosystem, including the group structure, the resource governance process, and the culture.”</p>
<p>Increasing the Pace of Innovation<br>
Once the right structure is in place, leaders can take the opportunity to adjust domains as needed, arbitrate any disputes, create a healthy environment for teamwork, and develop talent through recruiting, inspiring, and coaching efforts. “Leaders should manage performance including negotiating staff’s objectives, giving frequent feedback, measuring the results, deciding rewards, and managing performance problems,” says Markham. “CIOs can leverage performance programs and evaluations to restructure, reorganize and incentivize.&nbsp; They must also manage commitments and resources which includes assigning work within the group and coordinating shared decisions, like common methods and tools and professional practices. In addition, the CIO must make decisions when consensus cannot be reached.”</p>
<p>Markham shares another case study where the CIO in a large insurance company was tasked with addressing complaints from the business executives regarding the IT department’s opacity, unresponsiveness, and poor understanding of their business strategies. “The leadership in this organization was frustrated that they couldn’t control IT’s priorities and did not understand why many of the requests were not being fulfilled. There was a trend toward decentralization and many business units had started their own small IT groups, which the CIO disparagingly called Shadow IT. These groups only existed because business units did not want to do business with corporate IT. In response, the CIO dedicated a group to each business unit and divided his engineering staff among them. Each group was relatively self-sufficient with all the skills needed to deliver.”</p>
<p>“The senior managers also served as the primary liaisons to those business units,” continues Markham. “The CIO felt this structure would appease the business units and stave off further decentralization, while holding senior managers accountable for business results and client satisfaction. Unfortunately, technical specialists were needed throughout the organization, and since technology subspeciality was scattered among the various client-dedicated groups, this limited their professional exchange. When the sales team, for example, ran into technical challenges, they may not have known that someone in another group already had encountered that issue and knew a solution. Their peers were busy with other priorities, costs rose, and response time slowed, and everyone was reinventing solutions to common problems. Meanwhile, there was little impetus for standards, and individual teams built systems that were optimal for their specific clients, not for the enterprise as a whole.”</p>
<p>Markham continues, “The pace of innovation also slowed, and the organization could not hire an expert in an emerging technology until demand grew across the whole enterprise. As a result, business opportunities to build customer loyalty were missed and the impacts extended beyond IT’s performance. Over time, the structure led to multiple general ledger systems and multiple records for the same customer. Synergies were lost as the company lost a single view of its customers, resources, and suppliers.”</p>
<p>Including productivity specialists can bring efficiency to an IT organization which can translate into cost savings for return on investment. “Specialists have ready answers and don’t have to climb the learning curve with each new challenge,” says Markham. “Quality specialists know the latest methods and technologies in their field and understand how their products are more capable and have lower lifecycle costs. Competence and experience deliver results with fewer risks. Innovation specialists can keep up with the literature and be the first to learn about emerging technologies and techniques.&nbsp; As a result, the pace of innovation improves. Since they are confident in their abilities, specialists experience less stress, are more productive, and are more likely to excel in their career.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>&nbsp;“An important question to begin with is how does your organization view information technology? Do you view IT more as an engineering operation or as a service operation? Leadership must also determine if IT is viewed as an art or science, because there are plenty of institutions where IT is expected to be the primary change agent or innovator, not just in the administrative side of the house, but in educational technologies.”</p>

		<p>Driving Organizational Change<br>
Creating an IT strategy that optimizes processes and technology and fosters a culture of innovation includes several domains of enterprise architecture. “IT governance, funding and financial management, and enterprise data and data governance are among the top technology-related domains that impact digital transformation readiness,” says Markham. “Each of these domains represent specializations of the IT reference disciplines or olive branches from those IT reference disciplines, and the business architecture is an olive branch with each of the functional offices in both administration and academics. But without labeling these domains properly as a CIO, it’s very difficult to reorganize, restructure, or re-envision your organization. The cost of overlapping these domains and clustering by professional synergies is reduced specialization, redundant efforts, confusion, product disintegration, less innovation and teamwork, and lack of entrepreneurship.”</p>
<p>Edge’s E360 assessment is designed to provide a holistic, 360-degree view of an institution’s current-state technology program with a focus on the technology-related domains. Taking a diagnostic and prescriptive approach to evaluating the technology organization, Edge looks at four key areas. “We first identify any unreliable processes and if there is reduced specialization as a result of these gaps,” explains Markham. “We also look if that reduced specialization leads to conflicts of interest. The E360 assessment also focuses on the professional exchange between the domains, if there are domain overlaps, the level of coordination, and whether it is a whole business. Lastly, we explore the substructure and the results of reduced specialization, domain overlaps, and inappropriate biases. E360 produces a final report that not only includes outcomes and analysis, but a three-year roadmap for an IT organization to drive organizational change, improve their technology landscape, and achieve digital transformation goals successfully.”</p>

		<p>In an age where data collection and analysis continue to grow in importance in nearly every industry, many organizations seek innovative and affordable ways to store data and expand their networking capabilities. In the education community, not every institution is equipped with a large IT infrastructure or the space to host servers, networking equipment, and data storage. To help address this need, Edge offers affordable colocation services where member institutions can receive data center support and colocation space for disaster recovery and business continuity. “Colleges and universities have always had the responsibility to design, build, and run data centers on college campuses,” says Bruce Tyrrell, Associate Vice President Programs &amp; Services, Edge. “Unfortunately, the physical infrastructure, including commercial power, backup generators, and environmental services are extremely expensive and complex to deploy, especially in a typical college campus environment that was not designed for these requirements. Our colocation services are an enhancement of our members’ existing connectivity to the Edge network. By leveraging their existing last mile connections, members have the ability to place hardware at one of several locations around the region.”</p>
<p>With Edge maintaining high availability colocation data centers throughout the Northeast region, several members are choosing to exit the owned data center space and move their hardware to an off-campus location. “Many institutions are relocating hardware to a purpose-built facility that has been professionally engineered and constructed with the desired features,” says Tyrrell. “Access to these features is included in the monthly recurring costs for space outsourcing and using a colocation provider can help reduce the need for additional staff to handle the physical management of those environments.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Benefits of Colocation<br>
From their optical network, Edge can build connections for members from their campuses directly into the colocation facilities. “Member institutions can choose to place hardware infrastructure at the enterprise grade colocation facility on the campus of Montclair State University at a significant discount over commercial space,” explains Tyrrell. “Colocation is available along our optical network and provides access to 165 Halsey Street in Newark, New Jersey Fiber Exchange (NJFX), which is in Wall Township adjacent to the Tata international cable landing station, and at 401 N Broad Street in Philadelphia. Members can also access the Digital Realty colocation at 32 Avenue, the Americas in Manhattan. Edge is expanding our colocation capability by adding the colocation facility at Data Bank in Piscataway, New Jersey, a bespoke water-cooled facility designed with High Performance Computing in mind.”</p>
<p>Colocation data centers allow members to store their equipment in a secure location with a public IP address, bandwidth, and power availability. These locations also include backup power in the event of an outage. “An organization can use Edge colocation services to extend their internal infrastructure into a professional collocation space from an end user point of view,” says Tyrrell. “The Edge model is unique in that the bandwidth provided to our members is not shared with any other organization, and since this extension is transparent, students, faculty, and staff do not realize their data is traveling off campus and out to a data center and back—the data transfer only takes microseconds.”</p>
<p>With Edge as the provider of the bandwidth, both internally connected to the campus, as well as externally via their internet connections, these connections are designed to scale and burst. “Unlike a cloud environment, where there is an increased cost for bursting when an organization’s computing resources reach their max, a colocation environment offers costs that are fixed,” explains Tyrrell. “An organization rents a cabinet and purchases hardware to store in this cabinet. Edge fixes the cost of transport and internet capacity which can allow for greater budget predictability. This is different from the Cloud, where once an application is placed in the Cloud, upticks in utilization for those apps can have a direct impact on the monthly expense to operate those services. For some institutions, having a fixed monthly budget for colocation services is easier to operationalize from a financial perspective.”</p>

		<p>Onboarding and Support<br>
When an institution selects colocation services, Edge’s engineers help walk the member’s IT team through the ins and outs of the processes and can accompany them to colocation facilities to familiarize them with the data centers. “Edge acquires the space, coordinates the connectivity, and assists in providing remote and physically secured access to the cabinets or gauges,” says Tyrrell. “We also handle all the administrative pieces like billing and passing along clean invoices to the member. Since colocation facilities can often be complex and intimidating, Edge can visit the facilities with you during the onboarding process.”</p>
<p>“Colocation is a unique environment that can be complex from both an operational and an acquisition perspective,” continues Tyrrell. “Edge has decades of experience in operating these environments and we stand ready to assist our members with transitioning hardware and application into these professionally maintained tier three colocation facilities. Once the transition has been made, members are better positioned to weather the storms and unforeseen outage conditions that have been known to impact on campus data centers. This resilient infrastructure can provide peace of mind and a cost-friendly way to optimize resources and meet the growing demands of today’s higher education community.”</p>

		<p>With the age of artificial intelligence (AI) well underway, how we work, learn, and conduct business continues to transform and open the door to new opportunities. In the classroom, AI can be a powerful teaching tool and support innovative and interactive learning techniques and critical thinking. Dr. C. Edward Watson, Associate Vice President for Curricular and Pedagogical Innovation with the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U) and formerly Director of the Center for Teaching and Learning at the University of Georgia, explores how AI is revolutionizing the future of learning and how educators can adapt to this new era of human thinking in his new book, Teaching with AI: A Practical Guide to a New Era of Human Learning (Johns Hopkins University Press).</p>
<p>“AI is a significant game changer and is presenting a new challenge that is going to be dramatically different from past disruptive innovations,” says Watson. “Goldman Sachs and other sources estimate that two-thirds of U.S. occupations will be impacted by AI.1 With a vastly accelerating expectation within the workforce that new graduates will be able to leverage AI for work, there is a growing pressure on institutions of higher education to ensure students become well-versed in AI techniques. This new learning outcome for higher education is being termed AI literacy.”</p>
<p>AI is also introducing a new academic integrity challenge including how to accurately determine if students are using AI to complete assignments. Along with Teaching with AI co-author, José Antonio Bowen, Watson explores crucial questions related to academic integrity, cheating, and other emerging issues in AI-powered education. “The real focus of the book is how to create assignments and practices that increase the probability that students will engage with the work rather than turn to AI, as well as ways to partner with AI and use these tools in meaningful and impactful ways. Instead of fearing AI and how students may misuse it, the education community must employ logical pedagogical practices within the classroom that encourage our students to become competent partners with AI, including building AI literacy skills that will help them on their future career paths.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“I look forward to discussing the higher education landscape at EdgeCon and exploring suggestions for how we might move forward. We need to acknowledge that AI is going to be an important thread in the education and research industries. Disruption is not always a bad thing, especially in the workforce. AI can help improve efficiencies, reduce costs, increase productivity, and create new job opportunities. In the higher education setting, these tools have the potential to offer personalized learning experiences, strengthen retention, and resolve accessibility issues. Along with the potential challenges this type of technology may introduce, we must also look at the positive opportunities that will arise and how we can better prepare our students for the world that is already waiting for them.”</p>

		<p>AI in the Classroom and Beyond<br>
With over twenty-five years of experience in faculty and instructional development, Watson is nationally recognized for his expertise in general education, active learning, classroom practice, course design, faculty development, student learning, and learning outcomes assessment. “I believe in the transformative opportunities that higher education can provide individuals, especially first-generation students like myself,” shares Watson. “When I entered a master’s program in English, I became increasingly interested in the puzzle of how learning works. I wanted to better understand how to make learning more meaningful for students, how to engage them, and how to ensure what I’m teaching is not just memorized for an exam, but will be remembered and utilized long after the course is completed. As I advanced in my career, I was able to take what I learned helping students in my own classroom to provide programming and opportunities that could benefit the breadth of higher education.”</p>
<p>Even though change can be slow within the education community, Watson says the dramatic, fast shifts happening in the industry are causing many institutions to take notice. “Unfortunately, as higher education begins to adapt, AI is creating new digital inequities. Many institutions are struggling to determine how to best serve their students given the new challenges and opportunities. Institutions will need leaders who continue to explore how advancements like AI are changing their world and the ways in which they can harness and manage AI as a powerful teaching tool.”</p>
<p>“To begin to understand AI and its capabilities, I recommend that faculty copy and paste a current assignment into two or three different AI tools to better understand the opportunities, restrictions, and surprises. This can provide insight into ways to improve the assignment and to make it better aligned with the way students might be expected to complete similar work in the real-world post graduation. I think going forward, we will see AI more deeply integrated within systems we already depend upon. For instance, within learning management systems (LMS), it’s foreseeable that when tudents submit assignments, the AI-assisted LMS will check for AI, plagiarism, and may even grade and provide customized feedback using a faculty designed rubric.”</p>
<p>From a teaching perspective, AI can also be beneficial in helping instructors create rubrics and improve the quality of their course syllabus and assignments. “I hope more faculty look at AI as a toolbox, rather than something to fear,” says Watson. “Teachers are still the experts in their field, and AI can help them elevate their courses and find new ways to improve the learning experience. AI is not a search engine; it is more like a knowledgeable colleague. Using it is more about prompt engineering and having a conversation that fine tunes the results. Faculty should see AI as an idea generator that could be leveraged and helpful with many aspects of the classroom and beyond.”</p>
<p>ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022, is a common AI tool used to automate tasks, compose essays and emails, and have human-like conversations. According to a recent survey conducted by Study.com, 89 percent of students over the age of 18 have used ChatGPT to help with homework, while 48 percent confessed they had used it to complete an at-home test or quiz.2 “While many students are familiar with AI tools like ChatGPT, not all educators are aware of its prevalence, causing a disconnect,” says Watson. “Showing faculty how this tool can be useful is key and encouraging them to have open and honest conversations with students about how AI can be used as a tool of learning, rather than a way to cheat on their schoolwork is now an essential early-in-the-semester conversation. Instead of approaching AI with how it is breaking your pedagogy, consider how AI is relevant for what you would like to accomplish in preparing your students for the future.”</p>

		<p>Adapting Higher Education in a New Era<br>
With a theme of Excelling in a Digital Teaching and Learning Future, EdgeCon Spring 2024 will welcome Dr. Watson as a keynote speaker to explore how higher education is evolving and ways to overcome the challenges the industry is facing. “A recent Gallup survey shows a steep decline in how higher education is perceived in this country3,” says Watson. “Less than half of Americans have confidence in higher education. All of us within our industry should consider how we can positively impact this national perception of higher education as there are ramifications. Not preparing students for what will certainly be an AI-enhanced career or recklessly using AI detection tools in ways that might unjustly accuse significant numbers of students of cheating can be significantly dangerous for higher education. Combining such practices with the ongoing student debt crisis and a politically polarized higher education dynamic, and more and more students will question if higher education is still as important as it once was. Already many ask if higher education is still a cornerstone of the American Dream.”</p>
<p>“I look forward to discussing the higher education landscape at EdgeCon and exploring suggestions for how we might move forward,” continues Watson. “We need to acknowledge that AI is going to be an important thread in the education and research industries. Disruption is not always a bad thing, especially in the workforce. AI can help improve efficiencies, reduce costs, increase productivity, and create new job opportunities. In the higher education setting, these tools have the potential to offer personalized learning experiences, strengthen retention, and resolve accessibility issues.

		<p>Creating and sustaining quality online learning experiences has become a top priority across the higher education community and plays a key role in the appeal and competitiveness of an institution. As these online programs are developed and implemented, quality assurance frameworks and processes are essential to ensuring that these programs meet rigorous standards and continue to align with learning objectives. “Having standards that everyone from across an institution has to meet is of paramount importance in higher education,” says Joshua Gaul, Associate Vice President &amp; Chief Digital Learning Officer. “The lack of standards in today’s higher education system is a top reason for the drop in retention and enrollment, especially among community colleges and small private schools. Every organization should ensure their course offerings and entire digital presence meet quality industry standards, including ADA compliance.”</p>
<p>Using Rubrics to Assess Course Quality<br>
To help ensure learners are engaging with high-quality courses, Quality Matters (QM) is among the most well-known programs for creating a scalable process for quality assurance. “QM is a global organization leading quality assurance in online and digital teaching and learning and is used to impact the quality of teaching and learning at a state and national level,” says Gaul. “QM has eight general standards and 42 total standards. More than 1,500 colleges and universities have joined the Quality Matters community and they’ve certified thousands of online and hybrid courses, as well as trained over 60,000 education professionals, including myself, on online course design standards.”</p>
<p>The SUNY Online Course Quality Review Rubric (OSCQR) is another well-respected online design rubric, used and developed by SUNY Online, in collaboration with campuses through the SUNY system. “With six general standards and 50 total standards, the QSCQR is openly licensed for anyone to use and adopt and aims to support continuous improvements and quality accessibility in online courses,” explains Gaul. “The rubric and the online course review and refresh process support large scale online course design efforts systematically and consistently. The goal is to ensure that all online courses meet a quality instructional design and accessibility standard, and are regularly and systematically reviewed, refreshed, and improved to reflect campus guidelines and research based online effective practices.”</p>
<p>“In addition to QM and OSCQR, there are many other rubrics being used to systematically check courses against,” continues Gaul. “No matter which rubric you are using, it’s important to have accountability and a knowledge sharing process about these standards across the entire institution.”</p>
<p>Implementing an Evaluation Cycle<br>
Regardless of the program being used to conduct online course quality review, developing an evaluation cycle is essential to ensuring courses are meeting key standards. “The first step in implementing an evaluation cycle is gathering data and understanding the trends of your organization,” says Gaul. “What is the enrollment frequency, what courses have high enrollment, how many students fail or drop out? In classes that have very low enrollment or high drop rates, what are their barriers to success? Institutions should review the disciplines and courses with the highest enrollment and which courses should be evaluated and revised on a more frequent basis. Looking at the data closely can provide valuable insight into the effectiveness and quality of each online course.”</p>
<p>In between offerings, institutions should take stock of online courses as a whole and reflect on ways to enhance course content, engagement, and student outcomes. During this assessment, important questions to ask include:</p>
 
 Does the course learning environment welcome and include all students? 
 Is engagement encouraging? 
 Are there opportunities for self-reflection and discussion? 
 Do activities provide opportunities for realistic, relevant, and meaningful application of knowledge? 
 Are students achieving the goals of the course? 
 Is the workload reasonable for both students and the instructor? 
 
<p>By adopting a mission to review and update all courses to ensure the highest quality content and experience, that promise can go a long way in improving the brand of an institution and creating a student centric learning environment that attracts positive attention. To successfully create an evaluation cycle, Gaul says each institution needs a defined project management process. “Each organization should map out a review process that defines individual roles and responsibilities. This should involve instructional designers, librarians, IT services, student support, and academic support. This process should not fall solely on the instructor. If you think of it like building a house, the faculty member is the homeowner, the instructional designer is the general contractor, and IT is your plumbing and electrical. Every person needs to be involved in the planning from day one to ensure a successful build.”</p>
<p>Building a Course Assessment System<br>
Any time an institution begins assessing courses, whether it’s from a system level or individual course level, there are often barriers to overcome. “When technology is involved in instruction, there should be a collaborative effort to identify and overcome any hurdles,” says Gaul. “Technology should never lead the academia; the teaching should lead the technology. We must remember that all students are cognitively different, and this is why Universal Design for Learning (UDL) leans towards accessibility and flexibility and removing barriers to learning. These barriers can include inadequate support, where students do not know where to go for help, whether that’s technical, tutoring, writing style, etc. Access to support must be built into the course in order for students to feel supported and demonstrate emotional intelligence within the class.”</p>
<p>Other common barriers include a lack of a learning community and boredom. Without students feeling connected to the instructor and other classmates, they can become isolated, and without interesting content and delivery, students can feel disengaged. “System barriers we regularly see in regards to course assessments involve implementation,” says Gaul. “Lack of commitment, poor preparation, and inconsistency can all affect the success of a course assessment. Unless there’s some sort of checks and balances, courses are going to be inconsistent, and students are going to have difficulty moving seamlessly between classes if they’re taking more than one online course. The purpose of building a course assessment system is to free up faculty and give them the proper support they need to be successful.”</p>

		<p>Instructional Design Support<br>
Designing and managing online courses can be a challenging task, especially without the resources and training to do so effectively. Well-versed in instructional design, the Edge team understands digitally-enabled learning environments and how to evaluate online courses against standard industry rubrics. “Edge understands the methodologies, rubrics, and standards that go into the creation of a high quality curriculum,” says Gaul. “We have worked with colleges and universities to conduct evaluations and identify trends we see in their courses. We can also build workshops to help train faculty and students and improve their understanding of why online instruction is different from traditional classroom learning. Specifically, we help prepare staff and students for the challenge of online education through engaging student-centered experiences built to encourage online presence and encouraging active learning methodologies.”</p>
<p>Edge’s course and curriculum evaluation services are designed to help an institution deliver a top-quality product. “Whether a course is fully online, hybrid, HyFlex, or in-person, we can help make sure it meets all the standards of quality technology enhanced instruction,” says Gaul. “This can provide a level of risk management and quality control that can often get ignored when there’s too much focus on the tools, system recruitment, and retention. Member institutions can also count on web and educational technology support. Edge provides technology and web support service management frameworks and ticketing systems to help with website maintenance and web content management. Most importantly, we can help provide thought leadership in how to implement a systemwide course assessment and revision cycle.”</p>
<p>“Our team of experts can help an organization bridge the gap between technology and academia and lead a collaborative effort as opposed to two silos working in competition,” continues Gaul. “We can customize for smaller niche projects, support larger, longer-term initiatives, or become an extension of your team. Edge can provide documentation used in the project and whatever we produce will be owned by the institution, whether it’s a learning object or a series of training modules.”</p>
<p>Gaul says if online courses are not being reviewed and revised regularly, those learning experiences will not make an impact. “Revision cycles that are high quality, trust the data, and have accountability and responsibility are incredibly important to ensuring course content is engaging and impactful. Every institution should look at how their offices work together to create a course evaluation and revision cycle that is beneficial and supportive to the student. As you look for ways to improve your institution, Edge wants to help you transform your instruction, advance your online education, and find powerful ways to improve the way you do business.”</p>

		<p>As the wave of digital transformation continues to change and shape higher education, the demand for highly-skilled talent who understands instructional design is growing too. Especially over the last couple of years when online learning skyrocketed, institutions had to quicken their pace in offering remote classes, while also creating new online courses, programs, and degrees as we entered a modern era of learning. Instructional designers or learning designers have become essential members of an organization, but not only are they difficult to find, many with these credentials do not pursue roles in higher education. And for those who do work at colleges and universities, the increasing pressure to be experts in a multi-faceted profession where institutions are investing in technology at an astounding rate is causing many instructional designers to experience workplace burnout.</p>
<p>Many instructional designers find themselves responsible for designing courses, building learning materials, coding, project management, and ensuring the effective delivery of instructional materials and experiences. With such a high bar, it can be challenging for these individuals to keep up. “Many institutions look at their instructional designers as workhorses,” says Joshua Gaul, Associate Vice President &amp; Chief Digital Learning Officer, Edge. “Oftentimes, faculty members bring the content to the instructional designer and they then organize the content and build the course from a technical standpoint.”</p>
<p>“The biggest benefit of instructional design is not just knowing how to use the learning management system (LMS) or how to repurpose your content and put a discussion board together,” continues Gaul. “These experts work with faculty and leadership to bounce off ideas and integrate learning theory and pedagogy. Instead of shouldering faculty members with learning design on top of teaching and working to elevate the curriculum, instructional designers can help lighten this load and bring an expert perspective that can be hugely valuable to an institution.”</p>

		<p>Quality Assurance in Online Learning<br>
The approach to instructional design and how the field is regarded varies across the higher education community, and even between departments within an organization. “Institutions view instructional designers differently and it’s often tied to their current digital learning path,” shares Gaul. “The schools that were already forward thinking during the pandemic, didn’t have as large a shift in their business processes. The organizations seeing the most change in these processes are the ones who embraced the change but had to adjust on the fly. For the schools that do have instructional designers on staff, there is not always a unified approach to instructional design. The school of biology has different looking courses than the school of journalism, for example, but there need to be instructional design standards to ensure quality and compliance and can offer a clear model for all courses to follow.”</p>
<p>“Rubrics like QSCQR and Quality Matters (QM) establish an instructional design support framework,” continues Gaul. “Some organizations fear a centralized online learning approach will make courses too uniform, when in actuality, standardization gives faculty more academic freedom to customize their courses without worrying about accessibility. For instance, think about a textbook. Each has a table of contents, an index, and is broken into chapters. While the subject matter may be vastly different, it still follows this basic format and when a student opens the book, they know how to use it to get the information that they need.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Aligning Business Goals with Instructional Design<br>
Instructional design not only encompasses online learning, but extends to in-person instruction and hybrid learning as well. Many in this profession report long hours, lack of support, tight deadlines, and unrealistic expectations, all of which can lead to frustration and fatigue. “Some smaller institutions have a centralized instructional design office, but it’s often poorly staffed and leans more toward instructional technology training,” says Gaul. “This team will train faculty on how to use the LMS or the educational technology tools.”</p>
<p>Gaul continues, “Not every organization is going to have the budget to employ an instructional designer, especially someone who has an advanced education and necessary skill set. This is where Edge can be of value and offer instructional design support. With a team of over twenty seasoned instructional designers, we have consultants across the country, all with at least a master’s degree and several years of experience. Our instructional designers will work with an organization’s subject matter experts to analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate instructional materials and programs for an institution.”</p>
<p>As a longtime partner of Edge, Rowan University has a full team of instructional designers, but wanted to free them up to focus on faculty support and taking learning to the next level. “Rowan was able to move the course development and term to term updates to Edge and give their instructional design team the ability to work more closely with faculty members to elevate their courses and create more engaging, student centric content that meets quality standards. However, we understand many schools do not have the budget for a large instructional design team and that is why EdgeLearn can be a valuable solution for institutions. Edge can provide the expert support, strategy, and tools needed to enhance teaching, learning, and student engagement, without breaking the bank.”</p>
<p>One of the most important factors in successfully implementing digital learning programs and systems is ensuring business processes and goals align with instructional design initiatives. “Technology doesn’t drive the mission, but the technology can be informed by and follow the academic mission of the institution,” says Gaul. “As long as you have the right tools in place and the people who understand those tools and processes, you can accomplish amazing things with a small group of instructional designers. Edge can supplement an institution’s existing team or provide expert assistance in developing student-focused curriculum.”</p>
<p>“Edge can come in and hit the ground running because our team knows every tool,” continues Gaul. “We understand how to use data to glean important insights about an organization’s instructional design or ways artificial intelligence (AI) can open doors to new opportunities for digital learning. No matter what LMS an institution is using, or what rubric they follow, we can offer the specialized support needed to help fill any gaps and create superior teaching and learning experiences—anytime, anywhere.”</p>

		<p>With a longtime love of reading since young adulthood, Ann D. Hoang began working in a library as a student employee at Rutgers University. Her experience there helped direct her career path and she knew right away that she wanted to stay in academia and academic librarianship. “Being able to meet other students and having the ability to work with faculty and support students was very fulfilling,” says Hoang, University Librarian at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT); Chair, VALE Executive Committee. “My first full-time job was at Rutgers as a Reference &amp; Materials Delivery Coordinator. This role was within the IT department and gave me the opportunity to learn more about computing. This included using the iMac when it was first released and loading CD-ROMs onto servers. I realized I could combine my love of reading and supporting students and faculty with an interest in expanding my knowledge of technology.”</p>
<p>Gaining valuable experience in project management, Hoang quickly moved up the ranks, and in 2006, was recruited by NJIT to join their team as the Assistant University Librarian. In this role she served as the chief information officer for library technology overseeing administrative, library information technology, and collections services. “During the eleven years in this position, I was able to further hone my project management capabilities and technology knowledge,” shares Hoang. “When the head of the library position opened at NJIT, I applied and following a rigorous nationwide search, was awarded the position, and I’ve now been in this role for seven years. Even though I’m in a strategic leadership position, I still love meeting with students and helping them find the resources they need.”</p>
<p>Navigating the road to her current role at NJIT wasn’t easy. Reflecting back on her early, formative years, Hoang describes, “My family left Vietnam in 1978 as political refugees. We had to flee the country by boat. We were known as the “Boat People” because of how we left Vietnam. After many months of wandering the ocean, we finally arrived in Hong Kong. We spent two years in refugee camps waiting to settle in the United States. We arrived in New Jersey on a cold September evening in 1980 without speaking English.” She continues, “I remember it was so dark, thinking about how I would live here when everything was big and dark. Reading kept me focused while learning English. I spent many hours and days in ESL (English as a second language) classes. It took several years to understand the language with support from teachers and students of similar backgrounds. This part of my life helped me appreciate why engaging and supporting students is essential.”</p>
<p>“Many times, students are writing research papers and need to choose the right keywords to use when searching for resources,” continues Hoang. “I like being able to break down the process and instruct them on the steps needed to find information, as well as explain the difference between peer review content and block quotes off the Web. My team continually gathers feedback on how we can better support students and faculty. A large part of this is providing off-campus access to resources, anytime, anywhere. The library has evolved far past a quiet space full of books; the underlying infrastructure is now about technology and facilitating seamless access to much-needed content.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Professional development will give library staff new skill sets and make sure we’re on par with understanding our faculty’s needs and how to integrate technology successfully. This includes using certain tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality and how to provide data management services. To support students, we also have an opportunity to partner with faculty to develop freely available content that is implemented within their curriculum. Since textbooks are often not affordable for many students, this solution could give free access to materials and help students be more successful in their coursework.”</p>

		<p>The New Age of Academic Libraries<br>
In the past, traditional libraries focused on collecting physical print items, but as we entered the digital age, open access to resources became paramount. “The biggest challenge for us is providing instant access to our collection,” explains Hoang. “The only way to address this need is converting print to electronic, which is very time-consuming. And while vendors have designed a way to create digitally native content, this service can be costly. We can create a vicious cycle where faculty write grants to conduct research and pay to publish the research, followed by the libraries paying to acquire access to that research. We end up double or triple paying for the same content. To remain valuable to the institution, we must determine how to continuously provide access to that digital collection, including special collections.”</p>
<p>Digitizing a library’s special collections is necessary, but a labor-intensive process. “Much of the older content is not available digitally and we must determine how content that was created in the 1700s and 1800s, for example, can be converted into a primary source for users to access digitally,” says Hoang. “This is an important challenge and institutions need staff with the technical skills to complete these tasks, along with the technology infrastructure. Partnering with our IT department is crucial to understanding our limitations and ensuring our content is protected behind the firewall, so our institution’s network is not compromised. Libraries are being tasked with understanding technology and how to use these tools to facilitate and simplify our work.”</p>
<p>In addition to harnessing technology in useful ways, many libraries also seek to gain insights about their users and how their resources are being used. “Traditionally, libraries do not collect data, but it would be helpful to understand who is using each resource, and particularly, the number of students and faculty,” says Hoang. “This information could help determine if the resource is worth being part of our collection. We must learn how to collect data, as well as helping our faculty collect that data as they conduct their research and build large data sets. Additionally, we must determine how the faculty can collect, store, and share their data set. The library is in a perfect position to develop a data management service to help our faculty follow best practices for storing data and putting it in a format that allows other researchers to access it easily.”</p>
<p>For library staff to support data management, training will be an important part of achieving this goal. “Professional development will give library staff new skill sets and make sure we’re on par with understanding our faculty’s needs and how to integrate technology successfully,” explains Hoang. “This includes using certain tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality and how to provide data management services. To support students, we also have an opportunity to partner with faculty to develop freely available content that is implemented within their curriculum. Since textbooks are often not affordable for many students, this solution could give free access to materials and help students be more successful in their coursework.”</p>

		<p>Expanding Information Literacy<br>
As AI continues to transform the higher education landscape, the use of generative AI tools is on the rise. According to Inside Higher Education, 9 percent of faculty members had used AI writing tools in the spring of 2023, but that rate had risen to 22 percent by the fall. The adoption rate was even higher among students, where the rate jumped from 27 percent in the spring to 49 percent in the fall.1 “The emergence of AI presents both challenges and opportunities,” says Hoang. “Using AI positively can lead to many innovations, however using it negatively can be a detriment to society, so educating students and faculty on the ethical use of AI will be essential. We also need to explore how AI can enhance our data collecting and decision making. This technology can help us synthesize large sets of data and augment the decision-making process; allowing us to solve problems more creatively.”</p>
<p>“Navigating the ethical issues surrounding AI is critical and we must ease the fear that robots are going to take over our jobs,” continues Hoang. “Because in theory, if we use AI properly, this technology can help us synthesize information and increase our skills, allowing us to be one step ahead of the AI tool. Therefore, we become a valuable component of our institutions and can use advanced tools to make informed decisions. We must continue to expand our knowledge of AI and its capabilities to not only be prepared to seize important opportunities, but also to identify solutions that can combat the misuse of this technology.”</p>
<p>To introduce students to available AI tools, librarians at NJIT have regular information sessions and conduct demonstrations to show how AI can answer different questions. “We will compare the information provided by AI to the information we look up manually,” explains Hoang. “Sometimes AI can give the wrong answer, so if we just accept that information, we could potentially create something that is false or a societal detriment. Students must understand how to validate information and avoid plagiarizing someone else’s work. The library’s role is to educate students on the use of AI, while also helping them stay versed in finding information manually, using the search engine, and using our subscription to library resources to find what they need. We want to help them understand how to find the government regulations and rules set forth by an institution surrounding AI and ways to avoid violation of regulatory guidelines.”</p>
<p>A key part of the librarian’s role is helping expand students’ information literacy and their ability to locate and evaluate specific information. “The need for information literacy has exploded with the use of AI,” says Hoang. “Librarians must continue to be at the forefront of changing trends and technologies to teach students the correct way to look up information and verify that the information is accurate before continuing. That component seems to be the missing link with the newer generations because many students feel the Internet is the ultimate resource. Our faculty members partner with librarians and allow us to share this knowledge in the classroom and explain the rationale behind verifying information.”</p>
<p>Supporting Faculty Research<br>
Research continues to be a top priority in NJIT’s strategic plan. In 2022, the institution was reaffirmed as an elite research university and retained its R1 status by Carnegie Classification. “Our faculty is committed to expanding our research initiatives and pursuing grant funding to drive further innovation and discovery,” says Hoang. “To help in this endeavor, the library must ensure we have the infrastructure to support the research output of our faculty. As more research is conducted, the higher the need to store and preserve data. I am currently recruiting an open access and scholarly communications librarian with the skills to support open access and data management services. I also look to expand our team with individuals who have computer science technology, data science, and information technology backgrounds and can support our faculty in their research projects.”</p>
<p>“With librarians involved in supporting faculty research, we can help ensure information is documented properly and they are compliant with copyright laws,” continues Hoang. “We also can help identify possible collaborative partnerships and conduct background research on which journals would be the best match for publishing their work. We can identify which authors have the highest rating or citation impact on their research and connect our faculty with other institutions on a national and global scale. The library is poised to provide valuable insight into how our faculty can expand the reach of their research and find collaborators around the world.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				    
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Facilitating Collaboration<br>
The Virtual Academic Library Environment (VALE) is a consortium of fifty New Jersey college and university libraries, the New Jersey State Library, and LibraryLinkNJ (LLNJ). “The primary focus of VALE is offering a cooperative purchasing agent, similar to EdgeMarket,” says Hoang. “They negotiate a licensing contract with different vendors so libraries can purchase through the consortium without having to negotiate back and forth with the vendor. I was on VALE’s website committee early in my career to help develop websites that provided researchers with easy access to necessary resources, both virtually and in person.”</p>
<p>Currently serving as VALE Chair, Hoang and the Executive Committee discuss recommendations for purchasing databases, hardware, and software, and how libraries can meet the evolving needs of the academic community. “We are currently exploring how we can continue to integrate technology tools and ensure our librarians are equipped with necessary skills,” shares Hoang. “The Committee is looking at digital transformation, open access, publications, scholarships, and how we can house special collections that can be shared across academic institutions in New Jersey. We are exploring how we can work collectively to create a centralized, statewide repository that houses this content and can be accessed free of cost, anytime, anywhere.”</p>
<p>VALE hosts a conference on the first Friday of January to bring academic librarians from throughout the region together to discuss current topics, technology, and strategies for supporting student success. Along with John Kromer, Matthew Brown, Jill Lagerstrom, and Lisa Weissbard, the NJIT Librarians presented at a breakout session at VALE’s 2024 New Jersey Academic Libraries Conference on January 5, 2024. Entitled, Open Textbook Publishing from Conception through Completion: A Proof-of Concept, this session explored their multi-year journey of publishing their first open textbook, An Animated Introduction to Digital Logic Design, by NJIT professor John Carpinelli. They shared details about securing and apportioning funding, collaborating with a faculty author, compiling and editing the book, determining requisite technology, publishing in an open repository, tracking usage, and the plans for the future.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
	 
		                    
		  
	  
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Events like VALE’s annual conference provide valuable networking opportunities and a chance for librarians and the VALE team to prepare for their presentations at national and international conferences. “The VALE conference acts as a starting point or test where and presenters are able to gather feedback on how to improve their presentations and be better prepared for a wider audience,” says Hoang. “Through our partnership with Edge, we are now soliciting sponsorships to supplement the conference to help us continue to provide the event to librarians free of charge.”</p>
<p>A Vision for the Future<br>
As we look toward the future of libraries, Hoang says the biggest challenge will be to keep pace with advanced technology like AI. “We’re just starting to scratch the surface of understanding the impact AI will have on our day-to-day lives. If we fail to keep up with learning more about these technologies and developing programming around AI, we risk missing out on key opportunities. We must also embrace digital transformation and determine how to provide seamless access to resources; otherwise, we lose our value, and our students and faculty will turn to someone else for that information. In addition, libraries need collaborative flexible spaces for our students to learn and we must find innovative ways to support different learning styles, whether that is quiet study or spaces for louder, more active collaboration.”</p>
<p>“Libraries play a vital role in enhancing students’ learning capabilities and will need to provide interactive technologies and tools that students can use to apply what they learn in the classroom,” continues Hoang. “All these goals require thoughtful planning, strategic thinking, network infrastructure, and professional development. The library is integral to institutional success and we must raise awareness about its importance. Traditionally, librarian positions are greatly underpaid. Yet in today’s world, these individuals are expected to have advanced education and skills equal to someone in IT or computer science. I feel that by contributing to VALE, I am supporting my profession and community and helping my institution excel in the 21st century.”</p>

		<p>Beginning his career in 1988 at St. Joseph’s University as a media technician, P. David Lees, Ed.D., Director of Distributed Learning &amp; Educational Technology, La Salle University, has had a front row seat to the evolution of technology in higher education. “This field is constantly changing, and it has been a very interesting journey so far,” says Lees. “I started out delivering overhead projectors to classrooms to later facilitating state-of-the-art multimedia classrooms. Toward the end of the 1990s, the institution began exploring distance learning through video conferencing systems, chat rooms, and online instruction. Our first learning management system (LMS) was CourseInfo, a precursor to Blackboard. Being a pioneer that experimented with different technologies has kept my career extremely interesting.” In the late 1990s, the University received a Federal grant to create the Early Responders Distance Learning Center (ERDLC) which worked with government and other agencies to create online training for different first responders. The University was far ahead of its time in implementing distance learning.”</p>
<p>Later in 2012 with government funding ending, the ERDLC was searching for a place at the University. “We had been actively growing our online programs,” explains Lees. “We decided to combine a part of my old department with the ERDLC and created the Department of Academic Technology and Distributed Learning. During my time at St. Joseph’s, we started a Technology Innovation Fund where we would fund technology initiatives to help meet faculty’s learning objectives. In early 2010, there was a grant to provide iPads to faculty members. I later heard from a faculty member how that was such a transformative experience receiving that technology and how it helped advance the teaching and learning experience.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“The partnership with Edge has been terrific and they have helped with our course development.

Enter Joshua Gaul, Associate Vice President and Chief Digital Learning Office, Edge, who comes in and saves the day a lot of the time. We currently have a six-month contract with Edge while we look to hire two positions for an instructor technologist and may extend that based on our needs. Josh is also helping us with this interviewing process and finding suitable candidates.”</p>

		<p>Filling Skills Gaps as Online Learning Grows<br>
Joining La Salle University in 2017 as the Director of Online Hybrid Learning, Lees says the institution had just partnered with an online program management (OPM). “For most of my career, I had been on the faculty development side of online learning. With this new role, I had to broaden my scope and dive further into the business end of online learning, including marketing, enrollment, and retention. I have continually championed the OPM, because we’ve been able to grow our programs. In the fall of 2017, La Salle launched an online Registered Nurse-Bachelor of Science in Nursing (RN-BSN) and Master of Business Administration (MBA). In 2019, we launched two Nurse Practitioner tracks with the OPM, which brought our online offerings to nearly 20 programs.”</p>
<p>However, Lees did keep his ties with faculty and course development, “When I joined La Salle, the instructional design team did not report to me, but we worked closely together.&nbsp; After a couple of years at the University, there was a reorganization, and the ID Team began reporting to me.”&nbsp; Hence, the Distributed Learning and Educational Department was born.</p>
<p>Lees earned his master’s degree and doctorate at a distance in the early stages of the online revolution. “From my experience as an online student, and in developing online courses, and as an online instructor, I gained valuable insight into remote education.” Last year, after members of the ID team resigned, Lees was left to learn Canvas very quickly and cover the tasks of several people. “Thankfully, I had just signed up for an Edge conference and learned about the support Edge could provide, so I got in touch with the Member Engagement Manager, Erin Brink,” says Lees. “The University incorporated new technologies during the pandemic which the ID Team had to manage, and we still had programs to launch in the summer of 2023. The support from Edge allowed us to keep moving forward.”</p>
<p>“The partnership with Edge has been terrific and they have helped with our course development,” Lees continues. “Our OPM does provide some assistance with instructional design and Quality Matters (QM) reviews, but we did not have anyone internal to work with these organizations and provide daily Canvas support. Enter Joshua Gaul, Associate Vice President and Chief Digital Learning Office, Edge, who comes in and saves the day a lot of the time. We currently have a six-month contract with Edge while we look to hire two positions for an Instructional Technologist and may extend that based on our needs. Josh is also helping us with this interviewing process and finding suitable candidates.”</p>
<p>Similar to many institutions in higher education, Lees says finding and retaining instructional designers has been challenging. “Instructional Designers or Instructional Technologists are in high demand, but have only stayed short term, oftentimes only a year. We’ve tried to remedy this with competitive salaries and offering professional development, but many times, these individuals move to larger institutions or corporate organizations. While instructional design tasks can regularly be performed remotely, we like our designers to be on campus, but we’re trying to offer more flexibility to help attract talent to La Salle.”</p>
<p>Lees says having Edge’s support has also helped the University launch four master’s programs and six certificates this past summer. “Many of these courses had been built but needed revisions. We’re also launching stackable certificates in the business school in January. While we receive support from our OPM, Josh has taken on some of the heavy lifting and handled many of the daily tasks that I do not have time to do; allowing me to focus on other important initiatives.”</p>
<p>Embracing Technology to Enhance the Learning Experience<br>
As new technologies continue to evolve, artificial intelligence (AI) appears to be front and center and is driving many thought leaders to explore the potential opportunities and capabilities of this advanced technology. “There is a lot of hype around AI, but I think this technology will have a fundamental change on how we’re doing things across many industries, including higher education,” says Lees. “In many of our discussions, we’re seeing how AI can transform teaching, change how students learn, and offer tutoring and deeper critical thinking opportunities. While we’re in the Wild West phase of AI, it will take ongoing discussions and creativity to determine how to harness this technology in the most beneficial and impactful way. Just like video, iPads, and SMARTboards help transform education, technology like AI will take us into a whole new era of learning.”</p>

		<p>Cyber attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are targeting not only corporate entities, but also educational institutions with valuable data. Reports show that educational institutions fall among the top targets for cyber attacks, where incidents in this sector have increased by 44 percent from the prior year.1 “We have definitely seen an uptick in cyber attacks in the last few years and education and local governments are getting hit pretty hard,” says Dr. Dawn Dunkerley, Virtual Chief Information Security Officer, Edge. “Especially in the higher education space where government-funded research projects are being conducted, we’re seeing an increase in threats where people would like to gain access to this information. Institutions must gain an understanding of the current threat landscape and take proactive measures to fortify their defenses.”</p>
<p>The Emergence of New Age Cyber Threats<br>
Cyber attacks are popping up in every industry and across every region as hackers continue to find new ways to take advantage of vulnerabilities. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and its growing integration into our day-to-day lives, the landscape is changing rapidly and a new age of cyber threats is emerging. “Cybercriminals use AI-powered phishing attacks and create intelligent malware to infiltrate networks or devices,” explains Dunkerley. “While AI tools are providing us with many opportunities to streamline and automate processes, this technology can also open the door to cyber crime. In previous years, AI-powered phishing attacks were common, where you may receive a poorly-worded email with misspellings that were easy to spot.”</p>
<p>“Cybercriminals are now using ChatGPT, for example, to create more sophisticated attacks,” continues Dunkerley. “This AI-powered language model can generate human-like text that is more difficult to identify as malicious, as well as can contain code and malware that is designed to attack an organization’s network.” Another trend on the rise is Deepfake AI where convincing images, audio, and video of real people are generated by machine learning. “Deepfakes present new challenges with fraud and misinformation, identity theft, and political manipulation,” says Dunkerley. “We have started to see deepfake voice recognition issues where people are creating voices to attempt to gain access to organizations. So, while AI can lead to incredible opportunities, there are also threats we need to be aware of and ensure protective measures are put in place.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		        
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p> “Organizations must recognize the importance of cyber defense and that cybersecurity is not where you should cut corners. If you lose the ability to process financial aid, for example, the consequences could be disastrous. To create a strategic plan for success, you want to clearly identify your budgetary needs and the cybersecurity resources that will help enhance your defense.”</p>

		<p>The MOVEit Attack<br>
One of the most prominent cyber attacks of 2023 is known as the MOVEit breach that compromised confidential data across a wide range of entities. “The latest number of organizations that have been compromised by the MOVEit breach is over 1,000, and has affected over 60 million individuals,” shares Dunkerley. “MOVEit is a piece of software that was created as a file-sharing tool. Current investigations believe their source code was compromised by a ransomware actor and they were able to gain access to organizations that were using the client-based version of the MOVEit software.”</p>
<p>The education sector was among the industries affected by this cyber attack, where reports say nearly 900 colleges experienced a data breach during the mass hack. Among the organizations affected by the breach include National Student Clearinghouse, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America-College Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA-CREF), and Pension Benefit Information (PBI) Research Services. “For National Student Clearinghouse, thousands of student enrollment and other records were involved in the breach,” explains Dunkerley. “This attack has two tiers of compromise, where the lower tier is basic information including student name and non-sensitive data, and the second tier includes more personal information like Social Security numbers. We are working diligently with our member institutions who had information exposed to help provide the steps needed to protect themselves.”</p>
<p>TIAA is well known in the education space for helping provide retirement tools for people in academic, government, medical, cultural, and other nonprofit fields. The organization confirmed that one of its third-party vendors had been exposed in the MOVEit breach, and as a result, has filed a class action lawsuit alleging a breach of nearly 2.4 million personal records. PBI Research Services, a third-party vendor, had to inform their customers when they became aware of the MOVEit data breach. “This incident shows us how strongly we can be affected by third parties that are working on our behalf,” says Dunkerley. “It is becoming increasingly clear that we must make a strong push to understand vendor risk and manage the impact of such events on the education sector.”</p>

Your organization can also benefit from investing in advanced tools. Technology continues to emerge that uses AI for continuous threat monitoring and detection. We want institutions to be equipped with the tools they need to create a holistic security approach that is both effective and affordable and allows you to make proactive, responsible decisions to improve cybersecurity within your organization.”</p>

		<p>Investing in Cyber Defense<br>
The financial impact of a cyber attack is not just in the moment, it also extends into rebuilding IT systems and restoring data. “There are significant costs, including people, process, and technology, that are associated with response and recovery,” says Dunkerley. “You may have to create stand-up call centers to receive phone calls or stuff and send out envelopes with notification letters. Educational institutions may also face significant legal fees and penalties following a cyber attack, and can experience reputational damage; impacting future enrollment and funding.”</p>
<p>Cyber attacks can cause significant disruption to learning, with systems and networks often being taken offline for extended periods of time. This can result in lost revenue and enrollment for educational institutions. “Along with the cost of recovery efforts, a data breach can have a huge impact on learning,” says Dunkerley. “You may see a disruption to classes, assignments, and educational resources. Cyber attacks can cause systems and networks to be taken offline, which can disrupt classes and assignments, and result in students falling behind in their coursework.”</p>
<p>Identity theft and other privacy violations are also a major concern when sensitive student data, such as personal information and grades, are compromised. “Cyber attacks can also disrupt research projects at an institution and can impact funding and progress in the field of education,” says Dunkerley.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Optimizing your Cyber Defense<br>
Understanding the evolving threat landscape is an important step in creating a strong cyber defense strategy that prioritizes and optimizes a cybersecurity budget, addresses the most critical functions, and enhances the defense against emerging threats. “Organizations must recognize the importance of cyber defense and that cybersecurity is not where you should cut corners,” explains Dunkerley. “If you lose the ability to process financial aid, for example, the consequences could be disastrous. To create a strategic plan for success, you want to clearly identify your budgetary needs and the cybersecurity resources that will help enhance your defense.”</p>
<p>To optimize a cyber defense budget and prioritize spending, institutions can benefit from implementing spending on critical functions like firewall enhancements, user education, and intrusion detection systems. “Training and education are also critical parts of a cybersecurity strategy and creating an incident response team and tested incident response plan,” says Dunkerley. “You want to be able to answer the question, how can we improve general user behaviors? When this behavior or something else fails, how do we identify that something has happened? Knowing these answers can then inform how to react and recover appropriately.”</p>
<p>Creating a Culture of Cyber Awareness<br>
Outlined in the Safeguards Rule of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), institutions are required to protect private data in accordance with a written information security plan created by the institution. To be compliant, organizations must use administrative, technical, or physical safeguards to access, collect, distribute, process, protect, store, use, and dispose of customer information. Requirements include using proper software, testing and monitoring vulnerabilities, and providing employee training and education.</p>
<p>To enhance your institution’s cyber defense, Dunkerley says conducting a comprehensive risk and vulnerability assessment is a good place to start. “It’s important to understand what your top risks are from a confidentiality, integrity, and availability perspective and the impact of each. You also want to understand your overall vulnerability, including physical security. This goes beyond just a scan; you want to gain a comprehensive view where you can identify possible vulnerabilities before they become a threat.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>The GLBA requires institutions to develop an incident response plan and test it regularly. “We definitely recommend reviewing your response strategy at least every year, if not every six months,” says Dunkerley. “The response team also needs to include other team members than just the IT staff. In the event of a breach, there is potentially internal communications that will go out to the faculty, staff, and students, as well as external communication to other organizations.&nbsp; There will also be a legal aspect. The incident response team is multi-faceted and will require a cooperative effort during response and recovery.”</p>
<p>Edge encourages institutions to understand third-party vendor risk and recommends a vendor risk management program. “At Edge, we actively monitor our third-party risk and urge institutions to understand who their critical vendors are, who has access to the network, what is their critical software, student information systems, learning management systems, and critical infrastructure,” explains Dunkerley. “Your organization can also benefit from investing in advanced tools. Technology continues to emerge that uses AI for continuous threat monitoring and detection. We want institutions to be equipped with the tools they need to create a holistic security approach that is both effective and affordable and allows you to make proactive, responsible decisions to improve cybersecurity within your organization.”</p>

<p>Beatfarm Digital (“<a href="https://twitter.com/beatfarm_io">Beatfarm</a>”) and Elastos today unveiled a collaboration to deliver ‘positive disruption’ to the music business based on new inscription technology and Blockchain-based music consumption models.</p>
<p>The music creation and performance industry is notoriously inefficient when it comes to matching artists with potential collaborators and – even more so – when remunerating and protecting the rights of creators themselves. Research from industry research firm&nbsp;<a href="https://musicindustryblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/long-tail-cover.jpg">MIDIA</a>&nbsp;suggests that 1% of artists make a staggering 77% revenue related to recorded music sales; a trend that is actually becoming more regressive over time.&nbsp; According to research published in 2019 in&nbsp;<a>The Journal of Business Research</a>, in 1982, 5% of the top-earning artists accounted for 62% of concert revenues globally; by 2003 that proportion had risen to 84%.</p>
<p>A shift that has only been exacerbated by the emergence of new formats and technology; by the turn of the century, while 1% musicians accounted for 75% of ‘traditional’ formats such a CD revenues, they earned an even higher proportion – 79% – of subscription and streaming revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Elastos’ partnership with Beatfarm represents a welcome alternative to this trend; with technology helping to put musicians and artists in control of their work, who they work with and how the resulting work is monetized.</p>
<p>Through the collaboration, artists will have direct and secure access to all aspects of the music ecosystem – from composition and production, to merchandising and promotion as well as genuine ‘superfans’ –complete with a direct transaction mechanism based on Elastos’ recently launched&nbsp;<a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-bel2-bitcoin-layer-2-solution/">BeL2</a>&nbsp;technology, enabling them to establish Smart Contracts on their own terms and remunerated direct in Bitcoin.&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting contracts – eScriptions – are secured and assured through Bitcoin and can themselves be traded through a decentralized marketplace.</p>
<p>“The Elastos chain is an ideal platform for providing artists the tools and resources to control the monetization of their content and develop groundbreaking ways to connect with their fans in ways which the industry hasn’t seen before”, said Beatfarm’s Co-Founder, Alex Panos.</p>
<p>“Our collaboration with Beatfarm reflects everything that Elastos is about and what BeL2 can deliver.&nbsp; Now artists and creators will not only have direct access to unlimited collaborators and resources, they’ll be able to partner with them on their terms, retaining full control and ownership of their work.&nbsp; This is the very promise of the&nbsp;<a href="https://elastos.dev/">SmartWeb</a>&nbsp;in action,” says Jonathan Hargreaves, Global Head of Business Development &amp; ESG.</p>
 About Beatfarm 
<p>Beatfarm is a Web3 platform focused on the music industry whose mission is to provide artists the tools and resources to control the monetization of their content and develop new sources of revenue through direct collaboration with fans.</p>
<p>Developed by music industry veterans, Beatfarm aims to become the priority destination for direct artist monetization and enhanced artist to fan engagement.&nbsp; Follow&nbsp;@beatfarm_io on X</p>

<p>Cisco, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Intel, Micron, Microsoft, U.S. NIST, SAP, and Others to Develop Use Cases, Standards, and APIs that Enable End-to-End Visibility for Supply Chains</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 27 February 2024 – Members of OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, have formed the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ces-tc">Computing Ecosystem Supply Chain Technical Committee</a> (CES-TC). Leaders in the computing and semiconductor industries established the TC with aims to revolutionize global supply chain dynamics through standardized data exchange. With digital transformation rapidly reshaping industries and systems worldwide, the imperative for seamless data exchange has never been more pronounced.</p>



<p>This collaborative endeavor highlights the consensus in the computing ecosystem that digital transformation requires standardized data exchange among member companies over a network. The TC will focus on developing use cases, data schemas and ontologies, and APIs that enable end-to-end visibility for supply chains. The TC’s work will facilitate building resilient capacity, trusted hardware and software, secure systems, and sustainable practices to benefit all customers and end-users.</p>



<p>“Standardization plays a pivotal role in establishing secure and sustainable systems, which are crucial for the evolving digital landscape,” noted Joaquin Sufuentes, CES-TC co-chair, of Intel. “As the CES-TC sets its course, it signifies the collective dedication of OASIS members to lead the charge in technological advancement that directly enriches industries and end-users. The TC’s work will extend to smart contracts that drive logic functions, process automation, and role-based entitlements within the blockchain context.”</p>



<p>“TC contributions will focus on the data schemas and ontologies that define the attributes and entities and a REST API model for putting the data into and getting the data from blockchain or other distributed infrastructure,” said Tom Dodson, CES-TC co-chair, of Intel. “Through standardized approaches, we are empowering industries with the tools necessary to navigate the complexities of the digital age.”</p>



<p>Participation in the OASIS CES-TC is open to all through <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OASIS-OPEN-MEMBERSHIP-AGREEMENT_2024_TC.pdf">membership in OASIS</a>. The profile for the types of contributors to the CES-TC include business stakeholders responsible for product delivery, technical experts managing integrations, supply chain professionals, data specialists focusing on ontologies, government representatives concerned with traceability, and industry professionals driving digital transformations.</p>



<p>Support for the CES-TC<br>Cisco<br>“The OASIS CES-TC represents a great advancement in standardizing and securing the supply chain of the digital age. By focusing on the development of universally accepted data schemas, APIs, and smart contract specifications, this effort is laying the groundwork for transparency, efficiency, and security in supply chain management. I fully support CES-TC’s efforts to create a more resilient and trustworthy digital ecosystem.”<br>– Omar Santos, Distinguished Engineer, Cisco | OASIS Board of Directors</p>



<p>Intel<br>“Working as an ecosystem for the benefit of customers and end users of our computing products requires that we operationalize how we collaborate with data in real time to build more efficient operations and new revenue services. We want to standardize and scale the ability to share the right data and signals.”<br>-Paul Dumke, Senior Director, Ecosystem Strategy &amp; Operations, Intel Corporation</p>



<p>Micron<br>“The storage and memory business is complex and competition is fierce. Micron’s success depends on our ability to innovate, and with more than 50,000 lifetime patents, we take innovation very seriously. The value chain ecosystem is no exception. Ecosystem innovation is the next frontier and Micron is thrilled to be on this journey with our fellow CES-TC members.”<br>-Matt Draper, Senior Director of Micron Supply Chain Optimization</p>

             Confirming ATB Ventures’s Oliu service PCTF Privacy Component conformance&nbsp; 
<p>Feb. 27, 2024 – Vancouver – We are thrilled to announce that&nbsp; ATB Ventures’s&nbsp; Oliu has been certified against the <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PCTF-Overview_Final-V1.0_ENG-.pdf">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework </a>(PCTF) <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/pctf-privacy/">Privacy Component</a>.

<p>As leaders in authentication and payments spaces respectively, the FIDO Alliance and EMVCo collaborate to provide guidance on how FIDO authentication can be incorporated in payment use-cases allowing merchants, acquirers/PSPs and issuers to have a consistent way to submit and process FIDO authentication data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>EMVCo released a white paper with FIDO Alliance’s inputs, “<a href="https://www.emvco.com/resources/emv-3-d-secure-white-paper-use-of-fido-data-in-3-d-secure-messages/">EMV® 3-D Secure White Paper – Use of FIDO® Data in 3-D Secure Messages</a>,” which explains how the use of FIDO authentication data in EMV 3DS messages can streamline e-commerce checkout while reducing friction for consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authentication flows are evolving, and merchants are increasingly building seamless experiences based on FIDO standards for device-based authentication, where a trusted device is bound to a payment credential to ensure the credential is being used by the verified cardholder. Consequently, it has become apparent that in some scenarios the issuer may require more data to assess risk and validate the authentication cryptographically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This paper addresses these scenarios by providing a data structure that allows for a chain of trust to be established between cardholder authentication, FIDO enrolments and FIDO authentication, hence giving issuers increased control and insight into the authentication process as well as validate authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the EU, where payment authentication is required as per PSD2 SCA, this industry-wide guidance can provide assistance to enabling more device-based authentication in a standardized way using globally known authentication standards such as FIDO while using widely accepted authentication rails such as EMVCo.</p>



<p>Read the full <a href="https://www.emvco.com/resources/emv-3-d-secure-white-paper-use-of-fido-data-in-3-d-secure-messages/">white paper</a> on the EMVCo website to learn more.</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>The use of open standards in data interoperability is crucial for enhancing governance not only in the European Union but globally. Open standards determine the format, storage, and exchange of data and enable different organizations and systems to communicate seamlessly. This is especially vital for the EU, with its diverse member states and institutions, where open standards ensure free and secure data flow across borders, enabling better coordination and cooperation in implementing healthcare, trade, environmental protection, and security policies.</p>



<p>Furthermore, open standards uphold the principles of transparency and democracy, enabling citizens’ access to governmental data and enhancing public accountability, thereby promoting civic engagement. From an economic standpoint, open standards foster innovation, facilitate cross-border business operations and drive economic growth. Moreover, they help address global challenges such as climate change and pandemics, allowing effective data sharing and collaboration among nations.</p>



<p>OASIS Open <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/standards/">interoperability standards</a> are pivotal in ensuring data protection, privacy, and security while harmonizing technological infrastructures. Our standards are vital for the EU and other governments to fully leverage data interoperability’s benefits in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>

<p>2023 demonstrated that we still have a lot of work to do when it comes to protecting Americans from identity theft and identity-related cybercrime. The GAO and FinCEN together documented more than $300 billion in identity-related cybercrime, DHS’ Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) outlined how weaknesses in legacy authentication tools enabled adversaries to launch a wave of high-profile attacks, and millions of Americans struggled to recover from identity theft. Meanwhile, the introduction of new tools powered by biometrics and AI to help block attacks also raised concerns about equity and bias, and in the physical world, many Americans still struggle to get foundational credentials that they need to prove who they are. As 2024 kicks off, these issues will all continue to be front and center.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Thursday, January 25th in Washington DC, the Better Identity Coalition, FIDO Alliance, and the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) joined forces to present a full-day policy forum looking at “Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead.”</p>

<p>Points have taken Web3 by storm in the last six months, catalyzed by projects like Blur and EigenLayer rewarding users with points on the way to seizing the NFT market and amassing $7 Billion TVL respectively. More than <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/277823/crypto-projects-115b-points?ref=blog.ceramic.network">115 Billion points</a> have been given out by Web3 projects so far, according to Tim Copeland at The Block.</p><p>There are two ways to look at points:</p>  As a precursor to an airdrop. Projects use points ahead of a token to generate interest, signal what they care about and will reward, more effectively target engagement, and navigate legal risks associated with tokens.  As a measure of quantifiable reputation. Points ascribe a value to user activity, just like many reputation systems have before: traditional loyalty programs, Reddit karma, check-ins, credentials. They can signal legitimacy in pseudo-anonymous systems and — because they’re more quantitative than, for example, verifiable credentials — standing within the community.  <p>Both of these are right. Points align the incentives of the platform and the user base, like all reputation systems. And they forecast who is creating value and is likely to be rewarded. By understanding how these two intersect, we can forecast where Web3 will go far beyond today’s points craze.</p> Points are quantifiable like money, enduring like reputation <p>Tokens were the first major innovation of Web3 and the primary incentive. They offer fully quantifiable value, are transactional, and require no additional context. They work as “one time games.” Reputation is how social systems achieve repeat game use cases, rewarding ‘good behavior’ of an actor (e.g. following contracts and policies, not cheating counterparties) with access and benefits over the long term. Reputations are non-fungible — for them to establish trust, it has to be hard to buy reputation.</p><p>Points are proof of activity that act as a building block for reputation (and in Web3, often carry the suggestion of future value). **All reputations come with some benefit. Usually, they’re more subtle than financial rewards. Reputations might gain access to a service (credit score) or club (referral), earn discounts (loyalty programs) or introductions (dating), convince counterparties to transact (Uber rating, credit lending), and build trust with customers (influencers, corporate brands). Reputations are less measurable than financial assets, but often more valuable.</p><p>For Web3 to grow into social and other non-financial use cases, more robust reputations are needed. Points are not an isolated mechanism to forecast token earnings — they are one point on a broad spectrum of token (financial) and reputational rewards that Web3 will keep innovating on.</p> Points as part of the evolution of Web3 reputation <p>Reputation naturally starts in the most discrete, high-value places and evolves to more broad ones.</p> 1. B2C “Badges” <p>The earliest forms of reputation helped networks solve discrete pressing problems: anti-sybil and KYC. This involved a business or service issuing badges to users for achieving important milestones. For example, <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/gitcoin-passport-on-ceramic-enabling-trustworthy-beta-round-donations/">Gitcoin Passport stamps prevent sybil attacks</a> in Grants rounds for Ethereum and other ecosystems. The meaning of the badge is objective and clearly denominated.</p> 2. Attestations <p>After discrete badges, platforms needed reputation for a wider variety of activities and credentials: history of contribution, trust as a delegate, skills in a DAO, proof of activity. Attestations are still clearly denominated, but rather than signifying a clear milestone like badges they’re more continuous.</p><p>This also started B2C (for example, participating in an event, completing a certain step in a user flow, etc.) <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network#ceramic-network">EAS</a> has emerged as a standard for issuing these, used natively in the Optimism stack and widely in Ethereum. Increasingly, attestations are community-driven as well. Open platforms let users create and verify claims. For example, Metamask is working on a review and reputation system for Snaps.</p> 3. Points: scored activity <p>On-chain transactions, B2C badges, and attestations are all cryptographically verifiable actions. Users do something that has provable provenance and time, whether that’s on-chain or off-chain signed data.</p><p>Point systems specify which of these activities have value in their system (and how much), tabulate them over time for each identity, and ascribe a numeric ‘point’ value to them. Points create a quantifiable reputation that continuously aggregates the previous forms.</p> 4. Events: all activity <p>There’s no reason to believe the evolution will stop with points. At scale, all of a user’s activities in Web3 apps and platforms will be recorded as cryptographically verifiable events. This might be likes on a cast, messages on a forum, contributions to a codebase, visits to a blackbird restaurant, etc.</p><p>These are all events, and they all have value — but it’s not always known up-front what that value is. Some might have value in driving community engagement, others in improved analytics for products or targeting for ads, some as inputs into reputation systems. Because all will be cryptographically recorded, they can be referenced any time in the future.</p><p>Points will dominate for now, but before long we’ll see a huge increase in retroactive airdrops, activations, rewards, access, and other forms of value awarded to users based on a much broader history of their events — not just those that are made explicit up-front via point systems.</p> Infrastructure for points, events, and trust <p>All of these forms of reputation serve to reward users. Web2 used points exhaustively, but Web3 can uniquely do it openly and with composability. By making every event driving points both transparent and verifiable, events and points can be leveraged across platforms and have trust built in. This trust can reinforce future rewards, encourage more activity, and enable cross-platform point innovation.</p><p>Unfortunately, while points are proliferating, to date most haven’t tapped into this unique Web3 possibility — most have been tabulated on centralized databases, putting rewards at risk.</p> Data ledgers vs. asset ledgers <p>Financial blockchains were built to be asset ledgers, not point or event ledgers. They’re designed for scarcity; e.g., they must protect against double-spend as a core principle. Points are not bought, sold or traded like assets — they’re earned. They’re best served — fast, cheaply, scalably — on a data ledger.</p><p>Data ledgers, for data that is not scarce, operate with different principles. They must still offer strong verifiability and composability; but they don’t have to protect against double spend, and they must scale many orders of magnitude beyond asset ledgers. There are exponentially more data transactions than asset transactions in any web service.</p><p>Ceramic is the first <code>decentralized data ledger</code> with the scale, composability, and trust guarantees required to be a system of record for points and events. It’s built to enable the scaling of Web3 beyond financial transactions to richer experiences, including those powered by attestations, points, and the billions of events that are coming to enable a data-rich Web3.</p> Building with Points <p>If you’re thinking about a point system for your product, or how to advance point-enabled experiences, please reach out to <a href="mailto:partners@3box.io">partners@3box.io</a>.</p><p>If you are interested in emerging standards for points, reach out to us on the Ceramic <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">discord</a> to learn more about our working group. </p><p>If you’ll be at EthDenver next week, come talk points, reputation and verifiable data with us at <a href="https://lu.ma/proofofdata?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Proof of Data</a>.</p>

<p>Mailchain, founded in 2021, aims to revolutionize decentralized identity and communication with its services, including Vidos and the Mailchain Communication Protocol. These offerings streamline management of, and interaction with, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), ensuring secure, efficient, and compliant operations across various industries, simplifying the integration and adoption of decentralized identity technologies.</p><p>What is Mailchain, and how did it come into existence?&nbsp;</p><p>I always had a passion for startups. In 2016 I joined the team at AWS (Amazon Web Services) that helps startups with technology and go-to-market strategy, for example by introducing them to other AWS customers.&nbsp;</p><p>The blockchain landscape was evolving at the time and my soon-to-be co-founders (who I met at AWS) and I started tracking the space closely. We noticed that it wasn’t possible to communicate privately between blockchain addresses without providing an additional piece of information, like an email address. So we sent some encrypted messages with the transaction data as an experiment.&nbsp;</p><p>This grew into a side project. It was open source and had quite a few contributors, but we realized we needed something more scalable that wasn't dependent on blockchain protocols, with the associated gas fees and speed constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in 2021 we set out to build Mailchain, a protocol that enables people to communicate privately using any blockchain address.&nbsp;</p><p>With our SDK, developers can easily add web3 email to their own projects and applications, allowing them to engage with their users in a truly web3 way.</p><p>It’s an interesting strategy to focus on upgrading email with web3 capability. Why did you choose this route?&nbsp;</p><p>There are over <a>3.9 billion</a> active email users today. Each user’s inbox paints a rich picture of who they are. It stores their online actions, communication habits, spending behavior, even their thoughts, ideas, and feelings.&nbsp; And everybody wants to keep that information private.</p><p>‍Web3 on the other hand is underpinned by the principles of decentralization, privacy and digital property rights, using wallets and blockchain addresses as identities. But there’s no native way to communicate privately using these addresses. The workaround is to use another communication channel, whether that’s email, instant messaging or social media.</p><p>With Mailchain, users enjoy the privacy and other benefits of a digital identity wallet without needing to leave their email inbox. For instance, people can authenticate with a Web3 application by clicking a link in their inbox. Upon clicking the link, the system creates a self-signed Verifiable Credential (VC). The app knows who should be signing it, and is able to verify the user.&nbsp;</p><p>This use case came from a customer who needed to prevent Zoom-bombing (unauthorized intrusion into a private video conference call). Another use-case is universities selling remote courses. They don’t want people who are not enrolled joining the sessions, or others joining on behalf of those who are enrolled — particularly when it comes to exams.&nbsp;</p><p>How did decentralized identity become part of the Mailchain story?&nbsp;</p><p>We wanted to enable the community, so we open-sourced as much of the codebase as we could.&nbsp;</p><p>We started to see people using Mailchain for authentication, and realized identity was vital to what they were trying to achieve. These developers needed tools to manage user identities. It was early in the adoption cycle and there were a lot of gaps.&nbsp;</p><p>We also started hearing people talking about DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials).&nbsp; We saw a pattern between VCs and our previous work with NFTs. So, we went deep into the W3C standards and looked at how they were being used in the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, we didn’t know if we wanted to put people’s Mailchain IDs on-chain. We were looking for a standard way to construct the IDs and convey related attributes, such as the authorized senders for a blockchain address.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, we saw an opportunity to converge on a standardized approach. We also wanted to extend what we built to help other developers in the ecosystem, so we created <a href="https://vidos.id/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Vidos</a>, a suite of managed services to help people building with DIDs and VC related applications.&nbsp;</p><p>Tell us more about the tools you’re building, and how they promote adoption, and interoperability, of decentralized identities </p><p>Our first service is the Vidos Universal Resolver. DID resolution forms a core part of any interaction with VCs and needs to be reliable and performant. It’s also something that developers and ops teams shouldn’t need to spend time deploying and managing. The service takes away this burden so deploying a resolver is simple and just requires adding the API details to an application.</p><p>The service comes with uptime guarantees and offers granular policy and permissions features, helping organizations meet their own availability and compliance requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>This helps organizations who are not just issuers (of credentials such as course certificates and educational qualifications). They may also need to verify other credentials (such as proof of identity, age, etc.), which potentially involves resolving DIDs on multiple networks and services.&nbsp;</p><p>We also have other services coming later in the year that will facilitate credential verification with similar compliance and logging features.&nbsp;</p><p>You mentioned go-to-market strategy as an area of personal interest. Can you tell us a bit about your own strategy?&nbsp;</p><p>The DID resolution and Mailchain audiences are different. For Vidos, we’re working with enterprises and closing some gaps where technology is not available today. Mailchain is largely feature complete.&nbsp;</p><p>Vidos is a good fit with Mailchain because there’s strong interest in enabling Web3 communication, whether that’s machine-to-machine messages triggered by blockchain transactions or certain types of business communication.&nbsp;</p><p>We need to ground this in the real world, so developing SaaS (Software as a Service) products to move the entire ecosystem forward is what we think is most important right now.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d like to think that building on W3C standards ensures we don’t get ruled out of any geographic&nbsp; markets. The DID resolver is intended to be multi-region. Customers can already deploy into the UK and EU. We will stand up services elsewhere, as needed.&nbsp;</p><p>What market signals do you see?&nbsp;</p><p>The market never moves fast enough for an entrepreneur! But we’re seeing strong signs. It’s becoming a priority for enterprises to see how they can move beyond identity federation.&nbsp; Regulatory change and fraud are also encouraging supply chain actors and financial institutions to look at how they can use decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re seeing this pop up in different places, for example it’s good to see LinkedIn verifying humans on the platform. There are certainly tail winds.&nbsp;</p><p>What is the value of DIF membership to Mailchain?&nbsp;</p><p>We’re hoping to collaborate with industry participants, to make sure what we build is right for the use cases we’re targeting, starting with the Vidos Universal Resolver for DIDs, as well as to learn from others building in the space.&nbsp;</p><p>We also want to contribute back to what’s a very useful and sensible set of standards, whether that’s ideas in the working groups and/or contributing packages or libraries.</p><p>It’s a great time to be involved in DIF. The standards are reaching a stage where they are mature enough. The opportunity is now!</p>

 In this&nbsp;latest contribution to the ongoing dialogue surrounding Switzerland’s E-ID initiative, DIDAS has released a comprehensive document that critically evaluates the current technological proposals for the Swiss trust infrastructure. This document underscores DIDAS’s commitment to a principle-based, collaborative methodology in developing a secure, adaptive E-ID ecosystem, echoing the necessity for an approach that is both inclusive and forward-thinking. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>It&nbsp;focuses on the existing scenarios’ technological shortcomings,&nbsp;and is&nbsp;proposing an ‘A+’ scenario that better aligns with EU standards, addresses aspects of privacy (specifically unlinkability and correlation)&nbsp;and fosters iterative development. This approach champions not only secure cryptographic practices but also advocates for the coexistence of various credential types, ensuring a flexible, future-proof infrastructure.</p>
<p>The imperative for cryptographically safe owner binding, a cornerstone for qualified digital identities&nbsp;are further aspects. The document elucidates the necessity for&nbsp;cryptographic primitives embedded directly within the secure elements of devices,&nbsp;particularly for high levels of assurance. This technical requirement is not merely a suggestion but a mandatory prerequisite to&nbsp;prevent&nbsp;any potential misuse or impersonation attempts.&nbsp;It&nbsp;confines of a device’s silicon is highlighted as a critical measure to prevent the unauthorized replication of private keys, ensuring that the sanctity of digital identities remains inviolable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the document highlights the urgency of action, urging stakeholders to lead the way in establishing a continuously evolving, privacy-centric E-ID framework.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also&nbsp;aimed at striking a balance between Swiss-specific requirements and EU interoperability, setting a precedent for digital identity management.</p>
<p>DIDAS’s insights into governance structures and the collaborative design of the trust infrastructure serves&nbsp;as a&nbsp;high level&nbsp;guide for policymakers, technologists, and industry stakeholders, emphasizing the collective responsibility in shaping a digital identity ecosystem that is secure, user-centric,&nbsp;adaptable by private sector businesses and aligned with broader societal values and international standards.</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>Biometrics hit the news again earlier this month.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z82kjTQyQv0">TV1’s 7 Sharp</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.1news.co.nz/2024/02/08/foodstuffs-facial-recognition-tech-trial-concerns-privacy-commissioner/">1News</a>&nbsp;together with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/508613/privacy-commissioner-keeps-close-eye-on-supermarkets-facial-recognition-trial">RNZ news</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/350171964/foodstuffs-store-facial-recognition-trial-will-cut-down-crime">online</a>&nbsp;and several&nbsp;<a href="https://www.odt.co.nz/business/shops-itching-use-facial-recognition-retail-nz">print</a><a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/privacy-commissioner-promises-to-closely-monitor-foodstuffs-facial-recognition-trial/3JXFUBVGJVE47AA2GTVC5E6ASM/">media</a>&nbsp;carried the story of Foodstuffs North Island’s trial of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nist.gov/glossary-term/5441">Facial Recognition</a>&nbsp;in 25 of its stores to see if it reduces retail crime. In addition,&nbsp;<a href="https://waateanews.com/2024/02/09/high-mistake-rate-expected-in-shoplifter-face-check/">Māori, Pasifika and People of colour</a>&nbsp;have&nbsp;<a href="https://taiuru.co.nz/facial-recognition-and-artificial-intelligence-profiling/">concerns</a>&nbsp;of bias. Naturally the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/publications/statements-media-releases/privacy-commissioner-to-keep-a-close-eye-on-foodstuffs-north-island-frt-trial/">Office of Privacy Commissioner</a>&nbsp;(OPC) is closely monitoring the trial. I have no special insight but from the links above I deduce that the trial stores run their CCTV feed through facial image matching software set at a high 90% threshold, matching it against that particular store’s database of known and convicted offenders. If a possible match is made, specially trained ‘super recognisers’ visually inspect both enrolled and detected images which in itself should eliminate racial bias while the rest of the feed is deleted.</p>



<p>Permanent deletion being not straightforward and the ‘no sharing’ rule between stores are matters that OPC likely monitors along with the trial’s effectiveness of reducing retail crime. While&nbsp;<a href="https://internationalsecurityjournal.com/facial-biometrics-shops-recfaces/">emerging anecdotal evidence overseas suggests its effectiveness</a>, direct comparative research is needed.</p>



<p>CCTV and facial recognition are widely used for crime detection in public places, we are all using facial recognition every day on our phones, when we cross the border using Smart Gate, or when we use a browser on our PC, so you might ask why all the fuss?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are large notices in-store, it’s private property and people can choose to shop elsewhere. The additional use of image software in stores improves matching processes traditionally done by humans, albeit with potential human error. FR software and camera quality continuously improves while human-based matching has limitations. Perfection is challenging, but by combining human and technological efforts we can improve outcomes.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.foodstuffs.co.nz/news-room/2024/Foodstuffs-North-Island-begins-trialling-facial-recognition-in-select-stores">Foodstuffs North Island’s adherence to its rules</a>&nbsp;raises the question of whether striving for perfection impedes progress. DINZ’s Biometrics Special Interest Group reflects on differing community views,&nbsp;<a href="https://waateanews.com/2024/02/15/facial-recognition-raises-dilemma-for-police/">agrees with the Deputy Police Commissioner on the need for an open discussion</a>&nbsp;and emphasises the need for education on the technology’s workings and potential benefits when implemented correctly.</p>

<p>The Veramo User Group has kicked into action with a well-attended and productive first meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>The meeting on 15th February provided context for the origins of the popular Javascript framework and its subsequent donation to DIF, and surfaced a range of questions, ideas, use cases and feedback from current and prospective users, plus success stories including an Enterprise solution built on top of Veramo, now in full production.&nbsp;</p><p>After an initial round of introductions, the Veramo Labs team provided an overview of the project’s history and current status, and the goals of the User Group.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideas shared by participants included a registry of plugins that is actively maintained by the community, additional development languages and a 12-month roadmap of planned new features.&nbsp;</p><p>“The team’s goal has been from the beginning to grow the project by growing the community,” Veramo co-founder and group co-chair Mircea Nistor commented during the meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>“Prior to donating Veramo to DIF, we had previously donated other libraries, and we saw more adoption and contributions happening on these libraries. We’d love to see the same kinds of activities happening within the Veramo User Group,” he added.</p><p>“To make this into a community project, it needs the original team to be no longer exclusively in charge. The Veramo framework and plugins already contain enough functionality to get people started in this space. We hope to see many new GitHub issues coming from the User Group, and for those with bandwidth to take them on” said Senior Engineer at Consensys Identity and group co-chair Nick Reynolds.</p><p>The plan is to start reviewing GitHub issues and Pull Requests (PRs) at next week’s meeting, which is at 09:00 PST / Noon EST / 18:00 CET on Thursday, 22 February. The User Group is open to all, the meeting link can be found in the <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=decentralized.identity%40gmail.com&amp;ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF calendar</a>. </p><p>In the meantime, interested parties are welcome to join the community on Discord. The new Veramo User Group channel on DIF’s Discord server is recommended for meeting follow-ups and agenda items, and the Veramo Labs Discord server is the place to head for specific technical questions.</p><p>The Veramo Labs team is hoping for the community to participate in leading the User Group within the next six months.&nbsp;</p>

  From AI resurrected dictators to AI powered interactive chatbots, political 
campaigns around the world are deploying the technology to expand their 
audience and win over voters. This month, Hany Farid, UC Berkeley 
Professor, CAI Advisor, looks at examples of increasingly easier to combine

  <p>by Hany Farid, UC Berkeley Professor, CAI Advisor</p><p>News and trends shaping our understanding of generative AI technology and its applications.</p><p>In May of 2019, a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctored-nancy-pelosi-video-highlights-threat-of-deepfake-tech-2019-05-25/">manipulated video</a> of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi purportedly slurring her words in a public speech racked up over 2.5 million views on Facebook. Although the video was widely reported to be a deepfake, it was what we would today call a “cheap fake.” The original video of Speaker Pelosi was simply slowed down to make her sound inebriated — no AI needed. The cheap fake was, however, a harbinger.</p><p>Around 2 billion citizens will vote this year in some 70 elections around the globe. At the same time, generative AI has emerged as a powerful technology that can entertain, <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/january-2024-this-month-in-generative-ai-frauds-and-scams">defraud</a>, and deceive.</p><p>Today, nearly anyone can use generative AI to create hyper-realistic images from only a text prompt, clone a person's voice from a 30-second recording, or modify a video to make the speaker say things they never did or would say. Perhaps not surprisingly, generative AI is finding its way into everything from local to national and international politics. Some of these applications are used to bolster a candidate, but many are designed to be harmful to a candidate or party, and all applications raise new and complex questions.</p><p>Trying to help</p><p>In October of last year, New York City Mayor Eric Adams used generative AI to make robocalls in which he spoke Mandarin and Yiddish. (Adams only speaks English.) The calls did not disclose that the voice was AI-generated, and at least some New Yorkers believe that Adams is multilingual: "People stop me on the street all the time and say, ‘I didn’t know you speak Mandarin,’" Adams said. While the content of the calls was not deceptive, some claimed that the calls themselves were deceptive and an unethical use of AI.</p><p>Not to be outdone, earlier this year Representative Dean Phillips deployed a full-blown OpenAI-powered interactive chatbot to bolster his long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination in the upcoming presidential primary. The chatbot disclosed that it was an AI-bot and allowed voters to ask questions and hear an AI-generated response in an AI-generated version of Phillips's voice. Because this bot violated OpenAI's terms of service, it was eventually taken offline.</p><p>Trying to harm</p><p>In October of last year, Slovakia — a country that shares part of its eastern border with Ukraine — saw a last-minute and dramatic shift in its presidential election. Just 48 hours before election day, the pro-NATO and Western-aligned candidate Michal Šimečka was leading in the polls by some four points. A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/politics/election-deepfake-threats-invs/index.html">fake audio</a> of Šimečka seeming to claim that he was going to rig the election spread quickly online, and two days later the pro-Moscow candidate Robert Fico won the presidential election by five points. It is impossible to say exactly how much the audio impacted the election outcome, but this incident raised concerns about the use of AI in campaigns.</p><p>Fast-forward to January of this month when the state of New Hampshire was holding the nation's first primary for the 2024 US presidential election. On the eve of the primary, more than 20,000 New Hampshire residents received robocalls impersonating President Biden. The call urged voters not to vote in the primary and to "save your vote for the November election." It took two weeks before New Hampshire’s Attorney General <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/tech/nh-ag-robocall-update/index.html">announced</a> that his office identified two businesses behind these robocalls.&nbsp;</p><p>The past few months have also seen an increasing number of viral images making the rounds on social media. These range from faked images of Trump with convicted child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and a young girl, to faked images of Biden in military fatigues on the verge of authorizing military strikes.&nbsp;</p><p>On the video front, it is becoming increasingly easier to combine fake audio with video to make people say and do things they never did. For example, a speech originally given by Vice President Harris on April 25, 2023, at Howard University was digitally altered to replace the voice track with a seemingly inebriated and rambling Harris.</p><p>And these are just a few examples of the politically motivated deepfakes that we have already started to see as the US national election heats up. In the coming months, I'll be <a href="https://farid.berkeley.edu/deepfakes2024election/">keeping track of these examples</a> as they continue to emerge.</p><p>Something in between</p><p>In the lead up to their election earlier in February, a once-feared army general, who ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for more than three decades, was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/asia/suharto-deepfake-ai-scam-indonesia-election-hnk-intl/index.html">AI resurrected</a> with a message for voters. And, in India, former Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam – deceased since 2018 – was <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/how-ai-is-used-to-resurrect-dead-indian-politicians-as-elections-loom/ar-BB1i8gQJ">AI resurrected</a> with an endorsement for his son, the sitting head of the state of Bengaluru. I expect this type of virtual endorsement will become an (ethically complex) trend.</p><p>Looking ahead</p><p>There are <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/passive-versus-active-photo-forensics-in-the-age-of-ai">two primary approaches</a> to authenticating digital media. Reactive techniques analyze various aspects of an image or video for traces of implausible or inconsistent properties. <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">Learn more</a> about these photo forensics techniques in my series for the CAI. Proactive techniques, on the other hand, operate at the source of content creation, embedding into or extracting from an image or video an identifying digital watermark or signature.&nbsp;</p><p>Although not perfect, these combined reactive and proactive technologies will make it harder (but not impossible) to create a compelling fake and easier to verify the integrity of real content. The creation and detection of manipulated media, however, is inherently adversarial. Both sides will continually adapt, making distinguishing the real from the fake an ongoing challenge.</p><p>While it is relatively straightforward to regulate AI-powered non-consensual sexual imagery, child abuse imagery, and content designed to defraud, regulating political speech is more fraught. We, of course, want to give a wide berth for political discourse, but there should be limits on activities like those we saw in New Hampshire, where bad actors attempt to interfere with our voting rights.&nbsp;</p><p>As a first step, following the New Hampshire AI-powered robocalls, the Federal Communications Commission quickly <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-makes-ai-generated-voices-robocalls-illegal">announced</a> a ban on AI-powered robocalls. While the ruling is fairly narrow and doesn't address the wider issue of AI-powered election interference or non-AI-powered interference, it is a reasonable precaution as we all try to sort out this brave new world where anybody's voice or likeness can be manipulated.</p><p>As we continue to wrestle with these complex questions, we as consumers have to be particularly vigilant as we enter what is sure to be a highly contentious election season. We should be vigilant not to fall for disinformation just because it conforms to our personal views, we should be vigilant not to be part of the problem by spreading disinformation, and we should be vigilant to protect our and others' rights (even if we disagree with them) to participate in our democracy.</p>

<p>CSAF Aggregator schema updated</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) TC [1] are pleased to announce the approval and publication of Common Security Advisory Framework Version 2.0 Errata 01.</p>



<p>This document lists the approved errata for the OASIS Standard “Common Security Advisory Framework Version 2.0.” The specific changes are listed in section 1.1, at&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/errata01/os/csaf-v2.0-errata01-os.html#11-description-of-changes">https://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf/v2.0/errata01/os/csaf-v2.0-errata01-os.html#11-description-of-changes</a>.</p>



<p>The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) Version 2.0 is the definitive reference for the CSAF language which supports creation, update, and interoperable exchange of security advisories as structured information on products, vulnerabilities and the status of impact and remediation among interested parties.</p>



<p>The OASIS CSAF Technical Committee is chartered to make a major revision to the widely-adopted Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) specification, originally developed by the Industry Consortium for Advancement of Security on the Internet (ICASI). ICASI has contributed CVRF to the CSAF TC. The revision is being developed under the name Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF). TC deliverables are designed to standardize existing practice in structured machine-readable vulnerability-related advisories and further refine those standards over time.</p>

<p>There has been considerable press, a number of papers, and several formal initiatives concerned with quantum computing’s impact on cryptographic algorithms and protocols. Most standards development organizations are addressing concerns about the impact on the security of the currently deployed cryptographic algorithms and protocols. This paper presents FIDO Alliance initiatives that address the impact of quantum computing on the Alliance’s specifications and how the FIDO Alliance is working to retain the long-term value provided by products and services based on the FIDO Alliance specifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This paper is directed to those who have or are considering FIDO-enabled products and solutions but have concerns about the impact of Quantum Computing on their business. This paper will focus, from a high-level approach, on the FIDO Alliance’s acknowledgment of issues related to Quantum Computing and explain how the FIDO Alliance is taking appropriate steps to provide a seamless transition from the current cryptographic algorithms and protocols to new PQC (or quantum-safe) algorithms in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Despite their shortcomings, passwords have been a necessary evil; an unavoidable reality. No wonder online services have struggled to get rid of passwords for nearly three decades. Not anymore! Passkeys have emerged as a modern form of authentication, offering a superior user experience and higher security. With over 8 billion accounts already protected by passkeys, the question for service providers isn’t “if” they should be adopting passkeys, rather “when” and “how”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DocBook continues its evolution - over 25 years since origin</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of its newest OASIS Standard, approved by the members on 06 February 2024:</p>



<p>The DocBook Schema Version 5.2<br>OASIS Standard<br>06 February 2024</p>



<p>Overview:</p>



<p>Almost all computer hardware and software developed around the world needs some documentation. For the most part, this documentation has a similar structure and a large core of common idioms. The community benefits from having a standard, open, interchangeable vocabulary in which to write this documentation. DocBook has been, and will continue to be, designed to satisfy this requirement. For more than 25 years, DocBook has provided a structured markup vocabulary for just this purpose. DocBook Version 5.2 continues the evolution of the DocBook XML schema.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>I have been writing a lot lately on the power of open standards but never has it been better displayed than in protecting democracy. Let me know what you think…</p>



<p>Open standards can play a critical role in protecting democracy by promoting transparency, interoperability, and accessibility in the digital sphere. Here are a few ways in which open standards can help safeguard democratic values:<br><br>Promoting transparency: Open standards ensure that data and information are openly available and can be accessed and verified by anyone. This helps to prevent the spread of disinformation, propaganda, and fake news, which can undermine democratic processes.</p>



<p>Encouraging interoperability: Open standards ensure that different systems can work together seamlessly, which is crucial for democratic institutions that need to share data and collaborate with each other. Interoperability also promotes competition and innovation, which can help to prevent monopolies and maintain a level playing field for all.</p>



<p>Enhancing accessibility: Open standards can help to ensure that everyone has access to digital tools and services, regardless of their socioeconomic status or location. This can help to empower marginalized communities and ensure that everyone has a voice in the democratic process.</p>



<p>Providing security: Open standards can help to ensure that digital systems and data are secure and resistant to hacking, data breaches, and other forms of cyber attacks. This is crucial for protecting democratic institutions and preventing outside interference in the democratic process.</p>



<p>Overall, open standards can help to promote democratic values by ensuring that digital systems are transparent, interoperable, accessible, and secure. By adopting open standards, democratic institutions can help to build trust with citizens and promote a more inclusive and equitable society.</p>

<p>Two XACML specifications ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the approval and publication of two new Committee Specifications by the members of the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) TC [1]:<br>– XACML v3.0 Related and Nested Entities Profile Version 1.0 Committee Specification 03<br>– XACML v3.0 Separation of Duties Version 1.0 Committee Specification 01</p>



<p>These two Committee Specifications are OASIS deliverables, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>XACML v3.0 Related and Nested Entities Profile Version 1.0<br>Committee Specification 03<br>30 January 2024</p>



<p>Overview:</p>



<p>It is not unusual for access control policy to be dependent on attributes that are not naturally properties of the access subject or resource, but rather are properties of entities that are related to the access subject or resource. This profile defines the means to reference such attributes from within XACML policies for processing by a policy decision point.</p>

 How to run an impactful workshop using our free&nbsp;template <p>Recently, we ran a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Change">Theory of Change</a> workshop for the team at the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium</a>, which is hosted by <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>. We’ve found that organisations and projects that are looking to create big impact can benefit from this way of seeing into the&nbsp;future.</p><blockquote>Theory of Change (ToC) is a methodology or a criterion for planning, participation, adaptive management, and evaluation that is used in companies, philanthropy, not-for-profit, international development, research, and government sectors to promote social change. (Wikipedia)</blockquote><p>In this post we’ll outline what this kind of session aims to achieve, share a template which you can re-use, and explain how to make best use of&nbsp;it.</p><p>We’ve become pretty good at running these kinds of workshops for all kinds of clients, large and small, and find them particularly useful in charting a course for collaborative working. Thanks goes to <a href="https://outlandish.com/">Outlandish</a> for introducing this approach to&nbsp;us!</p><a href="https://whimsical.com/theory-of-change-VLrJHYoPmdJF17Xyb4H5ox@7YNFXnKbYzgCBz2QRZSh2">ToC workshop template</a> by <a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a><p>Note: around seven people is ideal for this kind of workshop. We run this workshop remotely, but there’s no reason why it couldn’t be done in&nbsp;person.</p> 🥝 At the&nbsp;Core <p>The template has several sections to it, but at the core is the triangle of Final goal, Outcomes, and Activities. You work through these in turn, first defining the goal, moving onto outcomes to support that goal, and then activities which lead to the outcomes.</p>The core of the ToC&nbsp;approach<p>One of the first things to figure out as a team is the timeframe for the work you are doing together. In terms of the final goal, is that to be achieved in six months? a year? 18 months? three&nbsp;years?</p><p>Write that down on the sticky note at the top left-hand corner just to remind everyone.</p> ⛏️ Breaking down the&nbsp;goal <p>The final goal can be difficult to write, so we’ve broken it down into three sections to make it easier for participants:</p><p>Before asking people to contribute ideas, we run through some examples from our own experience. The first row relates to work over around six months, the second over about 18 months, and the third over about three&nbsp;years.</p><p>Next, we use the section to the right hand side where each individual participant can take some time to write down what they think the organisation does (or should) do, to influence their stakeholders, to have the desired impact in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>They can approach these boxes in any order — for example, some people find it easier to go straight to the impact and then work backwards.</p><p>Once everyone has written something in all of the boxes, we go around and ask everyone in turn to explain what they’ve written. This adds some&nbsp;context.</p><p>Then, we go around again, and ask everyone to point to things that other people have written that they definitely agree with. This sets the scene for combining ideas into a collaborative final&nbsp;goal.</p> ✅ Good enough for now, safe enough to&nbsp;try <p>After a quick break, participants are ready to collaborate on a combined final goal. We ask if anyone would like to have a go at filling in one of the boxes. They can do this directly themselves, or we can screenshare and fill it in for&nbsp;them.</p><p>After some discussion and iteration of what’s been written, we move onto the other boxes. It’s worth mentioning that the most important thing here is facilitated discussion, which means timeboxing in a way that doesn’t feel&nbsp;rushed.</p><p>The phrase to bear in mind is “good enough for now, safe enough to try” which is a slightly different way of “perfect is the enemy of&nbsp;good”.</p> 🔍 Identifying the&nbsp;Outcomes <p>Getting the goal agreed on by the team is 80% of the work in this session. In our experience, it’s entirely normal for this to take an entire 90-minute session, or even&nbsp;longer.</p><p>Moving onto the outcomes, these are statements which support the goal. They are change or achievements that need to happen to help it be achieved; they should be written in a way that it’s possible to say “yes that has happened” or “no it has&nbsp;not”.</p><p>For example, “the world is a better place” is not an example of a well-written outcome, but “more people agree that the city is a safer place to live” would&nbsp;work.</p><p>Other examples of decent outcomes from different kinds of work might&nbsp;be:</p>  Local biodiversity is enhanced and pollution is&nbsp;reduced.  Parents demonstrate improved understanding of internet safety and digital citizenship.  Economic diversity within neighbourhoods is increased.  <p>There are several ways we’ve run this part of the workshop, from full-anarchism mode where people just ‘have at it’ through to taking it in turns in an orderly way to add (and then discuss) an&nbsp;outcome.</p> 🚣 Getting to the Activities <p>People new to ToC workshops often conflate Outcomes and Activities. The easiest way to tell the difference is to ask whether it’s something we’re working towards, or whether it’s something we’re&nbsp;doing.</p><p>So, for example, if we take the outcome “Local biodiversity is enhanced and pollution is reduced” some supporting activities might&nbsp;be:</p>  Introduce incentives for creating wildlife-friendly spaces, such as green roofs and community gardens.  Run regular river and park clean-up operations to remove pollutants and&nbsp;litter.  Enforce stricter regulations on industrial emissions and waste management.  Offer subsidies for businesses that implement green practices that reduce pollution and enhance biodiversity.  Promote the use of environmentally friendly pesticides and fertilisers in local farming and gardening.  <p>Again, we’ve run workshops where we’ve just had a free-for-all, others where it’s been more orderly, and then others where teams have gone away and come up with the activities outside the&nbsp;session.</p><p>Some, in fact, have taken the existing activities they’re engaged with and tried mapping those onto the outcomes. It’s an interesting conversation when those activities don’t&nbsp;map!</p> 💡 Final&nbsp;thoughts <p>A ToC workshop is a powerful way to chart a course together. It’s a collaborative endeavour for a small group to spend time on. What’s important is strong facilitation, as without it, participants can spend too much time (or not enough!) sharing their thoughts.</p><p>If you would like to explore WAO running a ToC workshop for your organisation, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">get in touch</a>!

Enjoy! :)</p>  Ceramic's Data Feed API opens for alpha testing<br>The Data Feed API is a set of new Ceramic APIs that enable developers to subscribe to the node's data change feed, allowing them to build Ceramic-powered databases and indexing solutions. A number of ecosystem partners are already in testing as we gear up for an early release before EthDenver!    ComposeDB now supports interfaces<br>Interfaces enable standardized data models for interoperability. By defining essential fields that must be shared across models, interfaces facilitate data integration and querying across different models. This is vital for ensuring data consistency, especially in decentralized systems like verifiable credentials. For a detailed overview, see <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/interfaces-in-ceramic-protocol-an-intro-guide/">Intro to Interfaces</a>.    Get started quickly with <code>create-ceramic-app</code><br>The&nbsp;create-ceramic-app&nbsp;CLI tool simplifies the process of starting with the Ceramic network by allowing you to quickly set up a ComposeDB example app. If you're familiar with create-react-app or create-next-app, you should be right at home. If you want to quickly test a Ceramic app locally on your system, simply run <code>npx @ceramicnetwork/create-ceramic-app</code>. This command will guide you through creating a new Ceramic-powered social app in under a minute.    Collect attendance badges at ETHDenver 2024!<br>Ceramic is partnering with <a href="https://fluence.dev/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Fluence</a>, a decentralized computing marketplace, to put forward a demo that will be in play at each of the events above. You will be able to find us at each event and tap a disc to participate! With each attendance you will claim badges represented as documents on Ceramic. Fluence will be consuming the new Ceramic Data Feed API to enable compute over incoming badges.    Deprecation of IDX, Self.ID, Glaze, DID DataStore, 3ID, TileDocuments, Caip10Link<br>3Box Labs announced the deprecation of a suite of outdated Ceramic development tools including Self.ID, Glaze, DID DataStore, 3ID, 3id-datastore, TileDocuments, and Caip10Link. Due to the improvements in ComposeDB an other Ceramic databases over the last 2 years, these tools saw waning demand, creating significant maintenance overhead while failing to meet our strict UX and security standards.

<p>Real-time data monitoring is revolutionizing maintenance and efficiency in industries such as aviation and automotive through digital twin technology.</p> <p>Richard Donaldson, host of the Supply Chain Next podcast, is a visionary in supply chain management and circular economy advocate. His&nbsp; insights on moving from linear to circular supply chains highlight the potential for substantial environmental benefits and the importance of embracing reuse, especially in the context of his work with startups promoting circularity.</p> <p>The dialogue extends beyond the digital twin to the broader digital transformation of global supply chains, drawing comparisons to the quick adoption of airplane wifi as an example of rapid technological progress. It explores the role of artificial intelligence in supply chain automation and predictive maintenance, touching upon the divide between machine learning and self-actualized thought. The conversation resonates with historical references and Richard's personal entrepreneurial experiences, including his tenure at eBay, his podcast Supply Chain Next, and his perspective on learning from failure. This episode offers a thought-provoking reflection on the future of supply chains and the role of technology in sustainable business practices.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Key takeaways:&nbsp;</p>     <p>The early days of the Internet continue to influence current work in digitizing supply chains.</p>     <p>The global supply chain still lacks full digitization and transparency, particularly in older, established processes.</p>     <p>There is a strong advocacy for shifting towards circular supply chains that are environmentally mindful and focused on sustainability.</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guest:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richarddonaldson/">Richard Donaldson on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by Hany Farid, UC Berkeley Professor, CAI Advisor</p><p>News and trends shaping our understanding of generative AI technology and its applications.</p><p>Advances in generative AI continue to stun and amaze. It seems like every month we see rapid progression in the power and realism of AI-generated images, audio, and video. At the same time, it also seems like we are also seeing rapid advances in how the resulting content is being weaponized against individuals, societies, and democracies. In this post, I will discuss trends that have emerged in the new year.</p><p>First it was Instagram ads of Tom Hanks promoting dental plans. Then it was TV personality Gayle King hawking a sketchy weight-loss plan. Next, Elon Musk was shilling for the latest crypto scam, and, most recently, Taylor Swift was announcing a giveaway of Le Creuset cookware. All ads, of course, were fake.&nbsp;</p><p>How it works</p><p>Each of these financial scams was powered by a so-called lip-sync deepfake, itself powered by two separate technologies. First, a celebrity's voice is cloned from authentic recordings. Where it used to take hours of audio to convincingly clone a person's voice, today it takes only 60 to 90 seconds of authentic recording. Once the voice is cloned, an audio file is generated from a simple text prompt in a process called text-to-speech.&nbsp;</p><p>In a variant of this voice cloning, a scammer creates a fake audio file by modifying an existing audio file to sound like someone else. This process is called speech-to-speech. This latter fake is a bit more convincing because with a human voice driving the fake, intonation and cadence tend to be more realistic.</p><p>Once the voice has been created, an original video is modified to make the celebrity’s mouth region move consistently with the new audio. Tools for both the voice cloning and video generation are now readily available online for free or for a nominal cost.</p><p>Although the resulting fakes are not (yet) perfect, they are reasonably convincing, particularly when being viewed on a small mobile screen. The genius — if you can call it that — of these types of fakes is that they can fail 99% of the time and still be highly lucrative for scam artists. More than any other nefarious use of generative AI, it is these types of frauds and scams that seem to have gained the most traction over the past few months.&nbsp;</p><p>Protecting consumers from AI-powered scams</p><p>These scams have not escaped the attention of the US government. In March of last year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/03/scammers-use-ai-enhance-their-family-emergency-schemes">warned</a> citizens about AI-enhanced scams. And more recently, the FTC announced a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/contests/ftc-voice-cloning-challenge">voice cloning challenge</a> designed to encourage "the development of multidisciplinary approaches — from products to policies to procedures — aimed at protecting consumers from AI-enabled voice cloning harms, such as fraud and the broader misuse of biometric data and creative content. The goal of the challenge is to foster breakthrough ideas on preventing, monitoring, and evaluating malicious voice cloning."</p><p>The US Congress is paying attention, too. A bipartisan bill, <a href="https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-coons-blackburn-klobuchar-tillis-announce-draft-of-bill-to-protect-voice-and-likeness-of-actors-singers-performers-and-individuals-from-ai-generated-replicas">the NO FAKES Act</a>, would "prevent a person from producing or distributing an unauthorized AI-generated replica of an individual to perform in an audiovisual or sound recording without the consent of the individual being replicated."&nbsp;</p><p>Acknowledging that there may be legitimate uses of AI-powered impersonations, the Act has carve-outs for protected speech: "Exclusions are provided for the representation of an individual in works that are protected by the First Amendment, such as sports broadcasts, documentaries, biographical works, or for purposes of comment, criticism, or parody, among others." While the NO FAKES Act focuses on consent, Adobe’s proposed Federal Anti-Impersonation Right (the FAIR Act) provides a new mechanism for artists to <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/09/12/fair-act-to-protect-artists-in-age-of-ai">protect their livelihoods</a> while also protecting the evolution of creative style.</p><p>Looking ahead</p><p>Voice scams will come in many forms, from celebrity-powered scams on social media to highly personalized scams on your phone. The conventional wisdom of "If it seems too good to be true, it probably is" will go a long way toward protecting you online. In addition, for now at least, the videos often have telltale signs of AI-generation because there are typically several places where the audio and video appear de-synchronized, like a badly dubbed movie. Recognizing these flaws just requires slowing down and being a little more thoughtful before clicking, sharing, and liking.</p><p>Efforts are underway to add digital provenance or verifiable Content Credentials to audio. Respeecher, a voice-cloning marketplace gaining traction among creators and Hollywood studios, <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/community-story-respeecher">is adding Content Credentials</a> to files generated with its tool.</p><p>For the more personalized attacks that will reach you on your phone in the form of a loved one saying they are in trouble and in need of cash, you and your family should agree on an easy-to-remember secret code word that can easily distinguish an authentic call from a scam.</p>

<p><a href="https://charmverse.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CharmVerse</a>, a pioneering web3 community engagement and onboarding platform, recently integrated ComposeDB on Ceramic to store user attestations for grants and rewards. CharmVerse’s decision to build on Ceramic was driven by the need to store credentials in a user-owned, decentralized manner, without relying on traditional databases.</p><p>A who’s who of well-known web3 projects leverage CharmVerse to help manage their community and grants programs. Optimism, Game7, Mantle, Safe, Green Pill, Purple DAO, Orange DAO, Taiko (and the list goes on) have all experienced the need for a unique, web3-centric platform to interact with and empower their ecosystems.</p> What Objectives Does the Integration Address? <p>The work of vetting developer teams and distributing grants demands a significant investment of time and focus to ensure responsible treasury deployment. This need-driven use case is a wonderful fit for Ceramic’s capabilities.</p><p>CharmVerse identified an opportunity to enhance grants/community managers’ capabilities by implementing a credentialing and rewards system that supports user-sovereign data. This system allows grants managers to better understand their applicants, scale the number of teams they can work with, and issue attestations representing skills and participation in grants and other community programs, creating a verifiable record of participation. However, this solution came with technical challenges in maintaining user data privacy and ownership while ensuring decentralization as this data represents significant insight into the historical activity and capabilities of individuals and teams.</p> Why did CharmVerse Choose Ceramic? <p>CharmVerse considered various options but ultimately chose Ceramic due to its unique capability to support decentralized credentials and store attestations in a way that aligned with CharmVerse's vision. Alex Poon, CEO &amp; co-founder of CharmVerse, shared:</p><p>“Ceramic's unique approach to data decentralization has been a game changer for us, allowing us to truly empower our users while respecting their privacy, allowing users the choice to keep their data private or publish it on-chain. This integration aligns perfectly with CharmVerse's success metrics, centering on community empowerment and data sovereignty.”</p> How did CharmVerse Integrate Ceramic? <p>CharmVerse's integration utilizes Ceramic's ability to store user attestations and leverages Ceramic’s work with the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) as the underlying model for supporting decentralized credentials. The integration was not only a technical milestone for CharmVerse but also achieved the strategic goal of appealing to an audience concerned with data privacy and ownership.</p><p>More specifically, CharmVerse issues off-chain signed attestations in recognition of important grant program milestones (designed to award these credentials both when users create proposals, and when their grants are accepted). Given Ceramic’s open-access design, we expect to see other teams utilize these credentials issued by CharmVerse as a strong indication of applicant reputation, track record, and ability to deliver.</p> How to See CharmVerse in Action <p>This collaboration illustrates the power of innovative solutions in advancing blockchain usability, value, and adoption while maintaining the values of the early cypherpunk vision of decentralization.

<p>What’s the state of identity and authentication in 2024?</p>



<p>That was the primary topic addressed in a day full of insightful speaker sessions and panels at the annual <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/identity-authentication-the-road-ahead/">Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead Policy Forum</a> held on January 25 in Washington D.C. The event was sponsored by the <a href="https://www.betteridentity.org/">Better Identity Coalition</a>, the FIDO Alliance, and the<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/"> ID Theft Resource Center</a> (ITRC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Topics covered included the latest data on identity theft, financial crimes involving compromised identities and the overall ongoing challenges of identity and authentication. The opportunities for phishing-resistant authentication standards and passkeys resonated throughout the event as well. In his opening remarks, Jeremy Grant of the Better Identity Coalition framed identity as both a cause and potential solution to security problems.&nbsp;</p>







 White House advances strong authentication agenda 



<p>In the opening keynote, Caitlin Clarke,&nbsp; Senior Director, White House National Security Council, detailed some of the steps the Biden-Harris administration is taking to improve digital identity and combat rising cybercrime.</p>







<p>“Money is fuelling the ecosystem of crime, but we often see that identity is either the target or the culprit of the cyber incidents that we are seeing every day,” Clarke said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a bid to help improve the state of identity and authentication, the administration is implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all federal government systems. Clarke also highlighted that the administration strongly believes in implementing phishing-resistant MFA.</p>



<p>“We need to make it harder for threat actors to gain access into systems by requiring and ensuring that a person is who they say they are beyond the username and password,” she said. “That is why authentication is also at the heart of the work we are doing to improve the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, upon which we all rely.”</p>



 The role of biometrics 



<p>Biometrics have a role to play in the authentication and identity landscape according to a panel of experts. </p>







<p>The panel included Arun Vemury, Biometrics Expert and ITRC Advisory Board Member; James Lee, COO of the Identity Theft Resource Center; Dr. Stephanie Schuckers, Director, Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR), Clarkson University; and John Breyault VP, Public Policy, Telecom and Fraud, at National Consumers League.</p>



<p>Panelists generally agreed that properly implemented biometrics combined with other security practices could help devalue stolen identity data and strengthen security overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Biometrics has the potential to affect fraud numbers,” Breyault said. “It’s not a silver bullet, it’s not going to stop everyone and, it may not be useful in every context, but it is something different than what we’re doing now.”</p>



 Better Identity at 5 years 



<p>Five years ago, the Better Identity Coalition published Better Identity in America: A Blueprint for Policymakers in response to significant questions from both government and industry about the future of how the United States should address challenges in remote identity proofing and other key issues impacting identity and authentication.</p>







<p>Jeremy Grant, Coordinator at the Better Identity Coalition, detailed the progress made in the past five years and also<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a7b7a8490bade8a77c07789/t/65b00995dd1af8633cbce40c/1706035608068/Better_Identity_Coalition24.pdf"> detailed new guidance</a> for 2024.</p>



<p>The report assessed that while some progress has been made in certain areas like promoting strong authentication, overall the government receives poor grades for failing to prioritize the development of modern remote identity proofing systems or establish a national digital identity strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The revised blueprint outlines 21 new recommendations and action items for policymakers to help close gaps in America’s digital identity infrastructure and get ahead of growing security and privacy challenges posed by issues like synthetic identity fraud and deep fakes.</p>



<p>“Our message today is the same as it was back in 2018, which is that if you take this as a package, if this policy blueprint is enacted and funded by government, it’s going to address some very critical challenges in digital identity and as the name of our coalition would suggest, make things better,” Grant said.</p>



 The year of passkeys 



<p>While there is much to lament about the state of identity and authentication, there is also cause for optimism too.</p>



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance detailed the progress that has been made in the past year with the rollout and adoption of passkey deployments.</p>







<p>“Passkeys are simpler, stronger authentication, they are a password replacement,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar noted that there are now hundreds of companies enabling consumers to use passkeys, which is helping to dramatically improve the overall authentication landscape. Not only is a passkey more secure, he also emphasized that it’s easier for organizations to use, than traditional passwords and MFA approaches.</p>



<p>“If you’re in the business of selling things, or providing content, or anything like that you want people to get on your site as quickly as possible –&nbsp; passkeys are doing that,” he said.</p>



<p>Shikiar noted that the FIDO Alliance understands that user authentication is just one piece of the identity value chain. To that end the FIDO Alliance has multiple efforts beyond passkeys, including certification programs for biometrics and document authenticity certification programs among other efforts.</p>



 Don’t want to get breached? Use strong, phishing-resistant authentication 



<p>The primary importance of strong authentication was highlighted by Chris DeRusha, Federal Chief Information Security Officer in the&nbsp; Office of Management and Budget (OMB), who detailed a recent report on a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapsus$"> Lapsus cybersecurity gang</a> that was released by the Cyber Safety Review Board.&nbsp;</p>







<p>DeRusha noted that Lapsus hackers were able to beat MFA prompts using a variety of techniques, including social engineering and even just mass spamming employees with prompts to get someone to act.</p>



<p>A key recommendation from the report is to move away from phishable forms of MFA, including SMS and instead embrace FIDO based authentication with passkeys.</p>



 The view from FinCEN 



<p>The U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, more commonly known by the acronym FinCEN, is a critical element of the U.S financial system.</p>



<p>FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki spoke at the event about the agency’s recent progress on beneficial ownership reporting and the FinCEN Identity Project. The FinCEN Identity Project refers to FinCEN’s ongoing work related to analyzing how criminals exploit identity-related processes to perpetuate financial crimes. As part of this, FinCEN published a financial trends analysis earlier this month that looked at 2021 Bank Secrecy Act data to quantify how bad actors take advantage of identity processes during account openings, access, and transactions.</p>







<p>“Robust customer identity processes are the foundation of a secure and trusted U.S. financial system and are fundamental to the effectiveness of every financial institution,” Gacki said.</p>



<p>Sean Evans, lead cyber analyst at FinCEN noted that the recent report examined over 3.8 million suspicious activity reports filed in 2021 and found that approximately 1.6 million reports, representing $212 billion in activity, involved some form of identity exploitation.. Evans explained that cybercriminals are finding ways to circumvent or exploit weaknesses in identity validation, verification, and authentication processes to conduct illicit activities like fraud.</p>



<p>Kay Turner, chief digital identity adviser at FinCEN, emphasized that strengthening identity verification is critical for security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have to get identity right, it is vital to building trust in the system,” Turner stated.</p>



 CISA praises the push towards passkeys 



<p>Closing out the event was a keynote from Eric Goldstein, Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, (CISA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p>







<p>Goldstein emphasized that it’s important to note that while there are challenges, there has also been progress. Passkeys are now used by consumers everyday and increasing numbers of enterprises are moving toward passwordless deployments.</p>



<p>“It’s worth starting out just with some reflection on how far we have come in moving towards a passwordless future,” Goldstein said.”We are seeing more and more enterprises moving to passwordless for their enterprise privileges, their admin, their their employee authentication solutions and that’s a remarkable shift.”</p>

<p><a href="https://walletconnect.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect</a> offers Web3 developers powerful tools to make building secure, interactive, and delightful decentralized applications easier. This tooling incorporates best-in-class UX and UI with a modular approach to a suite of SDKs and APIs. For many teams looking to accelerate their development cadence without sacrificing security or quality, WalletConnect's various SDKs are an obvious choice.</p><p>One of our favorites is <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/web3modal/about?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3Modal</a> - a toolset that provides an intuitive interface for dApps to authenticate users and request actions such as signing transactions. Web3Modal supports multiple browser wallets (such as MetaMask and Trust Wallet) and offers thorough instruction in their documentation to help developers get up and running across multiple frameworks (React, Next, Vue, etc). For this tutorial, we will show how to use WalletConnect's Web3Modal for user authentication and the creation of user sessions.</p><p>Ready? Awesome! Let's get started</p> What Will We Build? <p>For this tutorial, we will build an application to track event attendance. The use case here is somewhat basic - imagine a conference that wants to keep track of which participants went to which event. They might allow participants to scan a QR code that takes them to this application where they can sign in (with their wallet), optionally opt into sharing their location, and generate a badge showing that they attended.</p><p>Here's a simple visual of the user flow:</p><p>Based on the summary above, it might be obvious where Web3Modal fits in. That's right - we will be using this SDK to authenticate users and keep track of who attended what event based on their wallet address.</p><p>We've made up two imaginary events to align with this use case:</p>  Encryption Event  Wallet Event  <p>Below is a sneak peek at our app's UI:</p> What's Included in Our Technical Stack? <p>To power this simple application, we will need a few things:</p>  A frontend framework that runs in the attendee's browser and a backend to handle any internal API calls we'll need - we will use NextJS   Wallet tooling so we don't have to build authentication logic from scratch - Web3Modal  React hooks that work with our browser wallet so we don't have to build these either - we'll use <a href="https://wagmi.sh/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Wagmi</a>  Decentralized data storage - we'll use <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB</a> (graph database built on <a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>)   Why ComposeDB? <p>If dealing with potentially thousands (or more) attendees to these imaginary events (as is often the case with large conferences), storing these records on-chain would be both costly and inefficient. Each record would incur gas fees, and querying the blockchain across tens of thousands of records would be arduous.</p><p>Nonetheless, we want our application to give data control to the users who attend the events. And, in our imaginary use case, other conferences must have access to this data (not just our application) so they can determine who should receive admission priority. We will therefore require some sort of decentralized data network. </p><p>In Ceramic (which is what ComposeDB is built on), user data is organized into verifiable <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/streams/event-log?ref=blog.ceramic.network">event streams</a> that are controlled exclusively by the user account that created each stream. Since Ceramic is a permissionless open data network, any application can easily join and access preexisting user data (which meets one of the requirements listed above). </p><p>Applications that build on Ceramic/ComposeDB <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-client/user-sessions?ref=blog.ceramic.network">authenticate users</a> (using sign-in with Ethereum), creating tightly-scoped permission for the application to write data to the network on the user's behalf. This is important for us because our application's server will need to cryptographically sign the badge (to prove the badge was indeed generated through our application) before saving the output in Ceramic on the user's behalf.</p><p>Finally, ComposeDB adds a graph database interface on top of Ceramic, making it easy to query, filter, order, and more (using GraphQL) across high document volumes - an ideal fit for any teams who want to consume these badges and perform computation over them in an efficient manner.</p><p>We will go into more detail throughout this tutorial.</p> Getting Started <p>We have set up a special repository for you to help guide you through - keep in mind that we will need to add to it using the below steps for it to work.</p><p>Start by cloning the demo application repository and install your dependencies:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/walletconnect-tutorial
cd walletconnect-tutorial
npm install</code> <p>Go ahead and open the directory in your code editor of choice. If you take a look at your package.json file, you'll see our<code>@web3modal/wagmi</code> and <code>wagmi</code> packages mentioned above, as well as several <code>@ceramicnetwork</code> and <code>@composedb</code> packages to meet our storage needs.</p> Obtain a WalletConnect Project ID <p>While your dependencies are downloading, you can create a WalletConnect project ID (which we'll need to configure our Web3Modal - more information on <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/web3modal/nextjs/about?ref=blog.ceramic.network">their docs</a>). You can do so for free by visiting their <a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect Cloud</a> site, creating a new project (with the "App" type selected), and a name of your choosing:</p><p>After you click "Create" you will be directed to the settings page for the project you just set up. Go ahead and copy the alphanumeric value you see next to "Project ID."</p><p>Back in your text editor, navigate to your <code>/src/pages/_app.tsx</code> file and enter the ID you just copied into the blank field next to the <code>projectId</code> constant. Notice how we use this ID and a mainnet chain setting when defining our <code>wagmiConfig</code> (later used to create our Web3Modal). Just as the <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/web3modal/nextjs/about?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3Modal docs</a> instructed, we are setting up these functions outside our React components, and wrapping all child components with our <code>WagmiConfig</code> wrapper:</p> <code>const projectId = '&lt;your project ID&gt;'

const chains = [mainnet]
const wagmiConfig = defaultWagmiConfig({ chains, projectId })

createWeb3Modal({ wagmiConfig, projectId, chains })


const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;WagmiConfig config={wagmiConfig}&gt;
    &lt;ComposeDB&gt;
      &lt;Component {...pageProps} ceramic /&gt;
      &lt;/ComposeDB&gt;
    &lt;/WagmiConfig&gt;
  );
}

export default MyApp</code> <p>We can now make our Web3Modal button accessible to child components of our application to allow our users to sign in. If you take a look at <code>/src/components/nav.tsx</code>, you'll see that we placed our <code>&lt;w3m-button /&gt;</code> component directly into our navigation to allow users to sign in/out on any page of our application (at the moment our application only has 1 page). </p><p>Notice how we make use of the <code>size</code> and <code>balance</code> properties - these are two of several settings developers can use to further customize the modal's appearance. These two in particular are fairly simple to understand - one alters the size of the button, while the other hides the user's balance when the user is authenticated.</p><p>Finally, you probably noticed in your <code>/src/pages/_app.tsx</code> file that we're also utilizing a <code>&lt;ComposeDB&gt;</code> context wrapper. This is what we will explain next.</p> Create a ComposeDB Configuration <p>Now that we've created our Wagmi configuration, we will need to set up our ComposeDB data storage. There are several steps involved (all of which have been taken care of for you). These include:</p>  Designing the data models our application will need  Creating a local node/server configuration for this demo (in production)  Deploying our data models onto our node  Defining the logic our application will use to read from + write to our ComposeDB node  <p>Data Models</p><p>If you take a look at your <code>/composites</code> folder, you'll see an <code>/attendance.graphql</code> file where we've already defined the models our application will use. In ComposeDB, <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling?ref=blog.ceramic.network">data models</a> are GraphQL schema that contain the requirements for a single piece of data (a social post, for example), in addition to its relations to other models and accounts. Since Ceramic is an open data network, developers can build on preexisting data models (you can explore tools like <a href="https://scan.s3.xyz/models?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">S3</a> to observe existing schema), or define brand new ones for your app.</p><p>In our case, our application will leverage a general event interface that our two event types will implement:</p> <code>interface GeneralAttendance
  @createModel(description: "An interface to query general attendance") {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: String! @string(minLength: 42, maxLength: 42)
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
  timestamp: DateTime!
  jwt: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}

type EncryptionEvent implements GeneralAttendance
  @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "An encryption event attendance") {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: String! @string(minLength: 42, maxLength: 42)
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
  timestamp: DateTime!
  jwt: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}

type WalletEvent implements GeneralAttendance
  @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "A wallet event attendance") {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: String! @string(minLength: 42, maxLength: 42)
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
  timestamp: DateTime!
  jwt: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}</code> <p>Notice how we've set the <code>accountRelation</code> field for both types to "SINGLE" - what this means is that 1 user can only ever have 1 model instance of that type, thus creating a 1:1 account relationship. This is contrasted with "LIST" <code>accountRelation</code> which would indicate a 1:many relationship.</p><p>You'll also notice that our <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> fields do not use a <code>!</code> next to their scalar definition - what this means is that they are optional, so a model instance can be created with or without these fields defined.</p><p>Finally, we will use our <code>jwt</code> field to record the signed badge payload our server will create for the user. Since the user will ultimately be in control of their data, a potentially deceptive could try to change the values of their model instance outside the confines of our application. Seeing as our architecture requires a way for both our application and other conferences to read and verify this data, the <code>jwt</code> field will create tamper-evident proof against the values by tying the cryptographic signature of our application's DID together with the data.</p><p>Create a Local Server Configuration</p><p>Seeing as this is just a demo application and we don't have a cloud-hosted node endpoint to access, we will define a <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server?ref=blog.ceramic.network">server configuration</a> to run locally on our computer. While there are multiple <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server/server-configurations?ref=blog.ceramic.network">server settings</a> an application can leverage, the key items to know for this demo are the following:</p>  Our app will run <code>inmemory</code> whereas a production application will use <code>mainnet</code> for their network setting  Our server will define <code>sqlite</code> as our SQL index, whereas a production application would use <code>PostgreSQL</code>  Our IPFS will run in <code>bundled</code> mode (ideal for early prototyping), whereas a production application will run in <code>remote</code>  <p>Finally, each Ceramic node is configured with an admin DID used to authenticate with the node and perform tasks like deploying models. This is different from the DIDs end users will use when authenticating themselves using their wallet and writing data to the network.</p><p>Fortunately for you, we've taken care of this for you by creating a command. Simply run the following in your terminal once your dependencies are installed:</p> <code>npm run generate</code> <p>If you take a look at your <code>admin_seed.txt</code> file you will see the admin seed your Ceramic node will use. Your <code>composedb.config.json</code> file is where you'll find the server configuration you just created.</p><p>Deploying the Models onto Our Node</p><p>Seeing as we're not using a preexisting node endpoint that's already set up to index the data models we care about, we'll need a way to deploy our definitions onto our node. If you look at <code>/scripts/composites.mjs</code> you'll find a <code>writeComposite</code> method we've created for you that reads from our GraphQL file, creates an encoded runtime definition and deploys the composite onto our local node running on port 7007.</p><p>The important thing to take note of here is how the <code>writeEncodedCompositeRuntime</code> method generates a definition in our definition.js file. We will explain in the next step how this is used by our client-side library to allow our application to interact with these data models and our Ceramic node.</p><p>Don't take any action yet - we will explain how to use this script in the coming steps.</p><p>Integrating ComposeDB with Our Application</p><p>Finally, as mentioned above, we will need a way for our application to read from and write to our ComposeDB node. We will also need a way to combine our Web3Modal authentication logic with the need to authenticate users onto our node.</p><p>If you take a look at <code>/src/fragments/index.tsx</code> you'll find a <code>ComposeDB</code> component that allows us to utilize React's <code>createContext</code> hook and create a wrapper of our own. Since we know Web3Modal will make use of our wallet client, we can leverage the wallet client to request a Ceramic user session authentication from our user.</p><p>Observe the following:</p> <code>const CERAMIC_URL = process.env.URL ?? "http://localhost:7007";

/**
 * Configure ceramic Client &amp; create context.
 */
const ceramic = new CeramicClient(CERAMIC_URL);

const compose = new ComposeClient({
  ceramic,
  definition: definition as RuntimeCompositeDefinition,
});

let isAuthenticated = false;

const Context = createContext({ compose, isAuthenticated });

export const ComposeDB = ({ children }: ComposeDBProps) =&gt; {
  function StartAuth() {
    const { data: walletClient } = useWalletClient();
    const [isAuth, setAuth] = useState(false);

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
      async function authenticate(
        walletClient: GetWalletClientResult | undefined,
      ) {
        if (walletClient) {
          const accountId = await getAccountId(
            walletClient,
            walletClient.account.address,
          );
          const authMethod = await EthereumWebAuth.getAuthMethod(
            walletClient,
            accountId,
          );
          const session = await DIDSession.get(accountId, authMethod, {
            resources: compose.resources,
          });

          await ceramic.setDID(session.did as unknown as DID);
          console.log("Auth'd:", session.did.parent);
          localStorage.setItem("did", session.did.parent);
          setAuth(true);
        }
      }
      void authenticate(walletClient);
    }, [walletClient]);

    return isAuth;
  }

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    isAuthenticated = StartAuth();
  }

  return (
    &lt;Context.Provider value={{ compose, isAuthenticated }}&gt;
      {children}
    &lt;/Context.Provider&gt;
  );
};</code> <p>Notice how we're using the wallet client's account address to initiate a DID session that asks for specific resources from <code>compose</code>. If you track deeper, you'll see that <code>compose</code> was instantiated using the <code>definition</code> imported from the file our deployment script wrote into. This allows us to access a limited scope to write data on the user's behalf specifically for the data models our application uses (these sessions auto-expire after 24 hours).</p><p>Finally, to bring this full circle, back to our <code>/src/pages/_app.tsx</code> file, you should now understand how we're able to use <code>ComposeDB</code> as a contextual wrapper, enabling us to access both the ComposeDB client libraries and our model definitions from within any child component. For example, if you take a look at <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> you'll see how we're now able to utilize our <code>useComposeDB</code> hook that allows us to run queries against our node's client. </p> Create a Seed for our Application's Server DID <p>We mentioned above that we'll want our application to sign each badge payload before handing document control back to the end user. While this flow will not always be the case (read this blog on common <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/data-control-patterns-in-decentralized-storage/">data control patterns</a> in Ceramic for more), we'll want to implement this to ensure the verifiability of the data.</p><p>In <code>/src/pages/api/create.ts</code> we've created an API our application's server will expose that does exactly this - it intakes the data relevant to the event, uses a <code>SECRET_KEY</code> environment variable to instantiate a static DID, and returns a Base64 string-encoded JSON web signature containing the signed data.</p><p>We will therefore need to create a separate static seed to store in a .env file that we'll create:</p> <code>touch .env</code> <p>For this tutorial, enter the following key-value pair into your new file:</p><p><code>SECRET_KEY="11b574d316903ced6cc3f4787bbcc3047d9c72d1da4d83e36fe714ef785d10c1"</code></p><p>When you use the above seed to instantiate a DID, this will yield the following predictable did:</p><p><code>did:key:z6MkqusKQfvJm7CPiSRkPsGkdrVhTy8EVcQ65uB5H2wWzMMQ</code></p><p>If you look back into <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> you'll see how our lengthy <code>getParams</code> the method performs a quick check against any existing <code>EncryptionEvent</code> or <code>WalletEvent</code> badges the user already holds to test whether the <code>jwt</code> value was indeed signed by our application (a more thorough version of this could include verifying that the signed data matches the same values from the other fields, but we'll leave that up to you to add).</p><p>That's it! We are finally ready to run our application!</p> Running the Application <p>Now that we've set up everything we need for our app to run locally, we can start it up in developer mode. Be sure to select the correct node version first:</p> <code>nvm use 20
npm run dev</code> <p>Once you see the following in your terminal, your application is ready to view in your browser:</p><p>In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000 - you should see the following:</p> Signing in with Web3Modal <p>As mentioned above, we've made our Web3Modal accessible from our navigation which is where our "Connect Wallet" button is coming from. Go ahead and give this button a click and select your wallet of choice.</p><p>During the sign-in cadence, you will notice an additional authorization message appear in your wallet that looks something like this:</p><p>If you recall what we covered in the "Integrating ComposeDB with Our Application" section above, you'll remember that we discussed how we created a <code>DIDSession</code> by requesting authorization over the specific resources (data models) our application will be using. These are the 3 items listed under the "Resources" section of the sign-in request you should see. </p><p>Finally, after you've signed in, your Web3Modal will now show a truncated version of your address:</p> Creating Badges <p>As you can see, our application does not allow the user to input which event they have attended - this will be determined based on the URL the QR code sends the user with the following format:</p><p><a href="http://localhost:3000/?event=%7Bevent+id%7D&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000/?event={event id}</a></p><p>Take a look at your browser console - you should see logs that look similar to this:</p><p>We've preset these logs for you by reading from our runtime composite definition that we've imported into the <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> component. Go ahead and copy one of those fields and construct your URL to look something like this:</p><p><a href="http://localhost:3000/?event=kjzl6hvfrbw6c8njv24a3g4e3w2jsm5dojwpayf4pobuasbpvskv21vwztal9l2&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000/?event=kjzl6hvfrbw6c8njv24a3g4e3w2jsm5dojwpayf4pobuasbpvskv21vwztal9l2</a></p><p>If you've copied the stream ID corresponding to the <code>EncryptionEvent</code> model, your UI should now look something like this:</p><p>You can optionally select to share your coordinates. Finally, go ahead and create a badge for whichever event you entered into your URL:</p><p>If you navigate back to your <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> file you can observe what's happening in <code>createBadge</code>. After calling our <code>/api/create</code> route (which uses our application server's static DID to sign the event data), we're performing a mutation query that creates an instance of whichever event aligns with the identifier you used in your URL parameter. Since our user is the account currently authenticated on our node (from the creation of our DID session), the resulting document is placed into the control of the end user (with our tamper-evident signed data entered into the <code>jwt</code> field). </p><p>If you take a look at our <code>getParams</code> method in our <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> file, you'll notice that we've created a query against our ComposeDB node that runs both within our <code>useEffect</code> React hook as well as after every badge creation event. Notice how we're querying based on the user's did:pkh: <code>did:pkh:eip155:${chainId}:${address?.toLowerCase()}</code></p><p>If you take a look at our <code>chainId</code> and <code>address</code> assignments, you'll realize these are coming from our Wagmi hooks we mentioned we'd need (specifically <code>useAccount</code> and <code>useChainId</code>). </p> What's Next? <p>We hope you've enjoyed this fairly straightforward walk-through of how to use WalletConnect's Web3Modal toolkit for authenticating users, creating user sessions in Ceramic, and querying ComposeDB based on the authenticated user! While that's all for this tutorial, we encourage you to explore the other possibilities and journies Ceramic has to offer.

<p>In today’s fast-moving business world, it’s important for different systems to work well together, and having standard data formats helps a lot with this. This article investigates how the EmployeeID is used, which is a key part of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). The adoption group from DIDAS has worked on making sure this EmployeeID follows a set standard. Thanks to their work, we can now see how the EmployeeID can be used in real situations and think about how it can be used more in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demonstrating Real-World Applications&nbsp;</p>
<p>The practicality of the EmployeeID VC was tested in real-world scenarios by organizations SBB, AXA, Orell Füssli, and Swisscom. Together they showed the power of an interoperable eco system based on the credential “EmployeeID”. These demos showcased varied applications:&nbsp;</p>
 
 SBB: Used the VC for external partners to access internal IT systems, replacing traditional username/password methods.&nbsp; 
 AXA: Employed the VC to verify employment status for online insurance offerings.&nbsp; 
 Orell Füssli &amp; Swisscom: Utilized the VC to offer employee discounts in online shopping.&nbsp; 
 
<p>More information here: <a href="https://digitaltrust.swisscom.ch/en/das-potenzial-von-digitalen-nachweisen-aus-dem-privatsektor-erfolgreich-getestet/">Successfully testing the potential of digital evidence from the private sector</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Collaboration: The Key to Adoption&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the primary goals was to ensure that the EmployeeID could seamlessly integrate into various ecosystems. This required a standardized approach that would allow different systems and organizations to interact without compatibility issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process was not an isolated endeavor. It involved a collaborative effort from experts and stakeholders across different industries. By pooling their knowledge and insights, the group could identify and agree on the most relevant and sustainable attributes. This collaborative approach was instrumental in developing a schema that was not only effective for the present but also robust enough to stand the test of time and technological evolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The outcome of these pre-implementation discussions was a well-thought-out, standardized EmployeeID schema. This schema serves as a testament to the importance of foresight and collaboration in the digital age. By addressing the need for standardization and futureproofing at the initial stages, the EmployeeID schema was positioned to be an enduring and versatile tool, capable of adapting to the ever-changing business and technological landscapes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EmployeeID Schema&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EmployeeID schema incorporates various attributes, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Employee Core: A blend of personal and employer data.&nbsp; 
 Employment Contract: Key contractual information like contract type and working hours.&nbsp; 
 Role: The employee’s role and organizational unit.&nbsp; 
 Office Address: The physical office location.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Authorization: Specific access rights issued as separate VCs.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While many attributes are initially represented as free text in the logical schema, they should ideally be derived from predefined lists or tables for specific implementations. This becomes especially critical when exchanging information with other organizations, necessitating mutually agreed-upon value sets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detailed Schema: <a href="https://didasswiss.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/DIDASMembers/EcxwlWwuKbFCqu09DvSGd2QBK8cscFfDHJA3zP9WUzMxeQ?e=e3Ltup">Detailed Schema of EmployeID</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion&nbsp;</p>
<p>For organizations exploring use cases with SSI or sandbox environments, it’s crucial to engage with the DIDAS adoption group. This collaboration will help define a standard for your verifiable credentials, ensuring a unified approach and compatibility across different ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, the adoption of a standardized EmployeeID schema, as illustrated by DIDAS adoption group, is not just a technical necessity but a strategic move towards interoperability and efficiency in the digital age.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Yet to date, there is no known scheme considered truly interoperable across borders. SIDI Hub was was conceived as a community to accelerate the path to cross-border interoperability.</p><p>SIDI Hub held its first summit at TRUSTECH 2023. DIF was one of the event organizers, alongside our liaison partners including the Open ID Foundation, Open Identity Exchange, FIDO and Open Wallet Foundation. </p><p>120+ digital identity experts from governments, multilaterals, standards organizations, and non-profits representing 22 countries attended. Over 90% of participants agreed that the work started at the summit must continue in 2024. In response, the SIDI Hub community has defined the following work plan:</p>  Identifying champion use cases for cross-border interoperability that serve as baseline for all workstreams  Defining minimum interoperability requirements for priority use cases  Mapping trust frameworks across jurisdictions  Defining metrics of success  <p>The group is organizing a series of virtual and in-person meetings this year to progress the roadmap, and invites all organizations involved in the development, adoption and implementation of digital identity solutions to add their voice to this important work.

The project was established in 2018 at the International Institute for Information Technology in Bangalore. Today, over 100 million citizens in 11 countries are registered on MOSIP-based systems. </p><p>The&nbsp;inaugural MOSIP Connect promises to bring together technologists, policy makers and civil society groups for in-depth discussions and collaboration on inclusive digital identity systems. Participants will learn how digital identity empowers citizens and promotes inclusion, explore how MOSIP addresses concerns around data protection, privacy, and consent, and benefit from networking opportunities.</p> 🗓️ ️Community Events <p>Digital Switzerland</p><p>DIF’s Executive Director, Kim Hamilton Duffy, participated in a panel discussion on the importance of digital identity wallets alongside Beat Jans, the new Head of Switzerland’s Federal Ministry of Justice, who is responsible for the country’s digital identity policy, Stephan Wolf, the outgoing CEO of GLEIF and Daniel Goldscheider, founder of DIF's liaison partner, the Open Wallet Foundation.</p><p>The panel was convened after Mr Jans decided to visit the host event, Digital Switzerland, which took place in Davos recently, at short notice.</p><p>A Swiss E-ID was proposed to voters but rejected in 2021 due to fears that citizens could be tracked during verification, and that private companies would collect and store their data in centralized databases. Subsequent revisions focused on addressing these issues, with Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles taking center stage.&nbsp;</p><p>During the panel discussion, Kim pointed out that much of the unnecessary personal data sharing that typically accompanies customer onboarding is due to the lack of a strong digital identity. Conversely, digital identity based on open standards and SSI principles avoids data oversharing by design. It also offers powerful new economic opportunities, by providing the means to share a wide range of identity data in a privacy-preserving way.&nbsp;</p><p>Kim highlighted the opportunity for “reusable identity”, tying it to improved onboarding enabled by decentralized identity standards, and described how Verifiable Credentials (VCs) provide an ‘envelope’ that can store messages ranging from government-backed Identity data to competencies or skills certifications.&nbsp;</p><p>“Once relying parties trust that the envelope securely wraps and conveys one type of message, it opens the door for others, which offer some of the most exciting, potentially transformative signifiers of trust," she said after the event.</p><p>“Risks of AI were also an urgent topic of discussion. Indeed the waves of disinformation are getting bigger and coming faster as it becomes easier and cheaper to exploit the possibilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and deepfakes. Decentralized identity architectures enable harnessing the benefits of AI but with a stronger, more trustworthy foundation. The standards were designed to apply to Non Person Entities (NPEs) as well as natural persons. So for example, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VC) can establish a chain of trust demonstrating an AI agent is acting on behalf of a natural person.” </p><p>DIF Hackathon Winners share their insights and experiences </p><p>DIF caught up with Ken Watanbe, whose team's submission for the DIF Hackathon scooped first place in the TBD (Block) and Trinsic sponsor challenges, as well as winning second place in the main DIF prize pool.  </p><p>You can read about the team's innovative use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs) to enable a real-world use case within their university premises <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/guest-blog-ken-watanabe-anonymous-door-unlocking-project/">here</a>. </p><p>We also spoke to Harsh Tyagi, whose team developed HealthX Protocol, winning third place in the DIF Hackathon main prize pool, as well as third place in the TBD (Block) sponsored challenge.</p><p>Read the interview with Harsh <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/heatlhx-protocol/">here</a>. </p><p>Finally, Edward Curran told us about his path to the Hackathon, how he found developing TrustBox using Veramo and his experience of participating in the DIF community.

 Innovating Energy: Digital Identities at the Core of Transformation <p>ZUG, Switzerland — January 31, 2024, The German Energy Agency Deutsche Energy Agentur (DENA), has announced a partnership with Energy Web, Forschungsstelle für Energiewirtschaft e.V. Oli Systems, KILT Protocol, Fieldfisher, and Fraunhofer FIT to launch DIVE — “Digital Identities as Trust Anchors in the Energy System.” DIVE is set to redefine the energy sector in Germany, leveraging the potential of digital identities to integrate and manage renewable energies in a decentralized landscape.</p><p>The Energy System Transformation<br>As part of the urgent effort to achieve climate neutrality, Germany is embracing a massive expansion of renewable energies. This shift is leading to a decentralized energy system with an increasing number of small scale renewable energy facilities prolifterating including wind turbines, solar parks, batteries, electric vehicles, and distributed rooftop solar installations. In this new landscape, consumer choice and seamless integration to various use cases like tracing renewable energy, using customer-owned assets for grid services or selecting a different supplier is vital for efficient energy management.</p><p>Introducing Digital Identities for Trust and Efficiency<br>At the heart of the DIVE project lies a critical objective — establishing secure and reliable digital identities for devices and systems within the energy sector. These digital identities act as trust anchors, verifying the existence and capabilities of each system in real time. By automating verification processes, DIVE allows device owners to choose and change the electricity use cases that their devices are participating in almost no time and little effort, ensuring grid stability and cost savings for energy consumers.</p><p>Energy Web plays a central role in the DIVE project, contributing expertise and technology to two working packages:</p><p>Digital Applications in Proof Management Energy Web is taking the lead in developing and implementing use cases related to electricity labeling and verification. This includes the use of digital identities in conjunction with the registry and exploring energy industry use cases and their links to the identity register. Additionally, Energy Web’s contribution involves extending its existing open-source Green Proofs solution to connect to the digital trust anchors of DIVE and leveraging the substrate-based Energy Web X chain&nbsp;(EWX).</p><p>Energy Web’s Green Proofs solution enables trustworthy device identities to connect with different registers for guarantees of origin. This empowers devices to freely choose and switch between standards and marketplaces without encountering compliance issues like double spending. Energy Web aims to support existing standards and platforms, such as EnergyTag, Energy Track&amp;Trace (an Elia Group platform in collaboration with energinet and Elering), GO, REC, I-REC, and the German guarantees of origin register (Herkunftsnachweisregister — HKNR).</p><p>Furthermore, Energy Web continues to advance the development of its “Fast Change of Supplier for EV Charging Stations” solution (<a href="https://innovation.eliagroup.eu/en/projects/rebeam">ReBeam</a>). Initially tested with Elia Group &amp; 50Hertz Transmission in Berlin during the summer of 2022, the project now integrates with DIVE to enhance security and confidence in the entire process. This integration ultimately allows the consumption of self-generated PV power at public charging stations.</p><p>Smart Contract Library In addition, Energy Web will develop standardized representation and description forms for smart contracts under DIVE. This includes classification within the energy industry context, ensuring implementation-independent descriptions of inputs, outputs, conditions, and logic of smart contracts. The establishment of a “Smart Contract Register” as an “App Store” for decentralized applications and logic devices, along with the provision of smart contracts under free licenses, will set the groundwork for an independent technology library.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers.

<p>What led you to start working with Decentralized Identity?&nbsp;</p><p>I studied computer science at university and wrote my dissertation on Bitcoin, as well as developing using Hyperledger Fabric, so I’ve been in the Web3 world for a while.</p><p>After uni I got involved in a research project looking into how the mortgage application process could be improved, as part of a knowledge transfer partnership between a university and a bank.</p><p>Applying for a mortgage is slow and painful, so streamlining it should make it better for customers and cheaper for the bank. The number of parties — including buyer and seller, lenders, conveyancers, estate agents, credit reference agencies and the Land Registry — made us think “This seems like a problem blockchain can help to solve”.&nbsp;</p><p>However when we spoke to the parties involved, it became clear the core challenge is a data problem. There’s a need to securely exchange data about the property and the participants. That’s not easy, as a lot of the information is private.</p><p>All the guidance was, “Don’t put personal information on the blockchain”. So we searched around and learned about SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). We visited the Rebuilding the Web of Trust (RWOT) conference and got excited. We thought, “This seems like the right way to do it”.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point I realised I wanted to work in decentralized identity, so I moved to Berlin and worked at Jolocom.&nbsp;</p><p>Tell us about TrustBox, please &nbsp;</p><p>I’m not the only one who’s seen these problems with the property buying process. After I returned to the UK I got involved with the Property Data Trust Framework, which is a group of financial institutions, conveyancers and other industry participants working together to standardise data schemas.&nbsp;</p><p>I came in to try to find a way to standardise the data exchange using VCs. To do that, you need to know who’s allowed to issue and verify certain things, so I started looking into the DIF Trust Establishment specification, which is when I saw the publicity for the DIF Hackathon.&nbsp;</p><p>I thought “I can build something using Trust Establishment”. Initially I was looking at the organizational side. If each organization has a DID, they can recognize each other. I was less clear how it would work for buyers and sellers. DIDs are quite an abstract concept for people to get their heads around.&nbsp;</p><p>People do most of their research on the web, and I liked the idea of mimicking the SSL padlock (the icon displayed by browsers when visiting a secure website) so it verifies a site is part of the Property Data Trust Framework. So we developed a browser extension called TrustSight, building on existing work around DID configurations (used to cryptographically link a DID to a domain).</p><p>We also built a tool for deploying trust frameworks, and a tool to visualize trust relationships.</p><p>Why did you choose to develop using Veramo?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s tricky maintaining all these DIDs and DID configurations. There's a package by Sphereon around DID configurations, but it doesn’t provide any tooling around issuing or verifying credentials.</p><p>I was struggling to get the browser extension to work with JSON LD libraries, so I decided to use Veramo for DID and VC related operations and connect to the Sphereon resolver.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s made my life much easier, particularly if I want to use a new DID method or different VC formats.</p><p>What user benefits are you targeting?&nbsp;</p><p>As a buyer, ideally you’d apply to a hundred different lenders in order to get the best deal. However, it’s currently too expensive for lenders to do the checks. As a result, each buyer can really only apply for one mortgage, so people are very conservative about what they are looking for, to ensure they secure a mortgage. </p><p>We’re aiming to make the mortgage application process quicker and easier, and to ensure people get the right product for them.&nbsp;</p><p>How was your experience of participating in the Hackathon?&nbsp;</p><p>It was very well-organised. The criteria and timelines were all clear. I really enjoyed the Discord server. Some people were very active there, which made it feel like a community. I also liked the talks that were put on.</p><p>It was great to get to the end and see everyone’s submissions, and to feel connected and part of the community.&nbsp;</p><p>What next for TrustBox?&nbsp;</p><p>There is some tooling on the Trust Framework side that doesn’t yet exist, so I’d like to work with DIF on that.&nbsp;</p><p>Downloading a browser extension is still quite a big piece of user friction, ultimately you want to get into the browser itself. That’s one to discuss with the browser companies! </p>

 Part 2: Stemmatic Traceability  Further Explorations <p>Building on the foundational exploration of semantic interoperability in Part 1, we delve deeper into the innovative fusion of traditional methodologies with modern computational models. Previously, we discussed the pivotal roles of decentralized semantics and Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) in enabling semantic interoperability between data models and data representation formats across varied environments. We also explored how morphological and epistemological semantics enhance our understanding of data, setting the stage for preserving meaning and context across digital platforms.</p><p>In this installment, we introduce&nbsp;"stemmatic traceability,"&nbsp;marrying the ancient discipline of Stemmatics, focusing on tracing textual variations and origins, to contemporary event provenance models like Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). This synergy enhances data integrity mechanisms and seamlessly integrates classical textual analysis with cutting-edge event provenance practices. Through this exploration, we aim to demonstrate how the principles of Stemmatics, previously confined to textual criticism, enhance semantic interoperability by offering innovative ways to track the evolution of digital objects.</p> The Convergence of Stemmatics and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for Enhanced Data Integrity <p>In the dynamic landscape of digital content and data object evolution,&nbsp;'Stemma'&nbsp;[1] emerges as a versatile umbrella term, encompassing diverse tree structures representing the evolution of digital objects. Traditionally linked to textual criticism,&nbsp;'Stemma'&nbsp;transcends its origins, mirroring the characteristics of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), a robust model for version control systems, and more. It is a unifying genealogical tree encompassing trackable events in depicting the evolution of digital content.</p><p>Converging advanced data structures and traditional textual analysis methodologies in data management is profound and strategic. One of the exemplary intersections is the alignment between DAGs and the time-honored principles of Stemmatics. This synergy unveils a dynamic landscape where event provenance models enable tracing the evolution of systemic objects, enhancing data integrity and reliability across diverse computational ecosystems.</p><p>"Stemmatics"&nbsp;is a discipline within textual criticism that involves studying and analyzing the relationships among various copies of a text to reconstruct the original or an earlier form of that text.

  <p>A more precise understanding of data lineage and text variation between the ordered, hierarchical structuring of texts in Stemmatics and the nodal representation of data within DAGs demonstrate how these causal models encapsulate complex, multifaceted data.</p><p>Mirroring&nbsp;'Stemmatics,'&nbsp;which focuses on tracing texts back to their original form or archetype by unraveling their complex, layered evolutions, DAGs enable a similar journey for data objects. Every node, representing a distinct event or data state, is a stepping stone that leads back to the root (i.e., the source node) – the initial event. All other nodes (events) are causally or sequentially linked, directly or indirectly, to the source node without cycles. Each edge in the DAG signifies a direct influence or connection between events, tracing back to the initial event as the origin. Traceable tree-like structures bring transparency to the fields of data evolution and data integrity. In a digital world where data is as fluid as it is expansive, such a structured approach is instrumental in mitigating data corruption, loss, or misinterpretation.</p> Integrating Kinematical Mechanics and Data Stemmatics <p>Marking the convergence of classical and modern computational paradigms, the role of structures like DAGs, imbued with the essence of principles like Stemmatics, serve as pillars of data integrity, ensuring that as data traverses the complex pathways of digital systems, its essence, authenticity, and assurance remain intact and enriched, offering a foundation for causal representation.</p><p>Introducing "kinematical mechanics" [3] into our discussion, we delve into how this discipline optimizes event pathways and interactions within digital environments.&nbsp;Kinematical mechanics&nbsp;contributes to authentic data provenance and system performance by employing motion and event sequencing concepts, enhancing workflow optimization and data processing. Integrating morphological semantics and&nbsp;kinematical mechanics&nbsp;lays the groundwork for data stemmatics, offering a comprehensive framework for representing and understanding the sequence and patterns in data evolution.</p>  <p>Kinematical Mechanics: In data-centric design,&nbsp;kinematical mechanics&nbsp;analyzes and optimizes event pathways and interactions within digital environments. This discipline employs the study of motion sequences and patterns to enhance the understanding and organization of event sequences, crucially contributing to authentic data provenance and improved system performance. Its importance in workflow optimization enables computational task scheduling and data processing pipelines. Understanding the sequences of events and their causality is fundamental to achieving system efficiency and optimal performance.</p>  <p>Example:&nbsp;In data analysis, 'Kinematical Mechanics' investigates the sequence and patterns of specific events, such as data updates or user interactions, and their impact on the system's behavior within a defined framework.</p><p>Morphological semantics and kinematical mechanics form the basis for data stemmatics, offering traceable genealogical structures to represent causal relationships between tangible&nbsp;'objects'&nbsp;and recorded&nbsp;'events,'&nbsp;providing a comprehensive understanding of data evolution.</p>

    <p>Data Stemmatics: Data stemmatics explores the causal relationships behind data evolution, utilizing traceable graph structures with root archetypes to depict genealogical hypotheses about data relationships driven by content and historical context. It identifies the causes of data changes and offers insights into data evolution across domains. Data stemmatics is concerned with objects and events, delving into the cause of data modifications.</p>  <p>Data stemmatics clarifies the lineage of data changes and provides deeper insights into data evolution across various domains, thus enhancing our ability to achieve genuine semantic interoperability.</p> OCA and DAGs: A Synergetic Combination for Stemmatic Traceability <p>Stemmatic traceability, rooted in textual criticism and historical data analysis, is crucial in tracing data origins, transformations, and evolutionary paths. This method goes beyond mere nodal relationships to offer a nuanced understanding of data's evolutionary journey, thereby significantly improving our capacity for semantic interoperability.</p><p>Enhancements offered by the integration of OCA and DAGs include:</p>  <p>Precision in Data Lineage: The structural organization provided by OCA, coupled with the causal pathways rendered by DAGs, ensures the integrity of data structures and facilitates a transparent, unambiguous tracing of their historical evolution and transformations.</p>    <p>Enhanced Data Interpretability: Leveraging DAGs within the OCA framework transforms each data object's trajectory into a narrative that is both coherent and intuitively understandable. This clarity proves invaluable in scenarios where deciphering the evolution and provenance of data is critical.</p>    <p>Robustness Against Data Corruption: DAGs' acyclic nature inherently safeguards against data corruption and cyclic errors. Combined with OCA's structured framework, this resilience constructs a formidable defense mechanism for maintaining data integrity.</p>    <p>Scalability and Flexibility: Engineered with scalability at their core, OCA and DAGs adeptly navigate the complexities of expanding data landscapes. This synergistic blend ensures data integrity and traceability maintenance without compromising performance or adaptability.</p>  <p>Example:&nbsp;Consider a healthcare data ecosystem where patient records evolve. OCA organizes and structures this data while DAGs meticulously track every alteration, from initial diagnosis to treatment outcomes, ensuring a transparent, error-free historical record.</p> Conclusion <p>Data Integrity and Traceability:&nbsp;While using DAG technology to integrate Stemmatics principles, DAGs are a natural outcome of OCA's design, not a standalone feature. They are one of a few tools OCA uses to ensure data integrity, contributing to better data transparency and traceability and highlighting OCA's adaptability and versatility in handling data.</p><p>The integration of OCA with DAGs represents a synergistic relationship in data science, advancing stemmatic traceability by combining OCA's structural framework with the tractual precision of DAGs. This marriage ensures the tractual causality of data lineage and reinforces data integrity, making it a cornerstone of modern data management and the evolution of data records.</p><p>As we navigate the complexities of modern distributed data ecosystems, OCA and DAG technologies underscore a promising horizon for semantic interoperability and data integrity. The exploration into stemmatic traceability and its integration with contemporary technological frameworks marks a significant milestone in the modern digital landscape and the ongoing journey towards a future where data is not only abundant and accessible but also enriched with a clear, traceable lineage.</p>

<p>Please tell us about yourself and how you got involved in the Hackathon</p><p>I’m currently in my final year at university. I’ve been building apps for the past two years and have recently been learning about cryptography, but I hadn’t previously built anything with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</p><p>I heard about DIF through an email from Devpost with information about the Hackathon. I started reading recent DIF announcements and looking into the specifications.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of the concepts were new to me. It made me rethink how the internet can be delivered!&nbsp;</p><p>What motivated you to build something in the area of personal health data?&nbsp;</p><p>Another team member, who has health problems in her family, came up with the idea for HealthX Protocol. Her family has to take a big bunch of files with them to every medical appointment. There’s no way for healthcare providers to filter or compute on the data. Everything is manual and takes a lot of time and resources to manage.&nbsp;</p><p>Privacy is obviously really important when it comes to personal health data, but it’s not enough. Given the current state of cyber attacks, you have no idea who has your data, whether it’s in the cloud or whatever. So, the ability to own your health data was a critical requirement for us.&nbsp;</p><p>The other part is, you don’t only need to store the data, you also need to be able to share it with those who need it.</p><p>What did you learn during the hackathon, and how did you use it to meet these needs?&nbsp;</p><p>The hackathon introduced me to DWNs and Web5. Before, I was into other stacks and protocols: Ethereum, zero knowledge and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). I wasn’t actively building identity into my applications.&nbsp;</p><p>These past two months, I’ve been fully immersed in decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p><p>With Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs), owning your data is simple. You spin up a basic server, which can be in the cloud, on your smartphone, even in your browser. You can store the data there and send it to another DID, which can see or edit the full data, or a certain portion of it.</p><p>You encrypt your data with your DID. It’s not like Google has the keys. Even if it’s in the cloud, it’s yours.&nbsp;</p><p>Somehow everything fell into place. I thought “this can be a great use case”.&nbsp;</p><p>How have decentralized identity and Web5 changed how you think about app development?&nbsp;</p><p>The most important thing is being able to store, own and share data. You have self-custody with web3, but it’s just the private key. This enables decentralized money, but what if I need to build an application that generates a large amount of data? I can’t put the file on Ethereum. Even with systems like Filecoin and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), ownership is still a big issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Something that connects your identifier to your storage and enables you to give access to other identifiers opens the door to a lot of new applications. Ownership of data is lacking in web3, and web5 fills the gap.&nbsp;</p><p>Another consideration is that in web3, identity is anonymous. To build identity into an app, you need to write a smart contract. Proving your identity becomes really easy when you’re using DIDs and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). You can choose what information to share using Selective Disclosure. It’s all there out of the box.</p><p>VCs can also be used for access control to a DWN. For example, if you have a conference, anyone with a pass can get access to the materials. The old way of access control is using a username and password. The new way is you can give access to anyone with a VC.</p><p>What next for HealthX Protocol?&nbsp;</p><p>The application is currently just a prototype. We want to build something much more polished.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, generating the DIDs is a little difficult. To address that, I’m planning to integrate a digital identity wallet, perhaps even build one. Then we can do a production application.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d also like to build other applications and get more involved in the decentralized identity community.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a lot of ideas and I’m just getting started in this space!</p>

<p><br></p><p>Please introduce yourself and tell us the background to your project, "Anonymous Door Unlocking with Anonymity Revocation" </p><p>My name is Ken Watanabe. I’m studying cryptography at Waseda University under Kazue Sako. My current research focus is on use cases for Verifiable Credentials (VCs), as well as signature schemes such as BBS+.&nbsp;</p><p>The first time I used VCs was during a national project for the Japanese government, where we used VCs to authenticate UAVs (drones) delivering packages from A to B.&nbsp;</p><p>For the hackathon, we were looking for a simple use case we could implement in our day-to-day environment. We work in a lab, so I decided to make a physical door unlocking system using 3D printers, that enables us to unlock the door to the lab using VCs.&nbsp;</p><p>Please can you describe your solution?&nbsp;</p><p>In our solution the university is the issuer, students are the holders and the door unlocking application is the verifier.&nbsp;</p><p>We also introduced a new role in the ecosystem, ‘Opener’. Only the Opener can revoke a holder’s anonymity. The holder and verifier agree who will be the Opener during the setup process.&nbsp;</p><p>The key technical components are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), W3C JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs).&nbsp;</p><p>We chose DWNs as they offer both storage and messaging. We realized we could put our VC into a DWN and deliver it to other entities like doors using the TBD messaging libraries. This met our requirements and made it simpler to develop.&nbsp;</p><p>We made a wallet application that connects to the DWN, shows the list of VCs and presents the needed information to verifiers through a QR code.&nbsp;</p><p>We used Dock network (which supports BBS+ signatures) and Arkworks to implement the crypto libraries, which I developed myself.&nbsp;</p><p>Why was anonymity revocation an important feature?</p><p>We think Selective Disclosure is very important for many use cases, including this one. The holder shouldn’t have to share unnecessary attributes and the verifier shouldn’t need to hold sensitive data.&nbsp;</p><p>But sometimes, data breaches, a theft or a physical accident might occur and the incident needs to be investigated.&nbsp;</p><p>The Verifiable Presentations (VPs) generated by the application are stored on the lab’s Slack channel. This enables the lab manager to see when the door is opened in real time, without seeing who opened it. If something bad happens, you can pick the presentation from Slack and send it to the Opener to open.&nbsp;</p><p>Please can you explain how the system preserves users’ privacy?&nbsp;</p><p>The holder can choose which attributes to share and generate a Verifiable Presentation (VP) with just this information. They don’t need to share their name, only their faculty membership.&nbsp;</p><p>We used BBS+ signatures because of the unlinkability feature, which means you can’t link multiple transactions to a single user, for enhanced privacy. BBS uses Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to hide attributes. In this project we added another ZKP to the BBS signature, that we call “verifiable encryptions”. In our system, the holder encrypts his identifier using the Opener’s public key. The extra ZKP means the verifier can verify this has happened.&nbsp;</p><p>We think it’s our main contribution to these kinds of door unlocking systems.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s next for the application?&nbsp;</p><p>Only four faculty members use the system currently. I want others to be able to use it. To do this we need to issue VCs to more students. I also want to introduce the system to other doors within the university. But I know it will take time to get it into production, as we need to verify it works well.&nbsp;</p><p>Only one credential can be used in the application currently, but in future we want to make VPs from multiple VCs. I also want to introduce the ability for the holder and verifier to negotiate the Opener dynamically.</p><p>What other use cases do you envisage?&nbsp;</p><p>This is a research project but we think the system can apply to other scenarios. One is ride hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft. The customer can order a taxi anonymously but if an accident happens, their anonymity can be revoked. Another is anonymous social networks. Users can chat anonymously, but if there’s a message that’s violent or abusive the author’s anonymity could be revoked.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from VCs, my other interest is I'm a cryptographer, so I also want to make completely different scenarios. I want to keep using it.</p><p>Last week I presented the application at SCIS2024 in Nagasaki, the biggest cryptography conference in Japan. Many people from government, academia and industry were there. I hope it generated a lot of interest.&nbsp;</p><p>How did you find the experience of participating in the hackathon? Do you envisage participating in DIF going forwards?&nbsp;</p><p>I really enjoyed the hackathon and am very honored to receive this prize. It was my first time using Decentralized Web Nodes. I found the DWNs GitHub readme page and API documentation very easy to read. I just followed the intro and found I could implement it easily. It was straightforward to store the VCs using DWNs.&nbsp;</p><p>For me, BBS Signatures is an interesting area to explore further. I’d also like to use DWNs in other projects and, if possible, I would like to add some features to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mastercard is modernising digital interactions underpinned by biometric and AI-powered tools which provide less friction than endless password authentication. The company has joined the FIDO Alliance that calls for&nbsp; encrypted passkey solutions and specifications to end passwords. The Mastercard Biometric Authentication Service provides a FIDO certified passwordless authentication that allows users to verify their identity using biometrics.</p>

 <p>Prompt: “A public marketplace for digital goods where people pay whatever they please for everything they consume.” Via Microsoft Image Creator</p> 
<p>Now that we’ve hit <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/why-subscriptions-are-hard-to-cancel/623885/">peak subscription</a>, and paywalls are showing up in front of formerly free digital goods (requiring, of course, more subscriptions), perhaps the world is ready for <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/EmanciPay">EmanciPay</a>, an idea that has been biding its time on <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/">our wiki</a> since 2009.</p>
<p>So, rather than leave it buried there, we’ll surface it here. Dig:::</p>
 Overview 
<p>Simply put, Emancipay makes it easy for anybody to pay (or offer to pay) —</p>
 
 as much as they like 
 however they like 
 for whatever they like 
 on their own terms 
 
<p>— or at least to start with that full set of options, and to work out differences with sellers easily and with minimal friction.</p>
<p>Emancipay turns consumers (aka users) into customers by giving them a pricing gun (something which in the past only sellers used) and their own means to make offers, to pay outright, and to escrow the intention to pay when price and other requirements are met. And to be able to do this at scale across all sellers, much as cash, browsers, credit cards, and email clients do the same. Payments themselves can also be escrowed.</p>
<p>In slightly more technical terms, EmanciPay is a payment framework for customers operating with full agency in the open marketplace, and at scale. It operates on open protocols and standards, so it can be used by any buyer, seller or intermediary.</p>
<p>It was conceived as a way to pay for music, journalism, or what any artist brings into the world. But it can apply to anything. For example, [<a href="https://customercommons.org/solving-subscriptions/">subscriptions</a>], have become a giant fecosystem in which every seller has separate and non-substitutable scale across all subscribers, while subscribers have zero scale across all sellers, with the highly conditional exceptions of silo’d commercial intermediaries. As [<a href="http://customercommons.org/">Customer Commons</a>] puts it,</p>
<p>There’s also not much help coming from the subscription management services we have on our side: Truebill, Bobby, Money Dashboard, Mint, Subscript Me, BillTracker Pro, Trim, Subby, Card Due, Sift, SubMan, and Subscript Me. Nor from the subscription management systems offered by Paypal, Amazon, Apple or Google (e.g. with Google Sheets and Google Doc templates). All of them are too narrow, too closed and exclusive, too exposed to the surveillance imperatives of corporate giants, and too vested in the status quo.</p>
<p>That status quo sucks (see&nbsp;<a href="https://enewspaper.latimes.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=b8db8d9f-5e61-4da2-b112-e5e1cf71df57">here</a>, or just look up&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=subscription+hell">“subscription hell”</a>), and it’s way past time to unscrew it.) But how?</p>
<p>The better question is&nbsp;where?</p>
<p>The answer to that is&nbsp;on our side: the customer’s side.</p>
<p>While EmanciPay was first conceived by ProjectVRM as a way to make live payments to nonprofits and to provide&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/2009/05/28/emancipay-a-content-monetization-plan-for-newspapers/">a new monetization method for publishers</a>. it also works as a counterpart to sellers’ subscription systems in what&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zuora.com/">Zuora</a>&nbsp;(a supplier of subscription management systems to the publishing industry, including&nbsp;The Guardian&nbsp;and&nbsp;Financial Times) calls the “<a href="http://www.zuora.com/subscription-economy/">subscription economy</a>“, which it says “is built on ever-changing relationships with your customers”. Since relationships are two-way by nature, EmanciPay is one way that customers can manage their end, while publisher-side systems such as Zuora’s manage the other.</p>
 Emancipay economic case 
<p>EmanciPay provides a new form of economic signaling not available to individuals, either on the Net or before the Net became available as a communications medium. EmanciPay will use open standards and be comprised of open-source code. While any commercial&nbsp;<a title="Fourth parties" href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Fourth_parties">fourth parties</a>&nbsp;can use EmanciPay (or its principles, or any parts of it they like), EmanciPay’s open and standard framework will support fourth parties by making them substitutable, much as the open standards of email (SMTP, POP3, IMAP) make email systems substitutable. (Each has what&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.joeandrieu.com/2009/04/26/introducing-user-driven-services/">Joe Andrieu calls</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.joeandrieu.com/2009/05/07/user-driven-services-5-service-endpoint-portability/">service endpoint portability</a>.)</p>
<p>EmanciPay is an instrument of customer independence from all of the billion (or so) commercial entities on the Net, each with its own arcane and siloed systems for engaging and managing customer relations, as well as receipt, acknowledgment, and accounting for payments from customers.</p>
 Use Case Background 
<p>EmanciPay was conceived originally as a way to provide customers with the means to signal interest and the ability to pay for media and creative works (most of which are freely available on the Web, if not always free of charge). Through EmanciPay, demand and supply can relate, converse, and transact business on mutually beneficial terms, rather than only on terms provided by the countless different siloed systems we have today, each serving to hold the customer captive, and causing much inconvenience and friction in the process.</p>
<p>Media goods were chosen for five reasons: 1) because most are available for free, even if they cost money, or are behind paywalls 2) paywalls, which are cookie-based, cannot relate to individuals as anything other than submissive and dependent parties (and each browser a users employs carries a different set of cookies) 3) both media companies and non-profits are constantly looking for new sources of revenue 4) the subscription model, while it creates steady income and other conveniences for sellers, is often a bad deal for customers, and is now so overused (see&nbsp;<a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/07/15/subscriptification/">Subscriptification</a>) that the world is approaching a peak subscription crisis, and&nbsp;<a href="https://reality2.substack.com/p/unscrewing-subscriptions">unscrewing it can only happen from the customer’s side (because the business is incapable of unscrewing the problem itself</a> 5) all methods of intermediating payment choices are either siloed by the seller or siloed by intermediators, discouraging participation by individuals.</p>
<p>What the marketplace requires are new business and social contracts that ease payment and stigmatize non-payment for creative goods. The friction involved in voluntary payment is still high, even on the Web, where one must go through complex ceremonies even to make simple payments. There is no common and easy way either to keep track of what media (free or otherwise) we use (see&nbsp;<a title="Media Logging" href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Media_Logging">Media Logging</a>), to determine what it might be worth, and to pay for it easily and in standard ways &amp;#151; to many different suppliers. (Again, each supplier has its own system for accepting payments.)</p>
<p>EmanciPay differs from other payment models (subscriptions, newsstands, tip jars) by providing customers with the ability to choose what they wish to pay and how they’ll pay it, with minimum friction — and with full choice about what they disclose about themselves.</p>
<p>EmanciPay will also support credit for referrals, requests for service, feedback, and other relationship support mechanisms, all at the control of the user. For example, EmanciPay can provide quick and easy ways for listeners to pay for public radio broadcasts or podcasts, for readers to pay for otherwise “free” papers or blogs, for listeners to pay to hear music and support artists, for users to issue promises of payment for stories or programs — all without requiring the individual to disclose unnecessary private information or to become a “member” — although these options are kept open.</p>
<p>This will scaffold genuine relationships between buyers and sellers in the media marketplace. It will also give deeper meaning to “membership” in non-profits. (Under the current system, “membership” generally means putting one’s name on a pitch list for future contributions, and not much more than that.)</p>
<p>EmanciPay will also connect the sellers’ CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems with customers’ VRM (Vendor Relationship Management) systems, supporting rich and participatory two-way relationships. In fact, EmanciPay will by definition be a VRM system.</p>
 Micro-accounting and Macro-distribution 
<p>The idea of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropayment">“micro-payments”</a> for goods on the Net has been around for a long time and is often brought up as a potential business model for journalism. For example in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1877191,00.html">this article by Walter Isaacson</a>&nbsp;in Time Magazine. It hasn’t happened, at least not globally, because it’s too complicated, and in prototype only works inside private silos.</p>
<p>What ProjectVRM&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2009/02/11/emancipay/">suggests instead</a>&nbsp;is something we don’t yet have, but very much need:</p>
 
 micro-accounting&nbsp;for actual uses. Think of this simply as “keeping track of” the news, podcasts, newsletters, or music we consume. 
 macro-distribution&nbsp;of payments for accumulated use (that’s no longer “micro”). 
 
<p>Much — maybe most — of the digital goods we consume are both free for the taking and worth more than $zero. How much more? We need to be able to say. In economic terms, demand needs to have a much wider range of signals it can give to supply. And give to each other, to better gauge what we should be willing to pay for free stuff that has real value but not a hard price.</p>
<p>As currently planned, EmanciPay would –</p>
 
 Provide a single and easy way for consumers of “content” to become customers of it. In the current system — which isn’t one — every artist, every musical group, and every public radio and TV station has his, her or own way of taking in contributions from those who appreciate the work. This can be arduous and time-consuming for everybody involved. (Imagine trying to pay separately every musical artist you like, for all your enjoyment of each artist’s work.) What EmanciPay proposes, however, is not a replacement for existing systems, but a new system that can supplement existing fund-raising systems — one that can soak up much of today’s MLOTT: Money Left On The Table. 
 Provide ways for individuals to look back through their media usage histories, inform themselves about what they have been enjoying, and determine how much it is worth to them. The Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP), and later the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB), both came up with “rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller.” This almost absurd language first appeared in the 1995 Digital Performance Royalty Act (DPRA) and was tweaked in 1998 by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), under which both the CARP and the CRB operated. The rates they came up with peaked at $.0001 per “performance” (a song or recording), per listener.&nbsp;EmanciPay creates the “willing buyer” that the DPRA thought wouldn’t exist. 
 Stigmatize non-payment for worthwhile media goods. This is where “social” will finally come to be something more than yet another tech buzzmodifier. 
 
<p>All these require micro-accounting, not micro-payments. Micro-accounting can inform ordinary payments that can be made in clever new ways that should satisfy everybody with an interest in seeing artists compensated fairly for their work. An individual listener, for example, can say “I want to pay 1¢ for every song I hear,” and “I’ll send&nbsp;<a href="http://www.soundexchange.com/">SoundExchange</a>&nbsp;a lump sum of all the pennies wish to pay for songs I have heard over a year, along with an accounting of what artists and songs I’ve listened to” — and leave dispersal of those totaled pennies up to the kind of agency that likes, and can be trusted, to do that kind of thing. That’s the macro-distribution part of the system.</p>
<p>Similar systems can also be put in place for readers of newspapers, blogs, and other journals. What’s important is that the control is in the hands of the individual and that the accounting and dispersal systems work the same way for everybody.</p>

    Declaration Of Digital Independence Authored by Larry Sanger, Co-founder of Wikipedia 



<p>We declare that we have unalienable digital rights, rights that define how information that we individually own may or may not be treated by others, and that among these rights are free speech, privacy, and security. Since the proprietary, centralized architecture of the Internet at present has induced most of us to abandon these rights, however reluctantly or cynically, we ought to demand a new system that respects them properly. </p>



<p>The difficulty and divisiveness of wholesale reform means that this task is not to be undertaken lightly. For years we have approved of and even celebrated enterprise as it has profited from our communication and labor without compensation to us. But it has become abundantly clear more recently that a callous, secretive, controlling, and exploitative animus guides the centralized networks of the Internet and the corporations behind them.</p>



<p>The long train of abuses we have suffered makes it our right, even our duty, to replace the old networks. To show what train of abuses we have suffered at the hands of these giant corporations, let these facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>



<p>They have practiced in-house moderation in keeping with their executives’ notions of what will maximize profit, rather than allowing moderation to be performed more democratically and by random members of the community.</p>



<p>They have banned, shadow-banned, throttled, and demonetized both users and content based on political considerations, exercising their enormous corporate power to influence elections globally.</p>



<p>They have adopted algorithms for user feeds that highlight the most controversial content, making civic discussion more emotional and irrational and making it possible for foreign powers to exercise an unmerited influence on elections globally.</p>



<p>They have required agreement to terms of service that are impossible for ordinary users to understand, and which are objectionably vague in ways that permit them to legally defend their exploitative practices.</p>



<p>They have marketed private data to advertisers in ways that no one would specifically assent to.</p>



<p>They have failed to provide clear ways to opt out of such marketing schemes.</p>



<p>They have subjected users to such terms and surveillance even when users pay them for products and services.</p>



<p>They have data-mined user content and behavior in sophisticated and disturbing ways, learning sometimes more about their users than their users know about themselves; they have profited from this hidden but personal information.</p>



<p>They have avoided using strong, end-to-end encryption when users have a right to expect total privacy, in order to retain access to user data.</p>



<p>They have amassed stunning quantities of user data while failing to follow sound information security practices, such as encryption; they have inadvertently or deliberately opened that data to both illegal attacks and government surveillance.</p>



<p>They have unfairly blocked accounts, posts, and means of funding on political or religious grounds, preferring the loyalty of some users over others.</p>



<p>They have sometimes been too ready to cooperate with despotic governments that both control information and surveil their people.</p>



<p>They have failed to provide adequate and desirable options that users may use to guide their own experience of their services, preferring to manipulate users for profit.</p>



<p>They have failed to provide users adequate tools for searching their own content, forcing users rather to employ interfaces insultingly inadequate for the purpose.</p>



<p>They have exploited users and volunteers who freely contribute data to their sites, by making such data available to others only via paid application program interfaces and privacy-violating terms of service, failing to make such freely-contributed data free and open source, and disallowing users to anonymize their data and opt out easily.</p>



<p>They have failed to provide adequate tools, and sometimes any tools, to export user data in a common data standard.</p>



<p>They have created artificial silos for their own profit; they have failed to provide means to incorporate similar content, served from elsewhere, as part of their interface, forcing users to stay within their networks and cutting them off from family, friends, and associates who use other networks.</p>



<p>They have profited from the content and activity of users, often without sharing any of these profits with the users.</p>



<p>They have treated users arrogantly as a fungible resource to be exploited and controlled rather than being treated respectfully, as free, independent, and diverse partners.</p>



<p>We have begged and pleaded, complained, and resorted to the law. The executives of the corporations must be familiar with these common complaints; but they acknowledge them publicly only rarely and grudgingly. The ill treatment continues, showing that most of such executives are not fit stewards of the public trust.</p>



<p>The most reliable guarantee of our privacy, security, and free speech is not in the form of any enterprise, organization, or government, but instead in the free agreement among free individuals to use common standards and protocols. The vast power wielded by social networks of the early 21st century, putting our digital rights in serious jeopardy, demonstrates that we must engineer new—but old-fashioned—decentralized networks that make such clearly dangerous concentrations of power impossible.</p>



<p>Therefore, we declare our support of the following principles.</p>



 Principles of Decentralized Social Networks 



<p>We free individuals should be able to publish our data freely, without having to answer to any corporation.</p>



<p>We declare that we legally own our own data; we possess both legal and moral rights to control our own data.</p>



<p>Posts that appear on social networks should be able to be served, like email and blogs, from many independent services that we individually control, rather than from databases that corporations exclusively control or from any central repository.</p>



<p>Just as no one has the right to eavesdrop on private conversations in homes without extraordinarily good reasons, so also the privacy rights of users must be preserved against criminal, corporate, and governmental monitoring; therefore, for private content, the protocols must support strong, end-to-end encryption and other good privacy practices.</p>



<p>As is the case with the Internet domain name system, lists of available user feeds should be restricted by technical standards and protocols only, never according to user identity or content.</p>



<p>Social media applications should make available data input by the user, at the user’s sole discretion, to be distributed by all other publishers according to common, global standards and protocols, just as are email and blogs, with no publisher being privileged by the network above another. Applications with idiosyncratic standards violate their users’ digital rights.</p>



<p>Accordingly, social media applications should aggregate posts from multiple, independent data sources as determined by the user, and in an order determined by the user’s preferences.</p>



<p>No corporation, or small group of corporations, should control the standards and protocols of decentralized networks, nor should there be a single brand, owner, proprietary software, or Internet location associated with them, as that would constitute centralization.</p>



<p>Users should expect to be able to participate in the new networks, and to enjoy the rights above enumerated, without special technical skills. They should have very easy-to-use control over privacy, both fine- and coarse-grained, with the most private messages encrypted automatically, and using tools for controlling feeds and search results that are easy for non-technical people to use.</p>



<p>We hold that to embrace these principles is to return to the sounder and better practices of the earlier Internet and which were, after all, the foundation for the brilliant rise of the Internet. Anyone who opposes these principles opposes the Internet itself.

<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of the digital age, the concept of identity has transcended the physical realm and taken root in the digital world. This shift towards digital identities brings about numerous conveniences and efficiencies, but it also presents challenges: ensuring accessibility and equity for all. From online banking to social media profiles, our digital identity is an intricate tapestry that weaves together various facets of our lives. It’s crucial to note that when discussing inclusion, equity, and accessibility in this context, the focus is primarily on individuals who experience physical or cognitive disabilities that may impair their use of technology from the outset.</p>



<p>The importance of accessibility in creating digital identity solutions cannot be overstated. To achieve true inclusivity for this specific group, both the public and private sectors must prioritize accessibility and consider specific principles to safeguard the rights and privacy of individuals with disabilities. In this article, we’ll delve into the significance of accessibility for digital identity and the protection of marginalized communities, outlining key principles for both public and private sectors to consider.</p>
 



  
  
 
 


<p>Part 1: The Significance of Accessibility in Developing Digital Identity</p>



<p>Digital identity solutions are central to our modern lives, facilitating everything from accessing healthcare records to participating in online communities. However, these advantages are only fully realized when these systems are accessible to everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, including accounting for aging populations. An initial product release that lacks accessibility and proves difficult to use, even if it functions as intended, can erode trust and create negative perceptions.</p>


 
 
 



 
 
 
 
  



 
 
 Universal design: A foundational principle for digital identity solutions is creating systems usable by all individuals, regardless of disability. A universally designed digital identity solution should accommodate a wide range of abilities, modalities of interaction, and preferences, ensuring that everyone can participate in the digital world on equal terms. 



 Inclusivity in development: Involving individuals with disabilities in the design and testing phases ensures that the final product is genuinely accessible. By including diverse perspectives, developers can identify and rectify accessibility issues early in the development cycle. 



 Adherence to standards: To ensure accessibility, digital identity solutions must adhere to globally recognized accessibility standards, such as W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These provide a clear set of guidelines for making digital content and applications accessible. Compliance with these standards is crucial for ensuring that digital identities are available and usable for all. 
 
 
 
 


 
 User-centric approach: Developers must seek to understand how individuals with disabilities interact with their application or technology, offering customization options that empower users to adapt the system to their unique needs and requirements. This might include adjustable font sizes, alternative input methods, and compatibility with assistive technologies. They should also be adaptive in their design. 



 Privacy and security: Paramount in digital identity solutions, individuals with disabilities may be particularly vulnerable to privacy breaches and identity theft. Implementing robust security measures while maintaining respect for user privacy is essential. This can be achieved through encryption, robust authentication methods, and clear privacy policies. Regular audits and assessments can address the security and privacy practices of digital identity solutions as technology shifts, including vulnerability testing and compliance checks to ensure the highest standards of privacy and security are maintained. 
 



<p>Part 2: Safeguarding the Privacy and Trust of Individuals with Disabilities</p>



<p>To ensure that the privacy and trust of all citizens are safeguarded appropriately, accessible solutions must be designed and delivered with intent. To ensure that accessibility is realized, a high level of understanding and education is necessary for individuals to utilize their identity in digital channels without the apprehension of misuse or fear of being exploited.</p>



 
 Informed consent: Individuals with disabilities should have access to clear and understandable information about how their digital identity data will be used. Obtaining informed consent ensures that users are aware of the risks and benefits of participating in digital identity systems. 



 Minimal data collection: Users should understand that only the data that is absolutely necessary for the functioning of the digital identity system is being collected. Minimizing data collection reduces the risk of privacy breaches and limits the potential for misuse of personal information. 



 Transparency in data practices: Transparency should be maintained in data practices. All users must have access to their data and understand how it is being used and processed. Transparency, particularly to historically marginalized communities, builds trust and empowers individuals to make informed decisions about the use of their digital identities. 



 Accessible privacy settings and controls: Accessible privacy settings and controls that are easy for individuals with disabilities to use must be available. These controls must allow users to manage their data and privacy preferences effectively. 
 



<p>In conclusion, it’s important to recognize that accessibility, inclusion, and equity are multifaceted challenges. While this article focuses on individuals experiencing physical or cognitive disabilities, it’s crucial to acknowledge that there are various barriers to equitable access, including socio-economic factors, digital literacy, and language barriers. By addressing these challenges collectively, we can work towards creating a more inclusive digital world for everyone.</p>

<p>Founded in 2022, Silence Laboratories is a cybersecurity startup enabling adoption of privacy preserving threshold signatures and secure computations through its developer-focused cryptographic stack. The company also organizes Decompute, a conference focused on decentralized security with multiparty computation.&nbsp;</p><p>We spoke to CEO and co-founder Jay Prakash.&nbsp;</p><p>Please introduce yourself, and explain how you developed the idea for Silence Labs&nbsp;</p><p>I did my PhD in Usable Security, that is security an average user is able to handle, hiding all the math and complexity. My PhD Supervisor and I found multiple vulnerabilities in existing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) solutions, which we published and described at various conferences. We thought, “Why not build a company to do this better?”</p><p>During this period I spent time in both Singapore and the US. In the process of talking to prospective customers, we realized there was a bit of a mismatch between our original idea and the market need. However, we saw clear demand for decentralized authentication.&nbsp;</p><p>We began meeting with crypto wallet providers. Many were talking about exposure of private keys, which is a common problem. That’s how we landed on Multiparty Computation (MPC) as an area with a lot of commercial potential.&nbsp;</p><p>What are you building?&nbsp;</p><p>We have developed an interactive protocol which allows a group of parties to do mathematical calculations on private data.</p><p>For example, the data could be keyshares by isolated computing nodes trying to calculate the signature for a transaction. The requirement is to produce a valid signature from a predetermined proportion of the nodes in the network, known as t out of n secret sharing.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a hot problem that we latched onto and started to develop around.&nbsp;</p><p>We expose the protocol in our SDKs and libraries, which customers can use to distribute the signing process and overcome the problem of key exposure.&nbsp;</p><p>How is your solution being used today?&nbsp;</p><p>Our solution provides a good amount of freedom regarding what policies are set and how keyshares take place. We provide the tool, but don't dictate how it should be used.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a couple of ways our partners are using it.</p><p>One is browser plugin wallets that split the private key between the user’s browser and their phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Another design is to create a network which manages the keys on your behalf. You provide your ID, then the network runs a protocol (such as&nbsp; 5 out of 10 nodes) to get a valid signature.&nbsp;</p><p>A third design is to do one keyshare from the phone and one from the wallet provider. If our customer is a custodian holding a large volume of assets, they can also split their key between multiple directors and/or employees.&nbsp;</p><p>Are you targeting other market segments, in addition to crypto wallets?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>MPC is a powerful tool that can be used for many purposes.&nbsp; We’ve been doing a lot of research and development around using it for privacy guarantees. For example, a number of financial institutions hold your financial data. If you now want to take out a loan, the lender needs access to your credit score. Traditionally, credit agencies scrape your data without you knowing and return a score. Your data passes through lots of hands, you have no control over what’s happening to it, it’s aggregated and vulnerable to attack. MPC can radically improve how this is done.&nbsp;</p><p>Another use case is Reg Tech (regulatory technology) including Anti Money Laundering (AML) compliance. To uncover money laundering, you need to collaborate with lots of partners. For example, if I’m a telco and you’re a bank, we can both reduce our risk by computing on the customers’ combined telco and banking history. Reg Tech providers currently can’t share private data with each other, but with privacy guarantees, these protocols can comply fully with GDPR and other applicable regulations.&nbsp;</p><p>We want to position this like Two-Factor Authentication, which is already well understood by consumers. The intention is that the user experience will be exactly the same. To deliver that, it has to work fast. Right now we have the fastest multiparty signing library in production, around 5 to 10x faster than other solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>Can you unpack the concept of Privacy Guarantees a bit please?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a big misunderstanding around consent. Typically a service provider creates a super-long consent form and you tick to say you agree. What we are trying to champion is: One, the user interface should be clearer and Two, consent should not be one-time or one-directional. If I want to pull a piece of private data I previously provided, it should be removed from the entire ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>To make consent programmable, you need something like Multiparty Computation. MPC allows you to build more powerful and user-centric applications by guaranteeing decentralization of the computation.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, wherever multiple institutions have your data and want to collaborate without exposing your data to each other, that’s where our solution can help.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you see as the value of participating in DIF?&nbsp;</p><p>I heard about the hackathon through someone at DIF. I’ve been quite active on DIF’s Slack channel and hope to engage more formally soon.&nbsp;</p><p>I see two opportunities for Silence Labs. One is collaboration with others focused on similar topics, for example through a DIF working group. The other is about driving awareness. There’s little inherent ‘pull’ for privacy from companies, as they believe it’s just about compliance. But multiple surveys show there are business benefits too. For example, one survey showed that banks offering privacy guarantees can provide twenty percent more loans with less overall risk.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year we organized a conference, Decompute, where DIF was one of the partners. The event is happening again this year (in Singapore on 17 September) and we’re also interested in running an event in London. We see this as an opportunity to drive much more engagement from the decentralized identity community, as well as wider awareness beyond it.&nbsp;</p>

 Part 1: Semantic Interoperability  Introduction <p>Imagine you're a data scientist working in a multi-disciplinary team. Your day-to-day involves exchanging complex datasets and intricate models with partners and collaborators globally. However, every exchange feels like a hurdle - inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and a lack of synergy often arise when people need to interpret data. You ask yourself, "Isn't there a more seamless way to ensure that data models carry the same meaning for everyone involved, regardless of the system or platform they're using?"</p><p>"Data semantics"&nbsp;refers to the interpretation and meaning of data, and&nbsp;"semantic interoperability"&nbsp;is the ability of computer systems to exchange data with unambiguous, shared meaning. Semantic interoperability is a common requirement to enable machine computable logic, inferencing, knowledge discovery, and data federation between information systems.</p><p>Achieving genuine semantic interoperability is a central yet challenging goal in the complex data management and exchange landscape. This post explores decentralized semantics, a vital solution aiming to transcend the limitations of traditional methods. As we delve into data semantics, we touch upon Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a decentralized metadata framework for defining the semantic composition of digital objects, enabling the creation of interoperable schemas, and facilitating data harmonization. We aim to showcase how decentralized semantic structures enhance data exchange and ensure the transmission of intrinsic meaning and interpretability, paving the way for more robust and meaningful interactions between digital systems and challenging the prevailing notion that semantic alignment between ontologies and knowledge graphs is the solution to semantic interoperability.</p> Data Semantics Demystified <p>Data semantics includes&nbsp;"morphological semantics"&nbsp;[1] and&nbsp;"epistemological semantics"&nbsp;[2]. Imagine morphological semantics as the blueprint of a dataset. It pertains to the textual attributes that outline the concrete structure of data, akin to how architectural plans delineate the formation of physical structures. This branch of semantics deals with the 'objects' - tangible elements like data structures, systemic variables, functions, or methods. Think of it as the compositional elements that give structures shape and functionality.</p><p>In contrast, epistemological semantics focuses on&nbsp;'concepts,'&nbsp;analyzing contextual terms and relationships to build knowledge. It mirrors an abstract idea's cultural or communal interpretation, where traditions and norms provide life and meaning to physical structures.</p><p>Here's a breakdown:</p>  <p>Morphological Semantics: Picture a complex machine. Every gear, lever, and pulley (the&nbsp;"Objects") has a specific role and structure, defined by its physical and functional attributes. Morphological semantics is the study of these tangible elements and their interconnected parts.</p>  <p>Example:&nbsp;In a sentence, words and their arrangements (the&nbsp;'objects') carry specific meanings based on their structure and syntax.</p>  <p>Epistemological Semantics: Imagine the operator's manual explaining how to use the machine effectively or the operational training a worker undergoes.&nbsp;"Concepts"&nbsp;encompass this contextual enhancement, deriving understanding from contextual and subjective knowledge.</p>  <p>Example:&nbsp;In understanding a sentence, the meaning isn't just in the words but in the context, tone, and relationship between those words and the broader conversation or text.<br></p><p>These two intertwining branches constitute data semantics, offering a comprehensive semantic representation of tangible&nbsp;'objects'&nbsp;and intangible&nbsp;'concepts.'</p>

  <p>Data Semantics: Semantics is the branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning, and in the context of data, it encompasses objects and concepts. Data semantics involves creating a systematic plan or arrangement for data and defining how it should be structured and interpreted to achieve specific objectives. It establishes a blueprint for understanding data, ensuring it is used effectively and aligned with the intended goals. Data semantics provides the guiding framework for data, focusing on purposeful representation and how it’s organized.</p> Morphological Semantics Demystified <p>Morphological semantics stands at the forefront of driving semantic interoperability, which is crucial to ensuring seamless and meaningful communication across diverse systems. Unlike its epistemological counterpart, decentralized morphological semantics focuses on&nbsp;'objects,'&nbsp;representing them as layered structures composed of interoperable overlays. This nuanced representation is pivotal, transforming static structures into dynamic schemas that can seamlessly traverse distributed data ecosystems.</p><p>The harmonic interaction between disparate systems in data exchange is not just about transferring data but preserving its innate, objectual meaning. Decentralized semantics facilitates this by encapsulating that meaning within meticulously crafted overlays, each layer adding depth and richness to the semantic structure, ensuring the data's integrity remains unscathed during transfer. Every piece of textual information enhances the interpretability of the object. This process transforms primary data exchange into more profound, more meaningful communication. It aligns with the data's core nature and enables semantic interoperability at scale.</p>

   The Epistemic Shortfall in Achieving Semantic Interoperability <p>In knowledge representation,&nbsp;"epistemic"&nbsp;pertains to knowledge acquisition and understanding. It is derived from the study of epistemology and involves the logic and concepts associated with how knowledge is processed and understood. An&nbsp;"epistemic shortfall"&nbsp;in semantic interoperability indicates a gap where traditional methods fail to represent and share complex knowledge across various computational systems effectively. This shortfall highlights a challenge in preserving the depth and breadth of knowledge when it is exchanged or transferred among diverse platforms.</p><p>Although epistemological semantics does not directly contribute to interoperability in a technical sense, it is essential for ensuring that the data’s meaning is accurately interpreted and utilized. This aspect is crucial in complex domains where data interpretation is as critical as data exchange. Even though uniform nodal relationships enhance clarity for generic comprehension, the inherent nature of knowledge representation does not drive semantic interoperability. While knowledge graphs reveal the connections between related entities, they obscure the data's depth and evolutionary journey.</p><p>While aiding in generic comprehension, pursuing nodal relationships must remain generic within knowledge graphs to ensure uniform comprehension of the subjective concept. OCA enables dynamic semantic interoperability by distinctly separating the relationships of textual elements within a schema. Epistemological semantics enriches context via the intricate relationships delineated in ontologies and knowledge graphs. However, morphological semantics facilitate semantic interoperability through the inherent properties of the objects rather than the abstract concepts that house them.</p> OCA: The Beacon of Interoperability <p>As a scalable architecture, OCA streamlines the creation of each overlay and the sum of their connected parts, ensuring rich and comprehensive object representation. This foundational step enhances object utilization within assigned knowledge graphs. It's not merely about establishing relationships but understanding each nodal entity's genesis, evolution, and contextual relevance. OCA elevates semantic interoperability, making it a stable architecture for those pursuing authentic, meaningful, and robust data integration and interpretation.</p> Conclusion <p>Enhanced Data Interpretation:&nbsp;OCA ensures a richer data interpretation, capturing the detailed nuances often missed by traditional epistemic models.</p><p>OCA, grounded in&nbsp;“Decentralized Semantics,”&nbsp;addresses the limitations of epistemic models that often miss the intricate details of the data they represent. OCA is a robust solution that achieves semantic interoperability by providing a metadata framework for separating structural tasks into task-specific objects that, when combined, provide a digital representation of a complex object while ensuring that those components remain intact during data exchange. </p><p>The integration of OCA at the point of data capture promises a future where data is abundant, meaningful, and context-rich. This enhanced capability is pivotal for the evolution of AI and cross-industry data communication, ensuring that collected data retains its intrinsic value and meaning.</p>





















  
  



 


  <p>That concludes Part 1 of this series. In Part 2, we'll examine the dynamic union of stemmatics and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and their role in bolstering data integrity. We'll see how merging these time-honored methods with cutting-edge technology creates a strong foundation that verifies and preserves the authenticity of data. This innovative approach safeguards the evolutionary aspects of data integrity across digital platforms and enhances true semantic interoperability.</p><p><a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/unraveling-the-path-to-genuine-semantic-interoperability-across-digital-systems-part-2">Link</a> to Genuine Semantic Interoperability across Digital Systems - Part 2: Stemmatic Traceability</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>Ngā mihi o te Tau Hou! And I wish you all a trustful and prosperous one.</p>



<p>Will 2024 move the dial on Digital Trust in Aotearoa? This may seem provocative, but it’s not intended to be. It’s a reasonable question, given our economic and budgetary challenges coupled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cira.ca/uploads/2023/12/2023_A-trust-layer-for-the-internet-is-emerging_-report-%E2%80%93-Continuum_CIRA.pdf">with Canadian evidence of a decrease in internet trust</a>&nbsp;likely reflected globally. This means Aotearoa has to put in a mighty team effort with slim resources to reverse the trend, and in the year that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2023/0013/latest/LMS459583.html">Digital Identity Trust Framework regulation</a>&nbsp;comes into force and hopefully portable&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WAva_0YUcc">verifiable credentials</a>&nbsp;that form part of it become the norm in our daily digital lives. We will only move the dial if public sector agencies and industry genuinely rally around our shared issues, collectively inform and educate people on why these issues matter. Alongside these efforts, it is important to maintain non-digital channels for those who can’t, don’t feel confident with or choose not to use digital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While I’ve drawn on the above examples, there are other industry sectors with their requisite frameworks, concepts, regulations and codes of practice. They may not be termed ‘Trust Frameworks’ but in most practical senses they are. For instance, consider the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2021/11/Digital-Identity-New-Zealand-AML_CFT-Report_20-October-2020_FINAL.pdf">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a>&nbsp;component of the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations applying to financial institutions and our friends at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/">PaymentsNZ</a>&nbsp;leveraging its API centre to support adoption of open banking. Or consider farm sourced product supply chain provenance promulgated through verifiable credentials issued to a digital farm wallet by our friends at&nbsp;<a href="https://trustalliance.co.nz/">Trust Alliance NZ</a>. These span private and public sectors, industries and across international boundaries. They are ecosystems and networks performing critical purposes that – if the vision for a frictionless, safe, privacy-aware trusted digital future that most want to see – must work seamlessly with each other and be trusted by people, institutions and governments globally.</p>



<p>The fact is our existing centralised and federated digital identity systems with their requisite username/password processes that we started our digital lives with, are increasingly less fit for purpose. They are inconvenient to use, restrict our control over data about us, and provide opportunities for bad actors to steal our data, scam us, take over our accounts and exploit us as ‘products’, causing pain, stress and distrust.</p>



<p>Of the new, portable, reusable, more secure and privacy aware emerging systems, components such as verifiable credentials and&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/#:~:text=Passkeys%20are%20based%20on%20FIDO,in%20or%20account%20recovery%20method.">passkeys</a>&nbsp;that eliminate the use of passwords as DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authsignal.com/">Authsignal</a>&nbsp;has just implemented for DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/cyber-security-account-protection">Air New Zealand</a>, are mature and usable today. DINZ itself has preliminary ideas to introduce its members to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#:~:text=Decentralized%20identifiers%20(DIDs)%20are%20a,the%20controller%20of%20the%20DID.">Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)</a>, a key component of verifiable credentials as explained in&nbsp;<a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE5cxkr?culture=en-us&amp;country=us#:~:text=What%20supports%20the%20Trust%20System's,attested%20information%20about%20a%20subject.">this whitepaper</a>&nbsp;by our&nbsp;member Microsoft. But to use them, digital systems operated by all sectors need to be able to accept and in many cases issue them. Australia’s Steve Wilson, industry commentator and speaker at our 2022 Digital Trust Hui Taumata&nbsp;discusses the digital wallet metaphor and its relationship to the other components&nbsp;<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/holes-in-the-wallet-metaphor/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">here</a>. While humans and enterprises are naturally resistant to change due to fear, uncertainty, doubt, effort, focus and money, Aotearoa has a great record of embracing change. Look how we took to EFTPOS and more recently Apple Pay, Google Pay and our smartphone banking apps. Look how we’ve learned to use<a href="https://www.businessconnect.govt.nz/assets/Business-Connect/pdfs/qr-instructions.pdf">&nbsp;QR codes&nbsp;</a>to access buildings or even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.golf.co.nz/resource-detail/collecting-green-fees-with-qr-codes">collect green fees</a>&nbsp;at golf courses! These ‘new era’ tools can hide technical complexity to deliver the convenient, secure, consented and privacy respecting digital experiences we are entitled to expect when we are asked to confirm that minimal set of ‘identiful’ things needed to know to trust before we transact. It’s not just about you personally and it’s not just one-way trust. It is trusting each others’ devices, organisations and websites as we go about our daily lives.&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/01/18/sponsorship-opportunities-for-a-thriving-future/">Sponsoring aspects of Digital Identity NZ’s mahi</a>&nbsp;will help raise public awareness and knowledge to ultimately deliver tangible products and services in support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, moving the dial on digital trust in 2024 will take more than ‘a coalition of the willing’ while the majority sit back. It will take a concerted, orchestrated effort from the coalition of five million. No person or entity is immune to the potential threats and no-one should be limited in taking the opportunities digitalisation brings.</p>



<p>To make progress, we need to step out of our comfort zone. Organisations should use new tools for their services, and people need to be willing to try them.</p>

<p></p>      State of Web3 in 2024           <p>Insights into the past, present, and future of Web3</p>
          <p>When the term “Web3” was first coined, it symbolized the dawn of a new era: a decentralized, user-owned, privacy-first digital economy. It promised smarter, more seamless communication and business practices, and the unlocking of new revenue streams through trusted data. Now, in 2024, we find that the limitations of the old Web2 paradigm — characterized by data silos, interoperability issues, and escalating trust costs — are more apparent than ever. These challenges underscore the need for a new approach that can cater to our increasingly complex global ecosystem.</p>

   Understanding Web3    
<p>What is Web3? Is it blockchain? Cryptocurrency? The Metaverse? In truth, ‘Web3’ is more or less a blanket term that represents a broad vision, rather than pinpointing a specific technology or application. This vision extends beyond the boundaries of single entities, encompassing entire value chains to foster a unified digital ecosystem. As a result, the use of blockchain or crypto alone is not enough to constitute Web3 in a meaningful sense. At its core, Web3 is about trust and cross-industry interoperability — seamless interconnection and cooperation among diverse systems, organizations, and industries, with trusted identities and verifiable transactions. Web3’s essence lies in the ability to create a decentralized network where data ownership and control are democratized, unlike the centralized structures of traditional blockchain and cryptocurrency systems.</p>
 
       
<p>Central to this evolution is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) standards. These technologies provide the foundation for a standardized method of verifying identities and claims, crucial in establishing digital trust and ensuring seamless interoperability across various enterprise environments. Web3, bolstered by the capabilities of DIDs and VCs, is paving the way for a future where digital interactions are more secure, transparent, and user-driven. Its successful adoption and scaling in the enterprise domain hinge on embracing this shared approach to break down silos and foster a unified digital ecosystem. <a href="https://citopia.global/introduction-to-dids-and-vcs/">Learn more about how DIDs and VCs serve as key enablers for Web3</a></p>

   Solving Challenges in Driving Enterprise Web3 Adoption    
<p>The path to widespread enterprise adoption of Web3 has been slow, with efforts often limited to proofs-of-concept. This hesitance can be attributed to several factors:</p>
 
 Lack of Understanding: For many, the concept of Web3 remains shrouded in confusion, with terms like blockchain, NFT, and cryptocurrency often used, mistakenly, as synonyms for Web3. This conflation not only obscures the true potential of Web3 but also impedes its integration into mainstream applications. 
 Lack of Standardization: Lack of standardization in Web3 leads to a ‘wild west’ scenario, discouraging many companies from attempting implementation. Those who do venture into Web3 face fragmentation, as the use of varied protocols and blockchain platforms essentially results in the same Web2 siloing issues that Web3 aims to address. 
 Scalability Concerns: Challenges with network congestion and transaction throughput have made scalability a critical issue. 
 
 
       MOBI’s Web3 Infrastructure: Trusted Identities and Verifiable Transactions for Cross-Industry Interoperability and Commerce    
<p>MOBI is working alongside our members to build a federated <a href="https://dlt.mobi/web3-infrastructure/">Web3 Infrastructure</a> — <a href="https://citopia.global/">Citopia</a> and the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/">Integrated Trust Network</a> (ITN) — to create a privacy-preserving decentralized marketplace for digital commerce. Leveraging standards from <a href="https://dlt.mobi/standards/">MOBI</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">ISO</a>, <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>, <a href="https://www.sae.org/">SAE</a>, and more, Citopia and the ITN together offer standardized communication protocols for cross-industry interoperability. This unified framework serves as a common language, enabling organizations with diverse business processes and legacy systems to efficiently coordinate and communicate without having to build and maintain new infrastructure. Organizations can securely share data and verify claims throughout the entire value chain, overcoming the barriers posed by traditional, centralized Web2 systems.</p>
<p>In our commitment to demonstrating the scalability and effectiveness of this infrastructure, MOBI and its members have conducted several successful pilots, including:</p>
 
 A <a href="https://dlt.mobi/co2tracking/">vehicle emissions monitoring test</a> with the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/index_en">European Commission</a> in 2021. 
 A <a href="https://www.trb.org/IDEAProgram/IDEATransit.aspx">Transit IDEA</a>-funded <a href="https://citopia.global/citopia-maas-final-report-released/">Citopia MaaS pilot</a> in 2022-23. 
 
<p>These pilots have yielded outstanding results, affirming Citopia and the ITN’s capacity to handle large-scale operational demands with robustness and efficiency.</p>
<p>To accelerate Web3 understanding and adoption, MOBI is also providing comprehensive educational courses through MOBI Academy, aimed at demystifying Web3 concepts and their practical applications. <a href="https://dlt.mobi/academy/">Explore MOBI Academy</a></p>
 
       Looking Ahead: 2024 and Beyond    
<p>As we forge ahead into 2024, our focus at MOBI remains steadfast on enhancing Citopia and the ITN for more effective enterprise adoption and scalability. We are actively exploring the transformative potential of this technology across various industry verticals. Collaboration is at the core of our strategy, as we work hand-in-hand with our partners and other consortia — including the <a href="https://www.globalbattery.org/">Global Battery Alliance</a>, <a href="https://catena-x.net/en/">Catena-X</a>, <a href="https://thebatterypass.eu/">Battery Pass</a>, <a href="https://www.nada.org/">NADA</a>, and <a href="https://www.aamva.org/">AAMVA</a> — to address critical pain points and refine our solutions.</p>
<p>In our commitment to fostering a dynamic and collaborative community, next month marks a significant milestone. We are excited to host MoCoTokyo (19 Feb 2024) in partnership with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>. This event will bring together industry leaders and innovators to delve deeper into the initiatives of our Circular Economy and the Global Battery Passport (CE-GBP) Working Group. Additionally, we’re hosting a members-only workshop in Tokyo (20 Feb 2024) in partnership with <a href="https://www.densoautoparts.com/">DENSO</a> to facilitate vital discussions surrounding the Global Battery Passport, including laying out a roadmap for the implementation of a cross-industry Minimum Viable Product. <a href="https://dlt.mobi/moco2024/">Register for MoCoTokyo and our Members-Only Workshop</a></p>

<p>The first DIF-sponsored hackathon wrapped up with a <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizedID/status/1742700700310941760?s=20&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Meet The Winners Twitter Space</a> earlier this month which highlighted how the event has supported skills development, engagement with the decentralized identity community and participation in DIF’s work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Five winners shared the main DIF-funded $10,000 prize pool, with additional prizes scooped by winners of challenges sponsored by DIF members TBD (Block), Trinsic, Polygon ID and Ontology.&nbsp;</p><p>Participants included people both new to and experienced with decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p><p>“The number of submissions and the breadth of ideas, projects and levels of experience on display exceeded our expectations. We are particularly pleased that so many projects used DIF work items. A number of people from the web3 space used Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials for the first time, thanks to some interesting challenges from our sponsors, and many participants explored the exciting possibilities of Decentralized Web Nodes” said Limari Navarette, DIF’s Senior Director of Community Engagement.</p><p>Several winners of the main DIF prize pool are currently studying at university, and submitted research projects that combined DIF work items and sponsors’ SDKs to create sophisticated solutions to real-world problems.&nbsp;</p><p>“We are thrilled to have helped so many talented young developers upskill around decentralized identity, which also expands the talent pool available to our members” Limari added.&nbsp;</p><p>Participants, including those with significant experience working with decentralized identity technology, said the hackathon has helped them feel more connected to the community, with the technical masterclasses, Office Hours support and Discord server all singled out for praise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The hackathon has also sparked new participation in DIF, including two proposed new working groups, plus new work items for established working groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a flavor of the insights shared by DIF Hackathon winners during the Twitter Space on 10th January:</p><p>“This was my first time working with DIDs and DWNs. I fell in love with how revolutionary this is, and the possibilities for applications” Harsh Tyagi, HealthXProtocol - Third Place, DIF Main Prize Pool &amp; TBD Prize Pool.</p><p>“This project is inspired by an effort I'm involved in to build a trust framework for the home buying and selling industry in the UK. It aims to make it safe and easy for individuals and organizations to share data during the home buying and selling process”. Edward Curran, TrustBox - Honorable Mention, DIF Main Prize Pool.</p><p>“I’ve been in the automotive space for a while, removing friction for businesses. Otto told me about the hackathon and I deployed my team just a week before submissions closed. I came up with a use case and challenged the team with it, because I wanted them to learn and develop around primitives such as VCs, since we’d like to use them in our own product”. Aaron Wuchner,Titleblox - Third Place, Trinsic Prize Pool.&nbsp;</p><p>“Pop up events at big conferences present a challenging use case. All current solutions are “Prove this at home with your private key, then go”. But if you're at a conference and an event pops up, how do you prove ownership of an NFT? I didn't want our members walking around the conference with the private keys to their NFTs in order to sign a transaction to get in the door. I came to the hackathon specifically to learn Polygon ID and to use its privacy features to disconnect “Am I a member of the DAO?” from “What's my crypto wallet address” and my potential crypto net worth at a public event.

  <p>By Coleen Jose, Head of Community, CAI</p><p>Taylor Swift isn’t selling Le Creuset cookware. However,<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/taylor-swift-ai-generated-le-creuset-ad-not-real-rcna133285"> deepfake advertisements recently appeared</a> that used video clips of the pop star and synthesized versions of her voice to look and sound as if she were doing a giveaway offer. Unsuspecting fans and others who trusted Swift’s brand clicked the ads and entered their personal and credit card information for a chance to win.</p><p>Public figures are prime targets for scams that are being created and scaled with help from voice cloning and video deepfake tools.</p><p>In July 2023, a video of Lord of the Rings star Elijah Wood appeared on social media. Originally created with Cameo, an app that lets people purchase personalized video messages from celebrities, the clip featured Wood sharing words of encouragement with someone named Vladimir who was struggling with substance abuse. “I hope you get the help that you need,” the actor said.</p><p>Soon after, it emerged that the heavily edited video was part of a Russian<a href="https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/actors-recorded-videos-for-vladimir-it-turned-into-russian-propaganda/efe045b0-79c6-43bd-afb6-cc9a0f497fac"> disinformation campaign</a> that sought to insinuate that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had a drug and alcohol problem. At least six other celebrities, including boxer Mike Tyson and Scrubs actor John McGinley, unwittingly became part of the scheme. Despite clumsy editing, the videos were shared widely on social platforms.</p>





















  
  



<blockquote> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C15eSAustvC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading">       View this post on Instagram            </a><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C15eSAustvC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading">A post shared by New York Post (@nypost)</a></p></blockquote> 


  <p>Now, imagine if the level of effort required to create these videos dropped to zero. Instead of commissioning content on Cameo, one could choose a celebrity or obtain enough video content of an individual and use AI to make them say or do anything.</p><p>This challenge is intensifying with the spread of AI-enabled audio and voice cloning technology that can produce convincing deepfakes. Governments have started taking steps to protect the public; for example, the US Federal Trade Commission issued a<a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/03/scammers-use-ai-enhance-their-family-emergency-schemes"> consumer warning</a> about scams enabled by voice cloning and<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/businessguidanceblog/2023/11/FTCannounceschallengetopreventtheharmsofAIenabledvoicecloning"> announced a prize</a> for a solution to address the threat. Both the Biden administration and the European Union have called for clear labeling of AI-generated content.&nbsp;</p><p>These scams and non-consensual imagery, which range from fake product endorsements to geopolitical campaigns, are<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/deepfake-porn-is-out-of-control/"> increasingly targeting people</a> who aren’t famous singers or politicians.</p><p>A commitment to verifiable AI-generated audio</p><p>Dmytro Bielievstov knows that top-down regulation isn’t enough. In 2017, along with Alex Serdiuk and Grant Reaber, the Ukraine-based software engineer co-founded<a href="https://www.respeecher.com?utm_campaign=PR&amp;utm_medium=blogarticle&amp;utm_source=contentauthenticityorg"> Respeecher</a>, a tool that allows anyone to speak in another person's voice using AI. “If someone uses our platform to pretend to be someone they are not, such as a fake news channel with synthetic characters, it might be challenging for the audience to catch that because of how realistic our synthetic voices are,” he said.</p><p>Keenly aware of the potential for misuse, the Respeecher team has embraced the use of<a href="https://contentcredentials.org/"> Content Credentials</a> through the Content Authenticity Initiative’s (CAI)<a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/"> open-source tools</a>. Content Credentials are based on the C2PA open standard to verify the source and history of digital content. With an estimated 4 billion people around the world heading to the polls in over 50 elections this year, there’s an urgent need to ensure clarity about the origins and history of the visual stories and media we experience online. And there’s<a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/cai-symposium-2023"> momentum for C2PA adoption</a> across industries and disciplines.</p><p>We recently spoke with Dmytro about how Respeecher implemented Content Credentials, his tips for getting started, and why provenance is critical for building trust into the digital ecosystem.</p><p>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>How would you describe Respeecher?</p><p>Respeecher lets one person perform in the voice of another. At the heart of our product is a collection of high-quality voice conversion algorithms. We don't use text as input; instead, we utilize speech. This enables individuals to not just speak but also perform with various vocal styles, including nonverbal and emotional expressions. For example, we enable actors to embody different vocal masks, similar to how they can put on makeup.&nbsp;</p><p>Who are you looking to reach with the Voice Marketplace?</p><p>Initially, our focus was on the film and TV industry. We’ve applied our technology in big studio projects, such as Lucasfilm’s limited series “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” where we synthesized James Earl Jones’ voice for Darth Vader.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we’re launching our Voice Marketplace, which democratizes the technology we’ve used in Hollywood for everyone. The platform allows individuals to speak using any voice from our library. This will enable small creators to develop games, streams, and other content, including amateur productions. While we’ll maintain oversight of content moderation and voice ownership, we’ll now have less control over the content’s destination and usage.&nbsp;</p><p>What motivated you to join the Content Authenticity Initiative?</p><p>First, the CAI aids in preventing misinformation. We do not allow user-defined voices (say President Biden’s), as controlling that would be quite difficult. Still, users should know that the content they’re consuming involves synthetic speech. As a leader in this space, we want to ensure that all generated content from our marketplace has Content Credentials. In the future, as all browsers and content distribution platforms support data provenance, it will be easy for consumers to verify how the audio in a video was produced. If something lacks cryptographic Content Credentials, it will automatically raise suspicion about authenticity.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, the initiative addresses the needs of content creators. By embedding credentials in the audio they produce, they can make it clear that the work is their own artistic creation.&nbsp;</p><p>How do Content Credentials work in Respeecher?</p><p>We have integrated CAI's open-source C2PA tool into our marketplace. Whenever synthetic audio is rendered on our servers, it is automatically cryptographically signed as being a product of the Respeecher marketplace. When clients download the audio, it contains metadata with Content Credentials stating that it was converted into a different voice by Respeecher. GlobalSign, our third-party certificate authority, signs our credentials with its cryptographic key so that anyone who receives our content can automatically verify that it was signed by us and not an impersonator.</p><p>The metadata isn't a watermark but rather a side component of the file. If the metadata is removed, consumers are alerted that the file's source is uncertain. If the file is modified after it’s downloaded (say someone changes the name of the target voice), the cryptographic signature won't match the file's contents. So it’s impossible to manipulate the metadata without invalidating Respeecher’s signature.&nbsp;</p>





















  
  



<p>All voice cloned audio files downloaded from Respeecher Marketplace includes Content Credentials for AI transparency. </p>


  <p>What challenges did you encounter while implementing Content Credentials technology?</p><p>Surprisingly, the biggest challenge was obtaining keys from our certificate authority. We had to prove that we were a legitimate organization, which took several weeks and some back and forth with GlobalSign.</p><p>Another challenge was that cryptography, particularly public key infrastructure (PKI), can be challenging to grasp for someone who isn’t an expert. Our team had to understand the specifics of C2PA, figure out appropriate configurations, and determine whether we needed a third-party certificate authority. These nuances required time and effort, especially since we don’t have a cryptographic expert on our team. However, the CAI team and community were incredibly helpful in assisting us with these challenges.</p><p>What advice do you have for other developers getting started with Content Credentials and the CAI’s open-source tools?</p><p>Start with <a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/introduction">CAI’s Getting Started guide</a>, but then dedicate time to read the <a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/index.html#_technical_specifications">C2PA specification document</a>. Although it is somewhat long and intimidating, it’s surprisingly comprehensible for non-experts.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, utilize ChatGPT to help explain complex concepts to you. Even though ChatGPT doesn’t know the technical details of C2PA (because its current version has limited access to information beyond certain dates), it still does a great job explaining concepts such as PKI and cryptographic signatures.</p><p>What's next for you when it comes to advances in AI safety and Content Credentials?</p><p>We’re planning to give users of our marketplace the option to add their own authorship credentials to the Content Credentials. Currently, the metadata indicates that the audio was modified by Respeecher, but it doesn't attribute the audio to its creator. Some users may prefer to remain anonymous, but others will choose to include their credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>Respeecher will continue to be at the forefront of initiatives to adopt data provenance standards across the AI synthetic media industry. It’s essential for companies to create a unified authentication layer for audio and video content, and content distribution platforms like YouTube and news websites have a crucial role to play in embracing this technology. Just as a lack of HTTPS warns users of potential security issues, a similar mechanism could alert users to the source of an audio file, enhancing transparency and authenticity.</p><p>We are also closely watching how the concept of cloud-hosted metadata develops. Embedding hard-to-remove watermarks in audio and video signals without making them obvious remains a largely unsolved problem. By storing metadata in the cloud and enabling checks for pre-signed content, we can potentially simplify authentication and the synthetic media detection problem.</p>

<p>The first in-depth security analysis of OpenID for Verifiable Credentials has been completed, with the goal of increasing confidence in the security of these specifications. The formal security analysis includes the protocols OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI) and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP), both part of the <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials family</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.18419/opus-13772">formal security analysis</a> uses the Web Infrastructure Model (WIM), a detailed formal model of the web, which has been developed by the University of Stuttgart and used to complete formal analysis of other protocols including the OpenID Foundation standards OpenID Connect, FAPI 1.0 and FAPI 2.0, and the foundational IETF standard OAuth 2.0 (RFC6749). In this instance, the WIM is used to model the interaction of OID4VCI and OID4VP in an ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This work has been carried out as part of a master’s thesis at University of Stuttgart co-supervised by Verimi GmbH. The goal of the thesis was to prove that both protocols are secure with respect to the definition of security under certain assumptions and modeling decisions. The security definition used in the analysis covers several important properties around credential issuance and presentation; in particular, that an attacker must not be able to impersonate an honest user, initiate a login flow on a user’s device, or force a user to be logged in under an attacker-chosen identity.</p>
<p>For cases where certain preconditions are not met, the analysis revealed some potential attacks. In particular, the pre-authorized code flow in OID4VCI and the cross-device flow in OID4VP may be vulnerable to phishing attacks and require user attention to be secure. These attacks are not surprising, as cross-device flow vulnerabilities are a well-known class of attacks, affecting <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-cross-device-security-04.html">most cross-device protocols</a>. However, the analysis also confirmed the security of the same-device flows of OpenID for Verifiable Credentials. The OpenID Foundation’s Decentralized Credentials Protocols WG has taken the feedback from this master’s thesis into account in the current versions of the specifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the analysis, a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.18419/opus-13772">master’s thesis</a>, for details on the assumptions, modeling decisions, security properties, and the formal mathematical proof.</p>
<p>Our thanks to Fabian Hauck for his master’s thesis, conducted under the supervision of Dr. Daniel Fett and Pedram Hosseyni M.Sc with Prof. Ralf Küsters as the Examiner at the Institute of Information Security, University of Stuttgart. The thesis was generously supported by Verimi GmbH through the IDunion project. Please note that this analysis is preliminary and has not yet been peer-reviewed. Additionally, it may not reflect recent changes in the current specifications as the analysis is based on the May 2023 versions of OpenID for Verifiable Presentations and OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance.</p>
 <br>OpenID Foundation 
<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally.

<p>Welcome to Blockchain Commons’ yearly report on our status and projects.</p>



 What is Blockchain Commons? 

<p>We’ve revisited <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision/">Our Vision</a> in past annual reports for Blockchain Commons, but this year we have a great overview of Blockchain Commons that we want to share. It was penned by Simon Ratner, one of our long-time patrons at Proxy, and now Head of Engineering at ŌURA. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Blockchain Commons isn’t a traditional industry association that only organizes, where all the work is contributed by the member companies. They’re producing their own architectures and reference libraries and sample applications. So in a way they are co-developing their standards, remaining independent while working among industry companies.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They provide specifications that actually exist and have been tested and vetted. This is especially important for a startup, since we’re benefiting the most from having standardized and interoperable work, as well as from having access to work of an additional engineering team.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’re appreciative of Simon for his recommendation, but also for his clear statement of what Blockchain Commons is and what we do. Blockchain Commons develops specifications that create interoperability. Doing so does indeed give smaller companies a leg up. While working with those companies, we’re also offering our own expertise. We’re doing so to benefit users and companies alike by creating a shared infrastructure that embeds our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">Gordian Principles</a> of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness.</p>

<p>The whole recommendation can be found at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophera/details/recommendations/?detailScreenTabIndex=0">LinkedIn</a>. Thanks, Simon!</p>

 Our Standardizations 

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsFF5HPKQIk">
  
</a></p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has been working on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research?tab=readme-ov-file#contents">specifications</a> for years. Our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/animated-qrs/">Animated QRs</a>, which are built on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">URs</a>, were our first specification to receive strong uptake in the digital-asset wallet community. We released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsFF5HPKQIk">a video</a> this year to memorialize that. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a> data format has been one of our major initiates over the last year and a half or so.</p>

<p>But specifications are just the first step. We  ultimately need to work with standards bodies to ensure that our specifications are reliable and accessible in the long-term. In 2023, our specifications reached a sufficient level of maturity that we were able to begin that work.</p>

<p>Much of out new push for standardization focused on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/dcbor/">dCBOR</a>, or deterministic CBOR. This is a variant of the CBOR data format that allows for consistent representation of data, something that is vital for a variety of use cases including our own Envelope. We’ve just published <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/">v07</a> of the spec, with CBOR expert <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/cabo@tzi.org">Carsten Bormann</a> now on board as a co-author, so we’re quite hopeful this will become an actual standard soon.</p>

<p>We’ve also been working on an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-envelope/">Envelope standard for the IETF</a>. We hope that there is interest in the format, but ultimately we’ll be happy if we can get the larger community focused on hash-based elision as a privacy measure, whether that’s with Envelope or not.</p>

<p>Our Envelope standardization work also expanded to IANA, who registers <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml">CBOR tags</a>. Envelope is now registered with tag #200, allowing its widespread recognition whether it becomes an IETF standard or not. Other tags, which are used for <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">URs</a>, are also officially registered in the #40000+ range.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great year for this new step forward in our specification work. It gives us strong faith that as we finalize the development of specifications with our community, we can move them into standards for use by the larger ecosystem.</p>

 Our Community 

<p><a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/"></a></p>

<p>Work with the IETF helped Blockchain Commons to dramatically expand its community in 2023 through our meetings with that standards body. However, the Gordian Development community of wallet designers, chip manufacturers, and others continues to be our core constituency. As Simon wrote, part of Blockchain Commons’ mission is to act as an industry group that turns the needs of our patrons and partners into reality. That work is done with the Gordian community.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons held a full dozen meetings with community members in 2023, including eight regular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCkrqxOY1Fbp-P1Yv-7gmu75i2QS2Z6vk">Gordian Developer meetings</a>, one meeting focused on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HTuYL9-4T0">signing with Bitcoin keys</a>, two <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salons/">Silicon Salons</a>, and one <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">FROST Round Table</a>. We’re very appreciative of everyone who took the time to join us, and we’ve taken some real pointers from the community this year, resulting in the publication of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-010-output-descriptor.md">Gordian output descriptor v3</a> and a new system for detailing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/research/?tab=readme-ov-file#status">the status of our specifications</a>.</p>

<p>We expect community members to benefit from our meetings too. Most recently, we heard of a tape-out, where the design of a circuit is sent to a manufacturing facility, following the work at our Silicon Salons where we brought together hardware-wallet manufacturers with semiconductor manufacturers interested in supporting them.</p>

 Our Depository 

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uW6xlT4hTk"></a></p>

<p>Standards such as Envelope and dCBOR focus on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">openness</a>, but Blockchain Commons’ attention to resilience is at least as important. Openness ensures that a user will be able to control their digital assets through the interoperable tools of a variety of developers, while resilience helps them to be safe while doing so.</p>

<p>Since late 2022, our major resilience project has been <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/csr/">Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR)</a>. It attacks one of the biggest problems with independent control of your digital assets: it’s too easy to lose your keys (and the seeds they’re constructed from). Shamir’s Secret Sharing, which is part of our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">security-reviewed SSKR library</a>, offers one solution: you shard a secret and then only need to recover some of those shares to reconstruct your seed. But, the shares can be subject to loss just like the seed itself!</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/csr/">CSR</a>. It envisions a variety of automated ways to recover shares from remote servers using diverse authentication systems to maximize security. Throughout 2023, Blockchain Commons advanced <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Envelope</a> as a methodology for storing not just seeds, but the metadata critical for fully restoring both a seed and its assets. Toward the end of the year we also released our first version of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-depo-rust">Gordian Depository</a>, a CSR server that can remotely store those Envelopes (or other data).</p>

<p>The next step is for Blockchain Commons to publicly deploy its Depository, which we hope will be the first of a network of share servers, provided by a variety of organizations. We hope these organizations will include not just traditional Bitcoin wallet companies, but also organizations such as modern-art museums, who have a mission to not only display but also preserve artwork — and for NFTs that means protecting Ethereum and Tezos keys. A varied and diverse ecosystem like this will give users real choices for whom they want to store their seed shares with.</p>

<p>We hope to see this ecosystem development over the course of 2024, but the strong foundation is now there.</p>

 FROST is Coming 

<p>Though we mainly focus on the big picture in our annual report, we wanted to mention our increasing focus on FROST, a quorum signature system that uses Schnorr. We’ve been watching Schnorr signatures for a long time and think they’re both important and powerful because of abilities such as threshold, blind, and adapter signatures, as Christopher wrote in <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">“A Layperson’s Intro to Schnorr”</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">FROST</a>  became a lot more accessible in 2023 thanks to the Zcash Foundation’s release of <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/">ZF FROST</a>. We hosted a first <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">round table</a> to give FROST implementers the chance to talk with each other about their work and expect to continue supporting this exciting new technology in the year ahead.</p>

 Our Websites 

<p></p>

<p>Of course, no specification, standard, or other work is worthwhile unless people can access it. As a result, Blockchain Commons put real work in 2023 into expanding our presence on the web.</p>

<p>Most importantly, we launched a new <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/">Developer Website</a> that collects together all of our tutorials, test vectors, and other info for developers, demonstrating how to implement URs, SSKR, and the rest. (Links throughout this yearly report connect back to developer pages.)</p>

<p>We also created a new <a href="https://advocacy.blockchaincommons.com/">Advocacy Website</a>, which focuses primarily on our support for (or criticism of)  upcoming digital-asset laws. This remains an important topic: most recently, we talked about <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/eidas/">the dangers of EIDAS in Europe</a> and looked back at <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/echoes-history/">the tragedies created by overidentification in the past</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve also updated our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/">Main Website</a> and our <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">SmartCustody Website</a> to fit the same format as our new sites and link them all into a cohesive whole.</p>

<p>Related, Christopher updated his own <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/">Life with Alacrity</a> blog pages, which offer many of his thoughts on collaboration and identity going back two decades. His new <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/tags/#musings-of-a-trust-architect">Musings of a Trust Architect</a> articles appear there as well (but also on the <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/posts/">Blockchain Commons blog</a>).</p>

<p>We of course continue to do much of our work in GitHub, which is the internet home of our library and apps — as well as our actual specifications, in the form of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/README.md">Research Papers repo</a>. We reorganized things there as well, with a new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/README.md#status">“Research Status”</a> system that reveals the adoption level and thus stability of each of our specifications.</p>

 Looking Forward 

<p>The Blockchain Commons <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision/">mission statement</a> highlights four objectives: creating a Commons, Architecture, and Demand and establishing relationships with Peers. We expect to continue to work on all of these objectives in 2024.</p>

<p>A lot of our work is part of creating a Commons. We’re thrilled to constantly add reference libraries and apps to the Commons, including <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Gordian Seed Tool</a>, which should see a 1.6 release early in 2024. We think that our new advocacy toward <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Open-Development/">Open Development</a> will be an important next step in creating this Commons; we expect to discuss that more widely in the coming year.</p>

<p>We talked about our Architecture underpinnings much more in 2023 with Christopher’s <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/">Musings of a Trust Architect articles</a>. We expect more of that in 2024, with the topics of edge identifiers and cliques currently in our queue for both discussion and experimentation. However, we’re also working on the opposite side of the spectrum, which involves making our architectural ideas into standardized reality. We’ll be continuing to work with IETF, with plans to release a Problem Statement on the needs for hash-based elision for data storage, and we’re also planning to move some of our specifications to BIPs, beginning with our animated QR work.</p>

<p>We also expect to further investigate the usage of NFCs in a secure digital-asset architecture. This will include an examination of commodity NFC smartcards with the intent of creating references and best practices for securing a variety of data, from seeds and share to backed-up keys for developers. This is of a piece with our work on Depo servers: the ultimate goal is to give users a choice as to how their store their digital-asset seeds &amp; keys.</p>

<p>Some of architectural work ties directly to our work on Demands. We want to increase the call for privacy-first solutions to better support human rights, protect against coercion, and generally allow people to decide what information they release to the world. Demonstrating the need for hash-based elision is one way to do so.</p>

<p>Finally, we will continue to support our Peers, especially through <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/README.md#detailed-list-of-meeting-summaries-with-archives-of-video-mp3-and-transcripts">meetings</a>. Besides our regular Gordian meetings, we also hope to organize special-purpose events for emerging hot topics. This may include more <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">FROST round tables</a>, additional <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salons</a>, or others as needs arise within the digital-asset space.</p>

<p>However, we need your help to ensure this future. The financial climate for web3 work became very poor in 2023 due to investments drying up for the whole sector. This has resulted in some of our long-term patrons being forced to step back or even merge their businesses, which has impacted their patronage. If your company benefits from our work, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a> to ensure it continues. We are particularly looking for companies able to become sponsors at the $1,000 a month or better level. Please contact <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">Christopher Allen</a> to learn more of the benefits of doing so.</p>

<p>Value to Canadians:</p>



<p>The purpose of the PCTF&nbsp;Authentication&nbsp;Component is to assure the on-going integrity of&nbsp;login&nbsp;and&nbsp;authentication&nbsp;processes by certifying, through a process of assessment, that they comply with standardized Conformance Criteria. The Conformance Criteria for this component may be used to provide assurances:</p>



<p>          ·&nbsp;&nbsp;That Trusted Processes result in the representation of a unique Subject at a Level of Assurance that it is the same Subject with each successful&nbsp;login&nbsp;to an&nbsp;Authentication&nbsp;Service Provider.</p>



<p>          ·&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the predictability and continuity in the&nbsp;login&nbsp;processes that they offer or on which they depend.</p>



<p>All participants will benefit from:</p>



<p>          ·&nbsp;&nbsp;Login&nbsp;and&nbsp;authentication&nbsp;processes that are repeatable and consistent (whether they offer these processes, depend on them, or both).</p>



<p>          ·&nbsp;&nbsp;Assurance that identified Users can engage in authorized interactions with remote systems.</p>



<p>Relying Parties benefit from:</p>



<p>          ·&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to build on the assurance that&nbsp;Authentication&nbsp;Trusted Processes uniquely identify, at an acceptable level of risk, a Subject in their application or program space.</p>



<p>Context:</p>



<p>The purpose of this review is to ensure transparency in the development and diversity of a truly Pan-Canadian, and international, input. In alignment with our&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2fYrPnp6IfEBHfPEuSPoUi0VbjWCBPLg-rbAvg3CuA7DL8oYSjQHGTwDiBHNn9XMsZMXkOA9rQLiJ_dtRZH_XcXjF0HC9KOgR9wElFiHxDXpfifauYL0JEnmIZFfOvYZ-fnj2kVIyvhKJWJX9FJv7HTR7lY4DMWOlTzVJMQzCpiJR2RVK4LnPluE">Principles for an Identity Ecosystem</a>, processes to respect and enhance privacy are being prioritized through every step of the PCTF development process.</p>



<p>DIACC expects to modify and improve these Draft Recommendations based upon public comments. Comments made during the review will be considered for incorporation into the next iteration and DIACC will prepare a Disposition of Comments to provide transparency with regard to how each comment was handled.</p>

  We're introducing more code written in Rust to Ceramic's codebase.

 Introduction <p>At 3Box Labs, the core team building Ceramic, we are continually striving to produce the best solution for off-chain storage. This requires a combination of simplifying the user experience, while also delivering on the demanding requirements of users when it comes to performance and safety. To accomplish this, we’ve started to introduce more code written in Rust to our codebase.</p><p>For those not familiar with Rust, Rust is a language that focuses on three areas</p>  Performance  Reliability  Productivity  <p>We will dive into what Rust offers for performance and reliability, and how that allows us to produce fast, reliable, and secure off-chain storage on Ceramic. We will not talk about productivity in this blog post, as that is somewhat subjective and leads to language debates (even if we do love the productivity).</p> 1. Performance With Efficient Memory Usage and Systems Programming <p>One of the main reasons that Rust is able to achieve its performance is that it does not use a virtual machine or garbage collector. When Rust code is built, it produces machine code and binaries at a systems level, like C or C++. To further improve on this, Rust also has zero-cost abstractions. Zero-cost abstractions allow developers to focus on writing clean, performant, and maintainable code, as the compiler will remove the abstractions used and produce optimized machine code.</p>Source: <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/?ref=blog.ceramic.network#hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;section=data-r22&amp;l=yyj30e-cn3">TechEmpower Round 22 Benchmarks</a><p>Rust regularly performs similarly to C and C++ in benchmarks, while often having some measurable performance improvement over Go. In the above image, you will see a <code>Lng</code> column indicating the language a webserver is written in. Rust webservers, denoted with <code>rs</code> and purple in color, outperform C (<code>C</code> - red), C++ (<code>C++</code> - red), and Go (<code>Go</code> - green).</p>Go (Purple) vs Rust (Blue) Comparison. <a href="https://discord.com/blog/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Source</a>.<p>Additionally, Rust regularly produces better 75% and 99% response times due to better memory management. Discord switched from Go to Rust largely because these spikes wreak havoc on systems and user experience. They would have @mention spikes of 2 seconds or higher with Go, while Rust would consistently be in the sub-second range.</p> 2. Reliability: Safety and Uptime <p>The decentralized nature of Web3 applications demands an unyielding commitment to safety. Additionally, our users demand availability of their data, so uptime is of primary importance. When dealing with systems languages like C and C++, most people are familiar with the multitude of common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) that are filed, with a large number due to issues around memory management.</p><p>As mentioned above, Rust performance is a result of its close-to-the-metal code and memory management without a garbage collector. To ensure safety, Rust has introduced a memory ownership system, enforced at compile time, rather than runtime. This ownership system determines who is using data, and when it is free to release that data and, once freed, ensures that no one else can improperly use that data.</p> <code>fn main() {
    {
        let x = 42;

        println!("x: {}", x);
    }

    println!("x: {}", x); // ERROR: x not in scope
}
</code> <p>This additional security has led to a large number of companies needing secure-by-default software to start implementing code in Rust. Rust was created by Mozilla for use in Firefox to improve performance and security. Google and Microsoft have both been introducing more Rust into systems such as Windows and Android.</p> 3. Performance and Safety: Binaries and Containerization <p>One final benefit to Rust is our ability to deliver binaries for systems, providing a verifiable supply chain to your running program, and allowing you to choose whether you want to run our software natively on your system, or through a container. For those of you choosing containers, we are also able to deliver much smaller images, usually 100-200mb or less, compared to our Javascript images, which are much closer to 1GB in size.</p> What’s Next <p>As we release more software in Rust, we will let you know and share upgrade paths for any software that is a replacement on our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">blog</a>. Additionally, we will be looking to build more functionality in WASM, so users that require in-browser functionality with performance and safety can leverage libraries that 3Box Labs produces.</p><p>We look forward to continuing to provide you with the fastest, most reliable off-chain storage for your Web3 needs.</p><p>If you'd like to tell us more about your project or get in touch with the core team please <a href="https://noteforms.com/forms/ecosystem-projects-i8uqzp?ref=blog.ceramic.network">fill out this form</a>.</p>

 Demystifying technology through common&nbsp;language <p>Here at the co-op we talk about a lot about mental models and metaphors. As we’ve written in the past, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/sim-city-2000-as-a-metaphor-for-open-recognition-and-open-badges-462fb8224a3c">metaphors are powerful things</a>, helping people understand complex ideas like how to build Open Recognition programmes. They can <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/non-violent-communication-in-communities-dde7b1bf9b8e">shape community culture</a>. They mean people can spend less time understanding a thing and more time working to make that thing&nbsp;better.</p>cc-by WAO<p>We’ve started working with the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC), an applied research lab working on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). Hosted at <a href="https://mit.edu">MIT</a> with a membership portfolio that currently includes <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/who-we-are">12 other universities</a>, the DCC is leading the development of technical standards that underpin VCs. They are building demos and betas to help university registrars and IT departments, employers, vendors and developers understand the power of this technology.</p><p>When we talk about this work to people who don’t work in technology, we have to lean heavily on real-world metaphors to help people understand the underlying concepts of how technology works. Educators understand marking achievement with a credential much differently to technologists. As both educators and technologists, we need to find ways to explain the new and various worlds that technology opens up for&nbsp;us.</p><p>The DCC seeks to empower learners by enabling them to have ownership and control over their digital credentials. As an applied research lab, the DCC can show that the technology works, paving the way for much wider adoption. However, technology alone is never enough. Most people do not care about a technical standard per say, they care about what that standard can do for them. Aas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> famously pointed out, people tend to understand new things using existing mental&nbsp;models.</p><p>In this post, therefore, we want to play with a few examples, metaphors and mental models to help us explain what the DCC&nbsp;does.</p> Examples of standards <p>There are a couple ways to understand a ‘standard’.</p><p>A standard can be just the usual way of doing something. A standard can also be a reference to make sure things can be understood in the same way, no matter where or what is referencing the standard.</p><p>For example a kilogram in France is the same as kilogram in Germany, and a kilogram of feathers weighs the same as a kilogram of bricks. The kilogram is the standard, but where it is applied or what it is used for is up to whoever is using&nbsp;it.</p><p>Here’s some examples of standards you’ve probably heard&nbsp;about:</p>  Metric System: 100 centimetres is a metre and a foot is 12 inches. All our rulers and measuring tapes follow one of these systems, at least in the western industrialised world.  AM/FM Radio: “Amplitude modulation” or “Frequency modulation”, the way radios work is standardised.  Timezones, chemical symbols, maritime signal flags — our world has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_common_standards">plenty of standards</a>.  CC BY-ND Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>A technical standard is similar to these everyday standards, and how we get things such as the entire internet. We have technical standards that allow us to communicate and collaborate on the World Wide Web. However, because people need to understand what they are doing at any given point, we use homely metaphors — such as an envelope to signal ‘email’ (i.e. a digital message sent between servers).</p><p>Open technical standards are important when it comes to digital credentials. We don’t want a world in which the digital credentials we’ve earned at University X work differently to those at University Y and aren’t understood by Organisation Z. We need to make sure that our symbols of achievement make sense to whoever is looking at&nbsp;them.</p> Towards new metaphors for&nbsp;VCs <p>The DCC is active in helping shape the open technical standard for Verifiable Credentials and building ‘reference implementations’ on top of it. That’s a lot to take in if all you need to know is “Can we use DCC’s openly licensed work?” or “Is this person qualified?”</p>the DCC&nbsp;logo<p>In technology, standards are a way to ensure that solutions with different tech stacks work together in a way that is described as interoperable. There are common examples of technical standards in action such&nbsp;as:</p>  Email standard: Did you ever think about how you can send an email to any email address no matter what domain the email is pointing to? (e.g. laura@example.com can send an email to doug@mycooladdress.edu)  HTTP: You will have noticed the “http://“ or “https://“ in your browser menu bar. The HTTP application layer of the World Wide Web is what’s called a “standard protocol”.  URLs: Come to think of it “Uniform Resource Locator” are also standardised, which is why you can just type in <a href="http://blog.weareopen.coop">blog.weareopen.coop</a> and end up reading this&nbsp;post!  <p>The DCC exceeds at promoting interoperability. It creates and maintains open-source tools that facilitate issuing, verifying, and managing digital credentials in different contexts. The DCC contributes to the development of open standards necessary for Verifiable Credentials to gain global acceptance, like email&nbsp;has.</p> Mental models, metaphors and symbolism <p>Helping people understand examples of a standard is one thing, finding a metaphor for a specific standard is quite&nbsp;another.</p><p>A mental model is the container within which you can include a metaphor. A metaphor is, further, a container within which you can use symbolism and iconography.</p><p>If you have the mental model of chatting with your friends, the metaphor of “speech clouds” — this is a metaphor because language is not visible — helps you understand why most chat apps use speech clouds as logos and icons. This symbolism and iconography helps users understand that a piece of software can help them communicate with other&nbsp;people.</p><p>These mental shortcuts pop up all across technology — A folder icon to signify a new organising container for a body of work. A telephone to indicate making a call. A camera to designate a photo application.</p><p>Most people have a mental model of what “credentials” are, so how can we use other containers to explain Verifiable Credentials? The secret is in the name — “Verifiable” denotes “trust”, but it’s not actual trust. To use a metaphor the DCC often uses, VCs guarantee that what is inside the envelope hasn’t been tampered with, but doesn’t say anything about the letter inside&nbsp;it.</p><p>We trust other people’s trust. For example, if someone has a driver’s license, we trust that they know how to drive. It’s not just because they have the license, but rather we trust the agency behind the credential.</p><p>Often for trust, safety or verification, we use symbols like padlocks and vaults. For credentials, we often use seals and certification icons. Might using these kinds of iconography help users and implementers understand what is involved with cryptographically-signed credentials such as&nbsp;VCs?</p> Mental models for&nbsp;VCs <p>If we abstract away from “credentials” as the mental model, we might find other ways to explain this work. Another mental model that could help people understand what Verifiable Credentials are is the World Wide Web. Anyone can create a webpage, but some webpages are created by people or organisations we trust more than others. For example, when you want to know the weather, you likely go to the webpage of an organisation that employs meteorologists and uses weather prediction models.</p>the DCC’s work as a&nbsp;tree<p>Verifiable Credentials could also be thought about as state-issued identity documents. Be it a birth certificate, passport or drivers license, a marriage certificate or a school transcript. Even before the internet, these forms of identity documents are requested and verified by people other than the person who owns them (e.g. Laura’s birth certificate or Laura’s school transcript). These kinds of credentials are more than just the paper the credential is printed on. For example, a school transcript is a ‘product’ which is produced by a ‘school system’ that is predicated on national standards.</p><p>There are a variety of organisations that issue identity documents. They are issued in different countries and with different water marks. Somewhere underneath it all though, there are standards and processes, procedures and protocols that make identity documentation for many people* interoperable. No matter who issued your birth certificate, you can use it to verify your identity. The big flaw in this mental model is the fact that ANYONE, not just states or governments or elite organisations, can issue Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>The DCC doesn’t just work in standards. They also create infrastructure and lightweight products to help people visualise why these standards matter. This is part of the reason we wish to experiment with different mental&nbsp;models.</p><p>*Unfortunately not all people have even this amount of privilege.

   <p>The digital landscape is on the cusp of a monumental transformation. As of February 1, 2024, Google and Yahoo! are enforcing Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) protocols. This pivotal moment signifies the beginning of the end for online identity fraud, ushering us into a new era of digital identity security.</p>



 Understanding SPF, DKIM, and DMARC: The Trinity of Email Security 



<p>Before delving into the implications of this enforcement, let’s understand what SPF, DKIM, and DMARC entail:</p>



 
 SPF (Sender Policy Framework): This protocol verifies the sender’s IP address against the list of authorized sending IPs for a domain. It prevents email spoofing, ensuring that emails originate from legitimate sources. 



 DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): DKIM adds a digital signature to each email, which helps the receiving server verify that the email hasn’t been tampered with and is from a legitimate domain. 



 DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance): This protocol uses SPF and DKIM to provide a holistic approach to email validation. It allows domain owners to decide how an email should be treated if it fails SPF or DKIM checks. 
 



 The Impact on Online Identity Fraud 



<p>The enforcement of these protocols by internet giants like Google and Yahoo! is a game-changer in combating online identity fraud. By ensuring that emails are authenticated, it becomes increasingly difficult for fraudsters to execute phishing attacks and impersonate others. This move is a critical step towards a future where digital identity is secure and trusted.</p>



 The Path to Mandatory Digital ID 



<p>This development is not just about improving email security; it’s a significant stride towards the broader goal of establishing a mandatory digital ID. The enforcement of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols lays the foundation for a more secure digital identity ecosystem. It sets a precedent for other online platforms and service providers to follow suit, gradually building a more robust and fraud-resistant digital world.</p>



 What This Means for You 



<p>For tech-savvy individuals and businesses, this change is a call to action. It’s essential to ensure that your domains are compliant with these protocols. Not only will this protect your digital identity, but it will also ensure that your communications are trusted and reach their intended recipients.</p>



 Embracing the Future 



<p>The enforcement of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols marks a significant milestone in our journey towards a secure digital future. It’s a crucial step in the fight against online identity fraud, paving the way for the inevitable integration of mandatory digital IDs. As we embrace these changes, we move closer to a world where our digital identities are as secure and authentic as our physical ones.</p>



<p>Stay informed in online identity security, stay secure, and <a>join us</a> in welcoming this <a href="https://usdebtclock.org/">new era of</a> digital identity protection.</p>

  Interfaces, a new feature of ComposeDB, offer standardization, flexibility and efficient data queries.

<p>The Ceramic protocol has expanded ComposeDB's capabilities with a new feature called Interfaces (<a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-composedb/releases/tag/v0.6.0?ref=blog.ceramic.network">introduced in ComposeDB v0.6.0</a>). Interfaces are important for setting standards in data models.</p><p>Interfaces also constitute another step toward real data composability, which is the ability to easily combine and recombine data from various sources to create new datasets or insights.</p><p>This article explains Interfaces, why they're useful, and how they're implemented in ComposeDB.</p> What are Interfaces? <p>Interfaces are like a blueprint for data models. They define a set of fields that any type or model must include to be compliant with the Interface. This approach ensures that different models, though unique, maintain a level of standardization and interoperability.</p><p>In ComposeDB, Interfaces help create a common ground for diverse data models.</p><p>For a simplified example, you could have an Interface&nbsp;<code>Vehicle</code>&nbsp;that represents any kind of vehicle in a transportation system.</p> <code>interface Vehicle {
  id: ID!
  model: String!
  operators: [Person]
  usedIn: [Route]!
}
</code> <p>This means that any type that&nbsp;implements&nbsp;<code>Vehicle</code>&nbsp;must have these specific fields.</p><p>Here are some types that might implement&nbsp;<code>Vehicle</code>:</p> <code>type Car implements Vehicle {
  id: ID!
  model: String!
  operators: [Person]
  usedIn: [Route]!
  passengerCapacity: Int
  vehicleType: String
}
type Airplane implements Vehicle {
  id: ID!
  model: String!
  operators: [Person]
  usedIn: [Route]!
  wingspan: Float
  airline: String
}
</code> <p>You'll notice that both of these types possess all the fields from the&nbsp;<code>Vehicle</code>&nbsp;Interface, but they also feature additional fields:&nbsp;<code>passengerCapacity</code>,&nbsp;<code>vehicleType</code>,&nbsp;<code>wingspan</code>, and&nbsp;<code>airline</code>, that are unique to that specific kind of vehicle.</p><p>Interfaces are particularly useful when you wish to return an object or a collection of objects, and these objects could represent several different types.</p> Benefits of Interfaces in ComposeDB <p>Interfaces in ComposeDB offer several advantages:</p>  Standardization: They create a common standard for different models to follow, which is essential for consistency  Flexibility: Interfaces allow for the expansion of models by adding new fields, without breaking the established standards. (Note: Interfaces do not extend the existing models, they create new models that implement the same fields and constraints)  Efficient data queries: With Interfaces, it's easier to query data across various models, when these models share the same interface. You don't need to query by all the models separately, you can query by a single interface that these models share. This makes data retrieval more efficient.   Interface Implementation Example <p>An excellent example of Interfaces in action within Ceramic is the <a href="https://ceramic.network/patterns/verifiable-claims?ref=blog.ceramic.network">verifiable credentials</a> Interface. This Interface example standardizes the structure for decentralized identity systems.</p><p>It establishes a standard set of fields for all credential models, ensuring consistency across applications. At the same time, it allows you to add whatever additional fields you need for your own application.</p> <code>## Define the overarching VC interface that acts agnostic of our proof type
interface VerifiableCredential
  @createModel(description: "A verifiable credential interface")
{
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  issuer: Issuer!
  context: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  type: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  credentialSchema: CredentialSchema!
  credentialStatus: CredentialStatus
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  expirationDate: DateTime
}

## Use the main interface to create a more specific interface - this one is for EIP712
interface VCEIP712Proof implements VerifiableCredential
  @createModel(description: "A verifiable credential interface of type EIP712")
{
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  issuer: Issuer!
  context: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  type: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  credentialSchema: CredentialSchema!
  credentialStatus: CredentialStatus
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  expirationDate: DateTime
  proof: ProofEIP712! # The new field that is not present in the original interface
}

## Define our EIP712 type that uses VerifiableCredential and VCEIP712Proof interfaces and on top of that, adds credentialSubject specific to our use case
type VerifiableCredentialEIP712 implements VerifiableCredential &amp; VCEIP712Proof
  @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A verifiable credential of type EIP712")
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "issuanceDate" }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "issuer" }]) {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  issuer: Issuer!
  context: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  type: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  credentialSchema: CredentialSchema!
  credentialStatus: CredentialStatus
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  expirationDate: DateTime
  proof: ProofEIP712!
  credentialSubject: CredentialSubject! # The new field that is not present in any of the two implemented interfaces
}
</code> <p>This snippet shows how an Interface (<code>VerifiableCredential</code>) is defined and how a specific type (<code>VerifiableCredentialEIP712</code>) implements it. This snippet is from our Verifiable Credentials example app and you can <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/verifiable-credentials/blob/with-interfaces/client/composites/00-verifiableCredential.graphql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">see more on GitHub</a>.</p><p>This example of the verifiable credentials Interface standardizes the basic structure for credentials in decentralized identity systems. By doing so, it facilitates various applications in creating, exchanging, and interpreting credentials in a consistent and reliable way.</p> Conclusion <p>Interfaces are crucial in the Ceramic protocol for helping decentralized applications work together. As managing data in a decentralized way becomes more common, knowing and using Interfaces will become more important.</p><p>Are you currently building a project on Ceramic or want to connect with the core team?

Miners will be able to apply for the beta program and start knowledge mining as soon as January. The beta Knowledge miners will be eligible to claim NEURO rewards by publishing Knowledge Assets using both NeuroWeb and Gnosis blockchains. The beta program will be gathering key learnings on the dynamics of knowledge mining as the system matures from beta towards its fully decentralized version on NeuroWeb, setting the stage for the future of knowledge creation across all of humanity’s knowledge fields. Details are available in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/tree/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-20-Knowledge-Mining-for-Decentralized-AI">OT-RFC-20</a> and more will be shared in the upcoming knowledge mining kit&nbsp;release.</p> Catalyst 2: Delegated staking&nbsp;launch <p>As NeuroWeb <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/overview">is loaded with growing enterprise adoption</a> and is used in production environments, the incubation of the new DKG staking module will initially be validated on the Gnosis chain. Gnosis is the ideal environment for staking incubation as DKG V6 integration will already include the new staking module (no breaking change risk). Igniting network activity on the Gnosis chain, 1,000,000 TRAC will be used to kickstart knowledge creation. At the same time, the DKG on NeuroWeb is expected to grow faster with Polkadot’s asynchronous backing feature and other upcoming updates (increasing throughput by a significant factor). Details on delegated staking are available in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/tree/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-18-Growing-the-Trusted-Knowledge-Foundation">OT-RFC-18</a>.</p> Impact base: Terminus (established in Q2&nbsp;2024) <p>The founding population of Terminus consisted of 100,000 especially healthy scientists, whose ostensible purpose was to publish an Encyclopedia Galactica in order to preserve science and technology. The lack of natural resources forced Terminians to develop extremely high-efficiency tech, as their knowledge due to their position as the inheritors of the Imperial Library allowed them to do&nbsp;so.</p> Catalyst 1: Random sampling module for 100x scalability increase in Knowledge Asset throughput capacity <p>The explosive growth of the amount of Knowledge Assets on the DKG V6 has enabled the network to proceed towards the next scalability upgrade. DKG nodes will benefit from the improved “random sampling” method, a significant optimization of blockchain usage resulting in over 100x scalability increase in the amount of Knowledge Assets supported by the DKG and the blockchain layer.</p> Catalyst 2: Multichain growth <p>The multichain approach will explore integrations ranging from the most robust blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin) to the fastest yet less robust chains with strongly established markets, in accordance with the ecosystem’s neutrality principle.</p> Impact base: Gaia (established in H2&nbsp;2024) <p>The human beings on Gaia, under robotic guidance, not only evolved their ability to form an ongoing telepathic group consciousness but also extended this consciousness to the fauna and flora of the planet itself, even including inanimate matter. As a result, the entire planet became a super-organism.</p> Catalyst: AI-powered Autonomous Knowledge Mining <p>Synergizing the effects of Trantor and Terminus bases, Gaia drives the OriginTrail DKG native AI integrations with any model (e.g. Gemini, GPT), vector database (e.g. Milvus, Weaviate), and agent (e.g. AutoGPT). The AI-native capabilities enable a suite of autonomous activities — from discovering inferences in the DKG and mining new knowledge to validating existing data and autonomous agent-based solutions using trusted knowledge on the DKG. The Gaia impact base catalyzation leads to the Convergence in the Metcalfe roadmap&nbsp;phase.</p> Conclusion <p>The impact bases presented in this blog post serve as the V8 Foundation, describing core fields in which impact must be pursued to achieve an effective DKG V8 launch. The above does not focus on integrations with the world’s leading tech solution providers, growing governmental and institutional support, or other adoption updates. Each of the impact bases and their outcomes are therefore expected to be further augmented by the ongoing DKG adoption.</p><p>Stay #OnTrac(k)!</p> About OriginTrail <p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem-building decentralized knowledge infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI).

 Introducing a continuum of ambiguity and reflecting on importance of avoiding dead metaphors in the workplace Image created by DALL-E&nbsp;3<p>There are many things that mark individuals and organisations out as different. We can describe various characteristics and dispositions, but we can also point to different tolerances.</p><p>In this regard, perhaps the one we talk about the most is ‘risk’ tolerance, but in this post let’s explore the tolerance that individuals and organisations have to ambiguity. It’s key to understanding how change&nbsp;happens.</p> Let’s define&nbsp;terms <p>It might seem a little ironic to define a term like ‘ambiguity’, but it’s important to separate it from the idea that something is ‘vague’ or ‘unclear’.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.oed.com/">Oxford English Dictionary</a>, for example, contains several definitions for ambiguity:</p>  Originally and chiefly with reference to language: the fact or quality of having different possible meanings; capacity for being interpreted in more than one way; (also) lack of specificity or exactness.  An instance of ambiguity or uncertain meaning; a doubt; an uncertainty.  A word or phrase that can be interpreted in more than one way; an ambiguous expression.  A nuance which allows for an alternative reading of a piece of language; the fact or quality of having one or more such&nbsp;nuances.  Uncertainty about one’s course of action; doubt, hesitation. Also an instance of this: a feeling of uncertainty, a&nbsp;doubt.  The fact or quality of being difficult to categorise or identify, esp. due to changeable or contradictory qualities or characteristics. Also: something that is difficult to categorise or identify.  <p>If some of these definitions seem like how work sometimes feels, then you’re not alone! Life is ambiguous, but in different ways. Some types of ambiguity are more useful than others, and having a tolerance for ambiguity can be helpful in avoiding ‘dead metaphors’.</p><p>Let’s dig&nbsp;deeper…</p> Introducing a continuum of ambiguity <p>The image below looks simple but comes from plenty of research which spans everything from literary criticism to philosophy.</p>CC BY Doug Belshaw via <a href="https://ambiguiti.es">ambiguiti.es</a> Dead metaphors <p>One way of perhaps making this continuum immediately understandable is to say that something being ‘vague’ would be over to the left. The green bars represent different types of ambiguity, and then the phrase ‘dead metaphors’ represent terms and and ways of speaking which no longer have any explanatory power.</p><p>Here are some examples of dead metaphors — words or phrases which were once novel, but have become so common that they are now considered ‘dead’ or&nbsp;clichéd:</p>  Thinking outside the box — originally meant to encourage creative and unconventional thinking, it’s now a standard phrase for any form of innovation or different thinking.  Moving the goalposts — once a useful metaphor for changing criteria or rules unfairly, it’s now a routine way of describing shifting standards or expectations.  Game changer — initially used to describe something which changed radically the existing conditions or rules, now it’s often used to describe anything even slightly innovative.  <p>So now we understand that we’re dealing with the majority of our working life: the stuff that happens between something just being really unclear or vague, on the one hand, and something being a dead metaphor, on the&nbsp;other.</p> Where does ambiguity come&nbsp;from? <p>While there are different types of ambiguity, they stem from the overlap between what is denoted by a statement and what is connotes.</p>CC BY Doug Belshaw via <a href="https://ambiguiti.es">ambiguiti.es</a><p>The denotative aspect represents the literal, dictionary definition of a word, while the connotative aspect represents the associations, emotions, or additional meanings that the word carries beyond its literal definition.</p><p>There are many examples to help understand this:</p>  Dove — a bird (denotative) and also a sign of peace (connotative)  Home — where someone lives (denotative) and also a feeling of comfort and familiarity (connotative)  Cold — low temperature (denotative) and also a way of interacting that is unfriendly or&nbsp;distant.  <p>The overlap in the diagram, indicated by the arrow, represents words that carry both denotative and connotative meanings simultaneously. This can lead to ambiguity because the person who wrote or spoke the words cannot control their connotation in the mind of someone else. The ambiguity arises from the interplay between the precise, literal meaning and the variable, subjective interpretation of a word’s connotation.</p> Types of ambiguity <p>Given that we live in language and use it to understand the world around us, ambiguity is inevitable. However, as mentioned above, and as shown in the continuum image, there are different types of ambiguity, which are more or less useful for various purposes.</p><p>One way of thinking about these different types is as the state change of a substance from gas, to liquid, through to&nbsp;solid:</p>  Generative Ambiguity — this is where ambiguity can give rise to new ideas or interpretations. These are not usually well-defined and often only make sense to an individual. For example, you may have a flash of insight as to how something you’ve been grappling with in your personal life can help you with your professional life. This would likely only make sense to&nbsp;you.  Creative Ambiguity — here, ambiguity is used to help other people understand an idea. It remains highly contextual, so would only be understood by someone who shares your context: for example, you use a new term to make sense of how some problems your sector has been having are&nbsp;related.  Productive Ambiguity — this represents ambiguity that is beneficial or intentional in generating positive outcomes because it helps people shift their view. For example, as part of a strategy where leaving things unsaid or open to interpretation can lead to more flexible and adaptable solutions.  <p>So Generative Ambiguity is where a term or way of understanding something works for you. Creative Ambiguity is where it works for people like you (i.e. with similar domain knowledge). Productive Ambiguity is when it works for most&nbsp;people.</p> Using different types of ambiguity in your&nbsp;work <p>The first thing to say is that we should avoid vague, unclear statements as much as possible. Likewise, we need to stop talking in dead metaphors. Neither are particularly useful. Challenge both wherever you&nbsp;can.</p><p>Ambiguity, however, is useful, and sitting in it for a period of time can be creatively beneficial. Building up our tolerance of ambiguity involves recognising that not all ambiguity is equal — some types serve us better than others. Understanding how to use different types of ambiguity can be particularly useful in the workplace.</p> Generative Ambiguity <p>Generative ambiguity is a state where ideas are in flux, akin to a brainstorming session where every contribution is valued and nothing is off-limits.</p><p>To use this in your&nbsp;work:</p>  Encourage free thinking: create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing unpolished ideas. This could be through regular brainstorming sessions or a digital ‘ideas&nbsp;board’.  Embrace uncertainty: when presented with a new problem, resist the urge to find immediate clarity. Instead, allow ideas to percolate and evolve. (There’s a wonderful scene in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300015/">I Capture the Castle</a> where the character played by Bill Nighy points to scraps of paper pinned all around his room and says that his “ideas are percolating”)  Reflect individually: set aside time for personal reflection. This can help in connecting disparate ideas, leading to innovative solutions.   Creative Ambiguity <p>Creative ambiguity thrives on context and shared understanding. It’s about communicating new concepts in a way that resonates with a specific audience.</p><p>To encourage this:</p>  Know your audience: tailor your communication to the background and experience of your team. After all, what makes sense in one context may not in another. This is particularly important if you work across countries and timezones.  Use metaphors wisely: use fresh metaphors that align with your team’s experiences to illustrate complex ideas. Metaphors are extremely powerful, so think about the benefits and potentially unexpected consequences of introducing a new&nbsp;one.  Test new terminology: introduce new terms or phrases that encapsulate broader concepts or strategies specific to your work environment. See what resonates.   Productive Ambiguity <p>Productive ambiguity can be strategic, helping build a culture which values flexible thinking without a one-size-fits-none ‘solution’.</p><p>To help this&nbsp;thrive:</p>  Encourage adaptability: when setting project goals, be clear on the outcomes but flexible on the methods to achieve them, allowing room for innovative approaches.  Practice strategic communication: sometimes less is more. Give enough information to guide but not so much that it stifles alternative interpretations or solutions.  Enable collaboration: bring together diverse teams to work on projects. The intersection of different knowledge bases can lead to a fruitful ambiguity that encourages new ways of thinking.   Conclusion <p>Navigating the continuum of ambiguity requires an awareness of language’s power and its impact on thought and communication. By consciously employing different types of ambiguity, we can create environments full ofinnovation, creativity, and strategic thinking.</p><p>It’s about choosing the right tool for the job: sometimes a scalpel, sometimes a hammer, and sometimes a paintbrush. Each type of ambiguity can be your ally, if approached with intention and understanding.</p><p>Do you need some help with navigating and using ambiguity in your organisation?

<p>Rarimo protocol allows users to seamlessly port their identities across Web3. One of Rarimo’s use-cases is RariMe, an extension that allows users to store and manage their identity credentials inside of Metamask, generating privacy-protecting Zero-Knowledge proofs that can be submitted to dApps. So far, there have been over 6,000 RariMe downloads.&nbsp;</p><p>RariMe initially used MetaMask local storage to hold credentials, but switched to Ceramic as it allows for data to be synced between multiple devices—both increasing the portability and improving the disaster recovery process for users.&nbsp;</p> The Story of RariMe <p>Rarimo is an interoperability protocol solving identity fragmentation in Web3. It aggregates issuers and standards, allowing dApps to verify and interact with a broad range of identity artifacts. This in turn allows users to port their identities across Web3. All of this is accomplished with privacy-preserving Zero-Knowledge technology. Rarimo can be thought of as a Chainlink for identities.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior use cases include:&nbsp;</p>  Launching the <a href="https://rarimo.medium.com/why-proof-of-humanity-is-so-important-and-why-rarimo-built-the-worlds-first-poh-aggregator-8d7088192c28?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Proof-of-Humanity plug-in</a>  This plug-in allows platforms to filter out bots by gating access to users who have proven their humanity.  Through a single integration, dApps gain instant access to a range of four identity providers representing different methods of verification: Gitcoin Passport, Unstoppable Domains, Civic, and Worldcoin. This allows users to choose exactly how they prove their humanity.    <a href="https://rarimo.medium.com/rarimo-x-polygon-id-spearheading-the-worlds-first-multi-chain-zero-knowledge-proofs-for-verified-cd9b9406751e?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Scaling PolygonID</a> by making their Zero-Knowledge Proofs multi-chain  Launching <a href="https://rarimo.medium.com/why-storing-your-identity-in-your-metamask-wallet-is-such-a-big-deal-5e7428f14aaf?ref=blog.ceramic.network">RariMe</a>, a MetaMask Snap&nbsp;  RariMe allows users to store identity credentials inside their MetaMask&nbsp;  It also allows them to generate Zero-Knowledge Proofs for all of their credentials  Users are able to store both their Web3 assets and identities in the same location     Why RariMe Built With Ceramic <p>Multiple other solutions were considered including IPFS, FileCoin, and Arweave. In the end, Ceramic was selected because it is free for users and comes with a convenient high-level API provided by Compose DB.</p><p>RariMe snap uses ComposeDB as the primary encrypted storage of Verifiable Credentials. The keys for authorization and encryption are tied to the MetaMask mnemonic phrase. The safe <a href="https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/reference/rpc-api/?ref=blog.ceramic.network#snap_getentropy">getEntropy</a> method is used to derive them deterministically without compromising the security of crypto accounts. It is enough for the user to have the MetaMask mnemonic to retrieve and decrypt all her RariMe credentials.</p><p></p><p>This solution has the following advantages:</p>  Data is instantly synced between all devices that use the same MetaMask mnemonic  There is no need for manual backups because the data in Compose DB is durable  Straightforward UX, no extra steps or passwords required  Local storage capacity does not limit the maximum number of credentials. ComposeDB is scalable enough to handle millions of credentials   Try it Out <p>Test out RariMe by downloading it and by generating a Rarimo Proof-of-Humanity credential, which you can store inside your RariMe and use to gain access to gated human-only spaces, including a VIP Rarimo discord channel.&nbsp;</p><p>Download RariMe here: <a href="https://rarime.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">https://rarime.com/</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Prove your humanity here: <a href="https://robotornot.rarimo.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">https://robotornot.rarimo.com/</a></p>

<p>Hello and welcome to the first edition of CeramicWorld, a monthly roundup of everything happening across the Ceramic ecosystem. </p>  Ceramic Community Signup! <p>Community is really important to us at Ceramic! We'd like to know more about you and what you're working on, so we can create better technology and experiences. </p><p>Click the link below to learn more about the tech, meet the team, become an official Ceramic community member, explore integrations and partnerships, or share your project.</p> <a href="https://noteforms.com/forms/ecosystem-projects-i8uqzp?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Take me there!</a>   Play with ComposeDB’s no-code sandbox <p>ComposeDB Sandbox is an awesome no-hassle way to try ComposeDB's GraphQL API without needing to install anything. While playing in the sandbox, you'll also notice that ComposeDB now supports query filtering and ordering, which allows developers to filter and/or order the results of their data queries.</p> <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/sandbox?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Play with ComposeDB Sandbox</a>   Watch Optimism, Base, MetaMask, Karma3 discuss decentralized reputation @ RepConnect Istanbul <p>Watch MetaMask, Optimism, Base, and Karma3 share learnings from building industry-leading reputation products, protocols, and systems.

Over the last month, we’ve seen the <code>PriceFeed</code> dataset emerge on Ceramic mainnet, rapidly growing from obscurity to more than 70K entries at time of writing. As an example, <a href="https://s3.xyz/streams/stream/kjzl6kcym7w8y51l4on6dt2n85r30g5qtdkqksaahz2zze84vee9ap4yyctecw0?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">this document</a> stores a “snapshot” of the price of Solana ($SOL) at a given moment, but there are also others for Ethereum ($ETH) and Bitcoin ($BTC).</p><p><code>PriceFeed</code> is also notable in that it’s the first dataset on mainnet authored by a “data oracle,” responsible for bridging the gap between data that exists elsewhere and Ceramic. Just as oracles play an important role in blockchain networks, we expect data oracles to play a huge role in generating verifiable datasets in Ceramic.</p><p>Since the <code>PriceFeed</code> dataset exists on Ceramic mainnet and continues to grow everyday, you can now query, compose, and remix this data in your applications.</p> <a href="https://cerscan.com/mainnet/stream/kjzl6hvfrbw6c60ji9txuq3da0qic30tcioy25xah9g449zf40u3d0jmi8of0r7?ref=blog.ceramic.network">See PriceFeed dataset on Cerscan</a>   Recon, scalability protocol, enters final testing <p>Core devs are finalizing development on <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/cip-124-recon-tip-synchronization-protocol/1144?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Recon</a>, a set reconciliation protocol for syncing data between Ceramic nodes.

<p>In 2024, companies will see more adoption of passkeys and other MFA methods to access business assets. Passkey adoption, along with biometrics, hardware tokens, and public-key cryptography, will replace the use of passwords. These security technologies will also help mitigate phishing and social engineering, which target credential theft. One way to reduce risk and boost security patches is the usage of proximity badges, physical tokens, or USB devices (FIDO2-compliant keys).</p>

<p>Gemini is a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss in 2014. Gemini enables its users to transact both via a website as well as mobile apps to buy, sell and store cryptocurrency assets.</p>



<p>The Challenge/ Use Case</p>



<p>As a financial services vendor in a space that is highly targeted by criminals, the need for strong authentication is paramount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gemini’s security efforts are led by Chief Security Officer Dave Damato who is no stranger to the security industry and previously worked at security incident response firm Mandiant.</p>



<p>“So much of my career has been really focused on preventing and responding to incidents and strong two factor authentication is at the core preventing most of those attacks,” Damato said (in a session at the Authenticate Financial Services Summit). “It’s also why I’m so very enthusiastic about FIDO.”</p>



<p>How Gemini Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users</p>



<p>Gemini wanted to provide its users with the strongest level of security authentication to help minimize risk.</p>



<p>While using an SMS based two factor approach can be better than just a username and password, given the high value of a Gemini account, attackers might well go through the steps necessary to bypass SMS two factor. Beginning in 2019, Gemini began offering its customers the highest level of security possible and it did this by starting to support the FIDO2 authentication standard.</p>



<p>“FIDO2 is designed to overcome challenges and dramatically increase the cost for an attacker,” Damato said. “There’s no password that can be shared by our customers and that’s why FIDO2 is phishing resistant.”</p>



<p>Benefits</p>



<p>For Gemini, the use of FIDO2 provides a series of tangible risk mitigation benefits that helps to reduce the attack surface. Instead of needing to rely on a One-Time Password (OTP), SMS or backup codes, Gemini users can benefit from a more user-friendly FIDO2 powered experience.</p>



<p>Among the most common types of attack is credential stuffing, where an attacker makes use of passwords lost or stolen from one site, to re-use or ‘stuff’ into another. With FIDO, that risk is minimized for Gemini. Since FIDO strong authentication is based on cryptography and not a shared secret, even if a user reuses a password, the deployment of FIDO will minimize the risk significantly.</p>



<p>“The benefit to me as a company is that I don’t actually have to store, manage credentials or worry about other breaches, where credentials have been stolen,” Damato said.</p>
