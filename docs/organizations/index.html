 Celebrating 50 Years of the GS1&nbsp;Barcode <p>June 26 marked the 50th anniversary of the GS1 barcode, commemorating the first-ever product scan at a cash registry checkout. Over the decades, billions of products worldwide have been equipped with barcodes, streamlining and standardizing supply chain processes and adhering to GS1 standards.</p><p>As consumer demand for product information grew, regulatory requirements became stricter, and supply chain optimization pressures increased, the need for an updated barcode became evident. Enter the GS1 Digital Link, the barcode upgrade designed to provide dynamic access to comprehensive product information. Now, with <a href="https://www.gs1.org/resources/articles/leading-companies-retail-and-consumer-goods-industries-support-transition-qr-codes-gs1">leading retail and consumer goods companies actively supporting the transition to Digital Link QR codes</a>, the stage is set for the traditional barcode to retire gracefully.</p> Setting a Strong Foundation for Digital Link with OriginTrail <p>For products and brands to fully benefit from the GS1 Digital Link transition, a robust, connected, and verifiable data foundation is crucial. Product data is often split across various supply chain partners, including manufacturers, logistics providers, wholesalers, retailers, and others. To connect billions of products to the internet in a meaningful way that provides genuine insights and business value, this scattered product data needs to be interconnected.</p><p>Scanning a Digital Link on a product and seeing the manufacturer’s information, such as production date, description, ingredients, and brand details is good. Scanning the same code and accessing comprehensive information about the product’s journey through the supply chain — including whether the ingredients were ecologically produced, if the product was stored at proper temperatures during transport, and how long it was in the supply chain — is much better. This is the true potential of the Digital&nbsp;Link.</p><p>Beyond consumer engagement, consider a business operating a rail or plane network being able to access details on a component’s manufacture, testing, and maintenance by scanning a Digital Link code. That would have surely been invaluable with the recent Boeing aircraft incidents.</p><p>This is where the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and GS1 Digital Link make a match in heaven. The DKG provides a verifiable and interconnected knowledge base encompassing product data, supply chain events, certifications, locations, and more — across organizations and data sources. With the new DKG V8, the OriginTrail introduces the scalability needed to bring billions of products equipped with Digital Link into a world of standards-based, connected, and verifiable data. And the new DKG Edge Node concept empowers organizations and business networks to exchange product and other supply chain data with just a few clicks while maintaining data privacy, verifiability, and connectivity.</p>Supply chain data from multiple sources connected in a verifiable Decentralized Knowledge Graph.<p>As a longstanding partner of GS1, OriginTrail DKG is designed to natively support GS1 standards, including EPCIS, Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), Global Data Model (GDM), and Digital Link. This integration means that consumers, regulators, brands, and other stakeholders can access richer, more comprehensive, and trusted product data. The challenge now is to make this user experience seamless and simple, and there’s a tech perfect for the job — Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p> OriginTrail, Digital Link, and AI: A Consumer Engagement Power&nbsp;Throuple <p>Incorporating AI into the mix creates an incredibly powerful technology trio, enabling brands to enhance consumer engagement, based on connected and verifiable data spanning organizations, in unprecedented ways. And with the DKG Edge Node, AI capabilities come natively. Brands can thus offer personalized and tailored experiences by allowing customers to scan a product with a Digital Link QR code and ask anything — from brand details to product origins, sustainability, and environmental impact, all based on verifiable data from OriginTrail DKG.</p><p>This combination not only benefits consumers but also provides brands with valuable insights into customer preferences, allowing them to refine their business strategies. As billions of products transition from barcodes to Digital Link, the potential of this technology trio becomes evident. In fact, AI-powered product discovery, based on OriginTrail and Digital Link, is no longer a future concept but a current&nbsp;reality:</p><p>Some additional examples to check&nbsp;out:</p>  <a href="https://www.perutnina.com/int/en/premium-quality/check-the-origin/">Check the origin&nbsp;» Perutnina Ptuj</a>  <a href="https://x.com/origin_trail/status/1759626249813520823">Church of Oak Whiskey Distillery</a>  <p>Simultaneously, organizations can leverage AI to better understand and enhance their supply chains, ensuring they receive accurate and verifiable responses rooted in data from across their business network. By simply scanning a Digital Link QR code on a product, pallet, or shipping container, users are immediately empowered to ask questions and get verifiable answers — from basic queries like “Where was this product manufactured?” to more complex ones such as “Was the temperature in this shipping container in line with expectations?” and “Give me a list of all train wagons that are likely to experience issues with their wheels in the next month.” Exciting stuff&nbsp;indeed.</p> Where do we go from&nbsp;here? <p>As billions of products transition from traditional barcodes to Digital Link QR codes, establishing a robust foundation of connected and verifiable data becomes paramount. OriginTrail is at the forefront of this transformation, with the new DKG V8 offering the scalability and simplicity necessary to realize its full potential. When combined with AI, this technology trio unlocks immense opportunities for brands to engage with their customers in a trusted and meaningful way.</p><p>But consumer engagement is just one area set to benefit significantly from this transition. Regulatory bodies will gain streamlined access to verifiable product data, and supply chain management will become more proactive and efficient. The coming months and years promise exciting advancements and opportunities, making this a pivotal moment in the evolution of product information and consumer engagement.</p><p>We are excited to see OriginTrail at the epicenter of it all, as we — Trace Labs, the core developers of OriginTrai — along with our ecosystem partners get ready to unveil the Digital Link support via the new DKG V8 at the GS1 Industry &amp; Standards Event. Over 1,000 business leaders from 80+ countries will come together virtually to solve today’s greatest business challenges through the development and adoption of the GS1 global standard.</p><p>For the GS1 Industry &amp; Standards Event, register at: <a href="https://standards-event.gs1.org/">https://standards-event.gs1.org/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/from-barcodes-to-digital-links-supercharging-trillions-of-products-for-the-next-50-years-f46f4653e589">From Barcodes to Digital Links: Supercharging Trillions of Products for the Next 50 Years</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In the past months we have replaced the algorithm at the heart of the ceramic database. This post explains why we made the change from Multicast to pairwise synchronization but first let review the design motivations of Ceramic.</p><p>“Information also wants to be expensive. Information Wants To Be Free. ...That tension will not go away.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free?ref=blog.ceramic.network#cite_note-3">Stewart Brand</a>. There is tension since data storage is a competitive market but data retrieval can only be done by the service that has your data. At 3Box Labs, we want to catalyze a data ecosystem by making community driven data distribution not only possible but available out of the box. <a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> is a decentralized storage solution for apps that are dealing with multi-party data and that is more scalable, faster and cheaper than the blockchain. </p> Data vendor lock-in <p>Many organizations and individuals have data that they want to publish and Ceramic lets them do so without instant data vendor lock in for storing their own data. In the Web2 era, data often becomes ensnared within exclusive services, restricting its accessibility and durability. Access to this data requires obtaining permission from the service provider. Numerous platforms have vanished over the years, resulting in significant data loss like GeoCities, Friendster and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkut?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Orkut</a>. Even within still existing companies like Google, numerous lost data products are documented. See <a href="http://killedbygoogle.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">killed by google</a>. </p><p>We can break free from this risk by creating data-centric applications that multihome the data. Ceramic is the way to have many distinct data controllers publishing into shared tables in a trustless environment. Each reader can know who published what content and when they did without relying on trusting the storage service to keep accurate audit logs. Since each event is a JSON Document, signed by a controller, timestamped by ethereum, and in a documented schema it can be preserved by any interested party, with or without permission from the storage vendor. </p>Multihome the data<p>In Ceramic we separate the roles of data controllers from the data servers. By allowing data to live on any preferred server the data is durable as long as any server is interested in preserving the data. This allows data to outlive a particular data server, paired with the durability of data living in multiple places and the speed/reliability of operating on local data.</p> Document the schema <p>Throughout the history of the internet, we have witnessed numerous data services going away and taking the users data with them. While multihoming helps preserve data, it's useless without the ability to interpret it.</p><p>Ceramic preserves the data formats in two ways. The first is that the data lives in JSON Documents. This format allows us to reverse engineer and examine the data.&nbsp; The second is that the model schema gets published. The model schema contains both json-schema and human language description that the original developer can use to give machine and human context to the data. This enables both the preservation of the data and schema so the data can be understood and new apps can be made to interact with the preserved data.</p> <code>{

}</code> <p>Example schema document</p> Information retrieval&nbsp; <p>The key to multihome data is being able to retrieve the data from a server that has it.</p><p>How do we move the data from the servers that have the data to the servers that are interested in storing it? When we first made Ceramic we used two multicast methods: The first was to do a gratuitous announcement of new data. Send the data to EVERY node in the network so that they can store it if they are interested in it. Second, if a node did not know about a stream then when requested by a user it would multicast a request to the whole network and take the latest version to come back as a response.</p><p>This worked but had several drawbacks. The first is that requests for streams that a node did not know used WAN traffic and would have unpredictable latencies. This meant that all applications needed to design for slow unpredictable retrieval times. The second drawback was that a node had no way to retrieve a complete set of the streams that matched their interests. They could only listen to the multicast channel and fetch any stream they happened to hear about. Any stream that they missed either because it happened before the node was online or during down time could be missed forever. Third, there is a performance cost to sending requests to nodes that have no mutual interest with your node. A node that did 100 events a year could not scale down since it would need to keep up with filtering announcements from nodes doing 100 events a second. If we wanted to support both very large and very small data centric applications we needed a new strategy. We even saw cases where a slow node could not keep up on the multicast channel harming the performance of larger more powerful nodes.</p><p>To solve these problems of performance, completeness, and scalability we switched to a pairwise synchronization model. Each node advertises the ranges of streams that the node is interested in. Each node only synchronizes the streams that are of mutual interest and the nodes synchronize pair wise.</p> Scalability <p>Since the nodes synchronize pairwise, no slow node can harm the ability of two healthy nodes to complete a synchronization. If two nodes have no intersection in their interests then the conversation is done. A range of streams that has 100s of events per second that your node is not interested in will not create work for your node. A node only needs to scale to the speed of events in the ranges it is interested in and the scale of any model you are not interested in costs you nothing. This solved our scale up / scale down objective.</p> Completeness <p>If the two nodes do have an intersection of their interests they will continue the synchronization until both nodes have ALL the events that the other node had when the synchronization began. There is no longer a need for high availability to be online either when the stream’s event was originally published or when some node queried for that stream. If the event is stored by either of the nodes both nodes will have it at the end of the pairwise synchronization. Once a node has pairwise synchronized with each of the nodes that are advertising an interest range that node has all of the events in that range as of the time of the synchronization. This solves the completeness objective.</p><p>More interestingly, the local completeness means that we can build local indexes over the events and do more complex queries over the events in the ranges nodes are interested in entirely locally.</p> Performance <p>&nbsp;Lastly, since we have a complete set of events for our interests we can serve queries about the events from the local node with no need for WAN traffic. This solves the performance objective for predictable fetch latencies.</p> Pairwise Synchronization in Logarithmic rounds <p>In the multicast model ceramic sends messages to all other ceramic nodes. One of the most notable differences with synchronization is that nodes do pairwise synchronization one peer at a time. The two peers will each send the other their interests. Both nodes filter the events that they have to find the set of events of mutual interest between the two nodes. Once this intersection is found we synchronize the set with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13567?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Range-Based Set Reconciliation</a> protocol we call Recon.</p><p>We can report progress in a Recon synchronization by reporting the percentage of events in the in sync vs syncing ranges. Alternatively we could render a bar like in the diagram showing which ranges are in which states.</p><p>This is a divide and conquer protocol. We start with the full intersection as a single range. We pull a range off the work list and send the (hash, count) of all events in the range to the other side. They compare their own (hash, count) and respond accordingly.</p>

<p>We have</p><p>They have</p><p>Acton</p><p>hash_A</p><p>hash_A</p><p>Done.<br>`in sync`</p><p>0</p><p>hash_A</p><p>Send a request for the events.<br>`Don’t have`</p><p>hash_A</p><p>0</p><p>Send the events.<br>`in sync`</p><p>hash_A</p><p>hash_B</p><p>Split the range<br>Push sub-ranges from split on the work list.<br>Each range `syncing`</p>

<p>The range splits are handled differently on the Initiator then the Responder. The Initiator maintains the work list and pushes all of the subranges onto the work list. The Responder just sends a message back with multiple ranges and hashes for each range. This keeps the synchronization state on the Initiator and reduces the burden on the Responder to a stateless call and response. This fits Recon into the http client server request response paradigm.</p> Exponential distribution <p>Now that we have replaced a multicast message to all nodes in the network with pairwise sync it is reasonable to ask if we have broken the exponential distribution we got from multicast trees.</p><p>How fast can data spread through the network? Now that we have replaced the multicast channel with pairwise connections, how do we match the exponential distribution of the multicast channel?&nbsp;</p><p>We get this property since each node cycles through connecting to all other nodes that advertise overlapping interests. When the node that originally received the event from a client there is 1 copy on the network. After the first sync there are 2. Then both of the nodes sync to new nodes giving 4. This will grow exponentially until almost all interested nodes have the data. At that point the odds that any node with the event calls a node without it is small but the odds that the node without the event calls a node with it is large. By using synchronization we get the benefits of both push and pull gossip protocols. Push which is fast when the knowledge of the event is rare and pull which is fast when knowledge of the event is common. </p> Summary <p>By using Set reconciliation to perform pairwise synchronization of node’s overlapping interests we are able to have performance, completeness, and scalability. The predictable performance of querying local data on your node. The completeness of synchronizing all of the events of interest preemptively. The scalability of not synchronizing the events that lay outside of the interests of a node. Pairwise synchronization protects the network from slow nodes from slowing down the rest of the network. It is now possible to scale up or down without performance and completeness problems. This enables developers to build data intensive applications without the data vendor lock-in from either the storage providing service or the application that originally read the schema.</p>

<p>Corporate overview:</p>



<p>Wedding Park Co., Ltd. was founded in 2004 with the management philosophy of “Making marriage happier.” Celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2024, it started as a wedding review information site and has since expanded its operations. Utilizing a wealth of information, it operates several wedding-specialized media, including the wedding preparation review site <a href="https://www.weddingpark.net/">Wedding Park</a>. In addition, it runs various businesses in the realm of weddings combined with digital technology, such as internet advertising agency services, digital transformation (DX) support, and educational ventures.</p>



<p>Background and challenges leading to deployment</p>



<p>Wedding Park was faced with the challenges of strengthening the security of multiple cloud services that were being used for internal operations and the complexity of password management. As a way to address these issues, the company introduced an ID management service and consolidated them into a cloud service entrance with a single sign-on function.</p>



<p>The impetus for deploying FIDO authentication came from the fact that Salesforce, which is used for authentication for customer management, order and supply systems, and time and attendance management, announced that multi-factor authentication (MFA) was mandatory. However, if MFA is applied only to Salesforce and other cloud services continue to operate with password authentication, not only will the usability of users deteriorate, but the work of the IT management department will also become more complicated. In addition, due to the vulnerability of password-only authentication, the company decided to apply MFA to all cloud services, including Salesforce, in accordance with its policy to promote zero-trust security in February 2020.</p>



<p>Selection and verification of an authenticator</p>



<p>As an authentication method for MFA, the company considered one-time password authentication (OTP) and biometric authentication using smartphone applications, but ultimately decided to deploy passwordless authentication using FIDO for its unique ability to improve both security and user convenience.</p>



<p>In order to realize passwordless authentication using FIDO, a terminal equipped with a FIDO-compatible biometric authentication device is required. The majority of devices currently on the market support FIDO authentication, and with the exception of a few employees, the adoption of FIDO has been supported by the fact that all in-house devices are already equipped with Windows Hello and Touch ID. For some employees who use the devices not equipped with biometric features, a separate external authenticator has been installed.</p>



<p>A step-by-step changeover for each department</p>



<p>After examining the authenticators, the policy to deploy passwordless authentication company-wide in January 2022 was officially launched. The transition took place from February to March of the same year, and the smooth implementation in a short period of one month was made possible by the department-by-department implementation and the generous support provided by the IT management department. For this implementation, the company requested the support of CloudGate UNO, an identity management platform by International System Research Corporation (ISR) that the company has been using since 2012, because it supports passwordless authentication using FIDO2 and biometric authentication using a smartphone APP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The introduction of the system within the company began with the development department and gradually progressed to departments with a larger number of employees. First, at regular meetings for each department, the company communicated the purpose of why the system was being introduced and the benefits of “the deployment of the system will make daily authentication more convenient,” and gained the understanding across the company. The introduction of the system on a departmental basis had the advantage of not only limiting the number of people the IT management department had to deal with at one time, but also allowing the accumulation of QA as test cases and the smooth maintenance of manuals, since the system was introduced starting with the development department, which had high IT skills.</p>



<p>As a result of close follow-up by the IT management department, which not only prepared materials, but also checked the progress status on the administrator website as needed, and individually approached employees who had not yet registered their certifiers, the company was able to implement the system company-wide within the targeted time frame.</p>



<p>Effects of introduction</p>



<p></p>



<p>The number of login errors due to mistyping of passwords, which used to occur about 200 times a month, has been reduced to zero since the deployment of FIDO authentication. Many employees commented that the system has become very convenient, eliminating authentication failures due to forgotten passwords or typing errors. In addition, the number of periodic password reset requests has decreased, resulting in a reduction in man-hours for the administrator.</p>



<p>The passwordless authentication is smooth, and the authentication status retention period was shortened to further enhance security, but the system has continued to operate without problems since then.</p>



<p>Wedding Park’s future vision is to link all cloud services used within the company to “CloudGate UNO” and centrally manage them, including authentication, with “CloudGate UNO.</p>



<p>Akira Nishi, General Manager of the Corporate IT Office, who spoke with us about this case study, made the following comments.</p>



<p>“For those who are considering the deploying of a new authentication method, there is inevitably a concern that a change in authentication method will cause a large-scale login failure. In our case, in the early stages of the project, we held explanatory meetings for each department and repeatedly brushed up on explanatory materials and procedures, which was effective in minimizing confusion and anxiety within the company.</p>



<p>“After the switchover, we continued to check on the progress of the implementation and followed up with each department individually, but once the use of passkey (device-bound passkey) became standardized within the company, we felt that the scope of use, including various security measures, was expanding dramatically.”</p>

<p>The Ceramic protocol has undergone a series of updates over the past few months, all focused on improving performance and scalability, enabling developers to build applications that work better and faster. Today, the core Ceramic team is excited to share these updates with the community by announcing the release of <code>ceramic-one</code>.</p> About the release <p>The new release of Ceramic includes a data synchronization protocol called <a href="https://cips.ceramic.network/CIPs/cip-124?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Recon</a>, implemented in Rust. This new implementation of the Ceramic protocol enables data sharing between nodes and allows developers to run multiple nodes that stay in sync and are load balanced. All this facilitates highly available Ceramic deployments and reliable data synchronization.</p><p>To utilize the Recon protocol for their applications, developers are provided with a binary called <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic?ref=blog.ceramic.network"><code>ceramic-one</code></a>.</p><p>This new implementation of the Ceramic protocol offers significant performance and stability improvements. Additionally, this release marks a significant shift in making the Ceramic architecture more robust, allowing the team to iterate on and build new protocols in the future.</p> The new Recon protocol <p>Recon is a new data synchronization protocol used for synchronizing stream events in the Ceramic network, implemented on top of libp2p. Stream sets bundle multiple streams together, allowing nodes with a common interest in certain streams to synchronize efficiently.</p><p>Before Recon, Ceramic nodes broadcasted updates to streams to every node in the network using a simple libp2p pubsub topic. Due to the single channel, nodes would receive stream event announcements they were not interested in, imposing a significant overhead on every node. Additionally, the network's throughput was limited by bandwidth, which led to either prioritizing high-bandwidth nodes or greatly limiting the network throughput to support low-bandwidth nodes.</p><p>Recon provides low to no overhead for nodes with no overlap in interest, while retaining a high probability of receiving the latest events from a stream shortly after any node has the events, without any need for remote connections at query time. By shifting updates from the pubsub channel to a stream set, interested nodes can synchronize without burdening uninterested ones. Stream sets also enable sharding across multiple nodes, allowing synchronization of only sub-ranges, which distributes the storage, indexing, and retrieval workload.</p><p>Additionally, nodes need to discover peers with similar interests for synchronization. Recon achieves this through nodes gossiping their interests and maintaining a list of peers' interests, ensuring synchronization with minimal bandwidth. Nodes also avoid sending event announcements to uninterested peers.</p> Performance and robustness improvements <p>This release, along with the recent Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) updates, marks significant scalability improvements. Currently, Ceramic provides a throughput of 250 TPS (transactions per second), more than double the previous throughput of up to 100 TPS before the Recon implementation. This increase in throughput is especially important for applications that handle large amounts of user data and require fast transaction times.</p><p>These numbers were measured between two nodes that share the same interest. It’s worth noting that nodes without overlapping interests do not affect each other's throughput. This means that, in theory, the throughput of a ceramic-one node scales horizontally. However, there is still one component that puts an upper limit on this: the CAS, which is operated by 3Box Labs. This service is currently a centralized bottleneck in the protocol, which is why the team’s next goal is <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ceramicstudio/projects/2/views/1?pane=issue&amp;itemId=68981845&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Self-Anchoring</a>, allowing any Ceramic-One node to operate completely independently.</p><p>This release of Ceramic is also a significant step towards making the Ceramic architecture more robust, enabling the team to iterate on it and build new protocol implementations more easily and quickly.</p> Getting started with ceramic-one <p>All new Ceramic developers are recommended to use the <code>ceramic-one</code> to start building on Ceramic. Check out <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/set-up-your-environment?ref=blog.ceramic.network">the setup guides</a> on the Ceramic documentation to get started.</p><p>Developers, who have been building on Ceramic for a while, are encouraged to migrate their applications to the <code>ceramic-one</code>-based implementation. Check out <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network#migration">this migration guide</a> to follow the migration steps.</p> Share you feedback with us! <p>We would like to get your feedback on building on Ceramic. Do you have any suggestions or ideas of how the core Ceramic team can improve the implementation of Ceramic? Do you have questions or troubles using the new release or migrating your existing application? Share your thoughts and ideas with us by posting on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Community Forum</a>.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs was founded in 2014 to give people control and freedom over their personal and private information. Based in California, Utah and Australia, the company has deep expertise in security, identity management, authentication and authorization, cloud, privacy, and cryptography, and equips businesses with cutting-edge privacy and cybersecurity solutions that seamlessly integrate with existing offerings and systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Anonyome Labs Chief Architect and DIF Steering Committee member, Steve McCown, talked to us about how the company is using Decentralized Identity to drive interoperability and usability of their products, his involvement in DIF, and decentralized identity standards work.&nbsp;</p><p>What does Anonyome offer, and who are your customers?&nbsp;</p><p>We started 10 years ago, when we noticed that people’s personal and private information was being collected and used without their permission. There were certain contact points that industry was using to triangulate people’s behavior, such as phone numbers and email addresses. So we developed an app called MySudo that gives users the ability to create contact sets and associated pseudonymous profiles called ‘Sudos’, consisting of an email address, phone number and a one-time or reusable credit card number.&nbsp;</p><p>People already had separate home and work contact details, so we took it further. With MySudo, you can create Sudos for your online purchases, for hobbies, for travel, and so on. Our mission was to create separate IDs, so when a hacker steals data from websites, or data brokers buy and sell your online activity data, they can’t correlate your home activities with your work activities, or your social activities with products you purchase. This increases your privacy by disrupting how your data can be correlated.&nbsp;</p><p>Individuals use MySudo to privately communicate back and forth, share files, and so on — for all their usual digital activities. We also have an Enterprise-grade platform with all the same capabilities, which we license to organizations who incorporate these privacy-enhancing services into their own offerings. There are some very notable companies you would have heard of that are providing a white label version of our privacy-enhancing technologies to their customers. We’ve also been working with national governments to help preserve their citizens’ and commercial entities’ private data.&nbsp;</p><p>What got Anonyome interested in Decentralized Identity?&nbsp;</p><p>Anonyome is focused on creating strong privacy-enhancing and secure identity tools for everyday users.&nbsp; The MySudo product is a great example of how internet users can control their privacy during everyday activities, such as email, texting, calling, and purchasing.&nbsp; The critical privacy and security requirements for these elements are greatly enhanced with decentralized identity elements and protocols.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a previous job, I worked for the US Department of Energy as a cybersecurity exploit researcher, so that’s part of my mindset. How would someone take advantage of existing identity paradigms? It’s not just about all the good that everyone is trying to accomplish, it’s also about how an adversary might leverage identity technologies for illicit purposes. That concern is what led me to engage with Decentralized Identity and keeping the crypto keys, passwords, tokens, etc. within your own digital wallet. Because if you control the keys, you can better control access to your data assets.&nbsp;</p><p>The other thing that got Anonyome on this track is that strong crypto environments like Signal were emerging as closed ecosystems. If someone wants to use Signal, they also need to convince others to adopt it, too.&nbsp; For a lot of users, that can be really hard. Decentralized Identity provides a way to create an open encryption environment and keep the strong cryptography while also bridging across ecosystems. </p><p>While we may have competitors in parallel spaces, it benefits everyone if we can increase secure communication between applications that users enjoy using — this secure cross talk between applications becomes a rising tide that floats all boats … customers, companies, everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Interoperable security is the next evolution that extends beyond closed secure ecosystems, and we’re working to be interoperable with lots of other decentralized identity providers and users. This is why Anonyome has tasked me to work in the standards orgs. If we can collectively solve security and privacy issues at the identity standards level, then we will have a way to realize our goals for secure and private interoperability between applications … and people.&nbsp;</p><p>What is driving Decentralized Identity uptake, in your view?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s tremendous interest in Decentralized Identity. I credit a lot of this to GDPR. The EU has assigned significant liability and penalties for data breaches. Faced with these very large fines, companies are trying to figure out what they need to do to protect users' privacy, since this now affects their bottom lines. While some are doing the bare minimum, others are doing a lot more. There’s also a lot happening in Europe with the Digital Identity Wallet. We want to be interoperable with these standards and the services that implement them.&nbsp; So we've been reviewing the EU’s Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) to find out what identity, credentials, proof types and so on we need to work with.&nbsp;</p><p>Privacy at the legislative level is no longer just an EU thing. For example, there are new laws in Utah (US) that mandate that state government organizations can only collect the data they actually need, keep it only as long as authorized and then destroy it unless retention regulations require that they need to retain it. I serve on the Utah Privacy Commission and we’re very strong proponents of this. We will receive presentations from state agencies and give our feedback on what enhances privacy and what needs additional work. There is a real appetite among government officials for better privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also growing awareness of the potential problems associated with working in the cloud. For example, if you store your data in the cloud, it may be encrypted, but where do the keys go? If you don’t control access to the data access keys (or a provider does this as part of their service), then your information may be insecure without you really knowing it. Recently, there have been some very large data breaches, which seem like about once a month. In response, people are receiving emails saying “your data has been stolen, so here’s 3 to 6 months of free credit monitoring”. This almost seems on the level of “security theater” where companies are doing something, but it’s not very useful and doesn’t solve the problem.</p><p>Decentralized Identity can augment many existing services.&nbsp; For example, DI capabilities can be used to encrypt my files before they are sent to a cloud storage provider.&nbsp; The cloud storage provider can then work their storage, retrieval, and replication magic without having access to the unencrypted files. As long as I control the encryption keys, my data can only be decrypted by me.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s just what’s possible with file storage. Decentralized Identity is also delivering a wide range of interoperable privacy-enhancing capabilities for communications systems, identity control, access management, digital credentials, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s what I see happening with DI. If implemented as designed, we’re going to put privacy and security control in the users’ hands. Then we can continue to enjoy many wonderful cloud services while we will be able to control access to our own data.&nbsp;</p><p>What is the value of open standards for Anonyome and your customers?&nbsp;</p><p>We’re huge fans of open standards. We try not to build systems that are proprietary from an interoperability perspective. We strive to ensure that all of our interoperability points are based on industry standards, so that we can communicate with other platforms and they can easily communicate with ours.&nbsp; Embracing DI standards means if a user wants to use a particular platform, then they don’t have to convince others to use it before it's useful.</p><p>As a quick analogy, we’re aiming for the interoperability of email combined with the strong security and authentication of a secure communications application. Pick up any old email app and it will work with most any other, but the security isn’t there. If you work for a large enterprise, they may have put something like S/MIME in place, but when you or I get a regular gmail account, that’s not something we typically add. This is primarily because it’s too hard for users to manage the certificates and so forth. Today, this means that emails are typically transmitted in the clear and not end-to-end encrypted. DI facilitates privacy-enhancing and more secure interactions, which is a key reason why we’re working with these technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>As someone who is involved with DIF, W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium) and the Trust over IP Foundation, what do you see as their respective roles, and the differences between them?&nbsp;</p><p>We’re super excited about each of these organizations.&nbsp; W3C has spent a great deal of time and effort to create DI’s main building blocks, namely, DIDs and Verifiable Credentials.&nbsp; W3C is continuing to actively refine and extend these elements in order to facilitate many enhanced DI capabilities.</p><p>Trust over IP has created an excellent DI paradigm for illustrating how all of the DI components connect and interact.&nbsp; These layers depict how DIDs are anchored in a Verifiable Data Registry (such as a decentralized ledger), how DID-based communication takes place, how Verifiable Credentials fit into the ecosystem, and finally how a top layer governance model shows all participants in a system what the systems rules are.</p><p>What brought me to DIF was getting involved in DIDComm (Decentralized Identifier Communications).&nbsp; I see this as one of the main attractions in DI.&nbsp; As I had been participating for a while, I volunteered to become a co-chair with Sam Curren.&nbsp; This gave me new insights into the community standards-building processes and in particular key details of the DIDComm protocol.&nbsp; Later, Sam nominated me as a candidate during the Steering Committee elections and I am honored to have been elected to the SC.</p><p>I see DIF as one of the leading development organizations where implementation happens. While other organizations focus primarily on creating a range of standards and documents, which is vital, DIF typically focuses on producing a variety of working software that is based on industry standards such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).&nbsp; This makes DIF a key provider in the larger symbiotic DI industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of the various standards organizations are distinct and have different missions. DIF fills a critical void that traditional standards organizations don’t typically emphasize. The term incubator is a little outdated, but that’s part of the role that DIF performs. Everything in DI has started with a few people getting together and having a conversation about how to design, build, or enhance some particular technology element. This leads to standards being created.&nbsp; At some point, usable code libraries are created using the standard base elements and then those are combined into larger protocols, services, environments, and so on.&nbsp; </p><p>There’s a whole lot that needs to happen in this process, and a lot of that work happens at DIF.&nbsp; </p><p>If your goal is implementation right now, that’s where DIF excels. It’s where companies come to pick up architectural designs and reusable code libraries they can use in their products today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US and global respondents perceive Donald Trump as the Most ‘Crypto-Aware’ and ‘Crypto-Ready’ Presidential Candidate, outpacing Joe Biden and Robert F. Kennedy</p>
<p>Singapore: July 16th, 2024 – Here at Elastos, the premier SmartWeb ecosystem, we are excited to reveal the latest findings from our BIT Index (Bitcoin, Innovation &amp; Trust). This report underscores that Donald J. Trump is perceived as the leading figure among US tech-savvy consumers for his understanding and readiness to embrace Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Key Findings:</p>
 
 38% of respondents anticipate Bitcoin becoming mainstream within four years. 
 80% foresee Bitcoin evolving into a ‘default’ global currency. 
 Bitcoin adoption is progressing more rapidly in BRICS and Global South Nations compared to Western Nations. 
 
<p>Who is the Bitcoin President?</p>
<p>In the US, 50% of tech-savvy consumers recognize Donald Trump as the most ‘crypto-aware’ presidential candidate, demonstrating a profound understanding of Bitcoin’s intricacies and advantages, compared to Joe Biden (32%) and Robert F. Kennedy (19%).</p>
<p>Globally, the perception remains consistent:</p>
 
 Donald Trump: 51% 
 Joe Biden: 31% 
 Robert F. Kennedy: 19% 
 
<p>Demographic insights reveal that younger consumers (18-24) are slightly less inclined to view Trump as ‘crypto-aware’ (45%), compared to 25-34 year-olds (54%) and 35-44 year-olds (54%). Biden (34%) and Kennedy (21%) see a minor increase among the 18-24 demographic.</p>
<p>Trump is also viewed as the most ‘crypto-ready’ candidate in the US:</p>
 
 Donald Trump: 49% 
 Joe Biden: 30% 
 Robert F. Kennedy: 21% 
 
<p>Globally, the figures are:</p>
 
 Donald Trump: 51% 
 Joe Biden: 29% 
 Robert F. Kennedy: 20% 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, younger demographics (18-24) show less support for Trump as ‘crypto-ready’ (47%) compared to 25-34 year-olds (51%) and 35-44 year-olds (54%). Kennedy receives a slight uplift from 18-24 year-olds (24%).</p>
<p>Trump is also seen by 42% of US respondents as the candidate most likely to promote the use and benefits of Bitcoin compared to Joe Biden (23%) and Robert F. Kennedy (14%).</p>
<p>Globally:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Trump’s support from younger voters (18-24) is lower (37%) compared to 25-34 year-olds (43%) and 35-44 year-olds (45%), while Kennedy sees a slight increase from 18-24 year-olds (17%).</p>
<p>Internationally, Nigerian respondents (59%), followed by the UK (56%) and Germany (54%), believe Trump is the most ‘crypto-ready’, compared to only 42% in India.<br>
</p>
<p>Bitcoin Going Mainstream</p>
<p>More than a third of tech-savvy consumers (38%) believe Bitcoin will become mainstream within four years. This belief is higher among 25-34 year-olds (41%) and 18-24 year-olds (40%).</p>
<p>A significant 80% foresee a future where Bitcoin becomes a ‘default’ currency for global transactions, including commodities, real estate, and company valuations.</p>
<p>BRICS Nations and Global South Leading in Bitcoin Adoption</p>
 
 24% of tech-savvy Indian consumers and 26% of UAE respondents use Bitcoin daily, compared to the global average of 18%. In contrast, only 11% of Germans, 13% of UK respondents, 14% of South Koreans, and 15% of US tech-savvy consumers use Bitcoin daily. 
 High acceptance is observed in the UAE and Brazil (49%) for Bitcoin going mainstream within four years, compared to 22% in Germany, 25% in South Korea, and 36% in the UK. 
 91% of Nigerians and 90% of Indians envision Bitcoin as a ‘default’ currency, compared to 70% in Germany, 73% in the UK and South Korea, and 75% in the US.

 Nissan, Honda eye EV battery passports in Europe by 2027 
 <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/honda-mazda-nissan-complete-1st-phase-of-web3-global-battery-passport-mvp/">Read on the LedgerInsights website</a><br> 
<p>MOBI, the mobility web3 consortium, has completed the first phase of the minimum viable product (MVP) for its global battery passport. This involved nine members including DENSO, Honda, Mazda, and Nissan exchanging battery identity and data using open standards.</p>
<p>Stepping back, if batteries are to achieve the hoped for environmental impact, how they’re manufactured and recycled is a critical part of the process. Hence the need to keep track of battery lifecycles as mandated in the US and Europe. Digital credentials can include the battery’s composition, status and history.</p>
<p>What MOBI is trying to sidestep is the need for costly one off integrations and to achieve cross industry interoperability.</p>
<p>Stage 1 implemented the Integrated Trust Network (ITN) identity services, which enables companies to exchange battery identity and data on a peer-to-peer basis. Hence, the ITN is a federated registry built and operated by the members using W3C decentralized identifiers (DID). It’s a self sovereign identity (SSI) offering that supports multiple blockchains. The SSI aspect means the data is stored with the battery rather than in a centralized database.</p>
<p>“Today’s global battery value chain is complex and it’s difficult to simultaneously ensure efficiency, scalability, safety, circularity, and regulatory compliance. To balance these priorities, we need to enhance battery lifecycle management through the creation of a shared ecosystem with SSI framework for secure coordination and selective disclosure of sensitive data,” said MOBI CEO and Co-founder, Tram Vo.</p>
<p>Stage 2 will involve trialing Citopia, MOBI’s web3 marketplace for services. This will support applications such as enhanced battery and carbon credits management and vehicle-to-grid communications and payment. It will also support other mobility solutions, such as data-driven pricing for used electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MOBI has developed several standards. The most relevant is its battery passport standard released a year ago. Perhaps its most foundational standard is for vehicle identity. Other standards include tracking emissions for trips, supply chain blockchain standards and blockchain in vehicle financing.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Elastos, under the BeL2 initiative, will be attending the <a href="https://b.tc/conference/2024">Bitcoin Conference</a> in Nashville, taking place from July 25-27, 2024, at the Music City Center, less than two weeks away! This participation is the result of a collaborative effort supported equally by our <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/">Cyber Republic</a> (our DAO) via Proposal 145 and the Elastos Foundation, spearheaded by Mark Blair, longstanding CR Council Member and Head of Strategy at <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a>. In this article, we outline why this is so important for us, the details of our participation and how you can get involved! Let’s dive right in!</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Transforming Bitcoin: Elastos’ Vision and the Power of BeL2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="http://elastos.info">Elastos</a> is dedicated to transforming Bitcoin into a smart, versatile asset while preserving its core principle of decentralisation. BeL2 is a powerful new technology that leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and a decentralised clearing network to enable advanced DeFi applications for native Bitcoin (NB). The mission is to maintain Bitcoin’s integrity as the ultimate decentralised system while unlocking its potential for complex financial transactions, staking, and smart contracts​​​​.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BeL2 achieves this through a unique model where information, not assets, is transmitted across chains. This ensures that Bitcoin remains on its main network, maintaining its security and decentralisation. By utilising light client verification and zkBTC full nodes, BeL2 supports a range of Layer 2 applications, from lending to stablecoin issuance, paving the way for <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-new-bretton-woods-system/">a new decentralised financial system akin to the historical Bretton Woods system</a>, which, rather than being backed by gold, is backed by the 21st-century digital gold equivalent, Bitcoin.</p>
 Prime Location: Visit Elastos at Booth 621 
<p>Our booth at the conference has been officially confirmed, and we have secured a prime location on the conference floor. Booth 621 is the first large booth on the left as you enter, conveniently situated near the entrance, main stage, and the “Nakamoto Stage.” It’s also adjacent to the “Zen Lounge,” ensuring high visibility and foot traffic. This strategic positioning allows us to showcase our innovative solutions to a large audience, expected to be over 35,000 attendees​​!</p>
<p></p>
<p>At our booth, visitors will find exciting merchandise, fun giveaway prizes, and interactive games, including a spin-the-wheel activity. We will showcase alongside Elastos partners and stakeholders and also distribute a brochure (attached in this article) that highlights Elastos and its significant relationship with Bitcoin, emphasising ELA’s status as a merged-mined coin with over <a href="https://ela.elastos.io">50% of Bitcoin’s hash power​​.</a> Sasha Mitchell, the Head of BeL2 and founder of Elacity, will be speaking at the event, providing deeper insights into our technologies and future plans. The event will feature influential leaders such as Donald Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cathie Wood, Michael Saylor, Russell Brand, and Edward Snowden. This year is shaping up to be a very interesting event, given the US elections in November and Web3 becoming political.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BTC Nashville represents an important moment for Elastos and the BeL2 project as we continue to push the boundaries of what Bitcoin can achieve. We invite everyone to visit our booth, engage with our team, and get excited for the future of decentralised finance with Elastos and BeL2. For more information about our participation and updates, stay tuned to our official channels. We look forward to seeing you in Nashville on the 25th! Excited to learn more? Follow&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ElastosInfo">Infinity</a> for the latest updates, we will keep you updated throughout the whole week!</p>

 Developing communications for your organisation <p>This summer WAO ties a bow around a body of work we’ve been doing together with <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">the Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC). This initiative is hosted at MIT and has member universities from around the&nbsp;world.</p><blockquote>The Digital Credentials Consortium is advancing the use and understanding of portable, verifiable digital credentials in higher education through open source technology development and leadership, research, and advocacy.</blockquote><p>The DCC plays a pivotal role in the definition and establishment of the W3C Verifiable Credentials Standard. <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">Standards are often invisible, but they are massively important!</a></p><p>In this post, we’ll use our work with the DCC to help you systematically review your communication initiatives and give you a bit of a playbook on how to develop reusable communication assets and resources.</p> Understanding your&nbsp;audience An audience map WAO created with the&nbsp;DCC Research <p>When crafting communications strategies, most organisations miss a crucial step: audience research. Implementing lessons from outdated research or making assumptions about audience only to find out that your assumptions were wrong are two mistakes that you can&nbsp;avoid!</p><p>Before we started creating communication messaging and assets for the DCC, we did two rounds of interviews. In both rounds, we spoke one-to-one with people deeply involved in the DCC’s work. In the first round, we spoke with staff members, W3C task group members and people already implementing the Verifiable Credentials standard. In the second round, we talked to members of the DCC and with the Leadership Board. We asked the same questions for both rounds, but allowed for organic conversation to&nbsp;emerge.</p>cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>These interviews not only provided us with a bounty of onboarding and understanding to the DCC’s multitude of work, but it helped us identify, specifically, what stakeholders need and want from the&nbsp;DCC.</p> Segmentation <p>Once you have collected insights from your audience, you can begin to reflect those insights back in ways that help others understand who your audience is. Segmentation is a way to find overlapping interests and topics. We like to visualise segmentation and have done so in multiple ways, from our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/audience-ikigai-be0cebe4cea">Audience Ikigai</a> to <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/defining-the-cast/">Defining the Cast</a> and <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/persona-mapping/">Persona Spectrums</a>, we use a couple of different tools to find audience overlaps. Figuring out a visual way to explain your audience and their unique needs and insights is a great way to help people feel connected to your organisation.</p> Crafting your communications First slide of a deck implementing suggested design constraints Being specific <p>Understanding your audience will help you tailor your messages and customise content to specific segments of your audience. Through research, you are also creating relationships with your audience and can encourage people to feel open to giving you feedback.</p><p>Our research and subsequent analysis helped us see trends and patterns to pay attention to as we began to craft communications for the DCC. We also identified some quick intervention points allowing us to immediately implement small changes and quick wins. For example, before we ran our final interview, we implemented a new README for the <a href="https://github.com/digitalcredentials/">DCC’s Github organisation</a>. Small wins can have big&nbsp;impact!</p><p>Our onboarding and research activities helped us see where there were misunderstandings, so that we could deal with them as quickly as possible.</p> Design guidelines <p>It can be helpful to put what we call “Design Constraints” in place when we’re building communication strategies and initiatives. Design Constraints are simply rules you and your colleagues use to create consistency in both visual and written language. For example, we helped the DCC select a colour palette, fonts and an illustration library for their future communications.</p><p>A brand guide is an example of visual design constraints. A “key messaging and wording” section in your communications strategy is another.

We use several tools to help us figure out the best way to engage with a specific audience or community. We’ve written often about <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop/">the Architecture of Participation</a>, our go-to framework for creating participatory communities.</p><p>We also like to build Contributor Pathways, which help show how different stakeholders engage with a project. These pathways can outline steps different audience take and where you might be able to engage with them more effectively.</p><p>There are four stages to the engagement model we like to&nbsp;use:</p>  Awareness — The first stage invites you to think about how your particular group hears about you or your project for the first time. The questions to as are How do they hear about us and how would we like them to hear about&nbsp;us?  First Engagement — Stage two identifies the first interaction a person or a group has with you or your project. What is the first action that they take and what action would you like them to&nbsp;take?  Build Relationship — Stage three is about your interaction. How do you build relationships with people or groups and what value can you&nbsp;bring?  Deepen Engagement — As people deepen their engagement with your organisation or project, you’ll want to show them that they’re valued. So how can you ensure consistent engagement with your most engaged audiences?  <p>We think about each of these stages in reference to each specific audience group, as some audiences might be more or less engaged than&nbsp;others.</p> Advocacy <p>WAO tends to work with groups and organisations that are trying to create a better world. Advocacy is an integral part of our work. There are a variety of advocacy and collaboration strategies as well as best practices that you can use to ensure you are able to promote your messages in a way that lead to&nbsp;action.</p><p>In this post on <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/advocating-for-learner-centric-badge-systems-21a65be4a725">campaigning for the right things</a>, we take a deep dive into using an advocacy framework to figure out where we might focus efforts.

 Nissan, Honda eye EV battery passports in Europe by 2027 
 <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Electric-vehicles/Nissan-Honda-eye-EV-battery-passports-in-Europe-by-2027">Read on Nikkei’s website</a><br> 
<p>By Azusa Kawakami, Nikkei staff writer | 12 July 2024 </p>
 
 
 
 
 
<p>NEW YORK — Nissan Motor, Honda Motor and other Japanese auto industry companies have joined forces to develop a digital tracking system for electric-vehicle batteries, anticipating European Union regulations aimed at encouraging recycling and reducing reliance on China.</p>
<p>Mazda Motor and parts supplier Denso are also among the seven Japanese companies planning to introduce a “battery passport” by 2027.</p>
<p>Businesses and car owners will use a code to access these digital records and find information about the amount of recyclable metals used, origin and production history. The passport will also provide the extent of battery deterioration and residual value.</p>
<p>The companies will seek to put the system to use first in Europe, where battery regulations are to be introduced in 2027.</p>
<p>Adopted in June 2023, the regulations will make battery recycling mandatory within the EU bloc. Among the provisions is a requirement that 50% of lithium from used batteries must be recycled by 2027.</p>
<p>From 2027, automakers will need to meet those regulations for EVs sold in Europe, with penalties for failing to do so.</p>
<p>Nissan and Honda are participants in the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative, an alliance of more than 120 companies from Japan, the U.S. and Europe, and have been involved in the development of the battery passport infrastructure.</p>
<p>The EU’s tougher battery regulations are due in part to a desire to cut its reliance on China, which dominates the supply of battery materials. China accounts for 65% of the world’s processing and refining of lithium, according to the International Energy Agency.</p>
<p>The U.S., which is strengthening its own restrictions against China, is also considering introducing battery passports. The Inflation Reduction Act made it a condition for EV makers to procure batteries within North America to qualify for vehicle subsidies. Passports can help certify where batteries come from.</p>
<p>But because China leads the EV battery market with a roughly 60% share and controls much of the supply chain, it could be difficult to obtain full battery data without Chinese cooperation.</p>
<p>China’s CATL, the world’s leading automotive battery manufacturer, is said to have over 1 trillion pieces of battery data, from raw materials to recycling.</p>

<p>Canada’s digital trust leader, the DIACC, releases its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) Authentication Final Recommendation V1.2, signalling it’s ready for inclusion in their <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/">Certification Program</a>.</p>



<p>Why is the PCTF Authentication component important?</p>



<p>The Authentication component helps assure the on-going integrity of login and authentication processes by certifying, through a process of assessment, that they comply with standardized Conformance Criteria. The Conformance Criteria for this component may be used to provide assurances that Trusted Processes result in the representation of a unique Subject at a Level of Assurance that it is the same Subject with each successful login to an Authentication Service Provider while also providing assurances concerning the predictability and continuity in the login processes that they offer or on which they depend.</p>



<p>What problems does the PCTF Authentication component solve?</p>



<p>The Authentication component helps establish a standardized way for individuals and organizations to verify their identities when accessing digital services. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential breaches. Additionally, by providing a reliable method for authentication, this allows the PCTF to foster trust and confidence among users, service providers, and stakeholders. This is crucial for the widespread adoption of digital services.</p>



<p>Who does the PCTF Authentication component help?</p>



<p>All participants will benefit from login and authentication processes that are repeatable and consistent (whether they offer these processes, depend on them, or both). It can help lay the foundation to provide assurances that identified Users can engage in authorized interactions with remote systems. When combined with considerations from the PCTF Wallet Component, participants may have an enhanced user experience through the reuse of credentials across multiple Relying Parties.</p>



<p>Relying Parties can benefit from the ability to build on the assurance that Authentication Trusted Processes uniquely identify, at an acceptable level of risk, a Subject in their application or program space.</p>

We conducted this interview over email between Amsterdam and New York&nbsp;City.</p><p>Sam Hinds: Do you encounter specific types of people or professional backgrounds in the work of investigations and OSINT tool development?</p><p>Johanna Wild: The great thing about the field of open source research is that it consists of people from various backgrounds. Open source researchers spend a lot of time online. They find pieces of information on social media platforms, in online forums, and databases, and they compare features that they identify in user-generated online videos and photos with locations that can be seen on satellite imagery. This process, called geolocation, is used to verify online images. The nature of open source research allows everyone with an internet connection to do this type of&nbsp;work.</p><p>The open source researcher community is therefore a mix of people who do open source research as part of their job and volunteers who are passionate about contributing to important research in their free time. My surveys and user interviews with our Bellingcat community showed that our community consists of people working for human rights organizations, stay-at-home-parents who use their limited time to do something mentally challenging and useful, cybersecurity specialists, job seekers who want to learn new skills, lawyers, data scientists, people who are retired and many more. When I ask volunteers about their motivation, they often say that they want to contribute to research that reveals issues in the regions where they live, that they want to feel that in these times that are characterized by various conflicts around the world, and global challenges like climate change; they do not just passively sit around but actively contribute to something that creates new knowledge about those issues. Another motivation is to become part of a community with similar interests and to improve their open source research&nbsp;skills.</p><p>Of course there are also many journalists who are part of this community. Nowadays, more and more newsrooms are setting up teams focusing on open source research. However, journalists were more of the late adopters in this field. Most of them only discovered in the last few years how useful this type of research can be, especially if it is combined with traditional journalistic skills and methods. Newsrooms even started hiring skilled open source researchers who are completely self-taught and who have no journalism degree, which is something that is still rather unusual in the news industry.</p><p>Volunteers with a technical background contribute by building tools. These are often simple command line tools that are able to do one very specific task, for instance to scrape posts from a specific social media platform or to check whether an online account has been created on a platform using a specific phone number. Those tools do not usually turn into big commercial products; they are built by people from within the open source software community who focus on writing code that is publicly accessible to anyone. Several years ago, I clearly saw that the open source researcher and the open source software community are a very good match for each other, we just needed to bring them together. This is one of the things that we now do at Bellingcat. We organize hackathons, actively invite software developers into our volunteer community, and support them to build their own tools or to contribute to tools built by the Bellingcat team. This group of volunteers consists for example of people who have a full time job in a software company but want to do something meaningful in their free time, of job seekers who want to create their own portfolio of tools, or of academics who are already deep into a technical topic but would like to test its practical application.</p><p>Although the open source researcher and tech communities are very diverse in terms of their professional and personal backgrounds, they are currently still dominated by volunteers and professionals from Western countries, mainly from the US and Europe. The technical tool builder community is also, to date, still male dominated. This lack of representation raises serious questions in terms of who defines the future of our field and who has the power to research topics in regions all around the world. With people in many other regions still excluded from participating in this type of research, they mainly become the subject of Western researchers.</p><blockquote>“While AI tools can be powerful, we should not expect to automate the whole open source research process. Doing open source research is a combination of specific research methods, the use of tools, a good dose of logical thinking and also creativity!”</blockquote><p>SH: Have you seen novel trends emerge in the type of information researchers want&nbsp;today?</p><p>JW: I definitely observe that researchers, and especially journalists, have become more aware of how useful it is to be able to work with large datasets, to know how to scrape information from websites or to have the skills to build small tools that can speed up some of their research&nbsp;tasks.</p><p>Currently, everyone is of course interested in AI. Less experienced researchers are hoping for a tool that lets them input any picture or video and then spits out the exact location of where it was taken. While AI tools can be powerful, we should not expect to automate the whole open source research process. Doing open source research is a combination of specific research methods, the use of tools, a good dose of logical thinking and also creativity! Creativity is needed to spot topics that are worth getting investigated. When deciding where to look next in the vast amount of online information that is out there, creativity helps to connect multiple, often tiny, pieces of verified information which allow researchers to draw conclusions on a certain&nbsp;topic.</p><p>Another trend is the use of facial recognition tools. Open source researchers often find pictures that show individuals who have a connection to a certain research case but whose identity they don’t know. In the last few years, several easy to use facial recognition tools have emerged. Researchers can upload a picture of a person and the tool compares this picture with collections of photos from social media platforms. Sometimes, this can reveal the identity of a person, for instance by providing the person’s LinkedIn profile. It is obvious how useful this can be to identify individuals who were involved in serious crimes that require journalistic reporting.</p><p>However, facial recognition tools are a double-edge sword. We all know that they can provide wrong results. Two people might just look very similar and an uninvolved person might be misidentified as someone who is involved in illegal activities. It is therefore important that open source researchers do not use those tools as the only way of identifying someone. On top of that, the use of such tools raises various ethical questions ranging from the risk of stalking random people online, to questions about the data sources on which facial recognition tools rely. At Bellingcat, we reflected on how we can ensure a responsible use of facial recognition technologies and concluded that we will refrain from using these tools extensively, and never as a core element of an investigation. We also never used products from companies like Clearview AI. A good example of how we sometimes use a facial recognition tool as a starting point for further research can be found in our article on how <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/04/06/cartel-king-kinahans-google-reviews-expose-travel-partners/">“Cartel King Kinahan’s Google Reviews Expose Travel Partners”</a>.</p><p>SH: Are there any overlooked tools that you like to highlight in your trainings?</p><p>JW: The best type of tool really depends on the research topic. Often a combination of several small tools can lead to the best results. For instance, our<a href="https://bellingcat.github.io/name-variant-search/"> Name Variant Search Tool</a> is basically an enhanced search engine for finding information about people. Open source researchers often start with a name and try to find out as much as possible about the person’s online presence. However, the name might be written differently on different sites. “Jane Doe” might also show up as “J. Doe” or “Doe, Jane”. The tool suggests different possible variations of a name and provides search results for all those variations. It is also possible to instruct the tool to search for a name specifically on Linkedin or Facebook.</p><p>Example: Name Variant Search results for different variants of the name “Jane&nbsp;Doe”</p><p>Our<a href="https://osm-search.bellingcat.com/"> OpenStreetMap search tool</a>, on the other hand, supports the geolocation process. A core task of many open source researchers is to find out where a photo or video that they found online has been taken. To do that, they try to identify specific features and compare those with what is visible on satellite imagery or maps. If researchers already have a rough idea in which region a photo might have been taken, they can input a list of features that are visible in the photo (for instance, a residential street, a school and a supermarket) into our tool, which will try to list all locations in a pre-defined region in which those features show up together. This can really help narrow down possible locations.</p><p>SH: What’s an example of an unusual story or insight one can find from OS&nbsp;tools?</p><p>JW: If open source researchers have no idea where a picture might have been taken but they know at which time it was captured and the photo shows objects that cast clearly visible shadows, they can try our<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/GalenReich/ShadowFinder/blob/main/ShadowFinderColab.ipynb"> ShadowFinder</a> tool which is able to calculate at which locations around the world shadow lengths correspond with what can be seen in the photo at a specific point in time. This helps open source researchers concentrate their geolocation efforts to the areas suggested by the tool instead of searching across the whole&nbsp;world.</p>Example of a<a href="https://github.com/bellingcat/ShadowFinder"> ShadowFinder</a> tool result: Possible locations are shown by the yellow&nbsp;circle.<p>Another tool that has gained popularity within the open source researcher community is<a href="https://peakvisor.com/"> PeakVisor</a>, a tool that was originally targeted at helping mountaineers orient themselves but which can also be used for<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2023/07/13/more-than-mountaineering-using-peakvisor-for-geolocation/"> geolocation tasks</a>. For instance, we used it to research the location of the<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/12/11/the-sound-of-bullets-the-killing-of-colombian-journalist-abelardo-liz/"> killing of Colombian journalist Abelardo Liz</a>. This example in particular shows that a combination of research skills and the use of tools can go a long&nbsp;way.</p><p>SH: What frustrations or barriers do you see as a trainer, and how could the field democratize knowledge of command line&nbsp;tools?</p><p>JW: First of all: Teaching open source research is great. People who are interested in learning these methods come from so many different backgrounds which allows everyone to learn new things from each other, including the trainers! The topic is also quite accessible, meaning that everyone can start doing open source research with very simple methods, like using search engines in creative ways. Sometimes, this can lead to surprising results: For instance, just by googling, my colleague Foeke Postma revealed how<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/05/28/us-soldiers-expose-nuclear-weapons-secrets-via-flashcard-apps/"> US soldiers exposed nuclear weapons secrets via flashcard apps</a>.</p><p>Of course not all methods are as simple, and one of the things people are struggling with the most are research tools. During my <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/fellowships/nieman-berkman-fellowship-in-journalism-innovation-2/">Nieman-Berkman Klein fellowship</a> my research assistant Cooper-Morgan Bryant and I interviewed forty open source researchers about their use of tools. Their answers confirmed my<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/08/12/these-are-the-tools-open-source-researchers-say-they-need/"> previous findings</a> on this topic: Open source researchers, who are either beginners or who are looking at a topic that is new to them, find it really difficult to figure out what tool they should use at what stage of the research process and how those tools work. With such a wide variety of online tools, some more useful and some easier to find than others, and many researchers feel overwhelmed by the task of finding their way through the landscape of available tools spread across various platforms.</p><p>In addition, the majority of open source researchers are not able to use command line tools since this requires a certain degree of technical skills. However, those are exactly the type of small tools that the open source software community is building most frequently. There is a clear divide between those who are building tools for open source researchers and the researcher community itself, for whom those tools often turn out not to be accessible.</p><blockquote>“Open source researchers want complex tools that are easy to use and that are stable and well-developed but such tools need funders and teams who build them, and these conditions are not always easily met in the open source research and journalism space.”</blockquote><p>On the other side, open source researchers are often not aware of the resources that are required to build mature tools that have an easy-to-use interface. It is getting easier now, but tool builders need to invest a lot more time to build such tools and this is difficult for people who do this task in their free time and without any funding. Open source researchers want complex tools that are easy to use, stable, and well-developed, but such tools need funders and teams who build them. These conditions are not always easily met in the open source research and journalism space. I hope that researchers will become a little bit more open to learn some basic technical skills, and even more importantly that they understand that not every tool that is useful for their research has to function like a fully built commercial tool.</p><p>At Bellingcat, we focus on bridging this gap between tool builders and open source researchers. We work with tech communities —often through programs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOHj7r0_CKA">hackathons</a> or fellowships — and make them aware of how important good user guides are, even for seemingly easy-to-use tools. On the other hand, we teach open source researchers how to use command line tools. We also launched a video series with the goal to help researchers make their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymCMy8OffHM">first steps</a> towards the more technical side of research&nbsp;tools.</p><p>SH: Tools take a lot of resources to build. Do any OSINT tools have a complicated provenance in terms of private sector origin or geopolitics?</p><p>JW: It is definitely problematic that researchers and journalists can be so dependent on tools provided by big tech companies. Meta’s social monitoring platform Crowdtangle will be shut down in August and this has caused a lot of discontent amongst journalists, in particular amongst those who are covering elections. For instance, many of the platforms and tools open source researchers use are provided by Google, like Google Search, Google Maps and Google Earth Pro. We are often at the mercy of the decisions that big tech companies take regarding use of their&nbsp;tools.</p><p>However, their tools are usually provided for free, which is not the case for other commercial tools. Open source researchers definitely need to look into the companies from which they are buying tools. One risk is that tool providers might be able to see what type of keywords people are typing in or on what topic someone is working on. Researchers and journalists need to be sure that their sensitive research topics are safe from being monitored by tool providers.</p><p>At Bellingcat we focus on mostly small open source tools, but those tools come with their own set of challenges. For instance, it is often not clear who is behind a tool that is offered on code-sharing platforms like Github, which can raise security-related questions.</p><blockquote>“I would love to see universities getting more involved in building and maintaining tools for open source researchers and journalists…since both sides have the common goal of advancing research in the public interest”</blockquote><p>This is why I really hope we can build a different tool ecosystem for open source researchers in the future. I would love to see universities getting more involved in building and maintaining tools for open source researchers and journalists. I think that such collaborations could work well since both sides have the common goal of advancing research in the public interest, and many of the tools that are used by open source researchers are equally useful for academic researchers. I also see opportunities to research security-related aspects of widely used tools together, as journalists and open source researchers could definitely use some help in assessing the risks that some of the tools they are using might be posing. If anyone who reads this would like to discuss these topics with me: Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/johanna_wild">get in&nbsp;touch</a>!</p><p>SH: Misinformation, disinformation, conspiratorial thinking: What are some of the uses and abuses of “research” you see in these contexts?</p><p>JW: What is most common — especially during conflicts and wars — is that people share either photos or videos from a different conflict or old imagery and make people believe that they are related to current events. In the context of the Israel-Gaza conflict since October 2023, this phenomenon has reached a new scale with countless examples circulating online. For instance,<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/10/11/hamas-attacks-israel-bombs-gaza-and-misinformation-surges-online/"> Bellingcat</a> found videos that were shared with the claims that one showed rockets that were fired at Israel by Hamas and another that claimed to show recent Israeli strikes on Hamas; both turned out to be recycled videos that had been uploaded to YouTube several years&nbsp;prior.</p><blockquote>“People who post such pictures might sometimes think they are doing ‘research’ and that they are sharing relevant information about an ongoing conflict, without realizing that they are actually sharing incorrect information.”</blockquote><p>What is dangerous is that some of those posts go viral and are able to reach significant numbers of people who will never know that they fell for misinformation. People who post such pictures might sometimes think they are doing “research” and that they are sharing relevant information about an ongoing conflict, not realizing the information is incorrect. Others, however, will do it on purpose to evoke emotions either in favor or against one of the conflict parties. Users of online platforms cannot really do much to prevent being confronted with such posts. This is another reason it is essential that we all learn to question what we see online and to invest some time in learning <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2021/11/01/a-beginners-guide-to-social-media-verification/">basic verification skills</a>.</p><p>What we have also been seeing is that supporters of conspiracy ideologies are increasingly using open source research tools and presenting the information as journalistic findings. For example,<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/11/24/toy-rabbits-chemtrails-and-german-qanon-fanatics-how-not-to-conduct-open-source-investigations/"> Qanon supporters</a> in German-speaking countries started using flight-tracking sites to search for flights which they falsely believed were circling above “deep underground military bases” in which children were hidden and mistreated. This is problematic since people who are not aware of the methods and standards of open source research might not be able to differentiate between serious research and the distorted version of&nbsp;it.</p><p>SH: What are some of your favorite guidelines or best practices for journalists who aim to cover (and fact-check) broad conspiratorial thinking enabled by OS information?</p><p>JW: Looking at their business models can often be a very promising approach. More often than not, conspiracy-minded communities have business-savvy people amongst them who manage to benefit financially from those communities’ beliefs. When I was researching QAnon online communities in Germany, big platforms like Amazon and eBay had started implementing measures to ban QAnon products from their platforms. However, this seemed to have created new opportunities for QAnon influencers who were offering merchandise via their own small online shops. On top of that, customers in Germany were able to buy QAnon products from abroad, for instance from Chinese or British companies who offered products targeted specifically at German-speaking customers. It was interesting but also concerning to see how international today’s conspiracy merchandise markets&nbsp;are.</p><p>To research online shops, it is always worth researching what<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2024/03/26/how-to-get-started-investigating-payment-gateways-online/"> payment options</a> those shops are using and to look into their potential use of<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/03/26/how-to-track-illegal-funding-campaigns-via-cryptocurrency"> cryptocurrencies</a>. It is also important to take some time to learn the terminology a certain group is using. If you are looking into the far-right, for instance, it is crucial to learn how to<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2023/04/04/how-not-to-interpret-far-right-symbols/"> interpret the symbols</a> they&nbsp;use.</p><blockquote>”Open source researchers are often portrayed as some type of ‘nerdy hero’ who spends time on his laptop to research ‘the bad guys’ and is celebrated once he succeeds. The idea of one hero figure who solves all the research challenges is really the exact opposite of how open source research works&nbsp;best…”</blockquote><p>SH: How might international organizations build stronger support for women, femme-identified, and gender-nonconforming media and research professionals?</p><p>JW: In the field of open source research, there are definitely tendencies that I would like to see changed in the future. It is well established that women and gender-nonconforming people have traditionally had a much harder time to enter and succeed in the space of investigative journalism. Those issues are far from being overcome, but the journalism world has started to talk more openly about it, and the fact that academic researchers have published work on this topic has also been&nbsp;helpful.</p><p>My impression is that as open source researchers, we have not yet put enough effort into reflecting on what is happening in our own field. Maybe we thought that since it is relatively new, those issues would not appear as strongly. Unfortunately, however, they do, and it’s time to recognize this.</p><p>There are definitely many contributing factors, but one that has had a strong effect on me is that open source researchers are often portrayed as some type of “nerdy hero” who spends time on his laptop to research “the bad guys” and is celebrated once he succeeds. The idea of one lone wolf who solves all the research challenges on their own is really the exact opposite of how open source research works best, which is by nature collaborative and often requires the efforts of many to put together various small pieces of verified online sources for a specific research case. For those of us who don’t want, and are also not able to fit into this commonly portrayed male hero picture, this field might not necessarily feel like a good&nbsp;fit.</p><p>However, since more and more traditional newsrooms are setting up open source research units right now, I see more women entering the field and hopefully, this will also change how we publicly talk about open source research over time. To everyone who organizes a public event on open source research, I recommend to not only approach the few already well known voices in the field but to take the effort to find and invite speakers who can contribute new perspectives and who have done research on topics that are not always in the spotlight.</p><p>SH: What were the most meaningful conversations you had during your time at the Berkman Klein Center? Do you plan to use any of your connections or insights from the fellowship in your future&nbsp;work?</p><p>JW: I am very grateful that I was able to be a Berkman Klein Fellow this year. It was a great opportunity to be part of a community of people who all reflect on how we integrate new technologies in our lives but from various different angles. Each fellow and community hour provided me with insights into a different technology-related topic and I liked the “surprise” effect of being able to learn new things about topics I usually don’t have the time to think about. This has definitely had an impact on how I approached my own projects with Bellingcat. I feel that being immersed in such a knowledgeable and collaborative community has unlocked my creativity and I am looking forward to continuing to learn from everyone in the Berkman Klein sphere in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Johanna Wild was a joint 2023–2024 <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/fellowships/nieman-berkman-fellowship-in-journalism-innovation-2/#:~:text=The%20Nieman%2DBerkman%20Klein%20Fellowship,project%20relating%20to%20journalism%20innovation">Nieman-Berkman Fellow in Journalism Innovation</a>, a joint fellowship administered between the <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/">Nieman Foundation for Journalism</a> and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at Harvard University.

<p></p>      First Web3 Global Battery Passport Implementation for Current and Future Regulatory Compliance           <p>DENSO, Honda, Mazda, and Nissan among MOBI members who have completed Stage 1 of the Cross-Industry Interoperable Minimum Viable Product, a three-year initiative towards a decentralized Global Battery Passport built for data privacy and selective disclosure   </p>
          <p>Los Angeles, 10 July 2024 — MOBI, a global nonprofit Web3 consortium, is thrilled to announce a significant milestone in development of the Web3 Global Battery Passport (GBP) Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In a historic first, the MVP has successfully demonstrated battery identity/data validation and exchange between nine organizations using open-standards — <a href="https://dlt.mobi/standards/">MOBI Battery Birth Certificate</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework — an achievement that carries exciting implications for stakeholders of the battery value chain and lays critical groundwork for the Web3 Economy. Organizations worldwide are invited to <a href="https://dlt.mobi/participate/">join and collaborate</a> in this trailblazing effort.</p>
<p>Participants of MOBI Circular Economy and the GBP Working Group, constituting close to USD 1 Trillion in annual revenue and representing diverse functions within the global battery ecosystem, have successfully completed Stage 1 of the three-year MVP and are set to begin Stage 2. Implementers of the decentralized GBP include <a href="https://www.anritsu.com/">Anritsu</a>, <a href="https://www.densoautoparts.com/">DENSO</a>, <a href="https://www.hioki.com/">HIOKI</a>, <a href="https://global.honda/">Honda</a>, <a href="https://www.mazda.com/">Mazda</a>, <a href="https://www.nissan-global.com/EN/">Nissan</a>, and <a href="https://trade-log.io/">TradeLog Inc</a>. </p>
<p>As the world increasingly turns to batteries for sustainable energy solutions, global battery value chains are making continuous improvements to enhance operational efficiency, circularity, and cross-border compliance. Forward-looking global policies like the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/17/2023-06822/section-30d-new-clean-vehicle-credit">US Treasury’s Section 30D Guidance on EV Tax Credits</a> and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32023R1542">EU Battery Regulation</a> mandate digital recordkeeping to track battery life cycles, underscoring the need for a global battery passport — a digital credential containing key information about the battery’s composition, state of health, history, and more.</p>
<p>Creating a scalable GBP will require cross-industry interoperability, such that entities across the value chain can securely coordinate and selectively share relevant data without the need to pay for costly one-off integrations or abandon their existing systems. MOBI and its members believe Web3 can become a key enabler for cross-industry interoperability at scale. SSI in particular introduces a promising approach to unlocking powerful synergies, enabling entities to securely control and share credentials across different web applications and platforms without the need for centralized intermediaries. To this end, MOBI and its members are building a decentralized Web3 marketplace ecosystem with standardized communication protocols for Self-Sovereign Data and SSI, designed such that the federated infrastructure and data therein are not controlled or managed by one organization. While MOBI MVP initiative demonstrates a specific use case for implementing the GBP, the benefits of MOBI Web3 implementation extend to almost any use case that involves multiparty transactions. </p>
<p>In Stage 1 of the initiative, implementers demonstrated the<a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/"> Integrated Trust Network</a> (ITN) identity services of one-to-one cross-validation for battery identity and data. The ITN serves as a federated (member-built and operated) registry for W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>, offering SSI management for connected entities such as batteries and their value chain participants. The ITN is the first enterprise network supporting multiple blockchains at the same time. These features are unique to the ITN, built for high resilience by ensuring the network’s functionality and sustainability do not rely on a single organization or blockchain. </p>
<p>Stage 2 will demonstrate <a href="https://citopia.global/">Citopia</a> decentralized marketplace services through creation of the cross-industry interoperable, privacy-preserving GBP. ITN services are one-to-one whereas Citopia services are one-to-many (and many-to-one). Through Web3 implementation, the availability and selective disclosure of trusted data and identities throughout the battery value chain will beget digital services and applications such as enhanced battery and carbon credits management, vehicle-to-grid communications and transactions, risk-based insurance calculations, and data-driven used electric vehicle pricing.</p>
<p>“Today’s global battery value chain is complex and it’s difficult to simultaneously ensure efficiency, scalability, safety, circularity, and regulatory compliance. To balance these priorities, we need to enhance battery lifecycle management through the creation of a shared ecosystem with SSI framework for secure coordination and selective disclosure of sensitive data,” said MOBI CEO and Co-founder, Tram Vo. “Driving innovation at this scale requires cross-industry collaboration. We invite public and private organizations worldwide to join us in this critical pursuit.”</p>
<p>“Web3 is an interesting technology which may facilitate a more scalable approach to exchanging battery data in a peer-to-peer fashion between organizations,” said Christian Köbel, Senior Engineer at Honda Motor Co., Ltd. </p>
<p>“It is confirmed how Web3-based self-sovereign data management works throughout Stage 1 of the MVP,” said Yusuke Zushi, Senior Manager at Nissan. </p>
<p>Said Mazda Motor Corporation, “Through participation in the GBP Working Group, we not only acquired the technical knowledge of Web3 but also understood a vision of an ecosystem that realizes the exchange of reliable information. We appreciate MOBI for giving us this invaluable opportunity.”</p>
<p>“The Stage 1 MVP experiment was instrumental in deepening our understanding of a system that enables sovereign data management. In the current era of data, the integrity and safety of information flow are paramount. As an experienced manufacturer of measuring instruments, HIOKI has always placed a premium on the reliability and accuracy of data,” said Kenneth Soh, Executive Officer at HIOKI. “We believe that the insights gained from this MVP are vital for the future progress of measurement instrument manufacturers and the industries we serve, from the perspective of innovation and societal contribution driven by mechanisms that offer both security and precision in data distribution.”</p>
<p>“The successful implementation of the Web3 GBP MVP is a significant step towards a more transparent and sustainable battery ecosystem. We are honored to contribute to the realization of the GBP as participants in this important initiative,” said Hisashi Matsumoto, Senior Manager at Anritsu. </p>
<p>“We, TradeLog, Inc., proudly support the decentralized Global Battery Passport project, driven by the efforts of MOBI and its dedicated Implementers,” said Alvin Ishiguro, Project Coordinator at TradeLog, Inc. “Going forward, we will continue to deliver our customers new experiences through blockchain technologies in the energy sector.”</p>

 An Identiverse 2024 Panel Recap 
<p>The attendance for this <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv24/session/2089504/">panel, which featured all co-chairs of the Shared Signals Working Group (SSWG</a>), was near capacity and the engagement from the audience in the Q&amp;A was resounding…because the hype is real with CAEP. The panel was moderated by IDAC podcast host, Jeff Steadman. His questions ranged from provisioning use cases to applicability in connected scenarios with other IAM domains (such as ITDR) and diving deeper into the CAEP specification and Shared Signals Framework. The “IAM CAEPable” T-shirts were also a hot commodity…and there might be another order coming soon.</p>
<p>The many questions from the audience made the discussion even more lively, allowing for open and real conversations to occur with the assembled panel of experts. The panelists felt the audience’s engagement as they saw people scribbling notes, typing on a laptop, or nodding their heads before raising their hands to elaborate or branch off into new areas. Sometimes the energetic Q&amp;A led to a conversation between the audience and multiple panelists. This article covers the highlights.</p>
 Highlights &amp; Key Points 
<p>Q: What are the practical use cases and applications of CAEP Events?</p>
<p>Apart from the immediate “session revoked” scenario, now implemented by platform providers like <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/federated-authentication-identity-provider-axmfcab66783/web">Apple</a>, CAEP can be applied in numerous other scenarios. These include, for example, revoking a suspicious device’s session without impacting the end user or informing an IdP of assurance level changes – informative and actionable signals. </p>
<p>A real world scenario is when an event is emitted from an anomaly detection engine, which results in a CAEP event being transmitted so you could take action to revoke the specific session for both the user and possibly the device, if applicable.</p>
<p>Q: Where do CAEP and ITDR intersect? Can you explain the significance of this intersection?</p>
<p>CAEP brings the “R” in ITDR (Identity Threat Detection and Response). Additionally, Shared Signals (SSF) can be leveraged to enhance ITDR by providing a way to communicate detected threats and trigger responses to security systems…using an open standard. Think of Shared Signals as the management framework and CAEP as, effectively, the events that sit on top of it. The new events introduced in the latest CAEP draft, “Session Established” and “Session Presented”, can also help detect usage anomalies like lateral movement across cloud resources.</p>
<p>Q: Can this be used in provisioning use cases?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new draft in the IETF called “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scim-events/">SCIM Events</a>” defines events that can be shared using the Shared Signals Framework (SSF). This can be used to communicate changes to accounts such as new account provisioning or account termination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: How can you link events to the same underlying action or reason?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest draft of the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-03.html">Shared Signals Framework (SSF)</a> includes guidelines on using the JWT “txn” claim to ensure that transmitters and receivers do not process multiple events for the same underlying cause or reason and to establish a lineage between cause or reason to the events transmitted for reconciliation or closing the loop.</p>
 New Features and Drafts Released 
<p>There have been some exciting new developments from the Shared Signals Working Group. The new drafts have been released for review by the OpenID Foundation membership and voting. This stemmed from feedback at the Gartner Interoperability Summit, robust security analysis by the University of Stuttgart, natural maturation of the specification, and Work Group feedback where more use cases were brought to light.</p>
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-03.html">Shared Signals Framework (SSF) – Draft 03</a> 
<p>Clarification and bug fixes have been added to this draft. There have also been security issues addressed with issuer and stream audience mix up and potential attacker subject insertion. New features added include: the use of the txn claim to prevent cascading chains from the same underlying event and a means of using it for reconciliation and transmitters can now specify in their metadata which streams have no subjects by default or “appropriate subjects”.</p>
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-04.html">Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP) Draft 03</a> 
<p>The big update here is the introduction of 2 new events: “Session Established” and “Session Presented”. Additionally, the draft has been updated to reflect new formats and fields in examples to match the new SSF draft.</p>
 <a href="https://openid.github.io/sharedsignals/openid-caep-interoperability-profile-1_0.html">CAEP Interoperability Profile – Draft 00</a> 
<p>The first version of the CAEP Interoperability Profile, which defines how implementations can be fully interoperable for specific use cases such as session revocation and credentials change, is also released.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the recent integration between Elastos and <a href="https://chainge.finance/">Chainge Finance</a>, enabling users to swap assets like ETH, USDC, and USDT from over 14 blockchain networks into ELA on the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) or Ethereum (ETH) and back. This integration breaks down barriers and fosters a unified financial ecosystem in Web3. <a href="https://dapp.chainge.finance/">Use here now!</a></p>
 
 Elastos’ Friction Point 
<p>Elastos has long struggled with bridging issues, which affects ecosystem growth. Users on exchanges like Coinbase faced difficulties accessing Elastos as only ELA on Ethereum was available. Previous solutions, such as<a href="https://glidefinance.io/"> Glide Finance’s</a> high-fee shadow token bridge and<a href="https://elk.finance/"> ELK Finance</a>‘s complex swaps, frustrated the community. Just as airports facilitate international travel and business, cross-chain interoperability is vital for a cohesive DeFi ecosystem, reducing costs, enhancing tourism, and promoting overall business.</p>
<p>Unlike<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/centralized-exchange-vs-decentralized-merkeleon-software-q70uf/"> Centralised exchanges</a> (CEXs) with third-party control, stringent identity checks (KYC), and entry/exit restrictions, decentralised cross-chain exchanges (DEXs) like Chainge offer a permissionless alternative. They enable secure, seamless asset transfers across blockchains, supporting decentralised identities and eliminating centralisation risks, thus improving utility, security and efficiency for all Web3 stakeholders.</p>
  
 Interconnectivity 
 
 
 
 
 Stemming from<a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals/6605604e60cec9007c846ea6"> CRC Proposal 151</a> and led by Sasha Mitchell, <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elacity-revolutionising-drm-in-the-digital-transformation-era/">Elacity</a> CEO and <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-new-bretton-woods-system/">BeL2</a> Head of Operations, in collaboration with Chainge team CEO <a href="https://x.com/djqianfusion">DJ Qian</a>, Elastos and BeL2 Co-Founder <a href="https://x.com/SunnyFengHan">Sunny Feng Han</a>, and the <a href="https://app.bunnypunk.io/">BunnyPunk</a> team, Chainge’s cross-chain DEX has been integrated with Elastos. This integration merges liquidity pools on Ethereum (Uniswap) and ESC (Glide Finance) and adds 18,513 ELA and 41,655 USDC liquidity on Chainge’s Fusion blockchain, allowing users to swap assets into ELA from over 14 chains. These chains include Fusion, Ethereum, BNB Chain, Base, Avalanche C, Polygon, Aurora, Syscoin Rollux, X Layer Mainnet, CoreDAO, Syscoin NEVM, Arbitrum, Optimistic, Linea, zkSync and B2 (recent BeL2 partner). 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this screenshot, we show how USDC on Arbitrum was successfully used to purchase ELA on ESC in a single transaction using a decentralised wallet. This simplifies access to the Elastos ecosystem and its various Dapps, effectively opening up Elastos to the entire Web3 community with a new international airport.</p>
<p></p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Cyber Republic Proposal #294: Banking, Liquidity and Slippage 
 
 
 
 
<p>Next, working with Chainge, the goal is to soon connect to a fiat on/off ramp service, allowing users to buy ELA directly with credit cards or bank accounts and exchange ELA for US dollars into their bank accounts, enhancing accessibility and ease of use.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, there is still a necessary challenge to tackle surrounding liquidity and slippage. Liquidity is the ease of converting an asset to cash without affecting its price, while slippage is the difference between the expected and actual trade price. High liquidity and low slippage ensure quick, predictable trades, enhancing user experience and driving adoption. Deepening liquidity and reducing slippage are crucial for an efficient financial ecosystem. Below we can see how on the left, a 1,000 ELA order on Chainge has low fees, however, on the right, a 10,000 ELA order has drastic fees of above 15% due to lacking liquidity and high slippage.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/sash__mit">Sasha Mitchell</a> proposes using the remaining 197,152 stablecoin assets from the G20 proposal to match with CRC ELA and add to Chainge’s liquidity pool, which currently holds 18,513 ELA and 41,655 USDC. This will drastically boost cross-chain and banking purchase liquidity, reducing slippage and transaction costs and setting Elastos up for the upcoming fiat on/off ramp service. This increased ELA liquidity will allow stakeholders to move assets between chains and banks more efficiently without high costs. Deep liquidity and low slippage help enable quick, stable, and predictable trades.</p>

<p>The government has quietly ushered in the beginnings of what it hopes will be the answer to people’s experiences of fraud and lack of trust online. Its new digital trust framework has gone live in recent days.</p>



<p>Digital Identity New Zealand Executive Director Colin Wallis spoke to Radio New Zealand this morning, “The intent is that you’ll have a safer digital playing field as a baseline to build other services on top of. It’s just going to take some time for the ripple through where we are now for it to become seismic.”</p>

 A step-by-step guide to our project kickoff with Jobs for the Future and International Rescue Committee  Context <p><a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> (WAO) is kicking off some work this week, collaborating with <a href="https://jff.org">Jobs for the Future</a> (JFF) to assess the Job Readiness Credential provided by the <a href="https://rescue.org">International Rescue Committee</a> (IRC). WAO is managing the project, developing a user research strategy, preparing necessary materials, and conducting interviews with employers, IRC staff, and, if possible, IRC&nbsp;clients.</p><p>Our broad key question relates to how the visual design and metadata contained in a digital badge impact employer perceptions and interactions. We want to help JFF and the IRC have the most impact possible with the Job Readiness Credential because that impact means changing the lives of real&nbsp;people.</p> How we approach this kind of&nbsp;work <p>At the start of any project, it’s important to know the absolute basics. In fact, it’s a good time to get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9pftOJW0uk">Busytown Mysteries theme tune</a> in your head as an earworm! The 5W’s and an H shown above help make sure we know all of the things necessary to set the project up for success. Ideally, we’d know most of this before even signing the contract, but anything missing we can pick up in the client kick-off&nbsp;meeting.</p><p>Before the client kick-off meeting, we have an internal project kick-off where we talk about everything from timelines and responsibilities, to setting up the digital environments in which we’ll do the work. If we need to purchase any new equipment or subscriptions, we’ll identify those in this meeting. Our guidelines for this can be found on the <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/guidelines/project-kickoff">WAO&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p> Communications and&nbsp;cadence Early days of JFF/IRC Trello board. It’s the usual kanban format with the additional of the self-explanatory ‘Feedback Needed’ along with ‘Undead’. The latter is for cards that would otherwise get stuck somewhere but we don’t want to delete/archive just in case they come back to bite&nbsp;us!<p>Getting into the right rhythm with clients is an art rather than a science. While it’s easy to put an hour in the calendar each week for a catch-up call, this is a sub-optimal for anything other than the very short term. This is because, in our experience, these kind of calls quick devolve into status update meetings.</p><p>Much better is to work as openly as possible. Sometimes that means entirely publicly with etherpads, public Trello boards, and the like. Other times, it’s working transparently with tools that provide either real-time or summary updates. Often this means that the number and frequency of meetings can be reduced. With our recent work with the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">DCC</a>, for example, we met every other week, aiming for 45 minutes. Between meetings, we sent Loom videos and other sorts of outputs to make sure our collaborators knew how thinking had&nbsp;evolved.</p><p>While it’s important that there is a project lead from both sides, it’s also crucial that their inboxes do not become information silos. Larger organisations might use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management">CRM systems</a>, but for us information is best in context. So, for example, a Google Doc for ongoing meta-level important info, and everything else on the relevant Trello card (or equivalent).</p><p>Documentation is not putting a message in a Slack channel or mentioning something during a meeting. Documentation is writing something down in an uncontroversial way that makes sense to everybody involved in the project. This is important because humans can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven%2C_Plus_or_Minus_Two">only hold so much information in our heads</a> at one time, and our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory">memories can be&nbsp;faulty</a>.</p> Everything is a work in&nbsp;progress CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>‘Perpetual beta’ is another name for saying that everything is a work in progress. What’s true of software is true of documentation and everything involved in a project. Conclusions are provisional and based on the data and knowledge we had at the&nbsp;time.</p><p>To account for this, we usually version our work, starting at v0.1 rather than 1.0. The reason for this is to show the client (and ourselves) that we’re working towards our first fully-formed opinions and outputs. It’s all part of our attempt to <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/open-course/">work openly</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-business-case-for-working-openly-and-transparently-867e3fb04588">show our&nbsp;work</a>.</p><p>With this work that we are starting with JFF and IRC, we’ll be talking to stakeholders in a couple of different places. Our human brains want to take shortcuts and jump to conclusions quickly so that we can take action. However, we’ve learned to “<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/on-the-strategic-uses-of-ambiguity-c403bff44029">sit in ambiguity</a>” for long enough to allow thoughts and reflections to percolate. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">slower kind of thinking</a> allows us to spot things that might have been missed by our ‘System 1’ mode of&nbsp;thought.</p> Conclusion <p>We’re greatly looking forward to getting started with this work. We haven’t gone into how we perform user research, which is perhaps the topic for a future post. There’s a lot to cover from that point of view in terms of ethics, data, and different kinds of methodologies.</p><p>What we hope that we have shown in this post is our commitment to working openly, holistically, and thoroughly so that the outputs we generate are trusted, interesting, and actionable. We’ll share more on the project as it progresses.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/behind-the-scenes-of-our-new-project-on-job-readiness-credentials-30aa9580ca18">Behind the Scenes of Our New Project on Job Readiness Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

However, I didn't actively participate in the work items. With last year's first did:hack hackathon, my interest spiked due to the discovery of initial ideas that culminated in the Linked Verifiable Presentations specification, and its recent ratification as a DIF Deliverable", JC said.</p><p>"The collaboration and support I received from the working group, and from Markus in particular, inspired me to take on the role of co-chair. </p><p>"The Identifiers &amp; Discovery WG is an invaluable resource for working with and building DIDs. I feel honored to serve as co-chair and I'm looking forward to advancing Decentralized Identifiers with our working group," he added. </p><p>“JC has shown tremendous leadership in the decentralized identity community, including through his work on Linked Verifiable Presentations, a recently ratified DIF specification, and DID Traits.

<p>Running a Ceramic node in a production environment involves several key components. This article aims to provide an overview of the necessary resources and cost estimates for deploying a Ceramic node in the cloud. While we only showcased two specific providers for the services required (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DigitalOcean</a> and <a href="https://www.quicknode.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">QuickNode</a>), we hope these cost examples given the hypothetical scenarios we walk through will help give you a general idea of cost.</p> Components Required for a Ceramic Node <p>There are several sub-services to consider when running a Ceramic node in production, each serving different functions. As such, you will need:</p> 1. Resources for JS-Ceramic   Functionality: Tracks and stores the latest tips for pinned streams, caches stream state, provides the HTTP API service for connected clients to read, and communicates with the Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) for blockchain anchoring and timestamping.   2. Resources for Ceramic-One   Functionality: These nodes store the actual data and coordinate with network participants.   3. Resources for Postgres Database   Functionality: Required for indexing data.   4. Ethereum RPC Node API Access   Functionality: Required to validate CAS anchors.   5. Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) Access   Current Status: Anchors Ceramic protocol proofs to the blockchain. This service is currently funded by 3box Labs, however, eventually, this function will be provided by node operators and with some expected cost.   Baseline Recommended Resources <p>Given the services you’ll need above, the Ceramic team has tested and organized a set of “baseline” configuration settings we recommend when setting up your node. However, seeing as these are baseline, or average, you may need to increase resourcing accordingly based on your actual usage:</p> JS-Ceramic   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for state   Ceramic-One   4 vCPU  4 GB memory  100 GB disk for storage   Postgres Database   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for indexing   High Traffic Recommended Resources <p>Given the services you’ll need above, the Ceramic team has tested and organized a set of “High Traffic” configuration settings we recommend when setting up your node. However, seeing as these are baseline, or average, you may need to increase resourcing accordingly based on your actual usage:</p> JS-Ceramic   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for state  10,000 IOPs     Ceramic-One   6 vCPU  8 GB memory  500 GB disk for storage  15,000 IOPs     Postgres Database   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for indexing   High Availability Configuration <p>For high availability, an additional node can be configured to sync data and handle dynamic read/write tasks, thus doubling the cost of a single-node setup.</p> Ethereum RPC Node Endpoint Costs <p>We’ve also chosen QuickNode to provide several RPC cost examples :</p>  QuickNode Base Plan: $10/month (100 million API credits, 2 endpoints, 550 credits/second)  QuickNode Middle Plan: $49/month (500 million API credits, 10 endpoints, 2,500 credits/second)  QuickNode Premium Plan: $299/month (3 billion API credits, 20 endpoints, 6,000 credits/second)   Hypothetical Scenarios and Cost Estimates <p>Let’s walk through three hypothetical need scenarios and use these to help estimate our cost structure:</p> Application A: Small User Base   User Base: 10,000 monthly active users  Query Behavior: 30% writes, 70% reads  Availability: Low-priority  Configuration: Baseline resources  Cost Estimate:  Node: $96/month  Ethereum RPC: $10/month  Total: $106/month     Application B: Write-Heavy Mid-Sized Application   User Base: 100,000-500,000 monthly active users  Query Behavior: 70% writes, 30% reads  Availability: High priority (2-node setup)  Configuration: High Traffic  Cost Estimate:  Nodes (2x): $918/month (2x $459)  Ethereum RPC: $49/month  Total: $967/month    <p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator?hl=en&amp;dl=CiRjN2M2MzI1My0xYTQ1LTQ1N2YtOTc2MS04NjlkNzg1YjQ4YjYQCBokRjhGNDYwNjgtRTFBMC00M0MxLTgzMDAtRTRBNDFGQUFGQkVC&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Example GCP budget</a></p> Other Considerations <p>Additional cloud costs must be considered for networking - these costs will vary based on traffic patterns. Most cloud providers offer free traffic ingress to the nodes but will charge for egress, or data leaving the nodes.</p><p>Running a Ceramic node in production involves various components and resources, each contributing to the overall cost. By understanding the necessary configurations and associated costs, developers can make informed decisions tailored to their application's needs and user base. High availability setups and resource over-provisioning can significantly impact costs, especially for mid-sized applications with high traffic and write volumes.</p>

 <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/members/anon/new.html?destination=%2Findex.html">Open Identity Exchange (OIX)</a> and <a href="https://diacc.ca">DIACC</a> commit to finding alignment for global policies on digital trust and verification. 



<p>UK, June 2024 – The global non-profit <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/members/anon/new.html?destination=%2Findex.html">Open Identity Exchange (OIX)</a> and the Canadian non-profit <a href="https://diacc.ca/">Digital ID Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC)</a> have committed to working together to advance global digital interoperability – a crucial element for trusted, successful international trade in a rapidly advancing digital global economy.</p>



<p>OIX is an influential global community for all those involved in the ID sector to connect and collaborate, developing the thought leadership and guidance needed to enable interoperable, trusted identities carried seamlessly from place to place in ‘roaming wallets’ for everyone. DIACC is an equally influential community of public and private sector leaders committed securing inclusive digital economy benefits by promoting user-centric design principles and verifying private sector services against the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) to support a secure ecosystem of services to enable user-directed information verification between public and private sector data authorities.</p>



<p>The two organisations will explore how different country-based policies related to identity management, verification, security, data privacy innovation and approaches to digital identity assurance can be compared and analysed so that more rapid progress can be made towards global digital ID interoperability through alignment of policy or acceptance of policy differences.</p>



<p>The collaboration will focus on advancing methods for participants in one framework to accept identity verification and digital credentials verified through another trust framework based on a mixture of policy acceptance and technology adaption. DIACC and OIX will explore equivalency and interoperability processes, identify potential alignments, new standards required, and gaps that may need to be addressed, and highlight use cases that can be facilitated through interoperability across digital ecosystems. Within this work, they will explore methods to describe common features of jurisdictional and sectoral trust frameworks, and share insights widely available as a resource.</p>



<p>The exchange and transfer of knowledge and expertise will be at the heart of this collaboration. OIX and DIACC will work together to create ‘intellectual capital’ to shape debate and bring about actions, moving identity management, data privacy, and security forward at pace.</p>



<p>Nick Mothershaw, Chief Identity Strategist at OIX, said: “The benefits of the digital global economy will be vast, but there is still some way to go before everyone can confidently access them. Our collaboration with DIACC will play a critical role. The fantastic progress DIACC has already made across Canada is an exemplar for global interoperability and will provide much needed insight, tools and guidance to pave a much clearer way forward globally.</p>



<p>“Our plans are to share our work with other trust frameworks across the globe, by publishing the criteria and values, and in the short-term creating an interim tool for trust frameworks to use for policy areas. We also want to secure their input on what they want to see in Trust Framework Comparison tool, as well as to start demonstrating how a roaming wallet will work.”</p>



<p>Joni Brennan, DIACC President, said: “We’re thrilled to collaborate with the Open Identity Exchange. The formalization of our liaison demonstrates progress in supporting our shared values to advance secure, user-centric digital identity solutions globally. Our collaboration will leverage each organization’s expertise to explore opportunities to foster innovation, enhance interoperability, and build public trust in digital services by identifying the alignments and gaps between jurisdictional and sectoral trust frameworks.”</p>

<p>Driving data interconnectivity, interoperability, and integrity, the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), now in its 6th iteration, delivers significant advancements that have benefited world-class organizations and shaped standards for industrial information exchange. Through partnerships with entities such as the British Standards Institution¹²³, GS1⁴⁵, European Blockchain Sandbox⁶, and various government-funded initiatives, the DKG has also played a crucial role in informing public policies.</p><p>DKG uniquely and effectively addresses the challenges of data ownership, AI hallucinations, and bias⁷ with the Decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG)⁸ framework. dRAG drives a vast advancement of the RAG model initially developed by Meta⁹, by organizing external sources in a DKG while introducing incentives to grow a global, crowdsourced network of knowledge made available for AI models to&nbsp;use.</p><p>The DKG V8 has through a prototype demonstrated an unprecedented scale at which the Verifiable Internet for AI can drive value for anyone, on any device, and any chain. Addressing sensitive data concerns, scalability, and AI challenges concurrently has brought encouraging results that importantly shape the expected V8 release timeline.</p> DKG V8 — for Anyone, on Any Device, on Any Chain at Internet&nbsp;Scale <p>OriginTrail DKG has been battle-tested in real-world applications increasingly used by an ecosystem of organizations and government-supported initiatives. To date, no decentralized system has scaled in the production environment the way V6 DKG has. However, the current capacity of DKG reached its limits to support the growing usage requirements, prompting a transition to the V8, evolved to tackle the scale at which AI is consumed in any environment.</p><p>Data has been growing exponentially for decades, with AI driving further growth acceleration — according to the latest estimates, 402.74 million terabytes of data are created each day¹⁰. This trend is increasingly visible in the rising demands for additional capacity in the DKG, driven by data-intensive industry deployments in aerospace, manufacturing, railways, consumer goods, and construction driving DKG&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Version 8 of the DKG has therefore been designed with major scalability improvements at multiple levels, with a prototyped implementation tested in collaboration with partners from the sectors mentioned above.</p> 3 key products of OriginTrail DKG&nbsp;V8 <p>The major advancement that DKG V8 is making is in expanding the OriginTrail ecosystem’s product suite to 3 key products:</p>  DKG Core Node V8 — highly scalable network nodes forming network core, persisting the public replicated DKG  DKG Edge Node V8 — user-friendly node applications tailored to edge devices (phones, laptops,&nbsp;etc).  ChatDKG V8 — the launchpad for creating AI solutions using decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG).   DKG Edge Node — enabling the largest, internet-scale decentralized physical infrastructure network&nbsp;(DePIN) <p>The newcomer in the product suite is the DKG Edge Node — a new type of DKG node enabling the OriginTrail ecosystem to tackle the global challenges described above. As the name suggests, DKG edge nodes can operate on Internet edge devices. Devices such as personal computers, mobile phones, wearables, IoT devices, but also enterprise and government systems are where we can find huge volumes of very important data activity that DKG edge nodes will enable to enter the AI age in a safe and privacy-preserving way. The DKG edge node will enable such sensitive data to remain protected on the device, giving owners full control over how their data is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Together with being protected on the device, edge-node data becomes a part of the global DKG with precise access management permissions controlled by the data owner. In this way, AI applications that the owner allows data access to will be able to use it together with the public data in the DKG via decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG).</p><p>Since such AI applications can equally be run locally on devices directly, this enables fully privacy-preserving AI solutions aimed at the ever-growing number of devices on the network edge that can at the same time use both public and private DKG data. The introduction of the DKG edge node enables the DKG to quickly expand to be the largest, internet-scale decentralized physical infrastructure network&nbsp;(DePIN).</p> New features of the DKG Edge&nbsp;Node <p>To unlock these powerful capabilities, DKG edge node will include new features that have previously not been available on DKG nodes but were elements of other proprietary or open-source products.</p>  To enable a seamless creation of knowledge, DKG nodes will inherit the proven knowledge publishing pipelines from the Network Operating System&nbsp;(nOS).  The data protection techniques for private and sensitive data will be based on the NGI-funded OpenPKG project outcomes.  The DKG Node will support all major standards such as GS1 Digital Link, EPCIS, Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identities.  To support the growing field of knowledge graph implementations globally, it will enable seamless knowledge graph integrations of major knowledge graph providers such as Ontotext, Oracle, Snowflake, Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, and&nbsp;others.  <p>DKG Edge Node V8 Prototype — Oura Ring integration with demonstrated 400 Knowledge Assets published in 10&nbsp;seconds</p> DKG V8&nbsp;Timeline <p>The V8 DKG launch sequence consists of 4 stages, aligned with the wider OriginTrail ecosystem roadmap, with a forkless upgrade to&nbsp;V8.</p><p>Stage 1: V8 multi-chain infrastructure deployment</p>  Paranet deployment and first IPOs&nbsp;launched  Base blockchain integration  Cross-chain knowledge mining&nbsp;support  <p>Stage 2: DKG core internet-scale V8 testnet&nbsp;launch</p>  Asynchronous backing  Knowledge assets V2: Batch minting (in prototype)  DKG Core: Random sampling (in prototype)  <p>Stage 3: DKG edge nodes on V8&nbsp;testnet</p>  Edge node beta&nbsp;launch  Knowledge assets V2: Batch minting &amp; native vector&nbsp;support  DKG Core: Random sampling deployment  <p>Stage 4: V8 mainnet upgrade deployment (October&nbsp;2024)</p> To stay on trac(k) with updates on DKG V8 as it nears the deployment phase, make sure to join our <a href="https://t.me/origintrail">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/QctFuPCMew">Discord</a> channels! <p>¹<a href="https://v1.bsigroup.com/en-GB/insights-and-media/media-centre/press-releases/2023/july/new-solution-developed-for-cross-border-food-transfers/">https://v1.bsigroup.com/en-GB/insights-and-media/media-centre/press-releases/2023/july/new-solution-developed-for-cross-border-food-transfers/</a></p><p>²<a href="https://page.bsigroup.com/BSI-Academy-Blockchain-Solution">https://page.bsigroup.com/BSI-Academy-Blockchain-Solution</a></p><p>³<a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/globalassets/localfiles/en-th/innovation/blockchain-white-paper-th.pdf">https://www.bsigroup.com/globalassets/localfiles/en-th/innovation/blockchain-white-paper-th.pdf</a></p><p>⁴<a href="https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/bridgingblockchains.pdf">https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/bridgingblockchains.pdf</a></p><p>⁵<a href="https://www.gs1si.org/novice/novica/origintrail-resuje-izziv-ponarejenega-viskija">https://www.gs1si.org/novice/novica/origintrail-resuje-izziv-ponarejenega-viskija</a></p><p>⁶<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EBSISANDCOLLAB/European+Blockchain+Sandbox+announces+the+selected+projects+for+the+second+cohort">https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EBSISANDCOLLAB/European+Blockchain+Sandbox+announces+the+selected+projects+for+the+second+cohort</a></p><p>⁷<a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf">https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf</a></p><p>⁸<a href="https://origintrail.io/blog/decentralized-rag-with-origintrail-dkg-and-nvidia-build-ecosystem">https://origintrail.io/blog/decentralized-rag-with-origintrail-dkg-and-nvidia-build-ecosystem</a></p><p>⁹<a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/">https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/dkg-v8-scaling-verifiable-internet-for-ai-to-any-device-for-anyone-on-any-chain-37b9049d2e6e">DKG V8: Scaling Verifiable Internet for AI to Any Device, for Anyone, on Any Chain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>OASIS and the OASIS Topology and Orchestration. Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) TC are pleased to announce that TOSCA Version 2.0 is now available for public review and comment. This 30-day review is the third public review for this specification.</p>



<p>About the specification draft:</p>



<p>The Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) provides a language for describing application components and their relationships by means of a service topology, and for specifying the lifecycle management procedures for creation or modification of services using orchestration processes. The combination of topology and orchestration enables not only the automation of deployment but also the automation of the complete service lifecycle management. The TOSCA specification promotes a model-driven approach, whereby information embedded in the model structure (the dependencies, connections, compositions) drives the automated processes.</p>

<p>The digital realm has long struggled with the vulnerabilities inherent in password-based authentication systems. With iOS 18 launching in September, Apple introduces a groundbreaking API for developers to implement passkeys, transforming how users secure their online accounts. This innovation is set to create a password-less future, significantly enhancing user data protection.</p>



 What Are Passkeys? 



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> are a sophisticated, passwordless login option for apps and websites developed by the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO Alliance</a>. They consist of a “private key” stored on the user’s device and a “public key” residing with the service. This dual-key system undergoes an encrypted verification process, ensuring that access is granted only when the user’s biometrics or device PIN confirm their identity. This system effectively eliminates the need for passwords and multi-factor authentication codes, creating a seamless and secure user experience.</p>



 The Benefits of Passkeys 



<p>Traditional logins rely on passwords, which users often reuse across multiple sites, posing substantial security risks. Passkeys, however, are tied to the user’s unique device and biometric data, rendering them immune to phishing and brute-force attacks. If a passkey is stolen, it becomes useless without the rightful owner’s biometric verification. This intrinsic link between the user and the device significantly mitigates the threat landscape.</p>



 Banks and Passkey Adoption 



<p>While the advantages of passkeys are clear, some industries have been slow to adopt, including banks. Andrew Shikiar, CEO and Executive Director of the FIDO Alliance, explains, “Banks and financial institutions operate in a highly regulated industry, so they are vigilant when it comes to ensuring that user authentication complies with relevant regulations. Synced passkeys introduce a new customer assurance model that compliance leads within banks are still adjusting to.”</p>



<p>However, Shikiar noted that “we are now seeing regulatory and other government bodies begin to give formal guidance on how industry should contemplate passkeys,” including an April 2024 <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/giving-nist-digital-identity-guidelines-boost-supplement-incorporating">missive</a> from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offering guidance about implementation.</p>



<p>But Shikiar says that “banks are hypersensitive to customer experience,” too, and thus more cautious about changing how customers log in—even if passkeys are quicker and more secure. New login methods require educating customers—and that takes time.</p>



<p>Despite these bottlenecks, Shikiar says that banks are slowly moving away from strictly password-based logins because they “inherently understand that using a passkey as a primary factor is far superior to a password.”</p>



 The Collaborative Future of Passwordless Authentication 



<p>Apple’s implementation of passkeys underlines a collective effort by tech giants within the FIDO Alliance, including Microsoft and Google, to enhance internet security. The Alliance has pioneered developments in authentication standards, striving to eliminate the vulnerabilities of password-based systems. Users can visit the FIDO Alliance to learn more about the ongoing efforts and advancements in passkey technology and the latest in <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/implement-passkeys-overview/">passkey implementation</a>.</p>



<p>As passkeys gain traction, the internet moves closer to a future where security does not come at the expense of user convenience. The collaborative efforts of industry leaders within the FIDO Alliance signal a transformative shift towards more secure, passwordless authentication methods, promising a safer digital experience for all.</p>

<p>Picture this: you’re not just in the game, you’re leading it, crafting the very rules that define success. This is the golden opportunity that unfolds when you, as a tech innovator, dive headfirst into the realm of establishing open standards.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about the magnetic pull of influence and the domineering stature in the tech world. Engaging actively in setting open standards is not just about putting your name out there. It’s about embedding your products, your technologies, and your visionary outlook into the very fabric of the industry’s future. You’re not just aiming to lead; you’re set to redefine leadership. Why settle for just competing when you can be the one crafting the arena? It’s about creating a scenario where your competition isn’t just trying to catch up; they’re scrambling to decode your rulebook.</p>



<p>You’re a tech innovator armed with resilience, foresight, and an unmatched zest for breakthroughs. It’s not about facing challenges; it’s about embracing them, dissecting them, and transforming them into stepping stones towards your ultimate victory. Envision a future where your influence reverberates across markets, shaping demands, dictating trends, and steering the technological evolution. Your efforts in spearheading open standards not only catapult your products and strategies to the forefront but also enshrine your status as an indomitable leader and a relentless innovator.</p>



<p>But here’s the deal – it demands more than just ingenuity and expertise. It calls for an unyielding spirit, an insatiable appetite for excellence, and an unwavering commitment to surpass the benchmarks you’ve set yourself. It’s a call to arms for those ready to lead, innovate, and inspire. Let’s not just participate in the evolution of technology. Let’s lead it. Together, we can redefine the boundaries, push the limits, and craft a legacy that echoes through the annals of tech history. The path to unparalleled success and influence is before you. The question is, are you ready to seize it?</p>



<p>Remember, in the grand chessboard of technological advancement, it’s not about the pieces you start with, but how you decide to play them. Write the rules, win the game. Let’s make history. <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/join-2/">Join us</a> at OASIS Open!</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that the BeL2 Loan Demo App has been updated to version 0.3, available at <a href="https://lending.bel2.org/">https://lending.bel2.org/</a>. This update brings significant enhancements and new features to improve the user experience and functionality of the app. Here’s a detailed look at what’s new:</p>
 
 Added support for Taproot addresses 
 Added the ability to manually request ZKP proofs 
 Added support for USDC in addition to USDT 
 Additional repayment/proof information in order details 
 Implemented additional arbitration request use cases 
 Fixed expired order use cases 
 Other minor bug fixes 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Technical Update Insights 
 
 Added Support for Taproot Addresses 
<p>Integrating <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-taproot-upgrade-5210039">Taproot</a> addresses ensures compatibility with the latest Bitcoin advancements, enhancing privacy and scalability. Implemented in November 2021, Taproot makes all transaction outputs look the same, improving privacy whether for simple payments or complex smart contracts. It also boosts efficiency and reduces fees. Supporting Taproot allows our app users to benefit from these enhancements, enabling more discreet and cost-effective transactions. This aligns with our commitment to providing a secure and efficient platform, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
 
 Added Ability to Manually Request ZKP Proofs 
<p>Allowing users to manually request <a href="https://chain.link/education/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp">Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</a> enhances control and flexibility, enabling them to generate proofs as needed. ZKPs are cryptographic methods that verify a statement’s truth without revealing any additional information. In BeL2, ZKPs ensure transaction privacy and security without exposing underlying data. Previously, ZKP generation was automatic, which might not have suited all users. Now, users can decide when to generate ZKPs, providing greater autonomy and control over their transactions and improving the overall user experience.</p>
 
 Added Support for USDC in Addition to USDT 
<p>Supporting USDC alongside USDT provides users with more stablecoin options, enhancing liquidity and flexibility within the app. USDC is known for its regulatory compliance and widespread acceptance, making it a valuable addition to our platform. As a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, USDC maintains a stable value, attracting users who seek to avoid cryptocurrency volatility. Integrating USDC, widely supported in decentralised applications (dApps) on the <a href="https://esc.elastos.io/">Elastos Smart Chain</a>, such as <a href="https://glidefinance.io/">Glide</a> and <a href="https://ela.city/">Elacity</a>, offers more financial activity options and leverages existing liquidity, making transactions more seamless and efficient.</p>
 
 Additional Repayment/Proofs Information in Order Details 
<p>Providing detailed repayment and proof information in order details enhances transparency and user trust. It allows users to clearly understand their transactions, repayments, and associated proofs, essential for effectively managing financial activities. This update adds comprehensive data on repayment schedules and proof generation directly within the order details. Users can now see all necessary information in one place, making it easier to track and manage loans. This transparency is crucial for building trust in decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, ensuring users have all the information they need to make informed decisions.</p>
 
 Implemented Additional Arbitration Request Use Cases 
<p>Enhancing the arbitration process is critical for ensuring fair and efficient dispute resolution within the platform. By implementing additional use cases for arbitration requests, we aim to provide a more robust mechanism for handling disputes, and maintaining user trust and satisfaction. Arbitration in <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-new-bretton-woods-system/">BeL2</a> resolves disputes between parties in a decentralised manner, using ELA collateralised nodes, ensuring fairness without relying on centralised authorities. The new use cases expand the scenarios for arbitration, making the process more comprehensive and adaptable, reinforcing the platform’s reliability and fairness.</p>
 
 Fixed Order Expired Use Cases 
<p>Addressing issues related to order expiration is vital for ensuring smooth and reliable transaction processes. Fixing these use cases improves the overall user experience by preventing disruptions caused by expired orders. Order expiration issues occur when a transaction is not completed within a specified timeframe, leading to complications or the need for manual intervention. By fixing these issues, we enhance the predictability and reliability of the platform. This ensures that orders are processed as expected, reducing the likelihood of unexpected expirations and associated complications. These improvements help maintain a seamless transaction flow, enhancing user satisfaction.</p>
 
 Other More Minor Bug Fixes 
<p>Continuous improvement through minor bug fixes is essential for maintaining the stability and performance of the platform. These fixes address small issues that, collectively, can significantly impact the user experience. Minor bug fixes involve resolving smaller issues that may not be immediately noticeable but contribute to the overall functionality and stability of the app. By regularly addressing and fixing minor bugs, we ensure that the app runs smoothly and efficiently, providing users with a reliable and enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>These updates mark a significant step forward in our mission to provide a secure, flexible, and user-friendly platform for decentralised finance built on Bitcoin. By continuously enhancing the BeL2 <a href="https://lending.bel2.org/">Loan Demo App</a>, we aim to offer the best possible experience for our users, ensuring that they can leverage the full potential of their Bitcoin holdings in a secure and decentralised manner. Stay tuned for more updates and innovations as we continue to develop and expand the capabilities of the BeL2 ecosystem. Excited to learn more? Head over to the BeL2 <a href="http://www.bel2.org/">website</a>&nbsp;and follow&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ElastosInfo">Infinity</a>&nbsp;for the latest updates!</p>

<p>The OpenID SSWG <a href="https://openid.net/three-shared-signals-drafts/">has released three new drafts</a> for review by the OpenID Foundation membership. We would like to describe the salient features of these drafts here. At the end of the 45-day review period, members can vote on adopting these drafts as implementer’s drafts.</p>
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-03.html">Shared Signals Framework – Draft 03</a> 
<p>After the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0.html">Shared Signals Framework Implementer’s Draft 02</a> was released, the OpenID Foundation contracted with the University of Stuttgart for performing a formal security review of the draft specification. The good news is that the findings from the <a href="https://github.com/openid/sharedsignals/files/15014966/2024-04-09_WP4.1a-Report.pdf">preliminary report</a> were minor, but the bad news is that addressing them required changes to the normative language in the draft. As a result, the SSWG decided to create a Draft 03, which would need to go through the OpenID review process in order to be adopted as a successor Implementer’s Draft. Because we had to do this change, we decided to update some other aspects of the framework, which are backwards compatible (i.e., anything that implements draft 02 will still be draft 03 compliant). The salient features added in this draft and the issues fixed in this draft are listed below:</p>
 Security issues addressed 
 
 <a href="https://github.com/openid/sharedsignals/issues/162">Issuer Mix Up</a>: Draft-02 did not specify that a receiver must validate the issuer value in incoming events and API responses from the transmitter. This language has now been updated to specify that receivers must validate the iss value in events and API responses they receive from a transmitter. 
 <a href="https://github.com/openid/sharedsignals/issues/161">Stream Audience Mix Up</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openid/sharedsignals/issues/160">Attacker Stream Subject Insertion</a>: Draft-02 did not specify that a transmitter must authenticate a receiver, which we have remedied in draft-03. The new language in draft-03 also requires that transmitters use TLS and recommends that receivers verify the trusted source of the transmitter URL and use HTTPS. 
 
 New features added 
 
 Use of txn claim: Draft-03 now clarifies how to use the JWT txn claim in order to prevent cascading cyclic chains of SSF events caused by the same underlying event. By verifying that the txn claim in a newly received SSF event is the same as a previously received SSF event, the receiver can ignore subsequent events it receives. The txn claim can also be used for reconciliation or auditing purposes between a transmitter and receiver as part of “closing the loop” on security events and actions. 
 SSF transmitters can now specify in their metadata whether streams they create have no subjects in them, or “all appropriate subjects” automatically added in them, immediately after the stream has been created. 
 
 Clarifications and Bug fixes 
<p>A number of minor bugs, mostly involving non-normative language such as examples, have been fixed in this draft. Some new examples have been added and existing examples have been updated to match formats that have changed since those examples were first introduced.</p>
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-03.html">CAEP Draft 03</a> 
<p>The Continuous Access Evaluation Profile now has a new draft for review. The main update in this draft is the introduction of two new CAEP events: “Session Established” and “Session Presented”. These events can help in the following ways:</p>
<p>Session Established:</p>
 
 Notify completion of a federated identity initiated SSO 
 Indicate to a monitoring service that a user has established a new session with a particular application 
 Optionally bind a session to a specific device or other context so that it is easier to detect session hijacking 
 
<p>Session Presented:</p>
 
 Helps a monitoring service detect user presence at a specific application 
 Helps detect impossible travel across applications 
 Helps detect changes in environmental properties, such as IP-address changes. 
 
<p>Together these two events can help effectively monitor an organization’s cloud services for identity threats.</p>
<p>In addition to these new events, the draft has been updated to reflect the new formats and fields in all examples to match the latest SSF draft.</p>
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-interoperability-profile-1_0-00.html">CAEP Interoperability Specification</a> 
<p>In March 2023, the OpenID Foundation conducted an interoperability event hosted at the Gartner IAM Summit in London. The results of that interoperability event are documented as a part of this <a href="https://4sg.nl/aqvw1l">blog post</a>. At that time, the implementers established interoperability of the actual events being exchanged. The SSWG had already begun work on an interoperability profile that would specify more than just the event formats to be supported. So now we are pleased to announce the first version of this interoperability profile, which specifies:</p>
 
 Spec versions that must be supported by transmitters 
 API endpoints that must be supported by transmitters 
 Authorization schemes that must be supported by transmitters 
 Stream control features that must be supported by transmitters 
 AddSubject behavior of transmitters 
 Subject formats supported by transmitters and receivers 
 Signature formats supported by transmitters and receivers 
 Details of OAuth options that must be supported by transmitters and receivers 
 Event types that must be supported by transmitters and receivers 
 
<p>We invite the general public and members of the OpenID Foundation to review the specifications that are available here. Feedback may be provided by <a href="https://github.com/openid/sharedsignals/issues">opening an issue in the Shared Signals GitHub repository</a>.</p>

 Solidarity, common ground, and intersectionality in the climate&nbsp;movement <p>This post looks at ways we can channel our activist energy in ways that address multiple issues and find belonging in adjacent communities.</p><p>Recently at a week long event that brought together energy transition activists from around the Mediterranean, I was pleased to meet a variety of people with intersectional understandings of the climate crisis. Together, we explored what intersectionality looks like in the climate movement and how we can tell stories that lead to&nbsp;action.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers Expanding our activist&nbsp;energies <p>Although many of us care about a variety of struggles, we don’t have the time or the energy to get involved in every single thing. We focus our energies, we have to. The problem, of course, is that each issue and cause needs the visibility a group of activists coming together can provide. So how can we focus ourselves and find energy to do&nbsp;more?</p><p>For just a couple hours last week, I worked with a small group of rabble rousers to create campaign ideas for the challenge:</p><blockquote>The intersection and complexities of our structural problems makes people feel powerless.</blockquote><p>The structural problems we are facing are complex and co-exist within a matrix of other challenges. We are dealing with environmental crisis, racist societies, and social inequalities left, right, and centre. No matter how positive your personality may be, it’s hard to stay optimistic. No matter how cognisant you are about other struggles, it’s hard to pay attention to everything.</p><p>When we are overwhelmed and feeling powerless, we tend to recede. Our group had the insight that feeling overwhelmed or powerless is lonely. Loneliness is a cascading psychological phenomena that halts action and feeds&nbsp;despair.</p><p>We started to think about how we might address loneliness in activist movements by telling stories that help people who feel like they belong to one group (e.g. environmentalists) to understand their connection to other&nbsp;groups.</p><p>Our theory of change is that finding belonging amongst your activist friends can provide you with solidarity and a source of energy. We wanted to push for intersectionality in the climate movement.</p>Intersections in audiences, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/audience-ikigai-be0cebe4cea">the Audience Ikigai</a>, cc-by&nbsp;WAO Choose three: intersectionality in&nbsp;practice <p>Everybody cares about something, whether that be sports, the environment, or even status. If you can identify one thing you care about, you can surely identify three others. Using arbitrary design constraints, like “choosing three” is a good way to move any idea forward, including ideas around your own activism or civic participation.</p><p>We know that climate change disproportionately affects already marginalised communities, which can exacerbate existing social inequalities. With this in mind, we choose to look at the intersectionality of climate with three human rights&nbsp;issues:</p>  Refugee and migrant&nbsp;justice  Women’s rights  LGBTQIA+ rights  <p>Easy, right? Choosing three issues to put your energy into is a lot less than “everything”. Three is also enough to give variability and provide access to different communities. Different communities come with different energies and that is something you can tap into when&nbsp;needed.</p>We often consider the thematic intersections of our own work. See how we work in the overlaps together with thoughtful, ethical organisations in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/practical-utopias-and-rewilding-work-27c148d95b16">Practical utopias and rewilding work</a>. Find connections and leverage&nbsp;points <p>Intersectionality is about understanding the points of interconnection between two issues. Seeing the overlaps means that you can connect issues together in new and novel ways. Novelty is just one storytelling tactic in calling attention to a particular issue. Once you’ve determined places to focus, you can further narrow your focus by looking for leverage points that lead to connection.</p>  Refugee and migrant justice — From climate-induced displacement to the fact that people who are forced to migrate whatever the reasons can face challenges in accessing their basic rights, refugee and migrant justice <a href="https://www.climate-refugees.org/why">ties heavily</a> to other environmental and human rights&nbsp;issues.  Women’s rights — Women’s societal roles as caregivers and food producers make them more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It’s now widely understood that <a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-02-24/educating-girls-is-more-effective-in-the-climate-emergency-than-many-green-technologies">educating girls is a catalyst</a> towards climate&nbsp;action.  LGBTQIA+ rights — Again, marginalised communities are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis. <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/60078/impact-climate-crisis-lgbtqia2s-pride-month/">LGBTQIA+ are often </a>members of other marginalised communities, such as racial minorities, and they are more likely to live in&nbsp;poverty.  <p>Human rights and environmental justice are big and complex areas of focus. Thinking about how the complexities of these issues overlap can help narrow down the impact you want to&nbsp;have.</p>cc-by Iris Maertens with <a href="https://www.dancing-fox.com/">Dancing&nbsp;Fox</a> Have some&nbsp;fun <p>Yes, structural problems are serious and complicated. It is essential to be aware of both your own privileges (whatever they may be) and to think deeply about the issues and communities you are working with and within. It’s also important to know that joy is a common emotional human experience. Inciting joy is a way to truly help people. It can help build psychological characteristics that help people deal with whatever life has to throw at them. Joy can also open people up to a better tomorrow.</p><p>At the event I attended last week, as we thought about the intersectionality of environmentalism with human rights, we thought about how we might be able to inspire people to be joyfully curious to learning more about an issue they might not have much involvement with.</p><p>We developed a few posters, designed to be displayed on a metro, to inspire this curiosity.</p>Our poster ideas, drawn by the incredible <a href="https://www.dancing-fox.com/">Iris&nbsp;Maertens</a> Solidarity with&nbsp;others <p>The complexity of our global problems can be overwhelming, but we cannot solve one complex issue without tackling the intertwining structural issues. Finding ways to relate what you care about to what others care about is a way to build solidarity and, therefore, momentum. It’s not always easy, but the more you can participate in cross-cutting social and environmental communities, the bigger our collective power&nbsp;becomes.</p><p>I worked with inspiring people from these organisations:</p>  “<a href="https://www.casafuturs.org">La Casa dels Futurs</a> is both an ongoing project dedicated to supporting intersectional organizing between social and ecological movements, and a campaign to create a permanent Climate Justice Center and Movement&nbsp;School…”  “<a href="https://www.rinascimentogreen.it/">Rinascimento Green</a>…aims to bring together various pieces of civil society to promote, through a path of popular participation, a bottom-up Green&nbsp;Deal.”  “<a href="https://wesmellgas.org/">WeSmellGas</a> is a collective of organisers, researchers and film-makers based in Northern Europe. Climate justice can only be realised by dismantling capitalism and the imperial processes that reinforce it, including our current extractivist energy&nbsp;system.”  <p>🔥 Do you need help with storytelling and advocacy?

<p>The OpenID Foundation is proud to announce that, for the work building the “OpenID for Verifiable Credentials” family of specifications, members of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/">Digital Credentials Protocol (DCP) Work Group</a> won the “Future Technologies and Standards” award at the European Identity and Cloud Conference.</p>
<p>For the last several years, this group has been working tirelessly to develop scalable OpenID specifications attuned to Issuer-Holder-Verifier use cases. This family of specifications enable both the issuance and presentation of digital credentials – regardless of their format – and pseudonymous authentication. The net result of their work will be that end-users gain control, privacy, and portability over their identity information. And their constant, simultaneous focus on verifiers underpins a solid path to adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more by listening to WG Chair, Kristina Yasuda, speak about how Digital Identity Wallets can “cross the chasm” to widespread adoption during her <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-mainstream-eic24">EIC Keynote</a>.</p>
<p>This award recognizes the impact that the WG has already had on the market (learn more on their <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/">landing page</a>):</p>
 
 The <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-architecture-and-reference-framework-outline">European Architecture and Reference Framework</a> lists several of their specs as required for certain use cases 
 3 draft ISO standards reference DCP specifications 
 18 wallets in the European Commission&nbsp; EBSI project support them 
 NIST plans to implement <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/mdl-project-description-draft.pdf">reference implementations</a> of OID4VP to present mdocs/MDL 
 
<p>To further support and enable OID4VC implementers, the Work Group has been engaging closely with the OpenID Certification team to develop tests that will ensure that deployments are interoperable and secure. There are already draft tests for Verifiable Presentations being trialed by a number wallets and the Foundation is working with NIST and other partners for more. So stay tuned!</p>
<p>Thank you so much to the DCP WG for their efforts, their commitment to the work of the Foundation, and their advocacy for the users at the heart of this family of standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congratulations to Kristina Yasuda, Torsten Lodderstedt, Joseph Heenan, Tobias Looker, Oliver Terbu, Paul Bastian, John Bradley, Mike Jones, Fabian Hauck, Jan Vereecken, Nat Sakimura, Gail Hodges, Daniel Fett, Brian Campbell, Christian Bormann, and all others who have participated in and progressed this work.</p>
 About the OpenID Foundation 
 The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate.

<p>Credential Schemas launches<br>
<br>
The Credential Schemas work item is up and running following a successful kick-off meeting earlier this month.</p>
<p>“There was strong attendance and great energy. We had participants with deep experience in schema development and KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance, as well as newcomers to decentralized identity. We are currently focused on establishing the scope and use cases,” said DIF’s Executive Director, Kim Hamilton Duffy.</p>
<p>“It’s not too late to participate. We’re looking to involve a broad range of expertise, including people familiar with KYC reusable ID use cases, such as compliance experts.” she added.</p>
<p>The work item meets every other Tuesday at 10:00 PST / 13:00 EST / 19:00 CET, with the next meeting scheduled for Tuesday 2 July.</p>

<p>Linked Verifiable Presentations<br>
 Photo by FlyD on Unsplash</p>
<p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/linked-vp/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Linked Verifiable Presentations</a> specification has been approved.</p>
<p>The spec defines how to share, discover and retrieve Verifiable Credentials publicly via a service entry in a DID Document. It complements existing technologies for sharing VCs privately, like DIDComm messaging and OID4VC. Use cases enabled by Linked VPs include</p>
 
 Discover verifiable data about a website 
 Simplify the onboarding of suppliers and customers by linking relevant non-sensitive data such as to business registration credentials to the organization’s DID 
 Make mandatory data verifiable: provide imprint pages or terms of use statements as machine-readable, verifiable credentials 
 Decentralized business network: people share their educational background and work experience as verifiable credentials publicly 
 
<p>The specification is available here: <a href="https://identity.foundation/linked-vp/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://identity.foundation/linked-vp/</a></p>

<p>Last year we partnered with&nbsp;<a href="https://learnweb3.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Learn Web 3</a>&nbsp;(a free educational platform for Web3 developers) to publish a tutorial on&nbsp;<a href="https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-ai-chatbot-on-compose-db-and-the-ceramic-network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Saving OpenAI Chats to ComposeDB on Ceramic</a>&nbsp;to showcase an easy-to-understand design architecture and how ComposeDB could be leveraged for storage. In that example we showed how to configure and deploy a local ComposeDB/Ceramic node, walking through data model design, server configurations, model deployment, and runtime definition generation, all of which are necessary steps a developer must undergo before running the application locally.</p><p>But what if developers could bypass local node configuration altogether and start testing their database design and application logic immediately? What if they could do so with the assurances of no lock-ins, and the open option to move to a self-hosted configuration in the future? And finally, what if they could benefit from all of these things while enjoying a seamless developer experience that makes storage setup easy?</p><p>That's where <a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB</a> comes in.</p> What is OrbisDB? <p><a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB</a>&nbsp;is an advanced decentralized database built on the&nbsp;<a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a>&nbsp;and offers an ORM-like interface that developers can leverage when integrating the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB SDK</a>. Developers who have worked with Prisma or Drizzle with a Postgres instance will find this experience familiar and exceedingly easy to work with.</p><p>As for developer experience, what sets OrbisDB apart are the following:</p>  A user interface (UI) developers can run either locally or using a&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">hosted Studio instance</a>, bypassing the need to define and deploy data models by hand (which is still an option if using the SDK). The UI also includes data visualization (you can view data relevant to your applications in table format), as well as other views for configuring add-ons like plugins (described below).  OrbisDB offers the option to leverage a variety of a growing list of plugins to enrich the data capabilities developers can incorporate into their application logic. Some example plugins offer gating ability, automatic resolution of ENS domains, sybil resistance, and more. Anyone can also build plugins and incorporate them immediately in the event they're running a standalone instance.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB SDK</a>&nbsp;wraps user authentication, client creation, schema creation (if developers prefer not to use the UI), and querying all under one roof, therefore simplifying the list of dependencies developers need to worry about.  Finally, OrbisDB offers the option to run an instance locally (similar to the ComposeDB tutorial mentioned above), or on a shared (hosted) instance. This is a significant feature for overall development and testing velocity as it lets developers start writing and reading data right away without having to worry about node configuration. Once developers are ready to take their application to production after testing on the shared instance, setting up a self-hosted (standalone) instance is straightforward.  <p>For this tutorial, we will be leveraging the&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">hosted Studio instance</a>&nbsp;to both define our data models and utilize a shared OrbisDB instance.</p> Let's Get Started! <p>Before we get started, you will need the following dependencies:</p>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?ref=blog.ceramic.network">MetaMask Chrome Extension</a>&nbsp;(or similar browser wallet for authentication)  Node v20  An&nbsp;<a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OpenAI API key</a>  A project ID you will need from&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect</a>&nbsp;  A free&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB Studio</a>&nbsp;account - first, log in with your browser wallet. We will use this later to define our data models and obtain a context and environment ID   Initial Setup <p>First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot &amp;&amp; cd orbisdb-chatbot
npm install</code> <p>Next, create a copy of the example env file in your root directory:</p> <code>cp .env.example .env</code> <p>Visit <a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OpenAI Signup</a> page to create an account if you don't yet have one and generate an API key. OpenAI offers a free OpenAI API trial, with $5 worth of credit (which can take you a LONG way). Go ahead and assign your new API key to <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> in your new .env file.</p><p>Navigate to <a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect</a>&nbsp;and create a free account and a new project (with a name of your choosing and the&nbsp;<code>App</code>&nbsp;type selected). Copy the resulting project ID and assign it as the value for <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID</code> .</p> OrbisDB Setup <p>If you're logged into your <a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB Studio</a> account, we can start connecting our application to a shared OrbisDB instance.</p><p>First, you will need to define a new context. Contexts are a Ceramic-native feature exposed in all data management methods, and make it easy for developers to organize data across different applications or projects (there is also the option to leverage sub-contexts, but we'll save this for a future tutorial). </p><p>Go ahead and click "+ Add context" within your root studio view - feel free to give your new context a name and description of your choosing:</p><p>If you click into your new context you can view its corresponding ID:</p><p>Go ahead and copy this value and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTEXT_ID</code> in your .env file.</p><p>On the right-hand side, you should also see details about your setup:</p><p>Copy the value found under "Environment ID" and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_ID</code> in your .env file. This ID is required to identify you when using the shared OrbisDB instance. </p><p>You will also see the endpoints for the shared Ceramic and OrbisDB instances in the same section. No need to copy these values as they are already hard-coded into the repository.</p><p>Defining Data Models</p><p>We will also use the Studio UI to define the data models our application needs. This demo application utilizes two simple data models found within the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/models/tables.sql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tables file</a> in our repository:</p>  <code>posts</code> - this will contain each message within our conversation exchange. The "body" field will house the message itself, while the "tag" field will keep track of who the message came from (user vs. bot). This model will use the "List" account relation, which means an authenticated account can have an unbounded amount of instance documents that fall under this definition.  <code>profiles</code> - this model will allow us to assign additional data to ourselves and our chatbot, including a name, username, and fun emoji. The "actor" subfield will be used to differentiate between the user (using the value "human"), and your chatbot (using the value "robot"). In contrast to posts, this model will use the "Set" account relation based on the "actor" subfield, which means an account can have exactly 1 instance document given a value assigned to "actor". For example, this ensures that our application won't allow us to accidentally create &gt;1 document with an "actor" subfield matching "human".  <p>To start creating the models, navigate to "Model builder" from the Studio navigation. You can start by defining your "posts" table. After clicking "Create Model" you will be able to view the model ID:</p><p>Copy this value and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_POST_ID</code> in your .env file.</p><p>Go through the same steps for your "profiles" table. However, be sure to select the "Set" option under "Account relation". Copy the resulting model ID and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_PROFILE_ID</code> in your .env file.</p> Application Architecture <p>As mentioned above, the OrbisDB SDK makes it easy to instantiate clients, authenticate users, and run queries using the same library. As you'll note in the application repository, there are various components that need to be able to access the state of the authenticated user. While we're <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/pages/_app.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">wrapping all components </a>of our application within a <code>WagmiConfig</code> contextual wrapper (which will allow us to leverage Wagmi's hooks to see if a user's wallet is connected - learn more about this in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/walletconnect-tutorial/">WalletConnect Tutorial</a>), we also need a way to know if the user has an active OrbisDB session.</p><p>While there are multiple ways to facilitate this, our application uses <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Zustand</a> for state management to circumvent the need for contextual wrappers or prop drilling.</p><p>If you take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/zustand/store.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">store file</a> you can see how we've set up four state variables (two of which are methods) and incorporated the OrbisDB SDK to authenticate users and alter the state of  <code>orbisSession</code>: </p> <code>type Store = {
  orbis: OrbisDB;
  orbisSession?: OrbisConnectResult | undefined;
  // setOrbisSession returns a promise
  setAuth: (
    wallet: GetWalletClientResult | undefined
  ) =&gt; Promise&lt;OrbisConnectResult | undefined&gt;;
  setOrbisSession: (session: OrbisConnectResult | undefined) =&gt; void;
};

const StartOrbisAuth = async (
  walletClient: GetWalletClientResult,
  orbis: OrbisDB
): Promise&lt;OrbisConnectResult | undefined&gt; =&gt; {
  if (walletClient) {
    const auth = new OrbisEVMAuth(window.ethereum!);
    
    // This option authenticates and persists the session in local storage
    const authResult: OrbisConnectResult = await orbis.connectUser({
      auth,
    });
    if (authResult.session) {
      console.log("Orbis Auth'd:", authResult.session);
      return authResult;
    }
  }

  return undefined;
};

const useStore = create&lt;Store&gt;((set) =&gt; ({
  orbis: new OrbisDB({
    ceramic: {
      gateway: "https://ceramic-orbisdb-mainnet-direct.hirenodes.io/",
    },
    nodes: [
      {
        gateway: "https://studio.useorbis.com",
        env: ENV_ID,
      },
    ],
  }),
  orbisSession: undefined,
  setAuth: async (wallet) =&gt; {
    if (wallet) {
      try {
        const auth = await StartOrbisAuth(wallet, useStore.getState().orbis);
        set((state: Store) =&gt; ({
          ...state,
          orbisSession: auth,
        }));
        return auth;
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
      }
    } else {
      set((state: Store) =&gt; ({
        ...state,
        session: undefined,
      }));
    }
  },
  setOrbisSession: (session) =&gt;
    set((state: Store) =&gt; ({
      ...state,
      orbisSession: session,
    })),
}));</code> <p>As you can see, we've hard-coded the Ceramic and OrbisDB gateways, whereas we've imported our environment ID that we previously assigned as an environment variable.</p><p>Our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/navbar.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">navbar component</a> sits at the same or greater level as all of our child components and includes our Web3Modal widget. You can see how we're using a <code>useEffect</code> hook to check if our session is active and either set our "loggedIn" state variable as true or false. This result determines if we generate a new session for the user by leveraging our <code>setAuth</code> method from our Zustand store, or if we simply set our <code>orbisSession</code> as the value of our valid active session.</p><p>Back in the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">home page component</a> you can see how we're conditionally rendering our <code>MessageList</code> child component based on whether we have both an active orbis session AND the user's wallet is connected (allowing us to access their address).</p><p>Reading Data</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/message-list.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">message list</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/userform.component.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">userform component</a> files are responsible for performing the majority of writes and reads to OrbisDB. If you navigate to the message list component for example, take a look at how we've imported our client-side environment variables to identify our post and profile models, as well as our context ID. When this component is rendered, the <code>useEffect</code> hook first invokes the "getProfile" method:</p> <code>  const getProfile = async (): Promise&lt;void&gt; =&gt; {
    try {
      const profile = orbis
        .select("controller", "name", "username", "emoji", "actor")
        .from(PROFILE_ID)
        .where({ actor: ["human"] })
        .context(CONTEXT_ID);
      const profileResult = await profile.run();
      if (profileResult.rows.length) {
        console.log(profileResult.rows[0]);
        setProfile(profileResult.rows[0] as Profile);
      } else {
        // take the user to the profile page if no profile is found
        window.location.href = "/profile";
      }
      await getRobotProfile(profileResult.rows[0] as Profile);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      return undefined;
    }
  };</code> <p>Notice how we've constructed a <code>.select</code> query off of our OrbisDB instance (provided by our Zustand store), asking for the corresponding values for the 5 columns we want data for. </p><p>Next, we need to notate which data model we want our query to reference, which is where we use <code>.from</code> with our profile model ID as the value.</p><p>We also only want the records where the profile is for the human user, indicated on the following line.</p><p>Finally, we use the context ID that corresponds to this project as the final value that's appended to the query.</p><p>If a corresponding profile exists, we then invoke the <code>getRobotProfile</code> method to obtain our chatbot's information. If it does not exist, we take the users to the profiles page so they can create one.</p><p>Writing Data</p><p>Let's take a quick look at an example of data mutations. Within the same <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/message-list.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">message list</a> component you will find a method called <code>createPost</code> which is invoked each time the user creates a new message:</p> <code> const createPost = async (
    thisPost: string
  ): Promise&lt;PostProps | undefined&gt; =&gt; {
    try {
      await orbis.getConnectedUser();
      const query = await orbis
        .insert(POST_ID)
        .value({
          body: thisPost,
          created: new Date().toISOString(),
          tag: "user",
          edited: new Date().toISOString(),
        })
        .context(CONTEXT_ID)
        .run();

      if (query.content &amp;&amp; profile) {
        const createdPost: PostProps = {
          id: query.id,
          body: query.content.body as string,
          profile,
          tag: query.content.tag as string,
          created: query.content.created as string,
          authorId: query.controller,
        };
        return createdPost;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      return undefined;
    }
  };</code> <p>While this looks similar to the syntax we use to read data, there are a few differences. </p><p>First, take a look at the first line under the "try" statement - we're calling <code>getConnectedUser()</code> off of our OrbisDB prototype chain to ensure that our active session is applied. This is necessary to run mutation queries, whereas it's not a necessary step for reading data.</p><p>You can also see that we've swapped out the <code>.select</code> and <code>.from</code> statements for <code>.insert</code> which references the model ID we want to use, thus creating a new row in the corresponding table.</p><p>Finally, we're referencing the user's message value for the body while ensuring we tag the message as coming from the "user" before running the query and checking on its success status.</p> Running the Application in Developer Mode <p>We're now ready to boot up our application! </p><p>In your terminal, go ahead and start the application in developer mode:</p> <code>nvm use 20
npm run dev</code> <p>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000/</a> in your browser. You should see the following:</p><p>Go ahead and click on "Connect Wallet." You should see a secondary authentication message appear after you connect your wallet:</p><p>Signing this message creates an authenticated session (using <code>orbis.connectUser()</code> from our Zustand store). You can check the value of this session by navigating to the "Application" tab in your browser and looking for the <code>orbis:session</code> key pair:</p><p>Given that you have not yet created any messages, the application should automatically direct you to the /profiles page where you can assign identifiers to yourself and your chatbot:</p><p>Finally, navigate back to the homepage to begin exchanging messages with your chatbot. Notice how the values from your corresponding profiles appear next to the messages:</p> How Could this Application be Improved? <p>Since our message history is being written and queried based on static values (for example, assigning messages to the "user" tag), you'll notice that the same conversation history appears when self-authenticating with a different wallet address and creating a new session.</p><p>As a challenge, try thinking about how to implement different ways to improve the application design to improve this experience:</p>  Tagging the profiles and messages with values that align with actual authenticated accounts instead of static ones  Altering our message data model and application to accommodate different chat contexts, allowing a user to have different conversation histories   Next Steps <p>We hope you've enjoyed this tutorial and learned something new about how to configure and incorporate OrbisDB into your application! While this concludes our walk-through, there are other possibilities Ceramic has to offer:</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/ceramic?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Join the Ceramic Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/ceramicnetwork?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Follow Ceramic on X</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/useorbis?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Follow Orbis on X</a></p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Start Building with Ceramic</a></p>

		<p>Webinar<br>
Thursday, July 25, 2024<br>
10 AM ET</p>
<p>For higher education institutions offering financial aid to students, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, means your institution is required to meet compliance standards for the security and protection of financial information, and to provide transparency related to how personal information is used and shared. Failure to meet these standards carries significant risk for institutions, including restrictions or loss of eligibility for Title IV funding. In this session, we’ll review how the latest revisions to GLBA compliance standards, aligned with the NIST 800-171 revision 3, will impact higher education. Our privacy and compliance experts will review how these revisions increase the compliance burden for institutions, and key steps that institutions can take to meet the new standard and maintain compliance to receive federal financial aid support.</p>

<p>IBM, Logius, Orbex Global Markets, Publications Office of the European Union, U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and Others Advance Open Standard for Enhanced Interoperability and Efficiency in Supply Chain and Digital Trade</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 27 June 2024 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced the approval of Universal Business Language (UBL) V2.4 as an OASIS Standard, a status that signifies the highest level of ratification. Developed by the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/tc-ubl/">UBL Technical Committee (TC</a>), UBL V2.4 is the leading interchange format for business documents, revolutionizing global business transactions with its latest version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The standard works seamlessly with frameworks like ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML), extending the benefits of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems to businesses worldwide. UBL V2.4 maintains backward compatibility with earlier V2.# versions while introducing new business document types, now totaling 93. The European Union has recognized UBL’s significance by declaring it officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“UBL 2.4 represents a significant advancement, featuring enhanced support for B2C transactions, which will greatly benefit businesses and consumers alike,” said Kenneth Bengtsson, Chair of the UBL TC. “Additionally, it offers improved alignment with U.S. tax models, ensuring compliance and facilitating smoother transactions. These enhancements reaffirm our commitment to evolving and adapting UBL to meet the ever-changing needs of global commerce.”</p>



<p>As global sustainability efforts increase, UBL will expand its utility to encompass circular data exchange, reflecting the evolving needs of modern commerce. Looking ahead to the development of UBL V2.5, the TC will integrate circular economy data elements, marking a transformative step towards embedding sustainability into global supply chain data exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UBL TC is forming a new UBL Commodities Subcommittee (SC), which aims to streamline electronic transactions for raw materials, recycled goods, and agricultural products in global supply chains, with the goal of improving efficiency, transparency, sustainability, and reliability in commodity markets. The SC will standardize UBL document types and semantic library entries for global commodity trading and procurement processes.</p>



<p>The UBL TC encourages global collaboration and actively seeks input from stakeholders to ensure the success of UBL as a cornerstone for sustainability data exchange. The TC welcomes a diverse range of contributors, including ERP vendors; software and service providers; national, regional and local public authorities; procurement and trade communities; e-invoicing networks; supply chain communities; and logistics and transportation companies. Participation is open to all through <a href="mailto:join@oasis-open.org">membership in OASIS</a>, with interested parties encouraged to join and contribute to shaping the future of structured business document exchange. Contact <a href="mailto:join@oasis-open.org">join@oasis-open.org</a> for more information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>About the FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

 1. Background&nbsp; 
<p>In 2022, Internet Safety Labs (ISL) conducted an <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/reports/2022-k-12-edtech-safety-benchmark-findings-report-3/">extensive benchmark of EdTech apps</a> used in schools across the United States. We sampled 13 schools in each state and the District of Colombia and identified 1,722 unique apps which were in use In K12 schools. During the benchmark, the apps were evaluated scored on their behaviors related to safety. As part of the safety evaluation, SDKs in each app were identified and researchers collected network traffic for 1,357 apps. In total, there were 275 unique SDKs in the apps, and 8,168 unique subdomains, 3,211 unique domains from the network traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key research question in conducting the 2022 EdTech benchmark was to determine how accurate SDKs were as a proxy for actual third-party data sharing, since network traffic data collection is somewhat labor-intensive. This report shares the results of the analysis.&nbsp;</p>
 2. Analysis&nbsp; 
<p>The basis of the analysis was to compare the “expected” third parties as based on the company owners of the SDKs with the observed companies in the network traffic. This required identifying the owner companies for both the SDKs and all the subdomains observed in the aggregate network traffic.<a>1</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researchers first identified which SDKs were in use in apps by using AppFigures as a resource. In total, 275 SDKs unique SDKs were found in use across all apps.&nbsp; Next, researchers identified the companies who published these SDKs. For each app, the number of unique company owners of SDKs found in each app is referred to as the “expected” number of companies to receive data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, researchers performed a similar analysis on the subdomains observed in the network traffic (1,175 total apps). Each subdomain was resolved to an “owner” company.&nbsp; Subdomains were identified from HTTP POST/GET requests captured in the network traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We then performed two quantitative analyses: (1) we examined the network traffic of apps with at least one SDK (n=1,083 apps), and (2) we examined the network traffic of apps with no SDKs (n=92 apps).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 2.1&nbsp; &nbsp;Apps With at Least One SDK&nbsp; 
<p>Apps with at least one SDK communicated with an average of 10.1 companies based on observed network traffic (Table 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 2.1.1&nbsp; &nbsp;“Expected” Companies in Network Traffic&nbsp; 
<p>In apps with at least one SDK, there were an average of 4.7 unique companies represented by the SDKs–thus, 4.7 “expected” companies to receive data. However, on average, only 1.7 (or 36.2%) of the “expected” companies were seen in the network traffic of apps with at least one SDK (Table 1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that there are several contributing factors that could account for this, including:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The manual testing performed by the researchers was unstructured and therefore had inconsistencies across researchers.&nbsp; 
 The manual testing didn’t perform all functions in the app. For instance, the tested did not make any optional purchases or upgrading to a premium version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 <br>
2.1.2&nbsp; &nbsp;“Unexpected” Companies in Network Traffic&nbsp; 
<p>Additionally, as seen in Table 1, these apps communicated with an average of 8.4 unexpected companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As expected, apps that used Webview<a>2</a>, had advertisements or behavioral ads all had even higher average numbers of unexpected companies, with apps with behavioral ads having the highest at 33.7 unexpected companies on average<a>3</a>. The ISL app score rubric regards the use of Webview and the inclusion of advertising as very high risks for K-12 students and the data in Table 1 reinforces the rubric.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Apps with at least one SDK that use Webview had 2.6 times as many third parties as apps with at least one SDK that don’t use Webview.&nbsp; 
 Apps with at least one SDK that include ads had 3.0 times as many third parties as apps with at least one SDK that don’t include ads.&nbsp; 
 Apps with at least one SDK that include behavioral ads had 4.0 times as many third parties as apps with at least one SDK that don’t include behavioral ads.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 2.2 &nbsp; Apps with No SDKs&nbsp; 
<p>There were 92 apps in the data set that had no SDKs and for which we had network traffic. Since these apps had no SDKs, there were no “expected” companies to receive data from the app [other than the app developer, of course].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apps with no SDKs averaged 4.6 companies observed in network traffic—negligibly less than the average for apps with at least one SDK. However, for apps that use Webview, or include advertising or behavioral advertising, the average observed companies is markedly lower (Table 2).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Apps with no SDKs that use Webview had 44.1% fewer observed companies.&nbsp; 
 Apps with no SDKs that include advertising had 40.6% fewer observed companies.&nbsp; 
 Apps with no SDKs that include behavioral advertising had 21.0% fewer observed companies.&nbsp;

 <br>
3. Conclusion<br>
 
 3.1&nbsp; &nbsp;SDKs as a Proxy for Third Party Sharing<br>
 
<p>As the data shows, SDKs aren’t a useful proxy for the actual number of third parties receiving data from the app. Moreover, apps that include ads or that use Webview will likely have significantly more third parties than apps without.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that viable measurement of third parties receiving data from apps requires testing and observation of network traffic. ISL used mostly manual methods for the collection of this data but automated methods would be extremely beneficial for ongoing and pervasive measuring of app third party sharing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>SDKs do provide value in identifying potential omissions in the manual testing process. Can we account for the specific SDKs that don’t appear in the network traffic? Did we miss a particular functional branch of the app that we should go back and test? Or might it be an indication of an error in the SDK database? So while SDKs don’t serve as a perfect indication of the third parties communicating with the app, they still provide valuable information, and as such, they will remain in our app safety labels (see <a href="https://appmicroscope.org/">https://appmicroscope.org/</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 3.2&nbsp; &nbsp;Validation of ISL App Scoring Rubric&nbsp; 
<p>As shown in section 2, use of Webview and the inclusion of advertising substantially increase user exposure to data sharing with more third parties. This finding reinforces the ISL app scoring rubric wherein the use of Webview and presence of advertising are indicators for very high risk.&nbsp;</p>

  Note: researchers determined the use of Webview manually, by observing third-party pages opening within the app. Thus, the presence of Webview as tagged in ISL’s AppMicroscope.org may not accurately assess Webview use for first-party web pages.&nbsp; 
 It would be interesting to study how many apps&nbsp;have behavioral ads and&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;use Webview.

<p>In the records of financial history, few events have shaped the global economic landscape as profoundly as the establishment of the Bretton Woods system. In 1944, amidst the ruins of World War II, representatives from 44 Allied nations convened in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to create a new framework for international economic cooperation. The primary goal was to prevent the economic instability and competitive devaluations that had contributed to the Great Depression and the war.</p>
<p>The Bretton Woods system pegged major currencies to the US dollar, which was convertible to gold at a fixed rate. This effectively made the US dollar the world’s reserve currency, providing much-needed stability and fostering economic growth. However, by the late 1960s, the system began to unravel. The US faced mounting balance-of-payments deficits and dwindling gold reserves. On August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon unilaterally ended the dollar’s convertibility to gold, effectively dismantling the Bretton Woods system and ushering in the era of fiat currencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The transition to fiat currencies, while offering greater flexibility for monetary policy, also introduced significant challenges. Governments could now print money without restraint, leading to inflation, currency devaluations, and a series of financial crises. Today, the world faces a staggering $307 trillion in debt, excessive currency issuance, declining bank credit, and rising economic instability. This backdrop underscores the need for a new financial paradigm, one that combines stability with the technological advancements of the digital age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Bitcoin: Digital Gold 
<p>Bitcoin, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, was designed as a decentralised digital currency that could operate independently of central banks and governments. Often referred to as “digital gold,” Bitcoin possesses many qualities that make it an ideal candidate for a global reserve asset: it is scarce (with a cap of 21 million coins), durable, portable, and easily divisible. Bitcoin’s blockchain technology ensures transparency, security, and resistance to censorship, making it a robust vehicle to support fiat currencies and value exchange.</p>
<p>Despite its adoption and over $1 trillion in value, Bitcoin’s mainstream financial use faces challenges like scalability and programmability limitations. Its high decentralisation and security make transactions slower and resource-intensive. While its simplicity ensures robust security, it limits Bitcoin’s ability to handle complex transactions like digital agreements for loans or exchanges. Innovations like Ethereum, which introduced smart contracts in 2015, offer more functionality, leading to Layer 2 solutions aimed at uniting technologies and enhancing Bitcoin’s capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Bitcoin Layers 
<p>Layer 2 solutions are protocols built on top of a blockchain (Layer 1) to enhance performance and enable more complex functionalities. For Bitcoin, Layer 2 technologies like the Lightning Network and sidechains address issues of transaction speed, programmability and scalability, while bridges facilitate interoperability with other blockchain ecosystems. These solutions allow Bitcoin to interact with other blockchain ecosystems and innovations like Ethereum, enabling smart contracts and decentralised applications (DApps) that were previously not possible. However, there is a problem.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Inherent Problems 
<p>Scalability layers involve bridging Bitcoin off its main network and into these environments, creating security concerns that undermine its decentralised ethos. <a href="https://wbtc.network/">Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)</a>, for instance, is an ERC-20 token that represents Bitcoin on Ethereum networks. While it brings Bitcoin’s liquidity to more programmable finance platforms, it has several critical issues:</p>
 
 Centralisation Risk: WBTC requires users to trust centralised institutions to manage and safeguard the Bitcoin backing the WBTC. If these institutions act maliciously, users have no recourse, undermining Bitcoin’s decentralisation ethos. 
 Custodian Risk: The centralised custodians holding the actual Bitcoin can potentially be hacked or face regulatory pressures, putting users’ assets at risk. 
 Lack of Transparency: Users must rely on the custodians’ transparency regarding the actual reserves backing the WBTC, which may not always be reliable. 
 
<p></p>
<p>Recent cross-chain bridge hacks, such as the <a href="https://medium.com/immunefi/hack-analysis-nomad-bridge-august-2022-5aa63d53814a">Nomad Bridge exploit</a>, highlight these vulnerabilities. <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cross-chain-bridge-hacks-2022/">Chainalysis</a> reports that $2 billion has been stolen in 13 cross-chain bridge hacks, accounting for 69% of total funds stolen in 2022, with North Korean-linked hackers stealing approximately $1 billion. Currently, there are more than <a href="https://dezentralizedfinance.com/cross-chain-bridges/">70 cross-chain bridges</a> with over $25 billion locked and daily transaction volumes in the millions. Synapse, a popular cross-chain bridge, has surpassed $5 billion in transaction volume. Bridges are vulnerable due to their structure, combining custodians, debt issuers, and oracles, each presenting multiple attack vectors. For instance, the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/10/cross-chain-defi-site-poly-network-hacked-hundreds-of-millions-potentially-lost/">Poly Network</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wormhole-token-bridge-loses-321m-in-largest-hack-so-far-in-2022">Wormhole</a> attacks showcased vulnerabilities in cross-chain communication, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<p>To mitigate these risks, it is crucial for Bitcoin’s evolution to connect other innovation layers through information transmission rather than asset transfer, while decentralising staking on Bitcoin to avoid pooling assets together. This approach keeps Bitcoin native, secure, and decentralised, while enabling broader financial applications in scalable environments.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Native Bitcoin DeFi, Pioneering the New Bretton Woods System 
<p>Native Bitcoin refers to Bitcoin that remains on its main network while being collateralised for Layer 2 DeFi applications. Through BeL2, Bitcoin can participate in complex financial transactions without being transferred off the Bitcoin blockchain, maintaining its security and decentralisation. This allows Bitcoin to act as a versatile tool in DeFi ecosystems, leveraging its inherent strengths while expanding its functionality into smart services such as swaps, loans, and stablecoin issuance.</p>
 
 Staking: BeL2 employs non-custodial native Bitcoin staking in decentralised wallets, providing security for the network. 
 Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs): These provide private and verifiable proofs on Bitcoin staking transactions. 
 BTC Oracle: Connects BTC proof information into Layer 2 smart contracts, facilitating Bitcoin DeFi services without moving assets off the main network. 
 Arbiter Network: Utilises decentralised and collateralised nodes to facilitate time-based execution and dispute resolution, enhancing trustless financial operations. 
 
<p></p>
<p>BeL2 transmits information, not assets, across chains, preserving Bitcoin’s security and integrity while enabling smart contracts and decentralised applications for complex financial transactions. This approach eliminates reliance on centralised entities and ensures secure, decentralised financial operations. By keeping Bitcoin native, BeL2 ensures that the original blockchain remains the ultimate trust anchor for all transactions, thereby maintaining the foundational principles of Bitcoin’s decentralised ethos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Native Bitcoin Loan App Demo 
<p>In the context of BeL2’s transformative role in decentralised finance (DeFi), the BeL2 Loan Dapp Demo showcases its potential to enhance Bitcoin’s utility while maintaining security and decentralisation. This demo is the first native Bitcoin lending protocol built on <a href="https://starkware.co/cairo/">Starkwares Cairo</a> programming language, allowing users to lock their native Bitcoin as collateral without relying on Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) or cross-chain bridges. The BTC remains on the Bitcoin mainnet, ensuring non-custodial and non-liquidatable collateral.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Users lock their Bitcoin through a bespoke transaction script, and the loan terms, including interest rates and conditions for collateral release, are governed by a smart contract on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). BeL2’s arbiter network acts as an intermediary, facilitating communication between the Bitcoin and EVM chains and verifying transaction proofs. If a borrower, like Alice, fails to repay a loan, the lender, Bob, can retrieve the BTC. If Bob refuses to cooperate in unlocking the BTC after repayment, Alice can initiate arbitration, and the arbiter will co-sign to unlock the BTC.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This peer-to-peer system ensures fairness and security through zero-knowledge proofs and the arbiter network. Any malicious actions by the arbiter or parties involved are deterred by the ability to challenge and penalise misconduct, ensuring cooperation is the best outcome. This innovative approach enables Bitcoin holders to access liquidity while preserving Bitcoin’s core principles of decentralisation and security.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Principles for a New Native Bitcoin Bretton Woods System: 
 
 Decentralised Global Settlement: Native Bitcoin must act as a global settlement layer where all transactions are secured on Bitcoin’s main network, ensuring it remains the ultimate trust anchor for global finance. 
 Financial Innovation and Stability: By integrating native Bitcoin with smart contracts and DApps, we can support new financial products like BTC-backed loans and stablecoins, providing liquidity and stability to the global economy whilst uniting all layers. 
 Trustless and Transparent Operations: The implementation of information transmission through zero knowledge proofs and a decentralised arbiter network ensures trustless and transparent financial operations for native Bitcoin applications, reducing counterparty risk and enhancing transaction integrity. 
 
<p></p>
<p>BeL2’s vision is to become the defining piece of native Bitcoin infrastructure for a new Bretton Woods system. Emerging from the Elastos SmartWeb vision, which aims to create a decentralised internet where data, applications, and identities are secure, private, and user-owned, BeL2 strives to become a pivotal component of native Bitcoin infrastructure, transforming Bitcoin from digital gold into the cornerstone of a new global financial system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;BeL2 leverages Elastos’ secure <a href="https://elastos.info/">infrastructure</a>, using ELA as collateral for arbiters to ensure robust and trustless dispute resolution. ELA, an asset merged mined with over <a href="https://ela.elastos.io/">50% of Bitcoin’s</a> miner security, adds an additional layer of security and decentralisation to the BeL2 ecosystem, reinforcing both projects’ commitment to a secure and decentralised financial future.

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Earlier this month, I was lucky enough to be personally invited by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joergresch/">Joerg Resch</a>&nbsp;to attend Europe’s flagship digital ID conference in Berlin,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/agenda">EIC 2024</a>. For someone who regularly spoke on this circuit for over 10 years, it was a blast to be back, revelling in the richness of the presentations and discussion, highlighted in this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonibrennan_eic2024-dc4eu-personaldataprivacy-activity-7206782875801669632-70VT?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">post</a>&nbsp;by my predecessor at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kantara-initiative_eic2024-kantarainitaitive-activity-7204130422773985280-FVFw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Kantara Initiative</a>. The brain is fully engaged for hours, absorbing expert insight, experience, and innovation that is found here at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC</a>&nbsp;in Germany and<a href="https://identiverse.com/">&nbsp;Identiverse</a>&nbsp;in the US, the world’s two biggest conferences in this space. I’m looking forward to a tiny fraction of the ground being covered and contextualised locally at our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;in just six weeks’ time.</p>



<p>The pre-conference&nbsp;<a href="https://sidi-hub.community/">SIDIHub</a>&nbsp;made significant progress in the challenging goal to achieve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/multi-stakeholder-cross-border-identity-eic24">digital identity cross border interoperability</a>. Participants were interested in learning about Aotearoa becoming the first common law country to implement a<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital-government/programmes-and-projects/digital-identity-programme/about-the-digital-identity-programme/">&nbsp;regulated digital identity trust framework&nbsp;</a>on July 1st. This framework regulates stakeholders that opt in for accreditation, thereby increasing customer trust in their security and privacy settings. The US, UK, Canada, and Australia have digital ID trust frameworks in operation and piloted, but not yet nationally legislated. Credential authentication and verification continue to evolve both in policy and technology at different speeds, making it a complex issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At our recent DIA-hosted public/private sector working group meeting on digital identification standards, I commented that there is still much work needed globally before we can adopt comprehensive policies, protocols and standards for decentralised digital ID and its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/panel-the-wallets-we-want-eic24">container</a><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/panel-expert-digital-wallet-verifiers-eic24">wallets</a>. This is a plane we will continue to build as we fly it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high interest in digital ID led us to host/co-host two events in June: the capacity-filled ‘Digital Identity, Higher Education, Aotearoa’ sponsored by Middleware and featuring the University of Auckland, and a Town Hall-styled session on digital cash with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Te Pūtea Matua (RBNZ), in partnership with FinTechNZ. Both events showed how important broad digital trust is for ensuring cybersecurity and protecting against deepfakes, scams and hacking threats. Awareness and education are essential, so we thank our members for supporting DINZ initiatives, just as DINZ supports members’ initiatives like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nec.co.nz/biometrics-education-series/">the upcoming series from NEC</a>.</p>



<p>And finally, the DIA has released a new schedule of Identification Masterclasses through to August.</p>







<p>To register for any of the Zoom sessions, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:identity@dia.govt.nz">identity@dia.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;with the G or HD reference number and a Zoom link will be supplied.</p>



<p>Ngā mihi</p>

<p>Theatre 4 was the place to be at Identity Week Europe in Amsterdam earlier this month, when a series of presentations and panel discussions on decentralized identity and blockchain proved one of the exhibition hall's top draws. </p><p>The session, on the afternoon of Day 2, began with a panel discussion, "Blockchain and ID" moderated by Alex Tourski, with Steffen Schwalm, Co-ordinator, TRACE4EU, Maarten Boender, INATBA Identity Workgroup, Sphereon.com and William Wang, Founder, Palau Digital Residency Program (RNS.ID).</p><p>Alex Tourski: "Why does blockchain need identity?" </p><p>Steffen Schwalm: "If you only want to prove identities, you can use a PKI. But if you want to combine identity and transactions in one system — for example, if you want to trace the parts and materials in your Tesla’s battery — you need a distributed ledger."&nbsp;</p><p>Maarten Boender: "I agree. How can you be held accountable for what’s written to the blockchain, unless the transaction is signed by your identifier? If you need to make the audit trail of your product evident, that’s much easier to do with DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology). The DID document can’t be changed and will be around for as long as the blockchain it resides on, which is available always and everywhere. There’s no single point of failure.</p><p>"There are not so many other systems with the properties of a DLT".&nbsp;</p><p>Alex Tourski: "Can DIDs be considered a universal identifier scheme, when there are around 200 DID methods?"&nbsp;</p><p>Steffen Schwalm: "We have multiple credential data models, signature formats and protocols. What matters is achieving interoperability. I don’t have a problem with 500 DID methods, as long as we have a universal resolver that works."</p><p>Maarten Boender: "There are many types of database. As long as everyone talks SQL, its’ fine. Consumers won’t need to think about 200 DID methods. You’ll only have one choice, whether to login with your EU digital identity wallet."&nbsp;</p><p>Alex Tourski: "How do we know blockchain-based identifiers will persist?"&nbsp;</p><p>William Wang: "Why do IP addresses exist? Because there's an underlying need to transfer information. If there's a better way of doing this in ten years’ time, IPs may vanish. Blockchain exists because there’s a need for instant transfer of value. Maybe another way will arise and blockchain will disappear. We can’t say anything will exist for sure, even in 5 years time."&nbsp;</p><p>Maarten Boender: "DIDs and DLTs will be essential tools for businesses that need to provide audit trails. Qualified electronic ledgers are part of eIDAS 2.0. They are managed by organizations that are certified and fully liable to maintain the ledger." </p><p>Steffen Schwalm: "I’m pretty sure nothing of current IT systems will still be here in 50 years' time. It’s the data that needs to persist."&nbsp;</p><p>Sovrin: an example of a blockchain-based identity system&nbsp;</p><p>Stephen Curran, who chairs the Sovrin Foundation's board of trustees, and is a long-term contributor to Hyperledger Indy, Aries and AnonCreds, took to the stage to give an update on the Sovrin Network. </p><p>“Picking up from the previous talk, Sovrin is a distributed ledger that's used for identity. It’s global, for public-private use and enables different ecosystems of users.</p><p>“We provide a platform for issuers to publish information, that enables verifiers to independently verify this information. Sovrin is a valid place for any ecosystem where DIDs are used. It’s not tied to the Hyperledger stack,” he added.&nbsp; </p><p>Stephen described the Lawyer Verifiable Credential, which is used to ensure certain systems can only be accessed by qualified lawyers. "The Law society of British Columbia issues a VC confirming the holder is certified to practice law. The data is held in a wallet, enabling the holder to present it directly to verifiers, such as these restricted systems, without the issuer knowing this has happened.&nbsp; </p><p>"The Verifier reaches down into where the DIDs are to verify it's exactly what the issuer said, using issuer’s public keys. </p><p>“The Government of British Columbia is also very concerned about the surveillance economy. The goal of AnonCreds is to share the minimum possible data that’s needed for each use case. We’re trying to remove correlateability, traceability and surveillance”.&nbsp;</p><p>Stephen also reminisced about "Sovrin’s infamous token days. We got through that. We had strong technology and governance, and that’s what we took forward. </p><p>"The technology is very solid and robust&nbsp;— we’ve had 100% uptime for the past 5 years”.&nbsp;</p><p>Enabling the Economy of Trust </p><p>Next on stage was Catherine Fankhauser, Head of Identity at SICPA, who provided an overview of how authentication, data authenticity and communication have evolved since the inception of the web, and the impact this has had on digital trust. </p><p>Turning to the new generation of decentralized technologies, she shared that adoption will be driven by credentials with daily utility. In the context of the EU Digital Identity Wallet, this means lower-assurance credentials that improve the user experience, for example via passwordless access to online services. </p><p>Catherine concluded her presentation by highlighting the Unlimitrust Campus, the world's first site dedicated to the Economy of Trust. </p><p>Are unique identifiers a good idea? </p><p>In the final session, Alex Tourski returned to moderate a panel discussion focused on unique identifiers, with Executive Directors Judith Fleenor of Trust over IP Foundation and Mary Camacho of Holochain, plus Maarten Boender, Stephen Curran and myself. </p><p>Alex Tourski kicked off the discussion by highlighting how the lack of persistent   unique identifiers for digital assets means content created in the early days of the internet is often irretrievable today, with broken weblinks all that remains. </p><p>He asked the panel to consider the proposition that "transparency means safety", citing his home country of Ukraine, where false rumours contributed to the war. </p><p>"When an Uber driver likes or dislikes me, should their feedback not be connected to an identifier, to ensure accountability?," he added.  </p><p>The panel's response was unanimous: assigning persistent unique identifiers to  natural persons is a bad idea — though persistent identifiers may make sense for organisations, and certain types of physical and digital objects. Moreover, there are many benefits from using a standardized identifier framework, such as the Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification. </p><p>Judith Fleenor pointed out that the Internet Protocol (IP) succeeded because it does the minimum required to establish a universal data transfer mechanism. Similarly, while content provenance is needed to address the explosion of fake content, creators must be able to use multiple identifiers, to minimize privacy risks. </p><p>Mary Camacho agreed, adding: "Not all societies are as well-governed and free as the Netherlands. In some places, knowing who took a photo could mean death for that person." </p><p>Alex Tourski asked the panel whether Privacy Enhancing Technologies can protect us from the dangers of unique identifiers. </p><p>In response, Stephen Curran stated that cryptographic techniques and identifiers are separate topics, and that clever cryptography doesn't mitigate the privacy risks of assigning unique identifiers to natural persons.   </p><p>Maarten Boender agreed: "We're trying to make it impossible to correlate a holder's use of their credentials, which is the opposite of creating a single identifier."  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

<p>This week, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has called for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/health/surgeon-general-social-media-warning-label.html">warning labels for social media platforms</a>. If you know anything about Internet Safety Labs (ISL) you’ll know that our primary mission is the development of free and accurate safety labels for technology. So naturally, we heartily agree with Dr. Murthy that technology needs labels—but perhaps not warning labels and definitely not just for social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Various experts have written thoughtful responses<a>1</a>&nbsp;to this week’s call for warning labels, and their concerns underscore the fact that a warning label may be inappropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But of course we need safety labels on technology.&nbsp;</p>
 History of Product Labels&nbsp; 
<p>There are several types of product labels: ingredient labels (food), test result labels (automobile crash test ratings), warning labels from the surgeon general (cigarettes) and from other entities (OSHA’s Hazard Communication System for chemicals).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Safety labels have a long-standing history in the US as a core component of product safety and product liability. The purpose of safety labels is to illuminate innate—i.e. unavoidable—risks in a product whether it is food, vehicles, cleaning solvents, toys for children, or the technology that we use with increasing reliance for all facets of living our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Safety labels almost always lag commercial product introduction, and in at least a few cases, product safety can lag by decades. For instance, for cars, product safety awareness and measures (like seatbelts) emerged 50-plus years after their mass availability. Consumer computing has been around for about 40 years now, and it will likely be another 10 years before we see product safety in full swing for software-driven technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to InComplianceMag.com, US and Canadian tort-based law makes manufacturers’ product safety obligations clear (emphasis is mine):&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>” Manufacturers have an obligation to provide safe products and to warn people about any hazards related to the product. Those requirements have risen up out of the original product safety/liability cases, some of which happened in the same timeframe as the Chicago World’s Fair, the middle to late 19th century, with many more to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assumption in U.S. liability law, and also typically if a case is brought in Canada, is that the manufacturer of the product is guilty and has to prove that they did everything necessary to provide a safe product. That includes warnings, user instructions, and other elements. Today, that continues to be the basic concept in product liability, that the burden lies on the manufacturer to prove that they did everything possible to make their product safe.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another interesting fact about safety labels is that they always lag commercial product introduction, and in at least a few cases, product safety can lag by decades. For instance, for cars, product safety awareness and measures (like seatbelts) emerged 50-plus years after their mass availability. Consumer computing has been around for about 40 years now, and it will likely be another 10 years before we see product safety in full swing for software-driven technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If tech were food we would have never stood for the absence of product information for as long as we have. Never. We use tech with little to no visibility or awareness of what it’s actually doing. That simply must change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need a science of product safety for software and software driven technology. And that’s exactly what we’ve been building for five years at ISL. The current attitude of placing the onus on consumers to somehow gird themselves against invisible risks that not even vendors fully understand is absurd. Of course we need labels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the good news is we’ve got them started on over 1,300 EdTech related apps. Here’s an example <a href="https://appmicroscope.org/app/1614/">https://appmicroscope.org/app/1614/.</a> The image below shows just the label header and the safety facts summary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Labels for Technology&nbsp; 
<p>What type of label is appropriate for technology? A warning label is appropriate when the science is irrefutable. Are we there with the physical and mental health risks due to the use of technology? Maybe. Depends on who you ask. But maybe a label more like chemical warning labels is appropriate. Or perhaps just a test results label.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our work at Internet Safety Labs, our intention since day one was to expose invisible or difficult to recognize facts about risky behaviors of technology. As can be seen from the design of our app safety labels, we chose to emulate food nutrition labels that report measured findings. This approach of reporting measured findings works very well for this early stage of the science of product safety for technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, in our safety labels, you can see the category averages for most of the measures in the label. Why did we do that? Because there is no concrete threshold that distinguishes safe from unsafe ranges. There’s no industry standard that says, “more than ten SDKs is bad” for example. Moreover, technology norms vary by industry, such that personal information collection in fintech and medical apps is quite different than personal information collection in retail (at least one hopes). Thus, the category averages displayed in our labels don’t necessarily mean “safe”, they just provide context as we continue to measure and quantify technology behavior. An example of the shortcomings of this approach is when, for instance, the category average number of data brokers is greater than zero for apps typically used by children. (We advocate for no data brokers in technology used by children.) But we need to start with understanding the norms. We can’t change what we can’t see. &nbsp;</p>
 The Devil is in the Details&nbsp; 
<p>The call for a congressional mandate for something (not necessarily a warning label) is a step in the right direction. Why? Because it treats software as a product and tacitly places product safety requirements on it. This is an advancement in our eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, product safety is almost always the domain of government (or insurance). In the absence of a government mandate for product safety for technology, we see fragmented efforts with the FTC boldly championing privacy risks in technology, and the FCC advocating for a different type of label. So indeed, it’s encouraging that we’re starting to talk about technology in product safety terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the devil is in the details of any labeling program. In the words of Shoshana Zuboff, “who decides and who decides who decides?” As in, who decides what goes on the labels? Also who oversees the integrity of the labels? The US government is a customer of data obtained by surveillance capitalism<a>2</a>. When it comes to technology can the government be trusted to keep people safe? (When it comes to food can the government be trusted to keep people safe? When you dig into it, the track record is spotty.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product safety exists in natural opposition to the industry status quo and any kind of regulation is already facing and will continue to face strong opposition<a>3</a>. In the early 1900s, when chemist Dr. Harvey W. Wiley began a crusade for the labeling of ingredients and identifying toxic elements in food, industries who relied on the opacity of ingredients (snake oil salesmen) or who simply didn’t want to incur the cost of change (whiskey distillers) opposed such a mandate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Strenuous opposition to Wiley’s campaign for a federal food and drug law came from whiskey distillers and the patent medicine firms, who were then the largest advertisers in the country. Many of these men thought they would be put out of business by federal regulation. In any case, it was argued, the federal government had no business policing what people ate, drank, or used for medicine. On the other side were strong agricultural organizations, many food packers, state food and drug officials, and the health professions. But the tide was turned, according to historians and Dr. Wiley himself, when the activist club women of the country rallied to the pure food cause.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Product safety challenges the status quo and creates necessary growing pains for industry. But industry always survives. And more often than not, new industries emerge, such as the ongoing development of safety features for vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s return to the challenge of deciding what goes in the labels. We at ISL know quite a lot about what it takes to develop safety labels in a space where the naming and measurement of risk isn’t fully baked (or worse, non-existent). Determining what goes into a previously uncharted, unmeasured safety label is extraordinarily challenging. It’s even more challenging if the measurement tools don’t exist. But our situation is even worse than that: we don’t even have agreement on what the risky behaviors in technology are. AND, we are talking about behaviors here—which is not language we typically associate with products. Products don’t typically behave. From our several years in development, these are the highly iterative steps that must occur to reach consensus on labels for technology:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Consensus on naming the hazards/harms in technology.<a>4</a>&nbsp; 
 Consensus on assessing and quantifying the risks.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Identify the behaviors that embody the risks.&nbsp; 
 Figure out a way to measure the behaviors that embody the risks.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Assess the measurements.<a>5</a>&nbsp; 
 Consensus on presentation of the measurements/information.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p>As far as presentation of the data, in our case, we decided to aggregate the data into clusters based on riskiness, and we also ultimately decided to provide a single app score. This was done with some reluctance, and it will no doubt be a much-evolving scoring rubric for the next few years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, we believe the best thing the labels can do is objectively report the invisible (or poorly understood) behaviors of the products until such time as definitive harm thresholds can be derived.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a final vital detail regarding the establishment of any labels, and that’s having what I would characterize as exceptional diversity of participants in establishing safety standards. This isn’t lip service. A few years ago, when I started to better see how what was risky for me was very different than what was risky for people who are different from me such as a person of color, or a person with a disability, or an incarcerated person, I woke up one night from a deep sleep with the awareness that any attempt at standardizing or consensus is doomed if it doesn’t have full diversity involved<a>6 </a>. Why this is so is a long and complicated matter. On the one hand, everything ever done should endeavor to have exceptional inclusion of a massively diverse set of participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it also has to do with the fact the software and software driven tech is “alive” and interactive in a way that other products in our lives aren’t. We have a special duty when it comes to product safety of software animated products. We may even need to reconsider what a “product” is. We have seen evidence of the hazards of animated technology not built with adequate understanding of the diversity of users with the embodiment of human bias in automated decision making or with hand dryers that don’t activate for people of color. The point is that technology acts on and with us in a different (and constantly changeable) way than other products. So labeling is both harder and matters more than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>Overall, I remain optimistic that the lens is happily starting to focus on product safety, implicit though it may be. People will be thinking more about labels for technology. And they will see that ISL is already providing labels with privacy risks. We can call out the presence of infinite scroll, and like buttons and other widely recognized as addictive user interface patterns in labels today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, confusion stems from Dr. Murthy’s call for a “warning label” instead of a safety or ingredients label. Technology is cigarettes<a>7</a>. We use the metaphor all the time. Technology today is cigarettes in the 1940s/1950s when just about everybody chain smoked and the harms were likely all anecdotal and pooh-poohed. It took decades to assemble causal evidence. But tech is also much more complicated than cigarettes and a warning label is premature. This is not a compelling argument to say that we don’t deserve to have accurate information on tech’s risky behaviors. As it is right now, we don’t even have an ingredient label for technology. We are flying (tech-ing?) blind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course we need labels. Industry would do well to proactively embrace label enablers like software bills of material, consent receipts, and machine-readable record of processing activities (ROPAs). Because there can be no doubt that labels are imminent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier, I said that we’ve “started”. I say that because our labels only include privacy risks at present. Our labels are deliberately modular and we’ve scoped additional sections:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Risky UI Patterns –like deliberately addictive UI patterns of the sort Dr. Murthy is calling for exposing. Our <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/specifications/isl-safe-software-specification-for-websites-and-mobile-apps-v1-1/">Safe Software Specification for Websites and Mobile Apps</a> already describes measurement of these kinds of risks.&nbsp; 
 Automated Decision-Making Risks&nbsp; 
 Security [client side only] Risks&nbsp; 
 Differences between observed tech behavior and privacy policy and/or terms of service.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>All of these are on our roadmap. We know exactly how to add these sections to the label, it’s strictly a resource and funding issue. If they sound good to you, please <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/donate/">consider supporting our mission</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of course we need labels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Checkmarx, Cisco, Cyware, Google, IBM, Legit Security, Microsoft, Root, SAP, US NSA, CISA, and Others Join Forces to Build a Framework to Complement SBOM Data Formats, CSAF, CycloneDX, OpenVEX, and SPDX</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 20 June 2024 – With escalating cybersecurity threats exploiting software supply chain vulnerabilities, there’s an urgent need for better understanding and proactive measures to identify and prevent future risks. Members of OASIS Open, the global open source and standards organization, have formed the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/tc-osim/">Open Supply Chain Information Modeling (OSIM) Technical Committee</a> (TC) to standardize and promote information models crucial to supply chain security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The aim of OSIM is to build a unifying framework that sits on top of existing SBOM data models–such as CSAF, CycloneDX, OpenVEX, and SPDX. OSIM is not intended to replace or endorse any one of these models. Instead, as an information model, OSIM will bring clarity to software supply chain partners, mitigate vulnerabilities and disruptions, reduce security risks, and make it easier for companies to plan for upgrades and contingencies.</p>



<p>“CISA is excited to be a part of this technical effort to bring greater visibility to the software supply chain,” said Allan Friedman, Senior Technical Advisor at CISA. “We have many of the basic building blocks for software transparency and security, including SBOM, VEX, and CSAF. This work by OASIS will facilitate automation for easier and cheaper implementation and tooling, and help provide a unifying supply chain framework and raise the level of collaboration across industries.”</p>



<p>“OSIM represents an important effort to address the need for greater structure and comprehensibility of software supply chains,” said Isaac Hepworth, Google, and OSIM co-chair. “By establishing standardized information models we can enhance transparency, interoperability, and resilience in end-to-end operations — ultimately aiding cyber risk management and protecting critical infrastructure.”</p>



<p>Recognizing the crucial role of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) in fortifying software supply chain security, the OSIM TC aims to create, for example, a standardized SBOM information model that would enhance understanding and interoperability across diverse SBOM data formats (i.e. SPDX and CycloneDX). Competing data models, like SPDX, CycloneDX, CSAF, and OpenVex, show the need for creating information models that would bring coherence across diverse specifications.</p>



<p>“OSIM’s approach not only drives a universal taxonomy of thought, it also brings clarity and ease to how we implement standards and frameworks to support multiple industry software supply chain security needs. OSIM facilitates the identification of similarities and differences across specifications, enhancing interoperability and simplifying processes. The current cybersecurity landscape can no longer be defended in a silo,” said Jay White, Microsoft, and OSIM co-chair.</p>



<p>The OSIM TC welcomes a diverse range of contributors, including software and hardware vendors, open-source maintainers, technology consultants, business stakeholders, government organizations, and regulatory bodies. Participation is open to all through <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OASIS-OPEN-MEMBERSHIP-AGREEMENT_2024_TC.pdf">membership in OASIS</a>, with interested parties encouraged to join and contribute to shaping the future of supply chain information modeling.</p>



<p>Support for OSIM<br><br>Checkmarx<br>“Checkmarx is proud to be working with OASIS and be part of the OSIM Technical Committee. A major part of Checkmarx’ mission to secure the applications driving our world involves sharing our time, experience, and threat intelligence to help make the software supply chain ecosystem safer. As one of the biggest challenges remains education and closing the knowledge gap, we believe standardization is a crucial step and are committed to assisting in laying the foundations.”<br>– Erez Yalon, VP of Security Research, Checkmarx</p>



<p>Root<br>“The OASIS OSIM is a vital project for enhancing security and trust in the software supply chain. As a part of the OSIM Technical Committee, Root is committed to advancing supply chain security and transparency, aligning perfectly with this initiative’s goals. By collaborating on data schemas, data modeling, and security standards, we aim to improve vulnerability management and software security, ensuring threats are identified and mitigated promptly. This enhances software integrity, benefiting our customers and strengthening trust in the broader digital ecosystem.”<br>– Ian Riopel, CEO, Root.io</p>



<p>SAP SE<br>“Having a unified information model for representation of objects in the supply chain domain would enable efficient integration models and interoperability. Especially with the wave for generative AI, such aligned models can bring benefits in development efficiency , reduced maintenance and operations for upcoming innovations in the domain.”<br>– Gururaj Raman, Chief Development Expert, SAP SE</p>

<p>With tens of billions invested in AI last year and leading players such as OpenAI looking for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0">trillions more,</a> the tech industry is racing to grow large generative AI models. The goal is to steadily demonstrate better performance and, in doing so, close the gap between what humans can do and what can be accomplished with&nbsp;AI.</p><p>There is however another gap that has become strikingly apparent — the AI trust gap. As challenges such as AI hallucinations, bias, and intellectual property slurping continually cause damage, we look into how the base of the current Web could be effectively transformed to support the Verifiable Internet for&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The announced<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2024/06/10/apple-chatgpt-ios-18-heres-how-it-will-work/"> Apple and OpenAI</a> integration signals the trust gap is widening, with Apple users’ data becoming the next frontier for training ChatGPT and questionable transparency on how it is used. This data is so valuable that it <a href="https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/artificial-intelligence/apple-to-pay-openai-through-distribution-not-cash/110955459">reportedly makes up for charges Apple</a> would pay for using costly ChatGPT AI models. The Verifiable Internet for AI shifts this paradigm, making such data transactions transparent on chain with ownership of data taken back by users, who ultimately get to monetize&nbsp;it.</p> Decentralized AI: Intersection of Crypto and&nbsp;AI <p>Having employed the fundamentals of crypto, AI, and knowledge graphs successfully within a <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/overview">plethora of sectors</a>, where trust, transparency, and accuracy are of paramount importance, OriginTrail now integrates Base blockchain with OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), to help drive trust and transparency with neuro-symbolic AI. Instilling information provenance, ownership, and graph structure through blockchains and knowledge graphs together can effectively address the aforementioned problems of AI, as detailed in the most recent <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf">White Paper&nbsp;3.0</a>.</p> Your Body of Knowledge, Your Choice of&nbsp;AI <p>The opportunity of graph algorithms as a foundation for reputation in the age of AI was also highlighted by Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, in a recent&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>“Another piece of a puzzle that I feel could be missing, is something around reputation that’s on chain. You can imagine a version of this that’s like using the graph structure of the chains. To sort of say, okay if I trust this node, and they sent money to this node, that sort of implies some amount of trust. Kind of like a Google Page Rank had an algorithm, something like that could be built on chain.” — Brian Armstrong, CEO of&nbsp;Coinbase</p><p>The recently introduced OriginTrail Paranets (user-controlled on-chain knowledge graphs), enable users total control over their data, connecting it into the DKG decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN), while keeping it safely stored on their devices. Users are then able to choose from a growing selection of open-source AI systems integrated with OriginTrail via <a href="http://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG.ai</a>, a launchpad for user-controlled AI.</p><p>Knowledge graphs with paranets enable transparent on-chain reputation, relevance scoring with PageRank, recommendation engines, graph neural networks, and other AI reasoning applications.</p><p>The first of such knowledge graphs to launch on Base is<a href="https://origintrail.io/blog/announcing-the-id-theory-desci-ipo-initial-paranet-offering"> the DeSci paranet for autonomous scientific research</a> by <a href="https://idtheory.io">ID Theory</a>, crowdsourcing knowledge assets utilizing on-chain reputation via the OriginTrail DKG.</p><p>“<a href="https://x.com/hashtag/DeSci?src=hashtag_click">#DeSci</a> has great potential. Those who have a working product will have the power to forever improve science and the scientific process.” — Brian Armstrong, CEO of&nbsp;Coinbase</p><p>One of the first dapps deployed on the DeSci paranet on Base will be the DeSci AI agent, which will include a knowledge mining interface through which scientific knowledge will be minted on chain, with publishers receiving token incentives.</p><p>“We’re creating a user-friendly hub to coordinate scientific knowledge creation onchain — a co-owned substrate to crowdsource AI and supercharge research and discovery as we know it through autonomous science. The first iteration will focus on neuroscience as it’s very close to our hearts, but the future is boundless. Who knows, crypto might actually cure cancer.” — ID&nbsp;Theory</p>DeSci AI Agent in action built on OriginTrail<p>AI and Crypto, converging together in the OriginTrail DKG can tackle some of the largest challenges while providing users with an inclusive, unbiased, and verifiable way of making mission-critical decisions. As we bring this technology to more data-intensive sectors such as science, the trust layer — blockchain underpinning the neuro-symbolic AI approach made possible by the DKG — needs to fulfill both the scalability and user experience requirements.</p><p>This is where Base can help Trust Thy AI — in a scalable, inclusive, and user-friendly way.</p><p>Make sure to subscribe and follow the next steps as we make AI&nbsp;Base-d.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/trust-thy-ai-artificial-intelligence-base-d-with-origintrail-e866d996ca1c">Trust Thy AI: Artificial Intelligence Base-d with OriginTrail</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Validity + Reliability + Viability = Credibility Image CC BY-ND Visual Thinkery for&nbsp;WAO<p>Digital credentials are playing an increasingly important role in recognising a broad spectrum of skills in the workplace. These range from the tangible to the abstract and innovative, but in all cases, we want credentials that are credible — that is to say, something worth&nbsp;earning.</p><p>In this post, we explore two distinct scenarios, a culinary school and a large organisation looking to recognise and encourage the creativity of its exmployers. In each, the core elements of validity, reliability, and viability are discussed in terms of developing a credible digital credential system&nbsp;.</p> Validity <p>Validity ensures that an assessment accurately measures what it claims to measure. In the context of digital credentials, this means that the assessment process leading to the badge should accurately evaluate the abilities, knowledge, or competencies it is intended to certify. This alignment between the assessment criteria and the attributes it assesses is important. Without strong validity, the integrity of the credential could be questioned, undermining its acceptance by educational institutions and employers.</p>  Culinary School: Issuing badges for skills like knife handling, pastry making, and creative presentation means assessing specific competencies. Each badge must represent true mastery of these skills. Assessments might involve practical tests where students must produce a dish that adheres to professional standards. These practical assessments must be designed to measure relevant culinary skills accurately, ensuring the badge directly reflects the student’s capability.  Creative Organisation: For certifying creativity, the assessments might require participants to propose innovative solutions to real business challenges. These should be evaluated for their originality, practicality, and impact, ensuring the badge reflects genuine creative thinking and problem-solving ability.   Reliability <p>Reliability focuses on the consistency and dependability of the assessment results. A reliable digital credential system ensures that all recipients are evaluated using the same standards, and that these standards are consistently applied. This consistency builds trust in the credentialing system, making the credentials more likely to be recognised across different sectors.</p>  Culinary School: It is crucial that all culinary tests are graded on a consistent rubric. If two students deliver dishes of similar quality, they should both earn the badge. This uniformity builds trust in the credentialing system by affirming its fairness and&nbsp;rigour.  Creative Organisation: When evaluating creative projects, it’s essential that all judges use the same criteria to assess the submissions. This ensures that every employee who meets the standard of creativity receives recognition, maintaining the reliability of the credential across the organisation.   Viability <p>Viability deals with the practical aspects of sustaining an assessment system. This includes considerations such as the costs involved, the resources required, and the technology necessary to issue and maintain the credentials. A viable digital credential system is scalable and sustainable, capable of adapting to growing demands and evolving educational environments.</p>  Culinary School: The school needs a system that can efficiently handle various forms of assessments, from practical cooking exams to theoretical tests. This includes logistical aspects such as scheduling, recording results, and managing digital badges. The technology used must support these activities without prohibitive costs.  Creative Organisation: For a badges relating to creativity, the system should support diverse submission formats and robust communication for feedback. It must also be scalable and adaptable to accommodate a growing number of participants as the organization evolves.   Credibility as convergence <p>In both examples, credibility arises from the effective integration of validity, reliability, and viability. A credible digital credential system not only accurately and consistently evaluates and represents diverse skills — from cooking to creativity — but also operates efficiently and sustainably within its intended scope. This credibility enhances the value of a digital credential, making it a recognized and sought-after mark of achievement.</p> Next steps <p>Understanding and applying the principles of validity, reliability, and viability can enhance the effectiveness and perception of digital credentialing systems. Whether in a culinary school or a large corporation, these principles ensure that credentials issued represent genuine skills and achievements, fostering trust and respect in the digital badges awarded. Through these dual examples, this post demonstrates how these principles can be applied across various disciplines, encouraging readers to think broadly about the potential of digital credentials in their own&nbsp;fields.</p><p>Need help thinking about digital credentials in your organisation? <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/we-are-open-coop">Get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p> Related posts   <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/Badge_Project_Blueprint">Badge Project Blueprint</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/making-credentials-work-for-everyone-13bf7ae86283">Making Credentials Work for Everyone</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/a-compendium-of-credentialing-c8afe73e03bd">A Compendium of Credentialing</a>  <p>Special mention and thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paddy-craven-8544965/">Paddy Craven</a> of City &amp; Guilds, who initially pointed us in the right direction around&nbsp;this!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/building-credibility-into-digital-credentials-59945d07ace0">Building Credibility into Digital Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA) is an alternative to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach, emphasizing the importance of a robust, scalable, and expandable architecture. The MVA methodology mitigates risks associated with reputation, competitiveness, and architectural deficiencies, and fosters collaboration among competitors. Real-world examples, such as SSL/TLS and the Gordian system, illustrate the successful implementation of MVA in software development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A business methodology focused on producing a Minimum Viable Product blossomed in the 21st century. Unfortunately, it can set businesses up for future failure because it doesn’t properly define the larger architecture that is needed to evolve a product past its earliest, minimal state.</p>

 The Old Methodology: Minimum Viable Product 

<p>A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a business methodology that advocates creating the simplest possible version of a product as a first release, to see if the market responds positively, or else to understand why it doesn’t<a>1</a>. If an MVP is successful, possibly through iterations of the initial work, the product can then be grown and ultimately find large-scale success in the market.</p>

<p>Twitter has long been used as an example of an MVP that did great, with Dropbox and Facebook being other examples of MVPs<a>2</a> (to various extents). By the criteria of these companies, MVP would seem to be a win-win methodology.</p>

<p>However, they’re not the full story.</p>

 MVP Biases 

<p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, current literature about Minimum Viable Products suffers from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">Survivorship Bias</a>. We hear about the success of companies that used MVPs, but we don’t know that their doing so actually led to success. In fact, the successes that we see might just be a false signal.</p>

<p>How many hundreds or even thousands of companies pursuing MVPs failed for each Twitter or Facebook that succeeded? How many companies found that they couldn’t scale their MVP, realized that they couldn’t take commercial advantage of an otherwise successful MVP, or simply were beaten by competitors with even more viable products?</p>

<p>We can’t measure the success of the MVP methodology by the anecdotal success of a few individual companies.</p>

 MVP Dangers 

<p>The MVP system also has other dangers.</p>

<p>Some of these are related to company brand. Though a new company doesn’t have a reputation to damage, a series of unsuccessful MVPs could nonetheless curtail their future opportunities. Meanwhile, a more mature company might find their existing reputation blemished by a poor MVP. This is especially true today, as companies are increasingly saying that MVPs can be poor-quality releases<a>3</a>. That didn’t work out that well for Cyberpunk 2077, one of the highest profile and most controversial computer game releases of recent years, even though (like many modern-day computer games) it wasn’t quite released as an MVP, but not in a fully complete form either<a>4</a>.</p>

<p>There are also competitive dangers. Within a developmental niche, MVPs only work if everyone pursues them; otherwise, an MVP built on solid ideas could easily be out-competed by a firm who produced a slightly more mature prototype. Similarly, a company with more resources might be able to scoop up the ideas in a MVP and replicate them to their own advantage<a>5</a>.</p>

<p>However the biggest dangers of MVPs are probably architectural. By defining an MVP, a company can easily ignore the larger architecture issues that would have once been considered before starting work on any serious release. This can cause problems with scaling, with missing features that can’t easily be added, and with locked-in decisions that become part of the final product.</p>

<p>Twitter (“X”), for example, didn’t finalize its network architecture design until 2010<a>6</a>, four years after its advent. It would have been easy for a better architected social-medium system to get in there first; the fact that no one did is one of the pieces of luck that led to Twitter’s ultimate success. In fact, one of the developers at Twitter has noted this, saying: “In the end, Twitter barely made it, and product progress was slow for years due to post facto infrastructure investment.”<a>7</a></p>

<p>The biases and dangers implicit in MVPs suggest the need to at least experiment with other methodologies for product releases. The huge problems implicit in the potential lack of architecture in an MVP also suggest what that alternative methodology should be: a Minimum Viable Architecture.</p>

 A New Methodology: Minimum Viable Architecture 

<p>Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA)<a>8</a> is a methodology that has been discussed in somewhat different forms over the last several years. It doesn’t focus on the simplest product that can be released to consumers, but instead on the simplest architecture that can support future development within a product’s technological ecosystem.</p>

<p>The goal of an MVA is still to create a product that doesn’t strain the resources of a company and that doesn’t create a situation where a company’s ultimate success or failure depends on that singular release. However, that simple product must be created with the understanding of a larger architecture that has enough flexibility<a>9</a> that designers can fill in gaps in that architecture in the future. It’s just that the decisions for filling in those gaps are delayed as much as possible<a>10</a>. It’s a melding of agile methodologies with architectural concerns.</p>

<p>Though an MVA could be created with a full understanding of future expansions that may or may not be ultimately accomodated, it’s more powerful to create an MVA that is modular and expandable — that doesn’t depend on the architect thinking of everything, but instead future-proofs itself so that the architecture could include unthought-of elements in the future. As Jorge Lebrato says: “The architecture remains cohesive and each piece cooperates with the others, despite having had different rhythms.” The best MVA is a compromise between entirely ignoring the architecture (as is likely in an MVP) and designing it entirely (which would likely result in time cost and waste)<a>11</a>.</p>

 MVA Examples 

<p>The following examples contain some real-world usages of MVA instead of MVP.</p>

 SSL/TLS 

<p>When I co-authored the TLS spec in the ’90s, I did my best to future-proof it by simultaneously constraining the design and giving it enough flexibility to be expanded in the future. This is an example of a Minimum Viable Architecture whose usefulness has proven itself: TLS is now the most deployed security system on the internet, at the heart of almost every shopping, financial, or banking transaction.</p>

<p>This future-proofing was thanks in part to our architecting elements that we suspected would be required in the future, but which couldn’t be deployed in the then-present, primarily due to CPU limitations. Perfect forward secrecy<a>12</a> is an example. Users were able to simply turn it on when its usage became viable on standard hardware platforms.</p>

<p>However, our more notable work in creating an MVA came from our inclusion of ciphersuites. These are powerful encryption and decryption rules that do the actual cryptographic work of TLS. By defining them as modular plug-ins, we supported the future innovation of TLS, even in ways that we could not envision. And, there was considerable innovation. TLS 1.2 had 37 ciphersuites, though that dropped back to five with TLS 1.3<a>13</a>.</p>

 The Gordian System 

<p></p>

<p>One of my most recent endeavors is Blockchain Commons’ Gordian system<a>14</a>, which is a layered architecture for protecting digital assets and identity that has seen early successes with the protection of seeds with systems like SSKR<a>15</a> and CSR<a>16</a> and that focuses on the Gordian Principles of independence, resilience, privacy, and openness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockchain Commons’ Mission: Advocating for the creation of open, interoperable, secure &amp; compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to create an MVA that future-proofs the Gordian products, the Gordian architecture identifies points of potential interoperability and breaks the architecture into discrete components across those interoperable interfaces, thus allowing individual elemetns to be replaced. This was done both at the large-scale application level and at the small-scale programmatic level. It’s important everywhere.</p>

<p>At the large-scale application level, the Gordian system achieves interoperability by the careful architecting of both discrete applications and the ways that they can interact. Airgaps are a traditional methodology for introducing security into a digital asset system<a>17</a>, but the Gordian system has expanded that to include Torgaps<a>18</a>, which is a way for making transactions between connected applications both secure and non-correlatable. This modular approach is one way to enable future-proofing, and it’s only strengthed by systems such as airgaps and torgaps that tightly constrain communications between the modules.</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>At the small-scall programmatic level, the Gordian system introduces a layered stack of specifications that together enable the private and secure transmission of sensitive data. This stack includes dCBOR<a>19</a>, Bytewords<a>20</a>, URs<a>21</a>, Animated QRs<a>22</a>, Envelope<a>23</a>, Gordian Transport Protocol<a>24</a>, and Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol<a>25</a>. Together these specifications allow for the deterministic storage of binary data (dCBOR), the alphabetic representation of binary data (Bytewords), the tagged display of that representation with functionality to support multipart data (URs), the QR display of multipart data (animated QRs), the structured &amp; smart storage of content (Envelope), the communication of Envelopes (GTP), and the secure communication of Envelopes (GSTP). But we didn’t know what all the layers would be when we got started: this is another example of future-proofing, and one that easily arises from carefully layered specifications.</p>

<p>Similarly, when Blockchain Commons creates its progressive use cases we focus first on the requirements without needing to know the technology. The technological specifics can be filled in by ourselves or individual vendors in the future.</p>

<p>By abstracting and separating architectural elements—whether they be large-scale components, layered specifications, or additional requirements found in progressive use cases—the Gordian system will be able to incorporate options that we are not even considering. The ultimate goal of all of these designs is to ensure that our MVA architecture  does not limit itself, but instead remains flexible for the future.</p>



 
    
   

 Other MVA Examples 

<p>This type of MVA thinking is a pattern that can be widely successful and that doesn’t create some of the limitations that appear in MVP thinking. For example, when I was supporting the creation of the earliest specifications for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)<a>26</a>, I was pleased to see us arrive at a compromise where core DID specifications were separated from specific DID methods and from signature suites. It’s an architecture that allows for a lot of future expansion.</p>

<p>Similarly, some of my earliest Blockchain Commons work was with a company who was adapting the Gordian architecture. Even though they weren’t planning to initially implement multi-sigs, I ensured that they don’t make decisions that would lock them out of multi-sig usage in the future, because I was thinking of a MVA that went beyond the MVP they were focused on.</p>

 Coda: The Benefits of Coopetition 

<p>It can be quite hard for a single company to figure out an MVA. Thus, it’s great to work with other companies in your technology space.</p>

<p>This is particularly true if your industry supports coopetition, where business competitors can work together for a mutually beneficial good. If an industry  supports interoperability, or one company adding services to another company’s products, then it’s a great candidate for coopetition—and thus MVAs are even more likely to be successful.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has been able to take advantage of this. A variety of companies have participated in the Gordian Developer Community community<a>27</a>, each contributing their own ideas and requirements for the Gordian architecture. In turn, they’ve then gone off and created open-source libraries that adapt the architecture<a>28</a>, before beginning work on their own wallets that use the MVA that we cooperatively designed. A not-for-profit organization can be a great support for MVA work of this type; that’s what Blockchain Commons does.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Hollowing out spaces in architectures for future development and creating flexibility for the future through modular designs are two of the most successful methods for turning an MVP into an MVA. They give you something that supports minimal investment and agile development, while simultaneously maximizing the ability to scale and expand in the future.</p>

<p>We don’t always know the right solutions. We can’t predict what will work best. So the best we can do is create architectures that won’t lock us in to specific decisions about the future. By doing so, especially by working in coopetition to do so, we also ensure that no one company will lock us or our users into futures that we don’t agree with.</p>

Hopefully that means we’re moving in this direction!</p>

<p>On June 18, 2024 the OpenID Foundation’s Executive Director, Gail Hodges, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RAkY_Km9m8w?si=1m2P3bIPi-NoAmZB&amp;t=11691">spoke about Digital Identity at the G20</a> during the Digital Government and Inclusion Workshop. The following are her prepared remarks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bom dia and hello. I’d first like to applaud the Brazilian Government for your impressive work on Digital Identity here, in Brazil, and your G20 leadership. Brazil is modeling the kind of multi-stakeholder approach we need to enable Digital Public Infrastructure, data sharing and Digital Identity. The G20 is ideal forum to accelerate work in this area globally.</p>
<p>Today I’d like to suggest a vision for Digital Identity. We have a UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9 for Identity, with the principle that 8 billion people should have access to an identity credential. What should our goal be for Digital Identity? Should 8 billion people also have the right to a digital identity credential? How can we achieve social inclusion if all 8 billion do not have the option to fully participate in the digital economy?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we have a Digital Identity for everyone, what should it feel like? I suggest that it should be as easy for people to assert their Digital Identity credential as it is to assert their email or phone number.</p>
<p>It is possible to achieve these goals – the technology is not the barrier. But it will take G20 leadership, national leadership, multi-stakeholder collaboration (like our conversation today), and crucially… it will take global open standards.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is one of the open standards bodies at the center of Digital Identity specification development. We seek to offer secure and interoperable standards that respect domestic sovereignty. Our most popular standard is OpenID Connect, which is currently used by over 3 billion people across millions of applications. The OpenID Foundation also supports 28+ countries that have selected our OpenID for Verifiable Credential specifications, and another 12 countries have selected the OpenID Foundation’s high security profile for data sharing called FAPI. In fact, Brazil is one jurisdiction where FAPI was selected, and the OIDF is proud to supports Brazil’s Open Finance and Open Insurance programs by offering certification to all ecosystem participants.</p>
<p>Last year the OpenID Foundation and 12 other non-profits announced a white paper titled “<a href="https://openid.net/human-centric-digital-identity-whitepaper/">Human-Centric Digital Identity</a>” in conjunction with the OECD’s Recommendations on the Governance of Digital Identity. In that paper we recognized that countries have a mix of operating models that align to their technical implementations. Some countries lean to centralized modeled others to “decentralized” models. Some countries are government-led and others are private sector-led.&nbsp; From our vantage point all of these are legitimate models. There is no single way to develop and deliver a Digital Identity program. However, if you want to achieve social inclusion and a human-centric approach, you need to stare hard at your domestic model to ensure no one is left behind.</p>
<p>So what about your country? For those of you in countries at the start of your Digital Identity journey, I suggest you answer one critical question early on in your program development. Will you use global standards or will you develop your own local specifications? It is your choice. But I encourage you to take that decision at the most senior levels. Global standards offer you confidence in the security model, technical interoperability, the ability to scale, interoperability across borders, and it is resistant to vendor and consulting provider lock-in. Local standards could place limitations on the ability of your people and your businesses to thrive outside of the local context, and it could open you up to security threats if you become the “weakest link” relative to your peers. Even if you choose to leverage open source code, I encourage you to ensure that the open source code and your local implementations are certified as conformant to global open standards.</p>
<p>I assure you, the trend is already toward global standards. It was the rallying cry in Cape Town last month during ID4Africa. In recent weeks I was delighted to hear friends focused on the global south countries from the World Bank, UNDP, GovStack, MOSIP, Center of Digital Public Infrastructure all encouraging use of global standards and moving towards certification to global standards. Similarly, the European Digital Wallet program has been shaking up stakeholders in the global north with its Architectural Reference Framework, which leverages global standards that all EU member states will need to conform to so that European countries can interoperate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Digital Identity standards are complicated: there is not a single place or a single playbook to follow at this time. I encourage you to embrace the complexity. The strategy you develop could well include global standards from ISO, the IETF, the W3C, the OpenID Foundation, as well as best practices from other organizations like NIST to help avoid bias in your biometric algorithms – and you might want to consider using open source code to help you accelerate down the adoption curve. Either way, you are likely going to have to embrace some complexity in-house in order for your residents and businesses to benefit from simple user experiences.</p>
<p>Some of you represent countries with mature Digital Identity programs. We applaud you for being early adopters. I have a different question for you. How will you serve your residents and businesses that need to transact across borders? Is it worth investing in capabilities that will allow cross-border interoperability? You might want to ask yourselves, what percentage of your GDP is driven by cross-border trade, how important your global diaspora is, and / or how often your citizens travel abroad. Or you might look at Digital Identity in terms of how it can enhance your national security posture.&nbsp;&nbsp; With $1.4T lost annually to cybercrime globally, we all have room to improve to better protect our residents, our businesses, and our security posture. I also encourage countries with mature Digital Identity programs to take a leadership role in the work to develop global open standards, and to work on achieving cross-border interoperability of digital identity in practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; As David said in the earlier panel, the transformation and Digital Identity leadership in the global south is impressive … but global south representatives and the entities that fund their transformation are much less active in global standards bodies working on Digital Identity.</p>
<p>Earlier, I offered a vision of what good can look like: 8 billion people with Digital Identity, using their credentials seamlessly. But what does it look like when it goes wrong and we do not have global standards? One example is the train tracks where train gauges do not line up and people and goods have to move from one train to another.</p>
<p>In a new project called the Sustainable and Interoperable Digital Identity HUB or SIDI Hub, we are challenging ourselves to tackle the question of cross-border interoperability of Digital Identity. SIDI Hub is a multi-stakeholder community comprised of more than 25 countries from the global north and global south, 25 non-profits, and many of the major multinational organizations. In the last 7 months since we formed SIDI Hub, we held 3 summits on two continents, and we will have three more summit on three additional continents this year. We encourage the G20 to leverage multi-stakeholder forums like the SIDI Hub to ensure that the principles you develop can be implemented in practice, all the way down to the protocol layer, in a way that millions of developers will be able implement against those policies by default. Only then can your residents benefit from digital identity as a “public good”.</p>
<p>I will leave you with one last tip. If you want to achieve domestic or global interoperability, you need to test and certify implementations to a common specification, and then maintain conformance to that specification. When you multiply this by millions of entities — and millions of developers— testing, certification and conformance become pivotal.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>The following comments were made in response to other speakers and the Q&amp;A:</p>
<p></p>
<p>First I’d like to agree with Adam: that the critical path for any jurisdiction is domestic use cases. My ask is to ensure that each G20 jurisdiction reserve some thought for cross-border interoperability. We have heard from Adam about the progress with the EU in cross-border interoperability, and we know in the African Union they also want to enable cross-border trade and interoperability of Digital Identity deployments across Africa. From Husdon’s comments we know that Latin American interoperability is also growing in interest, and if we had an Asian representative on the panel we would probably hear the same from them.</p>
<p>I’d like to elaborate on one of the key ways we need to enable cross border Digital Identity. It starts with identifying use cases. To date with SIDI Hub we have identified 30 potential “champion” cross-border use cases. Let me offer four examples that are bubbling towards the top.</p>
 
 In Africa, the most popular use case was “cross-border trade” – helping people living lives along a geographic border, a use case that ranked lower in Europe for obvious reasons. 
 A second use case was “helping people assert their educational and employment certifications across borders” a use case that can serve all migrants whether they are high income or low income. 
 A third example is the “refugee” use case.&nbsp; UNHCR currently cares for 120 million refugees and they need to deliver on their mission to serve these individuals from the countries they originate from, through the UN system including host countries, all the way to any future destination country or back to their home jurisdiction. 
 The fourth example is “opening a bank account” which can be for students, employee relocations or any other migration use case. 
 
<p>We will not select “champion use cases” until later this year, but we already know that we need these use cases to be able to flesh out the minimum technical requirements to enable cross border interoperability and to map the trust frameworks across borders.</p>
<p>About the OpenID Foundation</p>
 The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities.

					 Centering Students and Using AI within Meaningful Learning Environments
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room B</p>
<p>“How can AI be used to enhance meaningful learning environments in culturally responsive ways? This session focuses on innovative ways AI tools can be used in the classroom to support meaningful learning experiences and culturally responsive teaching. When designing meaningful learning experiences, teachers use AI to engage students in activities that are active, collaborative, constructive, authentic, and goal directed. Culturally responsive teaching is a student centered approach that enriches how AI tools are used within meaningful learning experiences.This happens when teachers situate students’ lived experiences, frames of reference, and ways of being as resources for learning. Participants will be provided a process for designing meaningful learning experiences, a list of AI tools that promote meaningful engagement, and a culturally responsive framework that advances meaningful technology integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session also addresses educational inequities that surface when learning experiences lack meaningfulness. Teacher centered practices have historically been related to passive technology use, deficit based beliefs about students’ potential, “one size fits all” instruction, and curricular choices that do not account for diversity. As a result, teacher centered approaches have and continue to perpetuate opportunity gaps that disproportionately impact students from historically marginalized communities. To bridge digital divides and fill opportunity gaps, participants will be exposed to the strategies, beliefs, conditions, and tools that support the shift towards student centeredness. “</p>

					 Using AI Avatar Patients to Increase Student Readiness
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room A</p>
<p>Educators need to prepare students to enter the workforce post-graduation. Student’s readiness, which includes perceptions of knowledge, attitude, and ability, manifests in one’s sense of self-efficacy and is influenced by experiences. Additionally, experiences are impacted by context-specific readiness. The Context and Implementation of Complex Interventions framework defines context as a set of characteristics and circumstances that are active, unique, and embedded in the experience. Contextual readiness includes socio-political, community, organization, financial, and learning resources and opportunities that influence the experience. Experiences should promote active learning and simulate real-world scenarios to foster student readiness appropriately. Developing and delivering real-world learning experiences presents many challenges, including contextual characteristics, limited space for hands-on engagement, increased staffing needs, scheduling conflicts, and costs associated with patient actors or experiential opportunities. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) can address these challenges. AI is a computing system that can engage in human-like processes such as learning, synthesizing, self-correction, and data integration for complex processing tasks. AI technologies generate human-like content in response to complex and varied prompts and, blended with VR, immerse the user in simulated environments to make the experience more thoughtful and interactive, allowing for repeated practice to enhance skill development, conservation of resources, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>This panel presentation will describe the pedological design and implementation of AI avatar patients into healthcare interprofessional curricula. It will present data on financial impact and students’ perceived readiness post-AI-VR experiences and offer recommendations for future integration into the broader educational curriculum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Partnership aims to unlock up to $1.3 trillion of dormant Layer 1 Value, as US consumers get excited about the 3rd Age of Bitcoin</p>
<p>Location, Singapore, June 27th 2024: Elastos, the SmartWeb ecosystem provider, has announced a partnership with the L2 provider, BEVM, to develop a peer-to-peer Bitcoin-denominated loan offering around the former’s BeL2 protocol. Together the companies believe they can unlock up to $1.3 Trillion of dormant Layer 1 Bitcoin Value, which is supported by data from the latest <a></a>Elastos’ BIT (Bitcoin; Innovation &amp; Trust) Index suggesting more than two-thirds of US tech-savvy consumers are comfortable using Bitcoin.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Collateralize 80% of assets while the Bitcoin Layer is untouched 
<p>Elastos believes momentum is building around the Third Age of Bitcoin, where users will be able to transact using Native Bitcoin. Partnering with BEVM to develop this Bitcoin Native loan product will allow users to collateralize up to 80% of their assets in return for L2 credit (stable coins, for instance) based on terms defined in a Bitcoin-assured smart contract. The integrity of the currency is assured by BeL2’s unique ZK-proof process which means the Bitcoin Layer is untouched as the process can be completed without bridging, wrapping or otherwise interfering with the Bitcoin Layer. This maintains the integrity of the currency and avoids network congestion and additional fees that would otherwise result. This approach enables Elastos and BEVM to deliver a genuinely peer-to-peer loan product, which is completely disintermediated and anonymous. &nbsp;Verification (potentially through third party services) and resulting costs/delays would only be required in the event of a dispute between the two parties.</p>
<p>“The BeL2 protocol perfectly reflects what BEVM is all about; developing and supporting EVM-compatible DApps which can run in the Ethereum ecosystem to operate on Bitcoin L2. &nbsp;The loan offering is the perfect illustration of how such services could revolutionize the finance sector,” Hakan Sezikli, Co-founder of the BEVM Foundation.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Enabling Insight via BTC Oracle 
<p>Launched in December ’23, the <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-bel2-bitcoin-layer-2-solution/">Bitcoin Elastos Layer2</a> (BeL2) protocol is a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, enabling multiple functionalities such as staking and smart contracts to be denominated directly in the World’s most popular digital currency. BEVM will be collaborating with the Elastos’ BeL2 protocol to deliver a BTC Oracle to monitor and analyze all Bitcoin-based activity in real time. &nbsp;As the BeL2 protocol enables Bitcoin users to manage, literally, any relationship through the currency – from simple staking (‘interest’), to complex multi-party agreements through smart contracts – the BTC Oracle will become a vital source of insight into how the currency is being used.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 US tech-savvy consumers trust Bitcoin 
<p>This partnership comes as new data from the Elastos’ BIT (Bitcoin; Innovation &amp; Trust) Index indicates growing excitement among US tech-savvy consumers for Bitcoin. 63% of ‘tech savvy’ consumers feel either ‘perfectly comfortable’ or, even, ‘excited’ about transacting in Bitcoin and over half respondents in the US are using Bitcoin at least once a month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Respondents to the survey also suggest they trust Bitcoin as much as online banking or cash to protect savings:</p>
 
 24% US respondents would place most trust in Bitcoin 
 Compared with 25% who place most trust in online banks 
 23% who place their trust in cash 
 
<p></p>
<p>“What this data shows is that we’re reaching an inflection point in the understanding and embrace of crypto-currencies among early adopters in the US that reflects the global trend towards the Third Age of Bitcoin,” said Rong Chen, co-founder, Elastos. “We are on the verge of Bitcoin delivering a new era commerce, where users are in charge of their data and are no longer beholden to the Web 2 tech giants. This data shows there is work to do to encourage broader adoption in the US, but at Elastos it is our mission to develop technologies that will make it easier to interact and transact with Bitcoin.”</p>

<p>Policy experts from Africa, Europe, Latin America, and North America outlined next steps for global AI regimes and networked capacity&nbsp;building</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nasa?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">NASA</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/photo-of-outer-space-Q1p7bh3SHj8?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a><p>By Lis Sylvan &amp; Niharika Vattikonda</p><p>Nearly a year and a half after the introduction of ChatGPT, artificial intelligence remains in the regulatory hot seat. While the EU AI Act put the so-called Brussels Effect into play, more regions across the globe are now weighing risks, rights, economic opportunities, and regional needs. On May 28th, the <a href="https://networkofcenters.net/">Global Network of Centers of Internet &amp; Society Research Centers</a> (NoC) and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at Harvard University (BKC) hosted a group of policy experts from Africa, Latin America, the US, and the EU to discuss this state of global AI regulation and outline next steps for collaboration across continents.</p><p>Lis Sylvan, Senior Director of Strategy and Programming at BKC, moderated the discussion with Carlos Affonso de Souza (Director of the Institute of Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro), Mason Kortz (Clinical Instructor at the Cyberlaw Clinic at BKC), Gabriele Mazzini (European Commission, chief architect of the EU AI Act), and Ridwan Oloyede (Certa Foundation, coauthor of their recent “State of AI Regulation in Africa” report), with NoC Executive Director Armando Guio providing behind-the-scenes support. The group delved into how governments are weighing sectoral versus horizontal regulatory approaches; the role of the administrative state and existing data protection and competition regulators; the new models of AI regulation in Rwanda and Brazil; the impact of the EU AI Act across all jurisdictions; and the potential for truly global governance.</p> Origins and Approaches <p>De Souza contextualized the current moment of global AI regulation as a decade-long journey of AI regulation that started with charters and declarations of governing principles from various governments and entities. Over time, those charters and principles were reflected in national AI strategies, which have been in the works for five years and can be seen as the precursor to AI regulation; Brazil’s AI regulatory evolution, for example, closely followed this time frame. De Souza highlighted the impact of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on this evolution; after GDPR took effect, countries have established data protection authorities that have largely been the main point of contact for early AI governance. As a result of GDPR, he said, “data protection may be an accelerator, may be an entry point for countries in the majority world, because that’s the conversation that we have been having in the last decade, and that’s where resources [and] attention had been moving forward in those countries.” However, he cautioned against using data protection law as the sole basis of AI regulation, because the data protection framework does not necessarily address the full scope of challenges raised by the development of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Mazzini explained that the technical discussions about the EU’s proposed AI legislation date back to 2019. One of the key concerns with a sectoral approach, he said, was the risk of privileging certain sectors over others. The horizontal approach, though, results in added complexity as regulators needed to find regulations that would work across sectors and avoid repetitions; moreover, the scope of EU legislation is limited by the exclusion of national security, military, and defense sectors. While the EU AI Act takes an omnibus approach, Mazzini said it did not make sense to regulate AI as its own technology but rather a general-purpose tool with a variety of applications.</p><p>“What was clear to me since the get-go is that It didn’t make sense to regulate AI as a technology as such, because indeed what we are dealing with is a general purpose technology that has a variety of applications that we don’t even foresee today…” said Mazzini, “…and therefore, from my perspective, the idea to establish rules for the technology as such, regardless of its use, didn’t make any sense…We came up with this approach of establishing rules depending on the specific use to which that account is put, with the greatest burden, from a regulatory point of view, being on the high risk,” which Mazzini outlined to include applications of the technology that are linked to health and safety, including medical devices, automated cars, and&nbsp;drones.</p> Sectoral and Regional Approaches <p>In the U.S. and in the African Union, regulatory agencies have found it more effective to apply existing laws — across data protection, competition, consumer protection, employment, and other sectors — to govern AI, often taking a sectoral approach. Oloyede said that data protection authorities and competition authorities have largely driven the initial AI regulatory agenda, as these authorities are best equipped to enforce consumer protection, data protection, intellectual property, and competition laws as the basis for national AI governance strategies. “We might see some sort of like a clearinghouse model image where not every country in Africa, for example, will try to come up with a specific AI regulation,” Oloyede&nbsp;said.</p><p>Oloyede indicated that the sector-based approach has been dominant on the African continent, with countries including Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Rwanda, and Egypt beginning to develop roadmaps for AI governance and establish regulatory task forces. Oloyede said the sectoral approach has allowed regulators to develop specific policies for the deployment of AI in healthcare, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>According to Mason Kortz, this sectoral approach is typically favored in the U.S. because the U.S. regulatory approach values subject-matter expertise over technical expertise. The U.S. will likely have subject-matter experts regulate AI in their own domains, Kortz said — for example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development would regulate AI for housing. The U.S. approach relies on the country’s strong administrative state and directs specific federal agencies to take on different pieces of AI regulation. Meanwhile, certain state laws have sought to regulate specific use cases of AI in housing and employment contexts.</p><p>Kortz also noted that the current approach in the U.S. is a confirmation that existing rights-based regimes will be applied or extended to harms resulting from the use of AI systems; with a notoriously slow legislature, he said, only making small changes as needed is an advantageous approach, particularly when existing enforcement agencies may already have the power to make those changes. The U.S. common law system is well-suited to this approach, he said, as it lends judges relatively strong power to reinterpret the law in ways that are binding on lower courts without necessarily having to rewrite civil&nbsp;code.</p><p>“When it comes to some of the more rights-based statutes we have,” Kortz said, “I think, actually, we have a pretty good governance model right there, and we just need some small adjustments around the edges to modernize those statutes and bring them in line, not just with AI, but hopefully, if not future-proof them, at least provide a little more stability for whatever comes next after AI.” However, Kortz allowed that AI is so fundamentally transformative that certain existing laws, such as intellectual property law and copyright doctrine, may not be enough and global harmonization of AI laws should be a priority.</p> Global Collaboration and&nbsp;Capacity <p>Oloyede indicated that African countries have introduced solutions at the level of the Global Privacy Congress, although these solutions will need to reflect differing national and regional interests. Mazzini noted that generative AI and general-purpose AI create additional issues that require international collaboration — fighting misinformation, he said, will require such collaboration. However, de Souza cautioned that regulatory transformation must keep in mind how those laws will be applied in the future. In some cases, he noted, new liability regimes for AI are now stricter than the remaining body of law; Costa Rica, for example, has adopted a strict liability approach for high-risk uses of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>“If we turn out to have the chapters of liability on our AI laws more severe than what we have in our general law for other situations, if we are all in agreement that, in the future, AI is going to be in everything, the legislators that are designing those laws today, they are designing general laws on liability, because we will have AI in almost all sectors,” de Souza remarked. “So the decisions that we’re making today on liability, they might end up scrapping the provisions that you have on your civil code, consumer protection code, because the AI law will be the law that is more recent, more specific, and that may be the one that will be applying in most&nbsp;cases.”</p><p>This international collaboration will require capacity building across the globe, and Mazzini emphasized that the EU AI Act has prompted additional work to support the authorities in the EU that will implement and enforce the regulation. Although the AI Act will impact multiple private sectors, he said, its public enforcement will require both financial and knowledge-based resources. De Souza noted that the Brussels Effect will prompt a need for global bureaucracy to support global compliance with the EU AI Act, and well-resourced national authorities are needed to support that implementation. Oloyede, however, said that lessons learned from the GDPR rollout may inform a better approach to implementing the EU AI Act with a more nuanced understanding of the local context. While the EU AI Act will require capacity building to support new governance bodies with funding and resources, he said, it is essential to preserve existing collaborations with data protection and competition authorities and empower those authorities to address AI in their own&nbsp;domains.</p><p>Despite different countries taking more sectoral versus horizontal approaches, the global community is working to establish flexible approaches to AI governance in their respective regions. As Oloyede said, “AI is here today. Tomorrow is going to be a different technology. And we can’t keep legislating for every new technology that we have.” Mazzini described a need for international coordination when he said, “when it comes to this new type of AI that is sometimes is called ‘generative AI’ or ‘general purpose AI’ that we have specifically regulated in the EU — notably in the last few weeks, in final stages of the negotiations — I think I would like to see there certainly more international coordination, because there we are dealing with a number of questions that I think are pretty common across jurisdictions.”</p><p>Though approaches across the globe may be different, a common cross-cutting theme of the work is balance: protecting rights versus supporting innovation, legislating a critical technology while its capacity and impact is still developing, and providing necessary limitations while allowing nimble innovation.</p><p>The <a href="https://networkofcenters.net/">Network of Internet &amp; Society Research Centers (NoC)</a> is a collaborative initiative among academic institutions with a focus on interdisciplinary research on the development, social impact, policy implications, and legal issues concerning the Internet. The Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University served as NoC Secretariat from 2020–2023 and continues to participate in cross-national, cross-disciplinary conversation, debate, teaching, learning, and engagement.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/global-ai-regulation-protecting-rights-leveraging-collaboration-b0da8e6a704d">Global AI Regulation: Protecting Rights; Leveraging Collaboration</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

		<p>Dear Edge Community,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well. As we continue to adapt to the industry changes brought about by VMware’s acquisition by Broadcom, I want to share some important updates and reaffirm our dedication to assisting you through these transitions.</p>
<p>Pricing Changes Post-Acquisition: Following Broadcom’s post-acquisition adjustments to VMware’s licensing, contracting, and operational model, Edge will no longer manage an Enterprise Licensing Agreement (ELA) on behalf of our members. As a result, Edge will not be responsible for negotiating pricing, co-terming licensing dates, or participating in the quoting and billing process.</p>
<p>VMware Horizon Update: VMware Horizon is becoming a new organization, separate from VMware/Broadcom, called Omnissa. Licensing for Horizon must be procured separately from VMware and can also be fulfilled by partners like Carahsoft.</p>
<p>What This Means for Members:</p>
<p>Members will need to procure Broadcom/VMware licensing through standard reseller channels. Discounting will be determined by negotiations between each member and Broadcom/the reseller.</p>
<p>Edge still has procurement vehicles available for members to quickly process orders. These include:</p>
 
 The EdgeMarket TeCHS contract, fulfilled by SHI. 
 Other preferred resellers through our convenience contract via Carahsoft. 
 
<p>Additionally, Carahsoft will continue to assist the VMware reseller community in preparing your pricing and quotes.</p>

<p>Nick Price, who co-chairs DIF’s Travel &amp; Hospitality SIG and Nick Lambert, CEO of DIF member Dock Labs explored the potential for decentralized identity to revolutionize the traveler experience during a discussion with Rob Otto of Ping Identity, Cadrick Widmann of cidas and Roger Olivieira, co founder of Ver.id at EIC in Berlin last week.&nbsp;</p><p>Nick Price: “Hotels are still stressed about verifying and storing passport information. They have a very large number of customers on file, and a very low amount of usable information. You’re not surprised when they ask whether you have stayed before, though you’ve stayed many times. Decentralized identity promises a substantial improvement in these areas.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of the valuable information that makes travel work will be self-attested. Travel is not just about crossing the border or making a transaction, it’s about 'This is me, I'm a vegetarian, I like some extra legroom on the flight', et cetera. </p><p>"Travel companies need that information. The customer wants to give it to us, but they don’t currently have the tools to do it. This is exactly what we’re building for a large project in the Middle East: a decentralized identity journey for the traveler across airlines, transport, hotels and the tourism experience.” </p><p>Rob Otto: “What consumers really want is a value exchange. When I give you my data, use it to improve my experience. Maybe I even want the hotel to know how I'm feeling today, so I present an 'introvert or extrovert' credential.”&nbsp;</p><p>"You don’t need decentralized identity to figure out someone is staying at a hotel for the tenth time, you just need a system that isn’t stupid.”&nbsp;</p><p>Nick Lambert: “People do care about privacy, but it’s incumbent on us to provide that control over their data. For example, if you want to book a hotel or hire a car, you only want to provide the information the hotel or car hire company needs. </p><p>"From an organizational perspective, holding all that data centrally is a honeypot for hackers to target and sell, as well as a GDPR / CCPA compliance risk. Companies are keen to get rid of the liability and pass it over to customers."&nbsp;</p><p>Roger Olivieira: “There are new regulations coming up where you won’t be allowed to store this data any more. Digital wallets are a good solution. They do three things very well: authentication, consent and digital signatures." </p><p>Cadrick Widmann: “But it’s hard for users to download a wallet just for one use case.”</p><p>Nick Lambert: “True. The user experience needs to be better than what exists today. For example, staff at Condatis (an Edinburgh-based CIAM provider, and DIF member) use decentralized identity to enter the office and access systems remotely, which is great. The challenge is integration with legacy systems.”</p><p>Roger Olivieira: “We solve that problem by putting a service provider between wallets and platforms, using common protocols like AuthO / OpenID Connect."&nbsp;</p><p></p>

 How to think about the three-sided marketplace of skills validation CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>After more than a decade of working with digital credentials like <a href="https://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a>, we still sometimes hear the sceptical question: “Who’s asking for&nbsp;this?”</p><p>While digital credentials offer far more than just helping people into a job, this remains a significant and powerful use case. However, creating an ecosystem where this is not only possible but also straightforward takes time. It’s a complex, three-sided challenge that requires more than simply asking users what they want; it involves anticipating their needs and providing innovative solutions that work for everyone involved.</p> The Appeal of Credentials <p>People and organisations are often attracted to digital credentials for their potential to recognise and validate a broad range of skills and achievements. They can help democratise learning, making it accessible and recognisable beyond traditional educational settings. For learners, these kind badges represent an opportunity to showcase their skills in a way that is immediately recognisable — and verifiable.</p> Challenges <p>Despite the initial excitement, many individuals and organisations find themselves asking, “Now what?” In our experience, this question stems from several challenges. Earners can sometimes have a lack of clarity on how to effectively use badges in practice, and so struggle to see how these credentials translate into real-world opportunities.</p>CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Issuers such as educational institutions and other organisations may find it difficult to convince stakeholders of the value of alternative credentials. Meanwhile, employers may exhibit uncertainty about the validity and relevance of these badges, leading to hesitation in recognising them as part of the hiring or promotion process.</p> Understanding the Three-Sided Marketplace <p>To address these challenges, it’s important to understand the interplay between the three main groups involved: earners, issuers, and employers.</p>  Earners: These are individuals who seek to acquire credentials to validate their skills and knowledge. A <a href="https://www.jff.org/jobseekers-want-digital-credentials-for-skill-sharing-are-employers-ready/">significant proportion are already using digital credentials</a> in the application process, with their main concern being whether these badges will be recognised and valued by employers and educational institutions.  Issuers: These include schools, universities, and other organisations that award credentials. Their challenge is to establish the credibility and relevance of their badges as a form of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markcperna/2022/07/25/workforce-credentials-are-going-digital-heres-why-this-helps-everyone/?sh=58d6ec8673e3">skills currency</a>.  Employers: These are the entities looking to hire or promote individuals with verified skills. <a href="https://www.aacu.org/research/falling-short-college-learning-and-career-success">Fewer than half of employers</a> say that they find university transcripts useful in helping them to evaluate job applicant’s potential to succeed at their company. So they need a quick and easy way to verify skills in a way that is a reliable indicator of&nbsp;ability.   Shifting the&nbsp;Question <p>So, rather than asking, “Who’s asking for this?” perhaps we should instead focus on understanding the needs and motivations of each group in this marketplace. By shifting our perspective, we can better appreciate the value of credentials and work towards making them more effective.</p><p>Just look at the progress we’ve made as an ecosystem:</p><p>✅ Clear value proposition — digital credentials offer tangible benefits, like <a href="https://digitalpromise.org/2024/04/11/unlocking-the-benefits-5-key-reasons-for-earning-micro-credentials/">job opportunities and career advancement</a>, by validating a wide range of skills. Secure, digital wallets make it possible for earners to feel like they truly own and control their credentials.</p><p>✅ Widespread adoption and recognition — increasing numbers of institutions and employers are recognising and accepting digital credentials, thanks to the work of organisations such as the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC), <a href="https://www.jff.org/">Jobs for the Future</a>, and <a href="https://www.thersa.org/design-for-life-our-mission/hubs/cities-of-learning/create-digital-badges-and-pathways">The&nbsp;RSA</a>.</p><p>✅ Robust technology infrastructure — advanced platforms and secure technologies are being developed to support issuing, verification, and management of digital credentials, based on foundational work of standards organisations <a href="https://www.1edtech.org/">1EdTech</a> and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>​.</p><p>✅ Collaboration between key industry bodies — industry leaders, educational institutions, and technology providers are working together to standardise and promote the use of digital credentials. See, for example, the work around <a href="https://www.skillsfwd.org/">SkillsFWD</a>, <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/">Opportunity@Work</a>, and the <a href="https://www.t3networkhub.org/">T3 Innovation Network</a>, and networking at events such as <a href="https://www.thebadgesummit.com/">The Badge Summit</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://epic.openrecognition.org/">ePIC</a>.</p><p>✅ Data standards and taxonomies — establishing consistent data standards and taxonomies helps in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">creating interoperable systems</a> where credentials can be easily shared and verified across different platforms. Credential Engine has developed the <a href="https://credentialengine.org/credential-transparency/ctdl/">Credential Transparency Description Language</a> (CTDL), supporting comparability across credential types and providers.</p><p>A huge amount of funding and effort has gone into getting us to this place. It’s going to take more money and time to get us over the line, so where should we focus our attention?</p> Creating Value for All&nbsp;Sides CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>To make digital credentials truly valuable for jobseekers, we need to address the concerns of all three&nbsp;groups:</p>  For earners: Credentials should lead to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">tangible benefits</a>, such as job opportunities or career advancement. We need clear pathways for using certain types of badges, with examples of how and where digital credentials have successfully led to job offers or promotions.  For issuers: It is crucial to developing robust standards such as <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/why-open-badges-3-0-matters-09bb231be864">Open Badges 3.0</a> to promote the credibility of their badges. Issuers can collaborate with industry leaders to ensure their credentials remain relevant and respected, as well as regularly updating the criteria for earning these badges based on industry&nbsp;needs.  For employers: Providing tools and frameworks to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-future-of-trust-in-professional-networks-4e75f09286b2">easily interpret and trust</a> these badges will encourage wider acceptance and use. Employers can partner with educational institutions to co-create badges and/or develop practical tests to verify the skills claimed by the credentials.   Final Thoughts <p>In summary, the question “Who’s asking for this?” may not be the most productive one. Instead, we should focus on understanding the interconnected roles of earners, issuers, and employers in the credentialing process. By doing so, we can move beyond the trough of disillusionment and realise the full potential of these <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/creating-a-culture-of-recognition-39ffdb6cf943">new forms of recognition</a>.</p><p>At WAO, we’ve been working closely with the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC) on storytelling and communications strategies that help everyone <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-to-find-the-right-mental-models-for-your-audience-c68097a7f0ed">understand and embrace</a> the value of digital credentials. The DCC is a key player in the ecosystem, and one of a number of organisations helping build a future where Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials are a natural and trusted part of the hiring&nbsp;process.</p><p>🔥 Do you need help with digital credentials?

<p>Mozilla, which <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/mozilla-signs-lucrative-3-year-google-search-deal-for-firefox">got $400+ million a year from Google (for search in the Firefox browser) starting in 2020</a>, announce on June 3 that they will be <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-builders-accelerator/">Building open, private AI with the Mozilla Builders Accelerator</a>. Jive:</p>
<blockquote><p>This program is designed to empower independent AI and machine learning engineers with the resources and support they need to thrive. It aims to cultivate a more innovative AI ecosystem, and it’s one of&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozillas-biggest-ai-moments/">Mozilla’s key initiatives</a>&nbsp;to make AI meaningfully impactful — alongside efforts like&nbsp;<a href="http://mozilla.ai/">Mozilla.ai</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-launches-responsible-ai-challenge/">Responsible AI Challenge</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-rise25-ai-nominations/">Rise25 Awards</a>.</p>
<p>The Mozilla Builders Accelerator’s inaugural theme is local AI, which involves running AI models and applications directly on personal devices like laptops, smartphones, or edge devices rather than depending on cloud-based services…</p>
<p>We chose Local AI as the theme for the Accelerator’s first cohort because it aligns with our core values of privacy, user empowerment, and open source innovation. This method offers several benefits including:</p>
 
 Privacy:&nbsp;Data stays on the local device, minimizing exposure to potential breaches and misuse. 
 Agency:&nbsp;Users have greater control over their AI tools and data. 
 Cost-effectiveness:&nbsp;Reduces reliance on expensive cloud infrastructure, lowering costs for developers and users. 
 Reliability:&nbsp;Local processing ensures continuous operation even without internet connectivity. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Looks to me like both of these are Big AI writ small. It’s “local,” not personal. It’s made to serve your needs with what BigAI offers through APIs. It is still essentially AIaaS (AI as a Service), rather than truly personal AI (pAI): <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">personalized</a> more than personal.</p>
<p>That’s also what I see when I read between the lines at <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/mozillaai/">Mozilla’s AI job openings</a>. Take <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/mozillaai/jobs/4357000007">platform engineer</a>. This person will (among other things), “assist in managing and orchestrating workloads across multiple cloud providers.” That’s fine. I’m sure true pAIs will do that too. But most of pAI will be more personal than that. It will deal with the mundanities of your everyday life. Not with coughing up answers that can only come from AIaaSes.</p>
<p>The problem with personalizing AI giant offerings is that they are large language models (LLM) trained on everything that can be crawled on the Internet, plus who knows what else. Not on your truly personal stuff. This is why “prompt engineering” worthy of the noun is ” <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04444">not for anybody</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prompt engineering is crucial for deploying LLMs but is poorly understood mathematically. We formalize LLM systems as a class of discrete stochastic dynamical systems to explore prompt engineering through the lens of control theory. We investigate the reachable set of output token sequences $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ for which there exists a control input sequence $\mathbf u$ for each $\mathbf y \in R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ that steers the LLM to output $\mathbf y$ from initial state sequence $\mathbf x_0$. We offer analytic analysis on the limitations on the controllability of self-attention in terms of reachable set, where we prove an upper bound on the reachable set of outputs $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ as a function of the singular values of the parameter matrices. We present complementary empirical analysis on the controllability of a panel of LLMs, including Falcon-7b, Llama-7b, and Falcon-40b. Our results demonstrate a lower bound on the reachable set of outputs $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ w.r.t. initial state sequences $\mathbf x_0$ sampled from the Wikitext dataset. We find that the correct next Wikitext token following sequence $\mathbf x_0$ is reachable over 97% of the time with prompts of $k\leq 10$ tokens. We also establish that the top 75 most likely next tokens, as estimated by the LLM itself, are reachable at least 85% of the time with prompts of $k\leq 10$ tokens. Intriguingly, short prompt sequences can dramatically alter the likelihood of specific outputs, even making the least likely tokens become the most likely ones. This control-centric analysis of LLMs demonstrates the significant and poorly understood role of input sequences in steering output probabilities, offering a foundational perspective for enhancing language model system capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>But all that stuff applies mostly when we’re prompting a big LLM system.</p>
<p>What about using AI in our own lives, where the data that matters most are in our calendars, contacts, financial and health records, our travels, our correspondence (email, chat, whatever)? And how about all the location data we might get from our cars, phone apps, and phone companies? These should be much easier for a pAI to gather, examine, and help us do useful things. Caring about much less data also means a pAI will be less likely to give wrong (hallucinated) answers.</p>
<p>Today the mental frame almost everybody uses for AI is the Big kind, ingesting everything they can get their crawlers on, and munching all of it in giant compute farms. Those systems are great for lots of stuff, but they still don’t deal with personal data listed in the last paragraph.</p>
<p>Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>Look at it this way. For each of us, there are three data pools:</p>
 
 The entire Net, which is what gets crawled by all the giant LLM operators, plus whatever else they can get their claws on. 
 One’s personal life, some of which is digitized in useful form (contacts, calendar, mail, stuff in folders inside PCs and attached drives). 
 Personal data that is in the hands of giants, but is rightfully ours. These include our driving record and driving practices (,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html">recorded by our late model cars and snitched to insurance companies and others</a>), our location data (kept and shared by car and phone carriers to the likes <a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/09/30/theres-a-multibillion-dollar-market-for-your-phones-location-data">of Google</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/how-federal-government-buys-our-cell-phone-location-data">the feds</a>), our TV viewing habits, (<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-stop-smart-tvs-from-snooping-on-you">gathered</a> by Google, Amazon, Roku, Apple, etc.). 
 
<p>The pAI greenfield is with the last two.</p>
<p>Tell us who is working on what there, preferably with open source, and not sitting on walled garden silicon.</p>
<p>[Later… ] Since readers told me I had small language models (SLMs) wrong in one of the paragraphs above, and I’m not sure I had them right, I rewrote them out of the piece. I invite readers to post comments to further correct and expand on the subject of pAIs and what they can do.</p>

 Manual BTC Transfer Confirmation: Borrowers and lenders can manually confirm BTC transfers before ZKP completion, saving time. 
 Tip Functionality: Borrowers and lenders can provide tips to each other to encourage faster confirmations. 
 Lender Time Unlock Branch 3: Adds flexibility for lenders. 
 Wallet Compatibility: Unisat is now supported throughout the entire process, expanding beyond the Essentials wallet. 
 Dynamic Timelock Values: The UI now dynamically follows timelocks provided by the contract, no longer relying on hardcoded values. 
 Repayment Countdown Bug Fix: Addressed the repayment countdown duration bug. 
 Order Cancellation: Lenders can cancel an order if it remains unpaid for more than six hours. 
 New Order Status Filter: A new “ongoing” status filter has been added. 
 Bug Fixes: Various minor bugs have been resolved. 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Updates to Essentials Wallet 
<p>To support the BeL2 loan app, Essentials has also received crucial updates:</p>
 
 Direct APK Download: Android users can now download the latest version (3.1.5) directly from <a href="https://d.web3essentials.io/">d.web3essentials.io</a>. 
 iOS Version Update: The iOS version has been updated and is available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/web3-essentials-crypto-wallet/id1568931743">App Store</a>. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 BeL2: Expanding Bitcoin’s Capabilities 
<p>BeL2 enhances Bitcoin’s scalability, programmability, and privacy, leveraging the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) while preserving Bitcoin’s integrity. BeL2 enables Bitcoin to interact with smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology.</p>
<p></p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Decentralised Loan App 
<p>The Loan App on BeL2 allows Bitcoin holders to use their BTC as collateral for loans in USDT. Key features include:</p>
 
 BTC as Collateral: Users lock their BTC in a smart contract to borrow USDT. 
 Fixed Interest Rates: Protection against crypto market volatility. 
 No Forced Liquidations: Safeguards against violent price fluctuations. 
 Smart Contract Automation: Ensures predictable, automated repayment schedules. 
 Relayers and ZKPs: Enhance security and privacy in transactions. 
 
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Vision Forward 
<p>BeL2’s focus is on refining its technology and providing robust SDKs for developers to build a wide array of financial applications on top of Bitcoin, executable on EVM ecosystems like Elastos Smart Chain. They are focused on continuously enhancing the efficiency and security of our ZKP mechanisms and optimise smart contract performance for seamless integration across blockchain ecosystems. The team are developing next comprehensive Software Development Kits (SDKs) to simplify the process of building financial applications on BeL2. These SDKs will include:</p>
 
 Smart Contract Templates: Pre-built templates for common financial applications. 
 API Integrations: Easy-to-use APIs for integrating Bitcoin with other blockchain ecosystems. 
 Developer Tools: Advanced debugging and testing tools. 
 Documentation and Tutorials: Extensive documentation and tutorials to guide developers. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Building a Financial Ecosystem 
<p>The Loan App serves as a framework for developing various financial applications, demonstrating how Bitcoin can be used as collateral within a decentralised financial ecosystem. Potential applications include:</p>
 
 Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs): Platforms for trading cryptocurrencies without a centralised intermediary. 
 Lending Platforms: Smart contract-based lending services with APR. 
 Payment Solutions: Enabling businesses to accept native Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for online platforms. 
 Investment Platforms: Decentralised platforms for investing in various assets using Bitcoin’s security and liquidity. 
 
<p>We invite the Elastos community to explore the capabilities of the Loan App Demo 0.2 and experience the integration of Bitcoin with smart contracts on the Elastos Smart Chain. Your participation and feedback are invaluable as we continue to innovate and expand the BeL2 ecosystem.</p>
<p>Join us at <a href="https://lending.bel2.org/">lending.bel2.org</a> and be part of the future where Bitcoin gains new functionalities and applications through BeL2. Together, we are building a more robust and decentralised financial landscape.</p>

<p>This document intends to provide a comprehensive understanding of attestation’s role in enhancing and advancing the digital security landscape, specifically with respect to authentication. It focuses on the core function of attestation: verifying the origin and integrity of user devices and their authentication materials. FIDO credentials are discussed with a focus on how they offer more secure alternatives than traditional password-based systems and how FIDO attestation enhances authentication security for both Relying Parties (RPs) and end-users. In this document, RPs are those entities that provide websites, applications and online services that require the need for secure user access by confirming the identity of users or other entities. FIDO Alliance’s historical journey is presented with practical analogies for understanding FIDO attestation, its enterprise-specific technical solutions, and privacy aspects involved in the attestation process.</p>



<p>Targeted for CISOs, security engineers, architects, and identity engineers, this white paper serves as a guide for professionals considering the adoption of FIDO within their enterprise ecosystem. Readers should possess a baseline understanding of FIDO technologies, the meaning of attestation, and have a desire to understand why and how to implement attestation.</p>

<p>New Committee Specification from the CACAO TC</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that CACAO Security Playbooks Version 2.0 from the OASIS Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) for Cyber Security TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) is a schema and taxonomy for cybersecurity playbooks. The CACAO specification describes how these playbooks can be created, documented, and shared in a structured and standardized way across organizational boundaries and technological solutions. This specification defines the CACAO Layout Extension for the purpose of visually representing CACAO playbooks accurately and consistently across implementations.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>CACAO Layout Extension Version 1.0<br>Committee Specification 01<br>04 April 2024</p>

This gives an artist an ecosystem which provides an entire commercialization network for maximum revenue generation through superfan engagement.</p>

<p>DIF's ED Kim Hamilton Duffy, Wayne Chang, CEO of SpruceID and Professor Linda Jeng, a lawyer, former financial regulator and founder of Digital Self Labs, took to the stage at EIC to discuss how Decentralized Identity (DI) can help mitigate threats posed by Large Language Models (LLMs), ably moderated by KuppingerCole's Anne Bailey. </p><p>The panelists' thoughts on the nature and scale of the problem</p><p>Wayne: “Until now, we’ve been able to get by holding a driver's license up to a webcam, but with new AI tech you can fool these systems - this is already showing up at the edges. AI voice generation is really good now. People are saying it's not a valid identification factor any more. </p><p>"Phishing attacks are also on the rise, for example people pretending to be a romantic partner before encouraging the target to invest in crypto. Using AI bots for mimicry makes it easy for scammers to quickly establish trust".</p><p>Linda: "The rights conferred by GDPR, to decide with whom you share your data, are already difficult to enforce. Deepfakes will make this even harder. </p><p>"I’ve been meeting East Berliners here who tell me surveillance capitalism reminds them of what it was like growing up under the Stasi".</p><p>Kim: "A lot of the threats are not new, what we are talking about is an acceleration of these. We were already uncomfortable online. Now, with the things we’re seeing due to the advent of cheap, easy-to-use deepfake tech, we are past breaking point."&nbsp;</p><p>How Decentralized Identity can help mitigate these threats</p><p>Wayne: “We need to add authenticity to communication. We don’t want to present a strong ID every time we want to use a chat app, so it makes sense to embed DI into comms channels, to prove I’m real.</p><p>“I define DI as the ability of any party to play the role of issuer, holder and verifier, based on cryptographic trust. Having digital credentials issued by many parties will enable trusted content certification, giving us confidence about what goes into an AI model.</p><p>Linda: “It’s not about identity, it's about data governance, and creating chains of trust to combat risks from synthetic data. </p><p>Kim. “I think of DI as a set of standards, technologies and principles that restore individuals’ control over their data. With these technologies, we have the possibility to build products and solutions on strong foundations.&nbsp;</p><p>"One of the key aspects with DI is the ability to provide a consistent experience across channels, creating a much safer environment for individuals. For example if you get a phone call from your CEO asking you to transfer money, with DI you can be sure it’s them and not a deep fake of their voice.</p><p>Recommendations for solution developers&nbsp;</p><p>Wayne: “Focus on the value for the end user. The DI standards uniquely enable you to provide a great user experience while also ensuring privacy and solution sustainability, including the ability to swap out vendors if needed without disrupting the service you’re providing."&nbsp;</p><p>Linda: "We have grown used to not having to pay for digital services. The incentives need to change. Think about new models where we get paid for our data, enabled by content authenticity and DI tech."</p><p>Kim: “We have to balance usability and privacy. It’s clear people want to use LMM based tech in their lives. On the other hand we’re seeing increasingly aggressive interfaces, for example asking you to give full access to your documents or even your desktop. With DI, finally there are ways to provide people both the convenience AND the trust”</p><p>Other opportunities</p><p>Wayne: “There’s exciting work happening at Kantara Initiative around automated compliance with data regulations. Imagine giving someone a license to your personal data. Then, if you're a Data Processor it’s easy to automatically demonstrate compliance using consent receipts. </p><p>"It makes the “Accept all” problem go away, as you can decide what kind of consent receipts should be automatically generated for which parties.”&nbsp;</p><p>Linda: “We need to spend time educating policymakers and the public, but in the end it comes down to end user demand for solutions. There’s no legal requirement for open banking in the US, but it’s happening anyway as people want to share their banking data with fintechs. Creating a smooth, easy UX will help to create the demand.”</p><p>Kim: "There’s a huge role for expanding the scope of trust to content authenticity, similar to the browser check mark that shows a website has a valid SSL certificate. C2PA (link) is fantastic, and is already using VCs. However, there is a risk of getting locked into who can verify these claims, if we use Certificate Authorities (CAs) as the root of trust. We are talking to them and there’s strong interest in generalizing the trust model.”</p><p>The panelists' key takeaways</p><p>Wayne: "One of the early goals of the internet pioneers was to have your personal agent in cyberspace. We need to get back to that original definition of personal agents, taking advantage of them to certify our content and things done on our behalf."&nbsp;</p><p>Linda: "We need the right to certify our data as authentic. Right now we can’t tell what’s synthetic versus from an original creator. It’s not judging whether the data is good or bad, it just gives us additional info about the data we’re using."</p><p>Kim: "Everything we’re talking about is already here, its just about connecting the pieces. If you're building products, this is a great time to get involved. Come and talk to us at DIF!"</p><p>Linda Jeng, Wayne Chang, Kim Hamilton Duffy, Kristy Lam and Elissa Maercklein published <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4854347&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Chains of Trust: Combatting Synthetic Data Risks of AI</a> earlier today.</p>

<p>Two predominant themes stood out at last week’s Identiverse 2024 conference in Las Vegas. First, there was the issue of how to defend against rapidly evolving advances in deepfakes, especially for live remote verification. Second, there was a common assumption that widespread adoption of passkeys is right around the corner, and that organizations must prepare to manage and secure passkeys when they become mainstream.</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CEO Andrew Shikiar touched on both topics in a session Wednesday (May 29) titled “<a href="https://identiverse.com/idv24/session/2089529/">FIDO, Passkeys and the State of Passwordless</a>.”</p>



<p>He announced the alliance’s new certification standard for facial-recognition technologies. The first (and so far only) organization to receive that certification is iProov. In a <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv24/session/2089484/">keynote address</a> Thursday (May 30), Shikiar added that the FIDO Alliance was ready to offer independent testing of facial-recognition technologies.</p>



<p>As for passkeys, the passwordless, FIDO-certified PKI-based WebAuthn credentials that reside on hardware keys, smartphones, PCs and in the cloud, Shikiar said the question was not if consumers would adopt them, but when.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance’s goal is “to make passkeys inevitable,” Shikiar said. No one at Identiverse expressed any doubt that they would be.</p>

<p>Today, the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> announced <a href="https://hrf.org/hrf-bitcoin-development-fund-grants-1-billion-satoshis-to-14-projects-worldwide/">a Bitcoin Development Fund grant</a> to Blockchain Common for its continued support of the development of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">FROST</a>, including holding <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/#upcoming-events">two more virtual FROST meetings for the developer community</a>.</p>

<p>FROST is a powerful quorum threshold signature scheme built using Schnorr signatures that offers many advantages over existing signature methodologies. That includes crucial integration with Distributed Key Generation: private keys can be created in pieces by discrete online servers, with no server ever having the whole key. Altogether, FROST can improve privacy, resilience, and security alike, making it truly a next-generation key-management system.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has long looked forward to the mainstream deployment of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">Schnorr</a> and FROST because of their considerable benefits over traditional key-management and signature schemes. We held out first <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">FROST Implementer’s Round Table</a> in 2023 to give FROST library implementers and cryptographers a chance to talk with each other, and we were asked to do more. We also hosted a <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/summary/">FROST Developer’s Meeting</a> this year where we worked with Jesse Posner to offer wallet developers a look at what the future of FROST means.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons is thrilled by HRF’s recognition of our work. Their funding makes it possible to continue this work this year: we’ll be hosting a second round table for FROST library implementers &amp; cryptographers on September 18, then a second meeting for wallet developers on December 4. If you’re a cryptographer or library implementer, sign up for our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#frost-implementers">FROST implementer’s list</a> and if you’re a wallet developer, sign up for our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#gordian-developers">Gordian developer’s list</a> to receive the announcements on these events. Admission is free thanks to the support of HRF!</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has also placed FROST on our developmental road map for the year, to consider incorporating it our reference code and tools. More details as additional funding and our schedule firm up.</p>

<p>In the meantime, put September 18 and/or December 4 on your calendars so that you can join Blockchain Commons for these important events that will unveil the future of multi-party signatures and key management.</p>

		<p>CC* Regional Networking: Connectivity through Regional Infrastructure for Scientific Partnerships, Innovation, and Education (CRISPIE)&nbsp;</p>
<p>NEWARK, NJ, June 4, 2024 –Edge has been awarded an $857,000 grant from the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a> to enhance network connectivity and access to advanced research networks and related cyberinfrastructure for seven higher education institutions in New Jersey, including a community college and several Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). The partner institutions include Brookdale Community College, Kean University, Montclair University, Ramapo College, Rider University, Rowan University, and Saint Peter’s University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project will improve access to advanced research networks and related cyberinfrastructure, aiming to reduce disparities for smaller and less resourced institutions. The initiative offers specialized training programs for IT personnel, faculty, and students, and establishes essential infrastructure elements using tools like perfSONAR for deploying network monitoring and optimization capabilities, leveraging globus file transfer and sharing service, a regional, centrally managed Data Transfer Node (DTN) for efficient data transfers and Science DMZ for direct access to regional and national resources, secured by the InCommon Federation for remote access to instruments and HPC resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital identity pioneers Markus Sabadello and Nat Sakimura crossed swords on stage during an absorbing discussion at EIC in Berlin this evening. </p><p>Markus kicked off by asking why the internet has become highly centralized, in spite of its beginnings as a peer-to-peer network. </p><p>Markus observed that technology embodies the values of the community that spawns it. He illustrated this by comparing W3C versus SD JWT VCs - contending that the W3C format offers more "Liberte" - as well as DIDComm versus OID4VC - arguing that DIDComm features more "Fraternite". Here's a flavor of their conversation (apologies to both for any mistakes in capturing your comments).</p><p>Markus: "One of the biggest discussions right now is how to get a VC into a wallet and present it. With OpenID4VC, there is asymmetry between issuer and holder, whereas with DIDComm, you have a model where everyone can connect to everyone else and establish true peer-to-peer relationships."</p><p>Nat: "The same can be said for STMP. The philosophy was that everyone runs their own mail server. I do, but how many others do? Instead, we have enormous mail servers like Office 365 and gmail. Just the fact that protocol provides Liberte, doesn't ensure decentralization."  </p><p>Markus: "No one said Liberte was easy. The easiest thing is to log in with Facebook!". </p><p>Nat: "What's the cost of enabling Liberte? It will make things more complex and error prone. </p><p>"You need to specify what is being decentralized. For example, IDPs are so-called centralized, yet there are hundreds of thousands of them. The number of wallets will be even more than the size of the population, but thinking about wallet providers, it will probably be far fewer than the number of IDPs. </p><p>"It's not only the technical architecture we need to look at, but also the operational and legal controls. Don't try to solve everything in a technical way."</p><p>Markus: "SSI arose to ensure we can have the same social structures and protections we enjoy in the real world, in the digital world.  We want Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite, and these ideas are baked into SSI standards."</p><p>Nat: "The goal is not the technology, but how to achieve Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite. Don't get too fixated on the technology." </p><p>Markus: "We can agree on that!"</p>

<p>DIF’s ED Kim Hamilton Duffy and SC member Steve McCown delivered a  Technical Mastery Sprint to a packed audience on the opening day of the 2024 European Identity and Cloud conference. </p><p>Steve highlighted the scale of internet security and data privacy problems, noting that some 25 billion login credentials had been leaked to the dark web by 2022, a 65% increase from 2020. Identity is the hackers’ real objective, since this is what enables lucrative fraud schemes. This threat impacts both individuals - what happens when your biometrics are stolen? - and organizations - 98% of whom have relationships with at least one vendor that has experienced a breach within the past 2 years, according to the Cyentia Institute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve and Kim introduced key decentralized identity building blocks including Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), DID methods, DIDComm, wallets and agents, and how they can help address the current privacy and security challenges.&nbsp;They emphasized that these elements can be readily incorporated into existing systems, demonstrated by the growing use of decentralized identity to create on-ramps between Web2 and Web3 (and now Web5) applications. </p><p>Sam Curren demonstrated a new protocol that bridges DIDComm and OpenIDConnect, facilitating eIDAS-compliant integration of DI within the EU digital identity wallet to enable new use cases.</p><p>Steve and Kim spoke about how trust is established in a world where anyone can issue credentials, and highlighted several approaches that are gaining traction, including Trust over IP Foundation Trust Registries and DIF Credential Trust Establishment.&nbsp;</p><p>Kim outlined credential issuance and exchange flows and highlighted some implementation challenges, solutions and best practices, including credential storage and key management, and provided tips for managing a DI project and how to get started. She also outlined several existing government, educational, workforce management and supply chain use cases, and wrapped up the session with a live demonstration of DID creation and credential issuance using the Veramo CLI toolkit.&nbsp;</p><p>The session generated strong audience engagement, with Kim and Steve answering questions on topics including the trust relationship between issuers and relying parties, delegated authority (e.g. where a parent manages their child’s credentials), credential revocation, reconciling multiple user accounts, the need for centralized record keeping (e.g. for regulatory compliance), key storage and wallet recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>Look out for a more in-depth post where we provide their answers! </p>

<p>Alan Mayo goes beyond digital identity to consider identity in person, online, and by telephone. He has developed a structured way of describing identity that has, until now, been severely lacking. Alan questions the currently accepted status quo, suggesting that we will need to pass through an Identity 2.5 phase before reaching Identity 3.0.</p>

 Setting up a successful leadership transition <p>After years of working with and for a variety of different kinds of social impact organisations — from educational institutions to cooperative federations, small community-based charities to global non-profits — we’ve been lucky to see how our strategy and “critical friend” services can help leaders set foundations for an organisational programme or initiative.</p><p>It’s only lately that we’ve thought about some of what we do through the lens of “Fractional Leadership”. We are experts in cooperation, learning, technology and community, which means the type of leadership that we bring into projects is quite <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-business-case-for-working-openly-and-transparently-867e3fb04588">specifically OPEN</a>.</p> What is Fractional Leadership? cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Fractional leadership is essentially outsourcing a role or a part of a role to an expert who can help you hit the ground running. Such positions are great when you know you need a new department (e.g. Digital Transformation) or if you’re kicking off a new project that needs someone to lead. They’re also helpful when you know you want to hire someone full-time, but want to find the right person for your organisation.</p><p>Fractional leadership provides you and your organisation with some flexibility because it gives you the time and space to make the right decisions in staffing and for your organisation as a whole. It’s potentially less expensive than hiring someone full time and can be explicitly bound in a statement of work. It’s also a way to test whether or not a particular new position makes sense to your organisation.</p><p>It is a way to work with diverse experts who have wide-ranging experience that you would like to apply to your organisation as it grows, changes and transitions.</p> The shadow side of fractional leadership cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>As with any concept we pull from the world of bizniz into the social impact space, we need to be aware of how it can manifest inside an organisation that isn’t only trying to maximise&nbsp;profits.</p><p>Often, organisations in our space are unaware that what they need is a leader and look to us to create a specific “thing”. “We just need a digital strategy,” or “We just need a training programme,” are things that often come up in projects that obviously need something more. Working openly and helping people to understand how technology and funding intermingle, how community drives participation, how recognition motivates or how a learning programme can scale all require leadership.</p><p>Often funding in the social impact space is to develop a specific thing, not the impact that thing should have. Complex realities also mean that someone who might be a leader in one context might not have what it takes to lead in your context. This is why an open leader is so important. Fractional leadership in the open is a rare thing&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>A fractional leader needs to be adaptable and find ways to stay within the bounds the organisation has, while also setting a project or department up for future&nbsp;impact.</p> Preparing for a new colleague cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Still, experienced fractional leaders are well versed in making do with what they’re given. They can lay out plans and programmes with the future in mind. The strategies and processes put in place during a time of transition reflect a moment in time. Setting them up as iterative and designing them to evolve empowers future&nbsp;leaders.</p><p>We’ve offered “critical friend” services to help onboard the people who will take over from what we were asked to start. We’ve advise on workload and priority based on community engagement in tandem with organisational goals. We like to do the work of documenting and establishing open, productive processes and policies help future collaborators take over when the time&nbsp;comes.</p> Is Fractional Leadership for&nbsp;you? cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Your fractional leader can&nbsp;start:</p>  Developing a strategy that focuses on long term social&nbsp;impact  Creating processes or frameworks to measure impact or create processes for gathering data and&nbsp;insights  Building assets to begin implementing the change needed to achieve the impact you’re looking&nbsp;for  Supporting and working with others on your team to co-design principles and approaches that support your&nbsp;mission  Determining the skills and competencies necessary to lead the project, programme or department they’re working within and helping your organisation find someone to take&nbsp;over  <p>The whole point is that you can bring in engaged experts to help you get something going while looking for your forever person. There are lots of people working in the social impact space who have deep expertise in everything from finance to HR to product development and&nbsp;design.</p><p>Fractional leadership is something you can simply try out. As you create briefs or write out job descriptions just ask yourself, “Would a designated fractional leader give me more time and space to ensure this is a long-term success?” If so, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact">get in&nbsp;touch</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/fractional-leadership-in-social-impact-organisations-5c03daf9e08e">Fractional Leadership in Social Impact Organisations</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  🚀 Decentralized Identity Foundation News  
<p>DIF at ID4Africa</p>
<p>DIF was honoured to participate at the ID4Africa 2024 AGM in Cape Town last week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIF's Catherine Nabbala and Damian Glover delivered a plenary presentation to the conference, together with Anand Acharya of Bhutan National Digital Identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The session highlighted DIF’s work within the broader landscape of national ID schemes and provided real-world insights into the implementation of decentralized identity by the Thai and Bhutanese governments.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
The presentation elicited engagement with DIF from a variety of quarters, including several countries that are rolling out national digital identity programs, and others looking to do so.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our conversations with stakeholders evidenced a strong desire for Africa-specific digital infrastructure, and awakening interest in decentralized identity as a tool to empower citizens and promote cross-border interoperability while avoiding lock-in to ecosystems controlled by outside interests.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Universal Resolver<br>
<br>
The <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/iota-digital-identity-method-gets-support-from-decentralized-id-universal-resolver/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">IOTA Digital Identity (DID) method is now resolvable using the DIF's Universal Resolver</a>. The Universal Resolver is DIF-hosted infrastructure enabling resolution of any registered DID method through its flexible plugin model. This widely-used service is invaluable to the decentralized identity community. Accordingly,  DIF has invested in boosting its reliability and stability to ensure uptime and availability of the Universal Resolver.</p>
<p>The Universal Resolver was generously developed and contributed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/danube-tech/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Danube Tech</a>.</p>
<p>You can experiment with the Universal Resolver at <a href="https://uniresolver.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://uniresolver.io</a> and even follow our simple process for allowing your own DID method to run in the Uniresolver.</p>
<p>As a non-profit, DIF funds and hosts public good infrastructure like the Universal Resolver. Support our efforts by <a href="https://lnkd.in/gTyk6x4c?ref=blog.identity.foundation">joining DIF</a>.</p>
<p>DIF adds new liaison IOVF</p>
<p><br>
IOV Foundation’s mission is to create a new open financial ecosystem that provides accessible and fair services. They focus on Latin America, specifically demonstrating solutions for interoperability between governments (countries, cities) and organizations in Central and South America. Their current pilot focuses on building an identity platform for the Argentine Chamber of E-Commerce, aimed at managing event tickets and board meeting attendance.</p>

  🗓️ ️Community Events  
<p>Bridging the Gap: OpenID and DIDComm<br>
<br>
SC member Sam Curren and Artur Philipp from IDUnion unveiled OpenID-DIDComm, a new protocol that bridges OpenID4VC and DIDComm, enabling credential issuers and holders to communicate securely in a way that complies with EU requirements for credential exchange.</p>
<p>The community call was highly anticipated and was well attended, despite public holidays in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Following an introduction by DIF’s Senior Director of Community Engagement, Limari Navarrete, Artur noted that there are many reasons why issuers and holders will need to communicate, though OpenID4VCI (OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance) only supports the initial credential exchange.</p>
<p>For example, an issuer may need to notify a holder that a credential has expired or been revoked. On the other hand, a holder may want to request a batch of additional credentials from the issuer (single-use SD-JWT credentials will be important to prevent correlation of the holder).</p>
<p>The mutual authentication that is integral to the DIDComm protocol provides resistance to phishing attacks, compared with approaches requiring switches to channels such as SMS or email. What’s more, the security properties of a DIDComm connection do not degrade over time. These and other features make DIDComm an excellent choice to establish a persistent communication channel between issuers and holders.</p>
<p>The next step is for the project team to validate that the new protocol does not interfere with OpenID4VCI, in consultation with the group developing the OpenID specification. Enabling DIDComm connections to be established over OpenID4VP (OpenID for Verifiable Presentations) will follow later.</p>

<p>This paper explores the emerging practices surrounding the use of synced passkeys which allow passkey use across multiple devices by syncing the passkeys over the cloud, specifically addressing the initial choices and considerations for service providers (aka relying parties or RPs). These practices are in their early stages and are likely to progress, since operating systems, browsers, and passkey providers are still in a phase of enhancing functionality. This document outlines crucial areas such as registration, authentication, passkey management, and accessibility for RPs to consider and presents a range of emerging approaches for adopting this technology. The objective is to guide RPs through these budding strategies, acknowledging that the specifics of ensuring secure and convenient passkey usage may evolve as the digital landscape continues to advance.</p>



<p>This paper is written with independence for each section, allowing readers to read specific topics of interest without the need to read the entire paper from the beginning.</p>



<p>This white paper is intended for various stakeholders of relying parties, including non-developers, such as information security executives, product owners, identity and access management practitioners, UI/UX designers, and accessibility practitioners.</p>

<p>An innovative collaboration has emerged in the AI sector, as <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a>, a leading AI platform developer headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, and Trace Labs, the core development company of <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a>, based in Hong Kong, have just announced a strategic partnership aimed at supporting the development of the Knowledge Layer — the Internet of Knowledge.</p><p>This partnership signifies that two prominent players in the AI industry have come together to support a decentralized ecosystem where AI agents and infrastructure partners collaborate within the decentralized knowledge graph (DKG) landscape.</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to building a Verifiable Internet for AI, and this partnership marks the beginning of their collaboration with SingularityNET’s leading AI platform and robust ecosystem.</p><p>In some of the key highlights of this partnership, Trace Labs is tasked with developing sophisticated infrastructure that allows for efficient access and retrieval of information stored on the DKG, tackling challenges of AI hallucinations, bias, and model collapse due to an explosion in the amount of synthetic data produced by AI. This effort is aimed at enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of the decentralized knowledge graph within the OriginTrail network.</p><p>SingularityNET will then provide users access to its decentralized platform, where specialized AI models and Large Language Models (LLMs) can be purchased and used for data analysis. These models are designed to operate seamlessly with the data supported by the OriginTrail network, fostering a more robust ecosystem. The company will also develop AI models that can be trained directly on the Decentralized Knowledge Graph. This approach helps realize the shared vision of the two partners; eliminating the need for data centralization, and leveraging the decentralized nature of the blockchain to enhance privacy and security.</p><p>Leveraging SingularityNET’s leading position in mission-critical research of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Trace Labs’ experience in commercializing Web3 and AI solutions, the strategic partnership is in particular aimed at solving the real world challenges with decentralized AI within the key sectors, such as Industry 4.0, decentralized science (DeSci), real world assets (RWA), and education.</p><p>Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO of SingularityNET, stated, “As we move from an Internet of documents, media and apps to an internet of knowledge and AI, the basic composition of the Internet as a ‘decentralized network of decentralized networks’ becomes ever more important. Both SingularityNET and Trace Labs have powerful capability to grow decentralized networks around knowledge graphs and associated AI capabilities; connecting these networks together into a cross-linked, cross-token meta-network will yield a host of different synergies enabling a broad-based boost in intelligent functionality. As a practical example: Putting together a subgraph of OriginTrail’s DKG decentralized knowledge graph covering shipping logistics, with a knowledge meta-graph living in the OpenCog Hyperon system deployed on SingularityNET covering the timing of events in various markets, one could achieve an unprecedented level of emergent knowledge in the minds of AI agents carrying out supply-chain planning and forecasting. SingularityNET’s new MeTTa-Motto tool integrating Hyperon symbolic AI with LLMs and other deep neural nets could play a critical role here. Similar examples exist in every vertical market, which gives this partnership an almost unbounded potential for economic benefit and human&nbsp;good.”</p><p>Žiga Drev, Managing Director of Trace Labs, added, “The benefits of AI are limitless and so are the risks, like hallucinations and model collapse as the growth in synthetic data outpaces the provision of real world data. A truly open AI that fosters inclusion and a more equitable distribution of value can only be achieved through a collaborative and modular approach. We are proud to partner with SingularityNet, founded and led by the visionary Dr. Ben Goertzel, who coined the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Working alongside the leading visionaries at the convergence of crypto and AI opens exciting opportunities to accelerate real-world adoption of neuro-symbolic AI, combining the power of OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and SingularityNET’s specialized marketplace for Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI&nbsp;models.”</p><p>Both organizations will also engage in collaborative marketing and social media efforts to promote their partnership and the innovations it brings to the blockchain world, the AI industry, and the intersection of these two sectors. The two partners are also mutually exploring and plan to integrate AI services into Trace Labs’ DKG and paranets.</p><p>The partnership is about working together today to solve the challenges of tomorrow; synergizing blockchains and knowledge graphs for safe, verifiable AI that emphasizes secure and privacy-preserving mechanisms for user authentication and authorization within the knowledge layer, and ultimately ensuring all data processing by users is rooted in their&nbsp;consent.</p> About SingularityNET <p><a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a> was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel with the mission of creating a decentralized, democratic, inclusive and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). An AGI is not dependent on any central entity, is open to anyone and is not restricted to the narrow goals of a single corporation or even a single country. The SingularityNET team includes seasoned engineers, scientists, researchers, entrepreneurs, and marketers. Our core platform and AI teams are further complemented by specialized teams devoted to application areas such as finance, robotics, biomedical AI, media, arts and entertainment.</p> About OriginTrail <p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> is an ecosystem building a Verifiable Internet for AI, providing an inclusive framework that tackles the world’s challenges in the AI era, such as hallucinations, bias, and model collapse, by ensuring the provenance and verifiability of data used by AI systems.

<p>Conformance with the AuthZEN request/response protocol marks a significant milestone in simplifying and standardizing authorization approaches</p>
 &nbsp; 
 The OpenID Foundation led the standardization of authentication protocols with OpenID Connect and now we are proud to host the AuthZEN Working Group as they seek to do the same for authorization.”<p></p>
 — Gail Hodges, Executive Director for OpenID Foundation 
 
<p>LAS VEGAS, NV, USA, May 28, 2024 /<a href="https://www.einpresswire.com/">EINPresswire.com</a>/ — The OpenID Foundation AuthZEN Working Group announced today that select leading authorization vendors successfully achieved conformance with the AuthZEN request/response protocol, marking a significant step in bringing interoperability and standardization to the authorization market. The industry leaders include 3Edges, Aserto, Axiomatics, Cerbos, Permit.io, Rock Solid Knowledge, SGNL.ai, Strata Identity, and Thales, demonstrating their commitment to documenting common authorization patterns, defining standard mechanisms for communication between authorization components, and recommending best practices for developing secure applications.</p>
<p>Established through the OpenID Foundation, the AuthZEN Working Group’s focus is to tackle the complexities of authorization, to promote decoupling and externalizing authorization logic from applications, and to simplify the implementation of a robust authorization layer that can be edited and audited with ease within diverse application environments. With members from leading authorization vendors, the group aims to unify and standardize the way authorization decisions are enforced across varying platforms, with an initial focus on a specification that ensures interoperability and integration between policy enforcement points and decision points. This initiative draws on the expertise of leading companies in the security and authorization space, fostering a collaborative approach to enhancing the scalability and security of access control systems.</p>
<p>The AuthZEN Working Group is currently focused on three key areas to improve interoperability:<br>1. Defining a standard for the communication flow between policy enforcement points and policy decision engines.<br>2. Creating a standard for communicating access policies to policy decision points.<br>3. Identifying and documenting common usage patterns and recommended best practices.</p>
<p>The working group recently completed successful interoperability testing, which included a defined interop scenario in the form of a Todo application. Participating companies include 3Edges, Aserto, Axiomatics, Cerbos, Permit.io, Rock Solid Knowledge, SGNL.ai, Strata Identity and Thales – all of whom achieved success in this testing.</p>
<p>The AuthZEN Working Group is open to all organizations committed to the goal of improving interoperability and standardization in authorization. For more information, visit <a href="https://openid.net/wg/authzen/">https://openid.net/wg/authzen/</a> and <a href="https://authzen-interop.net/">https://authzen-interop.net/</a>.</p>
<p>Quotes:<br>Gail Hodges, executive director for OpenID Foundation<br>“As more and more players offer externalized authorization, it is critical that we ensure safe and secure patterns across implementations. The OpenID Foundation led the standardization of authentication protocols with OpenID Connect and now, ten years later, we are proud to host the AuthZEN Working Group as they seek to do the same for authorization.”</p>
<p>Derek Small, co-founder and president for 3Edges<br>“The OpenID AuthZEN Working Group is tackling authorization challenges faced by organizations of every nature and size. Dynamic authorization is cataloging the rich authorization patterns that support authorization decisions between organizations and varying platforms. As this Working Group continues its mission to address interoperability and standards in support of authorization policies of today and those of the future, 3Edges remains committed to supporting the critical workings of the AuthZEN Working Group and to supporting this interop at Identiverse 2024.”</p>
<p>Omri Gazitt, co-founder and CEO for Aserto<br>“Interoperable authentication is mostly a solved problem, thanks to standards such as SAML and OpenID Connect. But we haven’t yet had our “OIDC moment” in the authorization space. The OpenID AuthZEN Working Group is the definitive effort to get us there, and Aserto is proud to be among the first vendors to adopt it. “</p>
<p>David Brossard, chief technology officer (CTO) for Axiomatics<br>“Put simply, the goal here is to become the OAuth of authorization. We’ve taken the lessons learned from the past 15 years working to implement authorization for our customers along with the standardization efforts within OASIS XACML to produce an even simpler, more lightweight PEP-PDP protocol. Axiomatics is proud to support the work to facilitate integration between applications and externalized authorization services, raising the quality and security of authorization.”</p>
<p>Alex Olivier, co-founder and chief product officer (CPO) for Cerbos<br>“Cerbos is a proud contributor and early adopter of the OpenID AuthZEN specification enabling external authorization portability. This standardization effort provides software builders with the confidence to adopt a more secure and scalable access control layer in their applications. “</p>
<p>Or Weis, CEO for Permit.io<br>“Enterprises spend months and sometimes years struggling to apply authorization to their applications. Reinventing wheels due to the lack of standards in the space. At Permit.io, we’re excited to be early backers of the AuthZEN standard and its promise to unify simplicity across the landscape.”</p>
<p>Andrew Clymer, co-founder for Rock Solid Knowledge<br>“With many years of experience building single sign-on (SSO) solutions based on open standards, we are proud to support the AuthZEN Working Group in delivering open standards for authorization. As an early adopter of the draft standard, we are excited to make our .NET authorization engine, Enforcer, accessible to heterogeneous environments.”</p>
<p>Atul Tulshibagwale, chief technology officer (CTO) for SIGNL.ai<br>“The AuthZEN standard will be critical to achieving externalized management of authorization. SGNL is proud to have initiated standardization activity by contributing the first draft spec and is happy to participate in the interoperability event.”</p>
<p>Gerry Gebel, vice president of product and standards for Strata Identity<br>“Interoperability is a core capability needed for enterprises to securely deploy authorization services in complex environments comprised of systems from multiple vendors. Strata is honored to support the demo with the Hexa Policy Orchestration’s integration with Open Policy Agent (OPA). Identiverse is the logical place for this first interoperability demonstration to occur since the AuthZEN working group was founded based on meetings held at this event.”</p>
<p>Bertrand Tavernier, vice president/chief technical officer for Thales (secure communication and information systems)<br>“Thanks to the support of the OpenID AuthZEN Working Group and leveraging our long-standing experience with the OASIS XACML standard, we were glad to demonstrate the capability of our AuthzForce solution to combine XACML policy expressiveness and versatility with the new, ultra-lightweight AuthZEN authorization API for the great benefit of customers, especially in edge computing environments.”</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Otto Mora from Polygon ID and Kim Duffy from DIF hosted a webinar titled "Credential Schemas: Streamlining KYC." We were thrilled with the enthusiastic participation and valuable feedback we received from attendees. </p><p>Throughout the webinar, we conducted interactive polls to gather real-time feedback from participants. Here's a recap of the key highlights, discussions, and feedback throughout the session.</p> Understanding Decentralized Identity <p>We began with an introduction to decentralized identity, explaining the technologies and principles that empower individuals to control their digital identities and personal data. Key benefits include:</p>  Privacy &amp; Security: Ensuring data is shared only with necessary parties, protecting against misuse.  Streamlined Onboarding: Facilitating efficient customer onboarding with trustworthy data.  Bi-Directional Trust: Reducing fraud and fostering confidence in interactions.  Trust &amp; Transparency: Enhancing economic and social opportunities through new markers of trust and reputation.  <p>We asked participants “In your opinion, what is the most impactful use case for decentralized identity?”. At 36%, “Enhancing privacy and security” took the lead, with “Streamlining onboarding processes” coming in second at 27%.</p><p>The responses to “Other” included interesting applications such as:</p>   Governance, membership, voting, and sybil resistance  Virtual rights management (VRM)  <p>And others added powerful cross-cutting differentiators of SSI including user-controlled identity and interoperability.</p><p>For the rest of the webinar, we focused specifically on the "streamlined onboarding" benefit.</p> Real-World Use Cases <p>We explored various use cases where credential schemas can make a significant impact in onboarding:</p>  KYC/KYB: Streamlining financial transactions with verified identity claims.  AML: Reusable claims to help identify and protect against money laundering.  Age Verification: Ensuring age-appropriate access to services and content.  <p>We asked participants which credential schemas they (and their companies) are  interested in. KYC took the lead, which was not surprising given the webinar theme.</p><p>We had a freeform option to enter other credential schemas of interest, and participants responded with:</p>  Known customer credential  Verifiable product-related sustainability information  <p>For the rest of the webinar, we focused specifically on Decentralized Identity and credential schemas as they benefit KYC/KYB use cases.</p> Challenges in Traditional KYC/KYB <p>We reviewed challenges with traditional KYC/KYB processes, including:</p>  High Costs: Traditional methods are costly and resource-intensive.  Compliance Complexity: Meeting compliance requirements like AML assurance is challenging.  Time Inefficiencies: Current processes are time-consuming and require substantial manual effort.   The Role of Credential Schemas <p>We highlighted the importance of credential schemas as data templates that ensure consistency and interoperability across systems. The benefits include:</p>  Facilitating Innovation: Enabling innovators to focus on new applications rather than compatibility issues.  Enhancing Interoperability: Ensuring credentials are broadly recognized across different systems.  Encoding Best Practices: Capturing best practices and recommendations from experts.  Boosting Efficiency: Reducing the need for custom integration work.   DIF’s new Schema Work Item <p>We announced DIF's new schema work item, to be launched at the end of May, dedicated to credential schemas including:</p>  Basic KYC Model: For identity verification across financial services and other sectors.  AML Schema: To comply with anti-money laundering regulations.  Proof of Age: To verify age or age range for access to age-restricted content.  Proof of Humanity: To confirm real human identities, useful for community governance and anti-fraud.   General Discussion <p>The discussions provided us with great insights; one such key insight is that such schemas do not need to provide the complete answer – if they can shave off 80% of the verification work, then that’s a win.</p><p>We also discussed the importance of schema discoverability to promote convergence, which we'll discuss more later.</p> Thank You for Your Participation <p>We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who joined the webinar and contributed to the conversation. Your feedback was invaluable and underscored the relevance and potential impact of credential schemas in streamlining KYC processes.</p><p> As discussed during the call, an interdisciplinary, holistic approach is key to the success of this effort, and we'd love to continue the discussion with you!</p><p> Contact <a href="mailto:membership@identity.foundation">membership@identity.foundation</a> if you'd like to get involved. We are targeting an end of May start date. You can join the work item later, but getting involved now ensures we factor in your availability.</p>

<p>Face Verification Certification launched to bring confidence to ID ecosystem among rising online identity theft and bias concerns&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>May 29, 2024 – The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> announced today the launch of the first globally available certification program to test and certify the performance of remote biometric identity verification technology when verifying a user against a trusted identity document for accuracy, liveness, and bias. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/face-verification/">Face Verification Certification</a> program comes at a time of soaring demand for face biometric identity solutions and recognition of the importance of robust enrollment and identity re-binding processes to the overall security of online accounts. <a href="https://www.iproov.com/liveness-detection">Dynamic Liveness</a>, the science powering the <a href="https://www.iproov.com">iProov</a> Biometric Solution Suite’s Remote Onboarding Solution and Authentication Solution, is the first product to pass the rigorous certification testing.</p>



<p>The certification program, consisting of 10,000 tests at a minimum, assesses a biometric system’s performance across different demographics, including skin tone, age, and gender. It measures resistance to spoof and deepfake attacks with Imposter Attack Presentation Accept Rate (IAPAR), and also assesses the usability and security of solutions by measuring False Reject and Accept Rates (FRR and FAR respectively). The certification also tests “selfie match” capabilities to ensure a user’s “selfie” matches their government-issued ID in the initial account setup process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combating bias and deepfake threats in biometric ID systems</p>



<p>Biometrics has <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Authenticate-2023-Barometer-Report.pdf">ranked top as global consumers’ preferred way to log in</a> and the method they think is most secure for the last two years. However, as governments and businesses globally roll out remote identity solutions, two urgent issues remain to address – bias in some biometric systems and new security threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations including NIST have been closely <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software">monitoring the disparities in performance for some time</a> – with NIST’s most recent <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_demographics.html">evaluation of solutions across different demographics</a> ​​released this year. The issue of bias is tightly linked to brand reputation too; new research from FIDO Alliance released today has found 50% of American and British consumers said they would lose trust in an organization if its biometric system was found to be biased, while 22% said they’d stop using a service entirely. Similarly, generative AI’s boom has also heightened security apprehensions about online verification; the same survey revealed over a third of consumers (37%) are more concerned about verifying themselves online due to the rising number of deepfakes. In ENISA’s latest remote ID report, researchers observed that while deepfake injection attacks are increasing and more sophisticated, deepfake presentation and injection attacks remain the <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/remote-id-proofing-good-practices">top two biometric attack types most difficult to mitigate</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bringing trust to the ID ecosystem</p>



<p>Commenting on the news, Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CEO of the FIDO Alliance, said: “Remote identity solutions unlock huge benefits for governments, organizations, and consumers alike, but as appetite grows across the globe, there are understandable concerns mixed with excitement. Identity theft is rising, while bias in biometric systems has caused organizations to delay or reconsider implementations at a time when inclusivity and accessibility have never been more important.</p>



<p>“Certification unlocks the power of open standards and catalyzes ecosystem-wide innovation and opportunity. With iProov’s market-first certification for biometric face verification now completed, we look forward to serving additional providers who understand the value of independent, accredited lab testing. This new certification program provides a launchpad that enables all stakeholders to fast-track deployments that are robust enough for the modern threat landscape and work well for everyone, anywhere in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leading biometrics solutions provider, iProov, has become the first vendor to complete the rigorous certification process. iProov provides market-leading biometric solutions that protect the world’s most security-conscious organizations from deepfakes and other types of identity fraud. Andrew Bud, founder and CEO at iProov said: “Biometrics are a powerful tool that organizations can utilize to facilitate secure, inclusive, and user-friendly interactions online. Each of these three fundamental components must be given equal consideration as organizations evaluate their options. With the FIDO Face Verification Certification program, organizations now have a trusted compass for navigating these decisions. We applaud The FIDO Alliance for addressing the importance of biometric identity verification to strengthen the full user identity lifecycle. Independent certification creates a much-needed quality benchmark for this evolving technology and further demonstrates our ability to provide trusted identity assurance in an age of AI threats and identity fraud.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Testing requirements are built upon proven ISO standards and are developed by a diverse international authority of stakeholders, including industry, government, and independent subject matter experts. Participating vendors can benefit from identifying gaps in product performance and demonstrating clearly to the market their solutions can be trusted, which can reduce individual testing needs and boost adoption. Two independent labs are currently accredited to support this certification – <a href="https://ingeniumbiometrics.com/">Ingenium Biometrics</a> and <a href="https://www.tuvit.de/">TÜV Informationstechnik (TÜV NORD GROUP)</a> – with more expected to follow later this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program expands upon the Alliance’s existing <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/biometric-component-introduction/">Biometric Component Certification</a> and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/document-authenticity/">Document Authenticity (DocAuth) Certification</a> programs and demonstrates FIDO’s ongoing commitment to meet marketplace demand and address evolving threats with third-party certifications. Combined, these programs provide unrivaled end-to-end assurance to implementing organizations, consumers and vendors and support the world’s migration to more secure digital verification systems and passwordless security.</p>

<p>“As organizations are increasingly deploying passwordless authentication based on FIDO standards around the world, the end users of passkeys – along with the practitioners implementing them – have become top priorities for successful adoption,” said Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CEO of The FIDO Alliance. “Our <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/content-ebook-consumer-password-and-passkey-trends-wpd-2024/">research</a> shows consumers and employees are adopting phishing-resistant passkeys at a rapid pace while relying organizations are experiencing cost savings and fewer security incidents.&nbsp; By continuing our investment in the evolving user experience, the FIDO Alliance is committed to ensuring brands have a consistent and accessible set of guidelines that are fully aligned with design best practices and FIDO technology requirements. We encourage online service providers everywhere to use these publicly available guidelines to enhance the user experience and enjoy greater success with FIDO passkey deployment and adoption.”</p>



<p>Following the first release of FIDO UX guidelines for passkeys in 2022, the 2024 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/design-guidelines/">Design Guidelines</a> have been updated with optimization included for service providers evaluating and deploying passkeys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2024 Design Guidelines are organized into five sections to provide clear guidance, confirm design principles, and offer flexibility:</p>



 
 User experience research: Provides confidence that the guidelines are informed by design research 



 Principles: 10 UX principles and 3 content principles for passkeys that are core to any passkey implementation 



 “Get started” design patterns: Patterns are the heart of the guidelines, containing self-contained experiences that can be combined to match unique business needs 



 Optional design patterns: Patterns that can be added after the “get started” patterns over time 



 Resources: Provides additional resources like events, Figma UI kits and community groups to jump-start work with passkeys 
 



<p>The FIDO UX Working Group created the guidelines and comprises 131 UX researchers, designers, and PMs from 31 global brands. The guidelines were created in partnership with usability research firm Blink UX – with added underwriting support from 1Password, Dashlane, Google, HID, Trusona, U.S. Bank, and Yubico.</p>

 How can we verify users are genuine in an online world? 



<p>Online identity theft has steadily risen in recent years, while the generative AI boom has driven a new wave of deepfake-powered attacks that threaten remote enrollment and identity security. Meanwhile, bias in biometric systems has been monitored for some time, varying significantly across solutions and impacting consumer trust and perception of the technology.</p>



<p>As the adoption of remote identity verification technology rises, two critical concerns and challenges need to be addressed: bias and new security threats.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance recently sponsored an independent study of 2,000 respondents across the U.S. and the U.K. to understand consumer perception towards remote identity verification, online security, and biometrics. This eBook reveals those insights on remote biometric face verification, including how many people have used biometric face recognition successfully, and their opinions on verification accuracy, potential discrimination, and concerns about deepfakes.</p>



 Key findings 



 
 Consumers want to use biometrics to verify themselves online more, especially in sensitive use cases like financial services – where one out of two people said they would use biometric technology (48%). 



 One in four feel they experience regular discrimination when using automated facial biometric systems (25%). 



 Equity in biometric systems is vital to trust – with half saying they would lose trust in a brand or institution (50%), with one out of five saying they’d stop using a service entirely if found to have a biased biometric system (22%). 



 Over half of respondents are concerned about deepfakes when verifying identities online (52%). 
 



<p>Read the full results of the survey in this eBook and learn about these consumers’ experiences with biometric face verification technologies, and discover how organizations can improve global digital access, authentication, and security when leveraging these remote identity verification technologies.</p>

Name: Mark E. Blair, M.D.<br>
Current Council Member: Yes</p>
<p>Experience:<br>
“As a current member of the Cyber Republic Council (CRC), my experience over the past 4 years has been both rewarding and enlightening. I’ve had the privilege of collaborating with dedicated members like Sir Kahuna and Vegas Mike as part of ‘The Strawberry Council.’ Together, we have upheld the philosophy of ‘derived from the community, for the community,’ driving strategic initiatives that promote decentralization and community involvement within the Elastos ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Background:<br>
“In my role, I have focused on enhancing Elastos’ contributions to the Bitcoin ecosystem and digital/data rights, especially through my work as the Head of Strategy for BeL2 since December 2023. This position has allowed me to explore investment opportunities and strategize the rollout of BeL2 infrastructure, providing me with a unique perspective on how to further our community’s goals.”</p>
<p>Contribution Goals:<br>
“For another term, my aspirations include continuing to drive innovation and growth. I hope to continue to support the rollout and adoption of BeL2, which will not only increase use cases for the Bitcoin ecosystem but also boost Elastos’ visibility and adoption. Additionally, I am committed to exploring outside investor opportunities to increase the project’s ecosystem development and long-term viability.”</p>
<p>Improvements:<br>
“In my opinion, while the CRC is currently effective in serving as a DAO, there are areas that could be further improved:</p>
 
 Increased Community Engagement: Encouraging more active participation from community members, ensuring their voices and ideas are heard and integrated into our strategic plans. 
 Transparency and Communication: Enhancing transparency in decision-making processes and improving communication channels between the CRC and the wider Elastos community. 
 Strategic Partnerships: Forming strategic partnerships with other blockchain projects and organizations to foster collaboration and mutual growth. 
 Innovation and Flexibility: Implementing a framework that allows for greater innovation and flexibility in adopting new technologies and approaches, keeping Elastos at the forefront of blockchain development.”

Name: chen2rong2<br>
Current Council Member: No</p>
<p>Background:<br>
“I haven’t run for a council seat previously, and I will not run next year. However, I feel obligated to offer my help at this critical juncture of the Elastos initiative if I am elected. I have been with the Elastos project since the beginning. And I believe there is a need for a bridge between internet developers and crypto developers so they can work together to build a new Web3. I wish to share some of my thoughts with the Cyber Republic communities, especially in the DePIN area, because Web3 is a network first and foremost.”</p>
<p>Contribution Goals:<br>
“‘You own your data’ — that’s for everyone. Web1, Web2, and Web3 are for all internet users, not just crypto enthusiasts. I will try to help build the SmartWeb, our interpretation of Web3, in any way I can. The SmartWeb can’t survive unless project developers, internet influencers, and e-business vendors can make profits on their own.”</p>
<p>Improvements:<br>
“Currently, there is also a divide between the eastern and western members of the Cyber Republic communities. I hope to be an interpreter and help people see that both the world and the internet are common ground for us all.”</p>

 Greater agility, faster innovation, increased engagement Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Excuse us as we go full on bizniz mode for the rest of this post. We’re quite serious about the benefits of openness and have built our cooperative as well as our individual careers on the fact that Open Source is about more than just code. What follows is the “business case” for shifting your organisation to a more open model. We’ve borrowed liberally from the <a href="http://theopenorganization.org/">Open Organization community</a>, a group of people (including one of our members) who have written about the models and behaviours inside of FOSS for many&nbsp;years.</p><p>The evidence is clear: open working leads to greater agility, faster innovation, and increased engagement. Members of your organisation are more capable of working toward goals in unison and with shared vision. Ideas from both inside and outside the organisation receive more equitable consideration. Members clearly see connections between their particular activities and an organisation’s overarching values, mission, and&nbsp;spirit.</p><p>These advantages translate directly into better business performance and a stronger bottom line. If you want your organisation to obtain better results with the resources you currently have available, then embracing open working practices is one of your best paths toward sustainable success.</p><p>But don’t just take our word for&nbsp;it:</p>  Agility: According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/how-to-create-an-agile-organization">McKinsey &amp; Company</a>, organisations that adopt information transparency across their operations can achieve up to 30% gains in efficiency and customer satisfaction.  Innovation: <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/12/how-open-innovation-can-help-you-cope-in-lean-times">Harvard Business Review</a> reports that companies that support open and collaborative working environments can see a speed increase of up to 30% in their innovation cycles.  Engagement: Research by <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx">Gallup</a> reveals that highly engaged business units realise a 41% reduction in absenteeism, 17% increase in productivity, 10% higher customer ratings, see a 20% increase in sales, and are 21% more profitable.   5 Characteristics of an Open Organisation <p>Open Organisations are <a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-org-definition">defined</a> as exhibiting the following characteristics:</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Let’s explain what’s meant by each of&nbsp;these:</p> Transparency <p>This is fundamental to open organisations and involves everyone involved on a project to access all relevant materials by default. As a result, this means that team members are all able to review, assess, and contribute effectively to the work being done. Moreover, transparency means team members being not only informed about decisions and processes, but being encouraged to participate in discussions and provide feedback. Both successes and failures are discussed openly, meaning that valuable lessons can be learned, goals can be clarified, and roles well-defined. All of this enhances the overall organisational accountability.</p> Inclusivity <p>Open organisations actively welcome diverse viewpoints and ensure that everyone has a voice in the future of both the project, and organisation as a whole. This can be achieved not only through well-established technical channels but also through social norms that encourage a range of perspectives. It’s important that there are clear protocols for participation so as to promote an inclusive environment where feedback is valued. Leadership for inclusivity includes proactively including overlooked voices and ensuring that all relevant opinions are heard and considered. This approach enriches the decision-making process and also reinforces a sense of duty among employees to contribute meaningfully to discussions about their&nbsp;work.</p> Adaptability <p>The adaptability of open organisations is characterised by their flexibility and resilience, based on collective problem-solving and collaborative decision-making. To allow true adaptability, feedback mechanisms need to be accessible to both internal and external members. This allows for peer support and agency which can have clear impact on operational methods. This orientation towards continuous learning and the readiness to adapt based on feedback helps organisations avoid repetitive mistakes. It also helps them stay responsive to the changing needs of their environment.</p> Collaboration <p>In open organisations, collaboration is the default mode of operation. These is a general belief that working together produces superior outcomes, not only in project work, but also in terms of improving organisations. Ensuring a spirit of openness means that work is not only shared within the organisation but is also available for improvement by external parties, leading to greater innovation and continuous improvement. The ease with which people can discover, provide feedback on, and join ongoing work is a useful barometer for how different, welcoming, and collaborative open organisations are compared to&nbsp;others.</p> Community <p>The community aspect of open organisations is based on shared values and principles that guide participation and decision-making. These values should be clear to all members and help define the organisation’s boundaries and success criteria. Team members within this community approach are empowered to make significant contributions based on a common ‘language’ to prevent miscommunication. Sharing knowledge and experiences is encouraged to further the group’s work, which strengthens the communal bond and ensuring collective progress towards organisational goals.</p><p>As you can see, these characteristics are interconnected and intertwined, leading to a virtuous cycle of openness.</p> Practical Steps Towards&nbsp;Openness Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Ultimately, working openly is about cultural change. A change in attitude as much as a change in processes.</p><p>To transition to more open working practices, consider the following steps:</p>  Clear guidelines: Work together to document and share clear guidelines on what open working could look like in your organisation. This includes how information is shared, how feedback is given and received, and how decisions are&nbsp;made.  Culture of transparency: Encourage leaders and team members to share their work and the reasoning behind their decisions openly. This can be facilitated through regular meetings, shared digital workspaces, and open forums where ideas and projects are discussed transparently.  Inclusive communication: Ensure that all team members have equal access to communication tools and platforms. Use a variety of channels to accommodate different working styles and preferences, and encourage everyone to contribute to discussions and decision-making processes.  Collaboration across boundaries: Use technology and collaborative tools to break down silos within your organisation. Encourage teams to work together across departments and even invite external partners or customers to contribute to projects where appropriate.  Community engagement: Create spaces (physical/virtual/hybrid) where employees can interact, share ideas, and support each other. Regular community-building activities and team-building exercises can strengthen the communal bonds and enhance the shared sense of&nbsp;purpose.   Addressing Potential Challenges Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>While transitioning to an open working environment offers many benefits, it also comes with challenges that need to be managed. For example, information overload can be avoided by sharing information in a structured and digestible way so as not to overwhelm team members. Try using tools that allow for information to be categorised and easily searched.</p><p>While transparency is to be encouraged, clearly define sensitive information to ensure that robust security practices are in place to protect it. Provide training to team members around data protection standards and the importance of respective privacy and confidentiality.</p><p>While open working encourages broader participation, this needs to be balanced with the need for efficiency. So set clear objectives and deadlines for collaborative projects to avoid decision-making bottlenecks or&nbsp;delays.</p><p>Some team members may resist changes to traditional ways of working. Overcome such cultural resistance by demonstrating the tangible benefits of open working practices through pilot projects and sharing success stories. Provide training and mentoring to help adaptation to the new ways of doing&nbsp;things.</p> Conclusion Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>The shift towards working openly and transparently is a strategic move that can significantly enhance an organisation’s agility, innovation, and engagement. By encouraging a culture of openness based on transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community, organisations can create an environment where every member feels valued and empowered to contribute.</p><p>This approach not only drives better business performance but also cultivates a sense of shared purpose and commitment among employees. Embracing open working practices isn’t just an ‘initiative’ but a pathway to sustainable success and a robust bottom line. By implementing clear guidelines, engendering a culture of transparency, ensuring inclusive communication, promoting collaboration, and engaging the community, organisations can navigate potential challenges and realise the full benefits of open&nbsp;working.</p><p>As you would expect of an organisation called We Are Open, our cooperative can help you and your organisation on this journey. <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">Get in touch</a>, or take our <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/open-course/">free email-based course</a>, to find out&nbsp;more!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-business-case-for-working-openly-and-transparently-867e3fb04588">The Business Case for Working Openly and Transparently</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>IDunion SCE, the neutral and democratically organised European cooperative created from the IDunion research consortium, has been offering their managed network infrastructure for industrial and productive use since April 2024.</p>

<p>As a neutral basic infrastructure, the distributed and redundant network enables every company to independently store and manage identity information and all types of company-related data. Companies can store unique and distinctive company identity-related identifiers (DID – Decentralised Identifier) on the IDunion network, which are permanent, unchangeable and verifiable and do not require the use of a central register. The identifiers can be linked to user-defined company data or company attributes. All company data can be managed according to predefined parameters and can of course also be revoked. IDunion SCE makes the identifiers available to companies as required and assigns corresponding write authorisations for network use on an individual contractual basis.</p>

<p>The network is based on the open source software Hyperledger Indy. All network nodes are operated exclusively by cooperative members in accordance with the principles of the IDunion SCE and monitored by the latter as a neutral body. The IDunion SCE and the infrastructures it manages and supports are subject to the principles of openness, neutrality, sovereignty, transparency, integrity and cooperative competition. All members of the cooperative have the same voting rights, regardless of their company size. This ensures that all participating companies can have an equal influence on the technical and organised development of the IDunion SCE and thus the ecosystem. Companies can join the European co-operative as members at any time.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation recently convened a panel on Artificial Intelligence and Identity Standards. The panelists included:</p>
 
 Nancy Cam-Winget, Cisco 
 Kaelig Deloumeau-Prigent, Netlify 
 Mike Kiser, SailPoint 
 Geraint Rogers, Daon 
 Gail Hodges, OpenID Foundation (moderator) 
 
<p>This summary draws out general themes and comments are not attributed to individuals or their organizations.</p>
 Technology is Never Neutral 
<p>“Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral”</p>
<p>-Melvin Krantzberg</p>
<p>People and organizations have been working to build artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools for many years now. For decades, companies have been using predictive AI for a range of purposes, including fraud detection, security, etc. When the pandemic hit, Moderna used AI to speed up the development of the vaccine.</p>
<p>On the flip side, such models can (either inadvertently or by design) deepen disparities, promote bias, or create other harms. After all, if Moderna can apply these tools for public health, bad actors can use similar models to create biological weapons.</p>
 New Tools, New Harms 
<p>AI has been present for some time, but with the emergence of Generative AI (coupled with vast increases in computing power now available), there are far more tools available – and to a much wider audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panelists agree that this expanding audience, while it fosters inclusion and democratizes technology, creates meaningful new risks. With OpenSource AI LLMs now available (e.g. via HuggingFace) would-be bad actors have extremely powerful tooling at their fingertips. Each and every benefit of AI might be mirrored in illicit industries.&nbsp;</p>
 Identity 
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/F4WZ_k0vUDM?si=O3SRoVSWDyGdmn8_">Nachricht von Ella | Without Consent</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p> One of the most insidious risks that the panel discussed is AI’s impact on Identity – not just Digital Identity, but Identity itself. Synthetic content is becoming pervasive and the threat of viable impersonation can no longer be ignored. The use of quantum-resistant digital signing to validate provenance becomes a priority for any content generated today.</p>
<p>Gen AI has changed the game. It’s a way of life in business operations now. Barriers to entry are so low – and this has had amazing benefits but they are mirrored in the dark world.&nbsp;</p>
 AI Development 
<p>Coding is now largely an AI-facilitated activity. As developers come to rely more and more upon LLMs to support their work, there is a risk that expertise – particularly in cybersecurity – may wane at the exact time that organizations like CISA are calling for more focus. Furthermore, research suggests that AI-assisted code is substantially more insecure&nbsp; – but that developers using AI wrongly feel that their code is more secure (see “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622">Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants</a>” out of Cornell) With more than 50% of code being AI generated today, there is substantial risk that bad code will enter the supply chain via AI.</p>
<p>It is in this context that there is a risk to the OIDF and other standards bodies that build safe and interoperable protocols. When novice developers, unfamiliar with the specifications, seek LLM guidance on OIDF standards, they may receive poor guidance as to how to implement or bad code itself.</p>
 Outsourced Ethics 
<p>As more and more thought gets outsourced to LLMs, there is a risk that humans will miss important opportunities to think critically about the ethical implications of any given work product. This may happen by virtue of efficiency-seeking, negligence, or decreasing levels of capability as specialisms shift to AI. Since all technologies are value-laden either by intention or by outcome (e.g. as a result of the training data and other system inputs), there’s a risk that human values will be replaced by algorithmic values if AI facilitated innovation isn’t kept in check.&nbsp;</p>
 What Can We Do? 
<p>There are many organizations and regulators now grappling with the challenges that emerging AI presents on a societal level. An audience poll revealed that the majority of OIDF members present agreed that the Foundation needs to keep a watchful eye on AI and act, now or in the future, to mitigate the risks posed by AI. Such mitigations might include:</p>
 
 Standards Development: ensure that threat models consider the latest attacks and that standards evolve to meet given the new risks that LLMs present for real people with regards to asserting and protecting their identities online.&nbsp; 
 LLM Accuracy: explore methods by which OIDF can help ensure that LLMs produce guidance that is aligned to the latest specifications and best-practice configurations.

<p>Visa has introduced <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a> to the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkey-use-case/payments/">payment industry</a>, enabling customers to authorize online purchases <a href="https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/blog/bdp/2024/05/14/the-key-to-1715698035525.html?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=VisaPaymentPasskey&amp;utm_id=VPF&amp;linkId=431538864">through a biometric scan</a> on their smartphones or computers when making a purchase online.</p>



<p>This capability is powered by the Visa Payment Passkey Service, which is built on Visa’s Fast Identity Online (FIDO) server. The service allows merchants to integrate the Visa Payment Passkey Service into their checkout systems without needing to establish their own servers, thereby simplifying the setup process.</p>



<p>For users, this means they can use the same biometric authentication methods they use to unlock their devices to approve Visa payments online, with a one-time enrollment required during checkout. Visa also plans to extend enrollment options to banking apps in the future.</p>



<p>The development of passkeys was a collaborative effort among major technology companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, which joined forces around 2012 to form the FIDO Alliance. This group aimed to overcome the limitations of traditional passwords by creating <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-overview/">open standards</a> for more robust authentication, involving biometric experts like HYPR and Nok Nok Labs.</p>



<p>FIDO released its first standards in 2014, setting the stage for authentication methods that do not depend on passwords. Subsequent advancements led to the establishment of the WebAuthn standard in 2019, which quickly gained acceptance among major web browsers. This progress facilitated the creation of passkeys, leveraging FIDO protocols to link authentication credentials to users’ mobile <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/biometric-component-introduction/">biometrics</a>.</p>



<p>Visa’s recent move has been welcomed by supporters of FIDO and passkeys. HYPR’s co-founder and CEO, Bojan Simic, commented on this development, stating that nearly every regulated business he has interacted with in the past year has included a passkey initiative in their plans in an online post. “I’m so proud of the work that we have all done at the FIDO Alliance to make this a reality. When we wrote the first FIDO implementation in 2014 here at HYPR, seeing the top brands adopt the standard in a major way seemed like fantasy.”</p>



<p>In making this vision a reality, Visa joins several other prominent companies that have recently introduced support for passkeys, including PayPal, Samsung, and Amazon.</p>

<p>Spring conference season is in full swing and the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) is heading to Europe to participate in several major conferences:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) </a>— June 4-7, Berlin, Germany 



 <a href="https://www.terrapinn.com/exhibition/identity-week/">Identity Week Europe </a>— June 11-12, Amsterdam, Netherlands 



 <a href="https://diceurope.org/">Digital Identity unConference Europe (DICE</a>) — June 18-20, Zurich, Switzerland.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>We will also be attending the second regional summit of the <a href="https://sidi-hub.community/about-sidi/">Sustainable &amp; Interoperable Digital Identity (SIDI)</a> Summit 2024 series.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP, which celebrates its fourth birthday this month, has long been known for its dual stack that emphasizes why we must combine technical interoperability with governance interoperability in order to establish truly interoperable digital trust ecosystems.</p>







<p>Although in our early history we were best known for our work on the governance side of the dual stack, at these June conferences our emphasis will be on two new technical specifications for which we just published Implementers Drafts: the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/11/toip-announces-the-first-implementers-draft-of-the-trust-spanning-protocol-specification/">Trust Spanning Protocol</a> and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/03/toip-announces-the-implementers-draft-of-thetrust-registry-protocol-specification-v2-0/">Trust Registries Protocol</a>. Both of these protocols are designed to maximize interoperability and authenticity and minimize risk, while still enabling each ecosystem to make the choices they need for their specific context.</p>



<p>The following is a schedule of all the conference sessions and talks in which ToIP members or our partners will be participating.</p>



 



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join us at EIC for a panel of ToIP Steering Committee Members, moderated by Executive Director, Judith Fleenor.</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5643/1">Panel: The Emerging Trust Layer for the Internet: Using Minimum Viable Protocols to Achieve Maximum Interoperability</a> 



<p>Friday, June 07, 2024 13:30—14:30</p>



<p>Interoperability is not created alone and that is why ToIP collaborates with other standards organizations and certifications bodies.&nbsp; Executive Director, Judith Fleenor has invited the Executive Directors from <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/">Open Identity Exchange</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">Open Wallet Foundation</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> to unpack the role each foundation plays, how we collaborate to create the full picture for digital trust, and why it is so important for organizations and individuals to support and participate in several foundations, not just one.</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5709/1">Panel: Executive Directors Speak: Why We Need More Collaboration</a> 



<p>Friday, June 07, 2024 14:30—15:30</p>



<p>At last year’s EIC Judith gave a keynote on <a href="https://youtu.be/Hhv5-xbcmkw">Decentralized Identity Why is it all the rage?</a>&nbsp; Her premise was that the technologies that enable decentralized identity could be used, not only for traditional identity and access management, but more importantly for content authenticity and to assist in the challenges that AI brings.&nbsp; This year, Al will be a big topic at EIC, and several ToIP Steering Committee members will be addressing these topics in various sessions throughout the week.</p>



<p>On Wednesday Wenjing Chu, Futurewei Technologies and Drummond Reed, Gen Digital will be on the panel:</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5686/1">Redefining Human Identity in the AI Era: From Digital Evolution to AI Integration</a> 



<p>Wednesday, June 05, 2024 12:00—13:00</p>



<p>Following that Wenjing Chu will be giving the session:</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5551/1">Decentralizing AI: A Socio-Technical Path to Responsible and Trustworthy Tech</a> 



<p>Wednesday, June 05, 2024 14:30—15:00</p>



<p>Continuing in the AI track, Wenjing will be joining by others for the following panel discussion:</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5551/2">Is Decentralization The Best Way to Achieve Transparency and Verifiability in AI?</a> 



<p>Wednesday, June 05, 2024 15:00—15:30</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5557/1">Charting the Course: Diverse Approaches to AI Regulation in a Fractured World</a> 



<p>Wednesday, June 05, 2024 15:30—16:10</p>



<p>AI isn’t the only opportunity vs threat we are facing in the near future.&nbsp; Quantum Computing is coming as well.&nbsp; Also, on Wednesday, Steve McCown, Anonyome Labs, will be giving a presentation:</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5567/3">Post Quantum Security: Cryptography in Decentralized Identity</a> 



<p>Wednesday, June 05, 2024 18:10—18:30</p>



<p>Another big topic at EIC will be the use of verifiable credentials and the digital wallets that hold them. Several sessions will explore these topics and give real word examples of their use in productions.&nbsp;</p>

  You’re reading this on a machine with an operating system: Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, or Android. But that’s not your OS. It’s your machine’s.

<p></p>
<p>You’re reading this on a machine with an operating system: Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, or Android.</p>
<p>But that’s not your OS. It’s your machine’s.</p>
<p>How about one for you, that runs on your machine but is entirely yours? Let’s call it a Personal OS, or a POS.</p>
<p>The POS will have a kernel onto which abilities (not just applications) can be added. An extreme example of how this might work is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GftSkyUsA94">Neo learning ju jitsu</a> in The Matrix:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GftSkyUsA94"></a></p>
<p>That OS amplified&nbsp;Neo’s own intelligence, in his own head. We’re far from that today. But we can at least add abilities to a POS of our own. Those too can give us more agency of many kinds.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there is only one POS so far. It’s called <a href="https://paios.org/">pAI-OS</a> (<a href="https://github.com/pAI-OS/paios">Github code</a>), and it’s led by <a href="https://kwaai.ai">Kwaai</a>.* To my knowledge, pAI-OS is the first and only truly personal operating system. (If others do the same, let me know and I’ll talk those up too.) And it is built to run our own AIs. Let’s call them PAIs, where the A can mean amplified or augmented (<a href="https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/">sourcing Doug Englebart</a> for the latter).</p>
<p>So, what kind of abilities are we talking about?</p>
<p>Let’s start with something that could hardly be more mundane and important: memory.</p>
<p>In Laws of Media, Marshall McLuhan said (five decades ago) that computing promises “perfect memory—total and exact.” For many millennia, our species has been outboarding memory through speech, the written word, and collecting all of that in libraries and museums. And now, in the digital age that dawned with microcircuits and the Internet, we now occupy a <a href="https://www.digitallife.center/index.php/digital-life">digital world</a> where everybody can publish whatever they want. To peruse that, we made search engines. Those ruled from the late ’90s until approximately yesterday, when AIs took over servicing our interest in answers to questions. Google, Microsoft, ChatGPT, Perplexity.ai, and others have moved into a space we might call AI answerware.</p>
<p>Running all that answerware are corporate AIs. Lets call them CAIs. Nothing wrong with CAIs, but also nothing personal, because they are not ours. I explain the difference in <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">Personal vs. Personalized AI</a>. Here’s a graphic from that post showing a bit of what abilities might run on your PAI:</p>
<p></p>
<p>PAIs can extend our own memories by accumulating personal stuff we need to know better, and our ability to meet, access, and use the external abilities of the CAI world. So we’ll have our agents + their agents, working together.</p>
<p>For an example of how that might work, take a look at <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">The most important standard in development today</a>: <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/">P7012:&nbsp;Standard for Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms</a>, which “identifies/addresses the manner in which personal privacy terms are proffered and how they can be read and agreed to by machines.” After seven years with a working group, it is now in the IEEE editing and approval mill, edging toward becoming a finished standard by next year. It works like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here your agent (a PAI, represented by the ⊂ symbol) proffers your privacy terms (<a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/tools/terms/p2b1/">here is one example</a>) to a corporate agent (which might or might not be a CAI, but is still represented with the reciprocal symbol ⊃. (This should be familiar to ProjectVRM veterans as the <a href="https://projectvrm.org/category/r-button/">r-button</a>. We may finally get to use it!)</p>
<p>The ceremony here is the exact reverse of what we have today with the cookie popovers on most website home pages. This can and should be done ⊂ to ⊃. So should signing and recording the agreement, or the choice of the site, should it tell you to screw off. (An agent running on your PAI will record that diss.)</p>
<p>I also bring this up because it will be a key required ability—not just for you and me but for the world, starting with Europe, where <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/">the GDPR lists six lawful bases for processing personal data</a>. They begin—</p>
<blockquote><p>(a) Consent: the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose.<br>
(b) Contract: the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.</p></blockquote>
<p>By now everyone knows that (a) Consent has failed. It’s an expensive and meaningless dance, with high cognitive (mostly cynical) overhead, and almost no accountability. Now they’re ready for (b) Contract, especially in ceremonies where the individual (not a mere “user”) takes the lead.</p>
<p>I believe there is less limit to what each of us can do with a PAI than there is to what we can do with a laptop or a phone. Because our PAI is our own. It runs on a deeper machine OS, but is not limited by that. Your PAI, running on your POS, may prove to be the first truly personal layer ever put on a machine OS.</p>
 
<p>*Full disclosure: I am now the <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/about">Chief Intention Officer</a> there. At this stage, it’s a voluntary position.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Digital ID has been increasingly in the news lately, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansardr/27632/&amp;sid=0017">Australia</a>&nbsp;begins to ramp up its systems pilots development following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196986150773792768/">the passing of legislation</a>. In Aotearoa there’s been<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202405/nz-cabinet-minister-champions-digital-id-in-government-transformation-at-data-summit?utm_source=MarketingList&amp;utm_campaign=dc16ec863f-Top+Reads+17-05-202417%2F5%2F24+11%3A59+AM&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_3ab9d4375a-dc16ec863f-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D">&nbsp;a lot happening too</a>&nbsp;as Minister Collins opened<a href="https://nzgovdata.co/">&nbsp;this year’s Summit</a>&nbsp;where DINZ was on stage later.</p>



<p>Contained within the avalanche of consultations posted in March and early April, was the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DISTF-Rules-Draft-April-2024.pdf">second revision of the rules</a>&nbsp;that support NZ’s own<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2023/0013/latest/LMS459583.html">&nbsp;Digital Identity Trust Framework (DISTF) Act</a>. The Department of Internal Affairs(DIA) presented to a packed virtual lunchtime audience on it earlier this month. Digital Identity NZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/dinz-distf-working-group/">DISTF Working Group</a>, comprising both private and public sector participants,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DINZ-Response-DISTF-Rules-submission-May-2024.pdf">responded in detail</a>, reflecting the overall message that, despite good intentions to improve security, data protection, and privacy to reduce online fraud, there are alot of moving parts for stakeholders to consider. The fact that it is ‘opt-in’ for stakeholders and that alternative/non-digital channels should always be offered to people and organisations because it is not compulsory, should help provide time to become comfortable and confident with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/biometrics-special-interest-group-sig/">DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group</a>&nbsp;made a&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DINZ-Submission-Biometrics-Code-Exposure-Draft-May-2024.pdf">deeply considered submission</a>&nbsp;on the Office of the Privacy Commissioner’s (OPC)<a href="https://privacy.org.nz/news/consultations/biometrics">&nbsp;exposure draft of a Code of Practice for biometrics under the Privacy Act 2020</a>. We continue to assert that a code is premature with potential for unintended consequences, whereas well drafted, clear guidance at the outset will deliver better outcomes for all New Zealanders. As if the above two were not enough, the<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2024/0044/latest/whole.html">&nbsp;CDR/CPD bill&nbsp;</a>is set to be introduced to Parliament, which also has a critical digital identity component.</p>



<p>Since the CPD and the Biometrics Code (should it be implemented) are mandatory for specific digital ID service providers undertaking particular identity-related processes, whereas the DISTF is opt-in, I sense that the weight of regulatory burden will result in tough choices for the industry in this small market, despite the good intentions of all stakeholders. In my view, we’ll have to be conscious of the potential for market stall. Could the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2024/0044/latest/whole.html?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=5e09a5a86b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_03_18_11_43_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-5d57a7a812-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D">CDR/CPD bill</a>&nbsp;help unify our data and streamline our sector and service laws to better suit our market size?</p>



<p>Meanwhile, sectors continue to analyse the role of digital identity and the potential to operate schemes within the DISTF, with financial services leading the way. This is demonstrated so clearly by the&nbsp;<a href="https://comcom.govt.nz/about-us/our-role/competition-studies/market-study-into-personal-banking-services?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=8c96051db1-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_03_18_11_43_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-5d57a7a812-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D#projecttab">Commerce Commission’s consultation on personal banking</a>, which highlights the importance of robust digital identification for frictionless bank-switching and faster progress towards Open Banking.</p>



<p>With the above very much in mind,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7194476205281087488/">Payments NZ and DINZ co-hosted a highly productive investigative sprint earlier this month</a>&nbsp;across its combined membership. We brought together experts, representatives from the private, public and NGO sectors, and heard inspiring presentations from Australia’s&nbsp;<a href="https://connectid.com.au/">ConnectID</a>&nbsp;and our very own<a href="https://mattr.global/">&nbsp;MATTR</a>.</p>



<p>The research and education sector have been deeply engaged with digital identity for many years and continue to lead on many fronts. Learn more at our lunchtime webinar on Thursday 13 June simply titled ‘<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-higher-education-aotearoa/">Digital Identity, Higher Education, Aotearoa</a>’, when DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.themiddlewaregroup.com/">Middleware</a>&nbsp;showcases fellow DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university.html">University of Auckland</a>.</p>



<p>The following week, DINZ and FinTechNZ members with a general understanding of ‘digital cash’ should diary note 20 June for a ‘town hall’ styled dynamic submission with The Reserve Bank of New Zealand – Te Pūtea Matua on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/hub/news/2024/04/consultation-opens-on-a-digital-currency-for-new-zealand#:~:text=The%20Reserve%20Bank%20of%20New%20Zealand%20%2D%20Te%20P%C5%ABtea%20Matua%20is,coins%20will%20still%20be%20available.">criticalities (including digital ID) surrounding ‘digital cash</a>’ – a Central Bank Digital Currency as a potential alternative to physical cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DINZ and FinTechNZ members who are familiar with ‘digital cash’ should watch for details about a town hall meeting on Thursday, June 20, with The Reserve Bank of New Zealand – Te Pūtea Matua, discussing a potential Central Bank Digital Currency as an alternative to physical cash. The meeting will cover important topics such as digital ID.</p>

Databases built on top of the Data Feed API get the advantage of powerful querying capabilities custom-tailored to the needs of the application, while retaining interoperability and composability of the underlying data with all other databases built on the Data Feed API throughout the Ceramic ecosystem.</p> What is the Data Feed API <p>The Data Feed API enables developers to keep track of all the new state changes happening to documents in the Ceramic network, as they are observed on a Ceramic node. These state updates can either be from writes sent to the Ceramic node through the HTTP Client, or writes discovered from the network for Streams belonging to Models that are indexed on the Ceramic node. Ultimately, the Data Feed API can be used to build custom indexers and other database products, e.g., <a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB</a>.</p> Supported API Methods <p>The Data Feed is a read-only API, allowing you to retrieve the feed data through HTTP GET methods. The Data Feed operates on the aggregated state of documents (such as Models and ModelInstanceDocuments), abstracting away the lower-level concerns of the underlying event streaming system. This allows developers to build with familiar JSON documents while taking advantage of automatic application of updates to document state with built-in schema validation.</p><p>Feed data can be accessed via a new HTTP endpoint on the js-ceramic node with the URL path <code>api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents</code>. The feed utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push messages with the following schema:</p> <code>FeedDocument = {
  resumeToken: string
  commitId: CommitID
  content: any
  metadata: StreamMetadata
  eventType: EventType
}
</code> <p>So for example, the following request:</p><p><code>curl http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents</code> </p><p>will return the following response:</p> <code>data: {
  "resumeToken": "1714742204565000000"
  "commitId": "k6zn3t2py84tn1dpy24625xjv65g4r23wuqpch6mmrywshreivaqiyaqctrz2ba5kk0qjvec61pbmyl15b49zxfd8qd3aiiupltnpveh45oiranqr4njj40",
  "content": "{...}",
  "metadata": {
    "controllers": [
      "did:key:z6MknE3RuK7XU2W1KGCQrsSVhzRwCUJ9uMb6ugwbELm9JdP6"
    ],
    "model": "kh4q0ozorrgaq2mezktnrmdwleo1d"
  },
  "eventType": 2
}
</code> <p>The Data Feed API can also be consumed through event listeners to continuously pull and process events from the feed. For example:</p> <code>import { EventSource&nbsp; } from "cross-eventsource";
import { JsonAsString, AggregationDocument } from '@ceramicnetwork/codecs';
import { decode } from "codeco";

const source = new EventSource('&lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents&gt;')
const Codec = JsonAsString.pipe(AggregationDocument)

source.addEventListener('message', (event) =&gt; {
	console.log('message', event)
	//use JsonAsString, and AggregationDocument to decode and use event.data
	const parsedData = decode(Codec, event.data);
	console.log('parsed', parsedData)
})

source.addEventListener('error', error =&gt; {
	console.log('error', error)
})

console.log('listening...')
</code>  Resumability <p>The Data Feed API also comes with a resumability feature that provides “at least once” delivery semantics. Resumability is the ability for a consumer of the feed to pick up “where it left off” after downtime. Without resumability, an indexer that goes down has no way of receiving and indexing data that was propagated while the indexer was offline. The goal of resumability is to ensure that a consumer of the Data Feed API can be guaranteed to receive the most recent data for each Stream at least once, even in the event of failure.</p><p>Resumability in Data Feed API is enabled by the <code>resumeToken</code> property, which is added to every object emitted by the Data Feed API. This property enables you to initiate a connection and ask for the entries starting immediately after <code>resumeToken</code>.</p><p>For example, let’s say your application got an entry containing <code>resumeToken: "1714742204565000000"</code> . When connecting, you can pass the token value as a query parameter, as follows:</p> <code>// ... same as a code snipped above
const url = new URL("&lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents&gt;")
url.searchParams.set('after', '1714742204565000000') // Value of the last resumeToken
// Connection to &lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents?after=1714742204565000000&gt;
const source = new EventSource(url)
</code> <p>Note that the internal structure of the resumeToken is meant to be considered opaque and may change in the future. You should not try to craft resumeTokens manually, instead, you should always use the resumeToken of the last event you received and processed successfully from the Data Feed resuming the feed with a new connection.</p> What’s coming next? <p>This release marks the initial public release of the Data Feed API with quite a few significant updates already on the horizon.</p><p>One of the upcoming significant updates will be introduced with the new Event Streaming API, powered by ceramic-one (a new implementation of the Ceramic protocol, written in Rust), which will allow developers direct access to the underlying event streams that have historically been hidden behind document-based APIs.</p><p>In addition to that, the core Ceramic team is committed to listening to your feedback and feature requests and taking them into account for future releases.</p><p>At this stage, the core Ceramic team would like to see early adopters trying out the new API and sharing the early feedback with the team.</p> Share your feedback with the Ceramic team! <p>Do you have ideas for how Data Feed API can enable the development of your projects? Or maybe you have questions or feedback on what could be improved?

<p>Identity providers including Canadian Bank Note (CBN), Veridos (a joint venture between German security tech company Giesecke+Devrient and federal technology company Bundesdruckerei) and Thales shared digital and mobile identity innovations, developments and lessons learned from real-world deployments during Day 2 of ID4Africa in Cape Town. </p><p>The discussion concluded that Digital Identity is a powerful tool to increase inclusion and opportunity. A successful program is one everyone can use, including issuers, holders and verifiers. Convenience, security and interoperability are critical success factors. </p><p>Why build on global standards?<br>Trust - global standards are what enable relying parties / verifiers to trust digital IDs</p><p>Security - digital IDs are always verified electronically using standardized protocols, eliminating the need for error-prone physical inspection</p><p>Ecosystem development - building on standards enables ecosystems to benefit from network effects. For example, wallet provider like Google and Apple are working to persuade entities like Uber and Airbnb to adopt mDOC - reducing the need for ecosystem conveners to find verifiers for the ecosystem </p><p>Scalability - building on standards facilitates planning for the future and readiness to expand into new use cases. For example, the TSA (the body that manages security of air travel in the US) has started accepting mobile IDs for domestic air travel in some states where ISO mDL has been implemented </p><p>Cost reduction - avoid being locked in to a single vendor and reduce the cost of ongoing maintenance and support. Digital Identity based on the 3-party model enables holders to present credentials directly to verifiers, meaning there is no longer a need to maintain verification infrastructure, unlocking major financial savings compared to federated identity schemes, Mark Sullivan said</p><p>Benefits of participation in standards development</p><p>Canadian Bank Note (CBN) is involved in both standards development and implementation. "Digital Identity will be constantly changing for a while now. Participating in the standards process enables us to bring the latest and greatest in Digital Identity back into our solutions space", said Mark Sullivan, Director of Digital Services </p><p>Standards development gaps </p>  Standards integration. CBN is currently focusing on ISO mDL, as it is the only credential format that formalizes credential exchange today   Cross-border trust. Don't reinvent what already exists. For example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Public Key Directory is a database holding national cryptographic keys used in authentication of e-passport information - need something similar to ensure interoperability between countries  <p>Adoption insights</p>  The tools and standards are in place, but there is still hesitance to start building  Issuing Digital Identities is not enough to ensure adoption; there must be services associated with these identities  Governments' role is to create digital infrastructure which individual agencies and private sector orgs can leverage to make customers' lives easier and safer   Ease of use is critical: Digital Identity needs to be as easy to use as presenting a physical ID card. CBN recommends tight integration of UX/ UI teams into the software development process; their UX team benefited from deep dive research into other apps that require trust to be established, such as mobile banking  <p>Addis Ababa scoops ID4Africa 2025 AGM host city</p><p>The National ID Ethiopia team are celebrating in Cape Town tonight after being announced as winners of the competition to host the ID4Africa 2025 AGM!</p>

		<p>Slalom and New Jersey Institute of Technology Launch “Sophie”–A Prototype Digital Student Concierge</p>
<p>NEWARK, NJ, May 22, 2024 – The EdgeCon conference series continues to solidify its place as a destination event for higher education decision makers, with EdgeCon Spring garnering the event’s highest-ever attendance rate and attendee satisfaction rate. Edge members and vendors are taking note, and choosing the event as a key venue for innovative announcements.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.slalom.com/us/en">Slalom</a> and longtime Edge member, <a href="https://www.njit.edu/">New Jersey Institute of Technology</a> (NJIT), chose EdgeCon as their venue to officially debut a prototype AI Student Success Tool to attendees.</p>
<p>EdgeCon served as the ideal environment for the debut, given the prevalence of higher education membership in attendance, as well as the timely discussions of how AI is transforming higher education. Currently being referred to in development as Sophie, the AI tool is called the NJIT Digital Student Advisor, and is a prototype “digital student concierge”. Sophie was built using Soul Machines technology, with chat capabilities provided by GPT 3.5, and hosted in Microsoft Azure. The prototype was designed to work on any cloud platform with a native LLM integration (AWS, Google, etc.).</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Launching the prototype for our digital student advisor ‘Sophie’ in partnership with NJIT is just the beginning of a transformative journey for higher education in New Jersey. As we embark on a journey to humanize the future of AI, we’re not just shaping technology, we’re shaping the future of education itself, unlocking limitless possibilities for personalized learning and student success.”&nbsp;</p>
 — Stephen Walsh<br>
Senior Director – Public &amp; Social Impact<br>

		<p>In this prototype stage, Sophie was programmed to address a specific use case regarding a student interested in switching majors. The Q&amp;A format shown in the demo was developed around typical questions a student may ask when switching majors or attending NJIT for the first time. Further development will focus on additional use cases to support students in their journey when accessing academic or social services at NJIT. The overall purpose is to create and improve upon a digital humanizing experience for students and faculty – one that is both informative and supportive.</p>
<p>Ed Wozencroft, Vice President for Digital Strategy and Chief Digital Officer, Vice President Digital Strategy CIO, NJIT, shared, “NJIT’s Artificial Intelligence Initiative seeks to embed AI in all facets of our university–from teaching and learning; to research and innovation; our operations and infrastructure – all while remaining human-centered. Undoubtedly AI is here to stay, and higher education must adapt to succeed. With great partners like Slalom, we can quickly develop and deploy great tools and services that change the nature of education and improve the value proposition of investing in a now highly personalized higher education.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the prototype is in its early stages, NJIT is currently in development discussions with Slalom to determine the next phases and potential release dates. Stay tuned for launch dates and availability.</p>
<p>Slalom’s professional services are available for procurement by the higher education and public sector communities via Edge’s cooperative pricing system, EdgeMarket. To learn more about EdgeMarket, visit https://edgemarket.njedge.net/home.</p>

<p>DIF SC members and staff are among 2000+ participants from 101 countries participating in the ID4Africa 2024 AGM in South Africa.</p><p>Almost half of the delegates present at the event in Cape Town are representing African governments, as the ID4Africa movement celebrates its tenth year. The opening morning was rich with strategic and operational insights,  including</p>  The stakes are high. Digital identity is critical to "defeating the scandal of invisibility" and ensuring equal access to education, healthcare and economic opportunity, according to Mr Mthiyane, policy director of South Africa's Department of Home Affairs  Optimism tempered by realism. Digital identity is growing fast, but it's still early days. It has taken 30 years for e-passports to reach universal adoption, and ID4AFrica Executive Chairman Dr Atick expects a similar timescale for full adoption of digital ID, though this will be on a bigger scale  Theory versus reality. Some believe citizenship and access credentials should be kept separate. In practice, "You can't think of the technology without considering the national context" Dr Atick stated. This was borne out by the accounts of countries with multiple or porous borders, where establishing citizenship is a key step, though not all services require it    Need for policy and technology alignment. In a poll taken during the initial plenary session, 88% believed a policy requiring a unique National ID Number (UID) to access services should be a priority for lawmakers. Such a policy comes with its own challenges, including how to address the risk of exclusion and safeguard citizens' privacy.  Mix of physical and digital credentials. ID cards are not about to disappear. Most if not all of the programs outlined by speakers combine a UID (often linked to birth registration), a physical card and a digital ID (usually stored and presented via a mobile app). Most programs have adopted a multi-modal approach, with enrollment, authentication et cetera possible online, offline and in-person. That said, digital identity is seen as an important tool to accelerate progress towards Identity For All (UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9). For example, Malawi's digital ID scheme has helped it transition from a situation where most citizens lacked any legally recognised ID in 2017, to being on track to become the first African country to achieve UN SDG 16.9.    Digital identity as Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). This is the overall theme for the 2024 AGM and was reflected in several panel discussions after the lunch break focused on public policy. A number of related questions were discussed, including how countries can leverage digital identity programs to bootstrap a wider DPI while avoiding being locked into any particular technological approach or stack. Uganda's UGHub team shared that they are pursuing a strategy to establish DPI using protocols, not point solutions. Benefits include 100% uptake of electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) by banks and the rapid deployment of e-signatures across many sectors.  "I urge you to look at UGHub as an example of how to successfully establish DPI" Dr Atick commented.   Evolving privacy approaches. Most schemes rely on centralized databases to store foundational ID data. Privacy and security measures include UID randomization, data encryption, strong access management (including requiring government agencies to prove compliance with privacy laws), explicit user consent for data sharing and tokenized / decentralized authentication. Interest in standards-based privacy enhancing technologies such as decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials is growing.  <p>These insights elicited many challenging questions from the audience. </p><p>Implementation insights from Ethiopia's Fayda ID program</p><p>DIF Steering Committee member Yodahe Zemichael kicked off the presentations from national ID teams by providing an update on Ethiopia's Fayda program. </p><p>Launched in 2022, Fayda provides a foundational ID for citizens and refugees. Key achievements to date include</p>  Personal data regulation passed, creating a strong foundation for Fayda acceptance and uptake  integrated 44 organisations including banks and telcos covering more than 60% of the population, enabling them to securely onboard customers  Started authentication for real-time KYC by relying parties - currently processing 8,000 requests per day  <p>Mr Zemichael described the key points of Ethiopia's strategy for digital credentials:</p>  Enabling citizens to download a legal ID credential as a printable document with embedded QR code, share via a mini-app or show as a plastic printed card (all 3 are equally accepted)   Enable online and offline authentication for eKYC. Most authentication is offline to date (via an authenticator app). This is beneficial for privacy, and Mr Zemichael believes it will continue to be the mainstay of KYC processes for some time   Security and privacy are of utmost importance. The national ID team is looking to support W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) standards in time   <p>Mr Zemichael shared valuable learnings from the Fayda rollout, including </p>  Strong demand for physical credentials - requires printed cards to be delivered to citizen's homes  Enrolling people is an expensive affair including extensive educational activities plus a physical presence in multiple locations. As a result, Fayda is being scaled up  gradually  Importance of citizen education and support, including a national call centre which is open 6 days a week and fields a high volume of queries  <p>The day wrapped up with a fascinating session on DPI, that showed the wide range of approaches being adopted by African nations. Three examples illustrate this diversity</p>  Zambia started by digitizing healthcare records, as this was the most urgent use case. The national ID team is now looking at which outputs can be re-used in other use cases, creating opportunities to build DPI 'on the fly'  Senegal started by identifying digital assets that already existed within different agencies. The country is now building a federation scheme that enables all agencies to leverage these assets  Malawi adopted a 'greenfield' approach that capitalizes on the previous lack of identity infrastructure, enabling the country to create a best-practice digital ID program from scratch without needing to integrate legacy systems and platforms   <p>Dr Atick wrapped up the first day's proceedings by concluding that Africa has talent, digital public infrastructure and choice. </p><p>More updates from the DIF team tomorrow! </p>

 A less technical community-centric guide Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>It’s <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/03/16/verifiable-credentials-and-open-badges-3-0-whats-changed/">been a while</a> since the upcoming changes to the Open Badges specification were first proposed. The <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/impl">change to v3.0</a> has now been ratified, with six organisations at the time of writing having platforms that are <a href="https://site.imsglobal.org/certifications">certified compatible</a>.</p><p>We’d like to give a shout-out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerrilemoie/">Kerri Lemoie</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nateotto/">Nate Otto</a> who have tirelessly pushed this work forward, ensuring that the original community-focused mission has continued now that the standard is stewarded by&nbsp;1EdTech.</p><p>The video below gives a overview with the rest of the post helping break down the changes in a less technical way. We can’t say “non-technical” because, well, it’s a technical standard. But we hope that it what follows helps you understand some of the changes and what it means in practice.</p> 1. Enhanced&nbsp;Security <p>Open Badges 3.0 adopts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) data model, which enhances the security and integrity of credentials. Unlike with previous versions of the specification, the verifiable data that they contain can be validated without having to check back with the issuer each&nbsp;time.</p><p>This matters because organisations go out of business, web pages get taken down, and life moves on. By ensuring that the badge contains everything required, it can be used for truly lifelong learning for decades to&nbsp;come.</p><p>For example, imagine a cooperative that issues digital badges to its members for skills like collaborative decision-making or sustainable practices. When co-op members with these badges present them to, say, a partner organisation, they can trust that the badge is genuine without needing to contact the co-op directly.</p><p>This is particularly useful in large networks like those we support through our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">storytelling and communications work</a>, where verifying a member’s skills quickly and accurately is valuable.</p> 2. Control and&nbsp;Privacy <p>The introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier">Decentralised Identifiers</a> (DIDs) in Open Badges 3.0 gives badge earners more control over their personal data and how it is shared. DIDs are like personal web addresses for people’s digital identities that they can manage independently.</p><p>For community-oriented organisations, DIDs mean that members can manage their own credentials without relying on a central authority. For example, a member of a social enterprise could share their badges with a funder directly from their personal digital wallet, enhancing privacy and&nbsp;control.</p><p>Also, because DIDs are big long strings of numbers you can also use them anonymously. This could be useful for verifying the claims of sources who want to remain unidentified, for example that a whistleblower actually worked at an organisation that they’re reporting. It’s also possible to control multiple DIDs for different facets of your life, should you wish, such as work, activism, and your social&nbsp;life.</p> 3. Richer&nbsp;Metadata <p>Open Badges 3.0 allows for richer metadata within badges, which means more detailed information about achievements, how they were earned, and what they represent. This includes supporting multimedia content, making badges more descriptive and informative.</p><p>Credentials like badges are useful in helping us tell the story of where we’ve been and where we’re going. This is sometimes called the ‘learner journey’. With Open Badges 3.0, a badge can include images, links, videos, and more, to provide a narrative of how the badge was earned. For those that can remember back 20 years to the interest in eportfolios, each badge is essentially a mini-eportfolio, and can also be part of a wider portfolio.</p><p>For example, a badge for a professional development course could include video testimonials, project examples, and peer evaluations directly within the badge. This makes it easier for potential employers or collaborators to get a true sense of what the badge represents, enhancing the value of the credential to all&nbsp;parties.</p> 4. Interoperability <p>It’s one of those words that it’s difficult to avoid when talking about technical systems, and not one that we use in every day conversation. But ‘interoperability’ just means the ability of different systems, organisations, or products to work together effectively without special effort from the user. Various systems and devices can communicate, exchange data, and use the information that has been exchanged.</p><p>That’s might not sound too exciting, but with its alignment to the VC data model, Open Badges 3.0 is designed to work seamlessly with other digital credentials systems, including those used by educational institutions and businesses. For example, we’re working with the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium</a>, and systems can issue all different kinds of achievements, because of the interoperability between Open Badges and&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>For instance, a non-traditional learner who has earned badges as part of their self-taught skills development might want to share these with a university to get onto an MSc course. The university’s system can automatically recognise and understand the badges thanks to the shared VC model. This eases the process of credit recognition and transfer, making it simpler for learners to continue their education or seek job opportunities without so many bureaucratic hurdles.</p> 5. Revocation and Status Management <p>To ‘revoke’ a badge simply means to say that it is no longer valid. There are many reasons why an individual or organisation may wish to do this, and not just because of errors in issuing or poor behaviour by the recipient.</p><p>For example, imagine that an B-Corp has a training programme which they update. While they could simply leave the old badges as-is, to provide less of a headache for people trying to understand the difference between current and previous alumni of the programme, they can now revoke, update, or withdraw badges efficiently.</p><p>With Open Badges 3.0, this process is transparent and straightforward, ensuring that only the most current and accurate badges are in circulation. This helps maintain trust in the badge ecosystem, which is vital for the credibility of our collective efforts in promoting digital credentials.</p> Conclusion <p>I’ve been unreasonably excited about a technical specification for 13 years now, ever since the first MacArthur-funded pilot at Mozilla. This latest update to Open Badges 3.0 is a significant step forward in making digital credentials more secure, user-centered, and meaningful within various communities, including educational institutions, professional networks, and social organisations.</p><p>Along with the work that we’ve been doing around creating <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">plausible utopias for Open Recognition</a>, I’m really looking forward to seeing how this development helps further empower individuals and communities, enhances trust in digital credentials, and supports the broader landscape of lifelong learning.</p><p>If you’d like help with understanding either the basics or the latest developments in credentialing technology, <a href="mailto:hello@weareopen.coop">get in touch</a>! We’ve also got a free email-based course called <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/reframing-recognition/">Reframing Recognition: strategies for success in going beyond microcredentials</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/why-open-badges-3-0-matters-09bb231be864">Why Open Badges 3.0 Matters</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Honorable Rohit Chopra<br>Director<br>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&nbsp;<br>1700 G St NW<br>Washington, DC 20552&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="mailto:rohit.chopra@cfpb.gov">rohit.chopra@cfpb.gov</a></p>
<p>May 16, 2024</p>
<p>Director Chopra,</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is a non-profit organization whose mission is to lead the global community in creating open standards that are secure, interoperable and privacy-preserving. As part of that mission, we have worked closely with many ecosystems to advance Open Banking and consumer financial data sharing globally. We hope to be of service to the CFPB as we are to many other government partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are writing to follow up on our <a href="https://openid.net/oidf-comments-cfpb-rule-1033-regarding-open-banking/">letter</a> submitted on December 29, 2023 in response to the CFPB’s NPRM on Personal Financial Data Rights.&nbsp; This letter is written in light of submissions by other commenters and subsequent discussions with parties in the ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As detailed in our original letter, the OpenID Foundation believes that the final rule should include reference to a Qualified Industry Standard (QIS) for a Communication Protocol.&nbsp; More specifically, we believe this QIS should be required and separate from the QIS for “data in a standardized format” (“Data Format”) as proposed in §1033.311(b). We appreciate that such a change will have an impact to the definitions of 1033.131 and 1033.141(a). We respect the baseline included in 1033.421(e), however as security and implementation experts, we believe it would be suitable to address the security and interoperability risks more completely within this ecosystem as advised in this letter. Since the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act was passed in 1999, the domain of cloud based services, the related security risks, and the global standards to address those risks have evolved substantially.</p>
<p>Specifications for a Data Format and a Communication Protocol are critical to the developer interface required in §1033.301(a), as the standards serve two different purposes. A Data Format standard should prescribe, among other things, naming conventions, standard codes and formatting, data models and schema. A standardized Data Format promotes business interoperability, by allowing third-parties to aggregate and analyze high-quality data with ease.</p>
<p>In contrast, a standardized Communication Protocol ensures that data is shared in a manner that ensures security, and enables privacy and technical interoperability.&nbsp; Technical interoperability is a key element to achieve scale in the development and implementation of an Open Banking ecosystem – in particular to ensure that small or new market entrants wishing to receive data are able to easily participate.&nbsp; As mentioned in our original letter, the OpenID Foundation global community has developed a Communication Protocol that has become a de-facto industry standard for API ecosystems in general, and Open Banking / Open Data ecosystems in particular: FAPI – a profile of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.</p>
<p>The FAPI profile has been selected by multiple leading private and public Open Banking ecosystems. The FAPI profile is a security and interoperability enhanced version of OAuth 2.0 which closes critical security gaps that OAuth 2.0 alone does not address. Current global ecosystem adoption of FAPI include:&nbsp;</p>

<p>US FDX&nbsp;</p>


<p>Recommended</p>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;



<p>Beyond the 12 countries above and their milestones, we are seeing tangible growth:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Billions of successful FAPI API calls, with secure, interoperable and consent-based movement of user data or payments&nbsp; 
 2,800 FAPI implementations certified globally (<a href="https://openid.net/certification/">https://openid.net/certification/</a>) 
 44 million active users in Brazil (20% of the population) 
 6.5 million active users in the UK (15% of the UK population) 
 
<p>Given the critical role FAPI is playing in the US and abroad, hope is that the CFPB will explicitly add a requirement for a Communication Protocol and that the OIDF’s FAPI profile will in due course be selected as a QIS to fulfil the proposed requirement for a Communication Protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the rulemaking docket and other discussions, we understand that the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) intends to apply to be a standard setting body (SSB) under proposed §1033.141, and that they would meet the requirements for the Data Format. Were FDX to be designated an SSB, it could select the FAPI profile as a QIS for the Communication Protocol to complete their market offering and help offer a scalable and interoperable solution – this would be the preferred outcome for the OIDF.&nbsp; Alternatively, if FDX were to choose not to specify a Communication Protocol that delivers interoperability and security to the level required for a financial services ecosystem, the OIDF would consider applying to be an SSB so that the FAPI profile could be used as a QIS for the Communication Protocol enabling US ecosystems conform to this critical requirement.</p>
<p>We would also like to make very clear the nature of the risks that arise should the CFPB not modify the requirements to explicitly require a Communications Protocol. These risks are broken down into four categories.</p>
 US Ecosystem Interoperability Risks: 
 
 There will be a diverse set of Communication Protocol variants delivered by data providers as no consistent standard is required. As a result there will be significantly greater complexity for authorized third parties to deal with when integrating with the developer interfaces delivered by the in scope data providers. This results in an increased cost burden on the authorized third parties, and they will be unlikely to all implement to all available interfaces.. 
 This increased cost burden is likely to reduce the likelihood of organisations choosing to become authorized third parties at all, reducing competition and choice for consumers. 
 If authorised third parties cannot easily implement to all data providers, they will build first to the interfaces of the largest data holders. This means consumers with smaller data holders will have reduced choice and services from authorized third party services. 
 The overall result is that the US would end up with one of the world’s worst and most inconsistent user experiences amongst all the current global deployments of Open Banking and Open Data deployed to date. 
 
 Time to Market Risks: 
 
 While it is clear that the CFPB is extremely keen to have an Open Banking ecosystem established in the US market there is a difference between banks having delivered compliant developer interfaces, and authorized third parties and consumers adopting Open Banking. If there is not a defined Communication Protocol market adoption will be slow. A Communication Protocol makes it easier for authorized third parties to deploy by reducing cost and complexity of developing and delivering new product offerings for consumers, and in turn their time to market to deploy and scale. &nbsp; This enhances the ability of the ecosystem to offer fair access to financial services, and treat customers fairly.&nbsp; 
 While adding a Communication Protocol requirement to the rule may seem to make it harder for data providers to deliver compliance on a timely basis, it actually makes it easier because it reduces the optionality available to implementers. In addition, FAPI conformance tests are freely available to implementors to use, software is deployed at scale in other markets, and many service organisations have deployment experience. By leveraging these capabilities, Saudi Arabia deployed FAPI across their ecosystem in less than 12 months, and UAE is likely to launch in less than 12 months later this year.&nbsp; 
 
 US Ecosystem Security Risks: 
 
 It is very likely that many US data providers will take the lowest cost approach to compliance with the regulation (as has been seen in other previous contexts) contributing to undesirable diversity in US implementations. 
 These implementations are unlikely to have all been subject to thorough security assessment, and real “battle testing” that a standardized Communication Protocol like the FAPI security profile has had.&nbsp; This means implementations will not be consistently secure by default. 
 Implementations that have not deployed and certified to the highest security profiles are at risk of being the “weakest links” amongst not just US but global Open Banking and Open Data deployments. That will make the US and these specific implementations attractive to sophisticated attackers, putting US consumers at higher risk. 
 These concerns introduce safety and soundness concerns to Open Banking participants and consumers. 
 
 International Interoperability Risks: 
 
 The diversity of implementations will set-back the US market in its ability to interoperate with other Open Banking implementations around the world. The majority of global ecosystems to date have selected FAPI, explicitly naming it in their regulations, and requiring certification to FAPI.&nbsp; 
 If the US does not choose a Communication Protocol that facilitates global interoperability by default, only the largest entities will have the compliance and technology resources to conduct cross border Open Banking transactions. Small and medium sizes data holders and third party service providers will not have the resources to enable global interoperability at all, or they will be forced to pay premiums to intermediaries that facilitate cross border services. Ultimately this impedes the ability to provide fair access to financial services, and treat customers fairly in the global marketplace.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Presuming that the mission of the CFPB is to protect the interests of American consumers,&nbsp;we strongly encourage the CFPB to reconsider the details and conformance criteria related to QIS, and to consult with NIST on benefits of defining a Communication Protocol as we advise. We also encourage the CFPB to move with speed so that the first data holders (those obliged to be compliant in spring 2025) must update their systems to global standards for a Communications Protocol, like FAPI. If the changes are not put into effect now, it will become materially more difficult to course correct later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also understand from your comments at the recent FDX conference that you are concerned about the governance model of standards bodies and certification providers. The OIDF believes our governance model will meet the CFPB requirements, and if necessary, we would work in good faith to close any gaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that this letter will be submitted into the public docket for further consideration and would welcome meeting with you or your staff to discuss our recommendation in further detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A deep dive on Smartflow by Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p><a href="http://smartflow.org">Smartflow</a> enables enterprises to configure worker nodes — a new technology developed by Energy Web. These nodes comprise distributed computing networks that securely execute sensitive business operations impacting multiple companies. Worker nodes themselves are decentralized nodes controlled by companies or individuals who have staked Energy Web tokens in order to become trusted worker node operators. All nodes are anchored to the Energy Web X parachain, itself a Parachain on the Polkadot&nbsp;network.</p><p>This technology was originally developed to solve a paradox that hinders advanced renewable energy tracking solutions like renewable matching and green electric vehicle charging: credibility relies on accurate, publicly verifiable results (e.g., proof that digital representations of renewables are not double-counted). But inputs from separate organizations, such as granular renewable energy production and electricity demand data, are commercially sensitive and need to remain private. Complex commercial, legal, and technical requirements often make it challenging for a single actor to unilaterally access and process all requisite data. The ability to establish a shared source of truth from segregated, individual information sources has been an ongoing challenge in multilateral settings; the challenge is even greater for energy market participants seeking to exchange and process granular data in order to procure services from distributed energy resources.</p><p>Smartflow solves these challenges by enabling enterprises to configure, launch, and maintain distributed computing networks that ingest data from external sources, execute custom workflows based on business logic, and vote on results in order to establish consensus and trustworthy results without revealing or modifying the underlying data. Worker Nodes apply proven and tested concepts and components from blockchain technology in a novel, enterprise-friendly architecture to provide all stakeholders with cryptographic proof that mutually-agreed rules and and processes are followed correctly, ensure computational outputs from business processes are correct, trustworthy, and preserve the privacy and integrity of underlying data for auditing purposes.</p><p>In addition to Smartflow being used as a generic configuration tool for any enterprise by Energy Web customers, the following are examples of existing worker node networks configured using Smartflow:</p>  <a href="https://rmi.org/press-release/maritime-book-and-claim-system-advances-pilot-study-to-support-first-movers-in-zero-emissions-shipping/">Worker nodes supporting the Maritime Shipping registry</a> supported by the Maersk McKinney Moller center for Zero Carbon&nbsp;Shipping  Worker nodes are also supporting a recently released solution for green electric vehicle charging on Energy Web X, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/introducing-autogreencharge-by-energy-web-a-decentralized-application-for-decarbonizing-electric-995436e8fea8">Autogreencharge</a>  A network of nodes powering the <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">Sustainable Aviation Fuel registry</a> in partnership with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers&nbsp;Alliance  A network of worker nodes is currently powering the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-releases-digital-spine-toolkit-to-the-public-e65847d468dd">Digital Spine solution</a> supporting multiple grid decarbonization projects  <p>How Smartflow and Worker Nodes Work: Worker nodes can be implemented in any development framework, including node.js, python, and rust. Each worker node is programmed to execute a specific conditional logic workflow based on a predefined dataset (i.e. source and schema) and event trigger (e.g. a regular time interval, or a specific external event). Workers are given read-only access to one or more external data sources via API or message broker. When the workflow “event” is triggered, the workers initiate a round of calculation and voting (worker nodes can be configured to either poll an external data source at regular intervals, or “listen” to an external source for a specific trigger).</p><p>In the calculation step, each worker node independently executes the same conditional logic based on the data it received during the trigger. Then, each worker submits its results (i.e. output of the logic workflow) to the smart contract, which collates the worker nodes’ votes into a unique voting round and keeps track of each round to maintain continuity. The smart contract defines a voting threshold (typically a simple majority, such as 2 of 3, or 4 of 7, etc.) that must be reached in order to establish consensus on the results of each voting round. Each voting round is defined by a voting ID, the number of unique votes (from worker nodes), and a consensus result. If the threshold is reached (i.e. a majority of nodes independently reach the same conclusion and submit identical results to the vote), then the voting round is closed and the result is hashed on the Energy Web X Parachain; this creates a connected tree of results that can be queried and validated for auditing purposes. If consensus is not reached in the voting round, the entire process from event trigger through voting is repeated; if a second round fails, a custom workflow is executed (this can include alerts, failover to other nodes, or acceptance of results from a plurality of workers).</p><p>In addition to collating the voting results, the smart contract is configured to issue rewards for workers in the pool based on performance criteria. A base reward can be issued simply for workers being available in the pool, and additional rewards can be issued based on metrics such as consistency (i.e. availability for all voting rounds), accuracy (i.e. being part of the winning consensus), and speed (i.e. being fastest to submit voting results following the event trigger). Workers presenting faulty results are penalized, so the only profitable strategy for a worker is to provide honest, accurate results. This mechanism ensures that the outcome of the process, the consensus reached, can be trusted by everyone, even without knowing all the input&nbsp;data.</p><p>This entire process is now abstracted away via Smartflow which enables enterprises to configure their own Worker Node networks in a no-code environment. Please see <a href="http://www.smartflow.org">smartflow.org</a> for additional information.</p><p>The infographics below summarize the value proposition of Smartflow. The first graphic shows how solutions are typically configured by enterprises without Smartflow before showing what the new process can be leveraging worker nodes and Smartflow.</p><p>Without Smartflow:</p><p>With Smartflow:</p><p>Industry testimonials:</p><p>“As long-time Energy Web supporters, we are excited by the decentralized approach to multi-party computation provided by SmartFlow. It is a digital tool that provides a new kind of trust layer in business relations based on shared information. We are eager to discover how it can be integrated into our processes, and what kind of value it can create,” said Etienne Gehain, New Digital Solutions Director at&nbsp;Engie.</p><p>“Energy Web’s collaboration with Deutsche Telekom shows that Web 3 technology can be an important tool in the fight against climate change,” says Dirk Röder, Head of Deutsche Telekom’s Blockchain Solutions Center. “Deutsche Telekom is not only securing the energy grid, but also accelerating progress towards climate targets while promoting renewable energies.”</p><p>On Smartflow’s embedded self-sovereign identity solution: “To ensure network security and stability, the integration of renewable energy sources into our energy systems will require household and industrial flexibility to be activated. SSI will be an important tool for creating a registry of decentralised and flexible assets that will allow us to monitor the state of the network and steer these decentralised assets.” Kris Laermans, Innovation at Elia&nbsp;Group</p><p>Jasper Verwaal, Digital Assets Manager at Deloitte recently provided the following insights on Energy Web X’s architecture, solutions, and worker nodes: “The architecture Energy Web has already built around asset management, exchanging data, and green proofs…can be seen as public infrastructure. The more standardization that’s in place, the easier it is to adopt common methodologies.” He continued, “Many enterprises find it challenging to put data on-chain. But we hope that Energy Web X will contribute to making it easier to decide what data lives on-chain and what data off-chain.”</p><p>Sahas Katta, CEO at Smartcar, the leading connected car API platform and Autogreencharge partner, said “This partnership will empower EV drivers with the knowledge and confidence to maximize the sustainability of their EV charging experience. With Smartcar, Energy Web can seamlessly integrate across diverse vehicle brands, giving more EV drivers access to accurate insights into charging transparency and renewable energy options,” in reference to the new Autogreencharge solution powered by Smartflow, worker nodes, and Energy Web&nbsp;X.</p><p>Bryan Fisher, Managing Director at the clean energy nonprofit <a href="http://www.rmi.org/">RMI</a> commenting on the SAFc registry deployed on Energy Web X supported by worker nodes, “The SAFc Registry is the culmination of RMI’s ongoing work to catalyze the sustainable aviation fuel market. By creating a throughline from corporate consumers to fuel producers, we can expand investment in SAF infrastructure and increase supply of low-carbon fuels. Voluntary uptake is critical to scaling a burgeoning market, and we hope this registry can serve as an example for other sectors in the&nbsp;future.”</p><p>Frederik Jacobsen, project manager at the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping commenting on the Maritime registry on Energy Web X supported by Smartflow worker nodes: “The collaboration with ZEMBA further strengthens the development of a global Maritime Book and Claim System and underlines how important such a system will be to overcome obstacles to accelerate the adoption of low-emissions fuels at&nbsp;scale.”</p><p>“We’re very interested in driving trust and transparency across the supply chain, which is why we’re so excited to join the Energy Web ecosystem,” said Thatcher Young, CEO of CarbonEnfo. “In addition to supporting the public blockchain, we see tremendous value in leveraging the Energy Web technology stack to advance our own application development.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/case-study-smartflow-3215f32ed2f5">Case Study: Smartflow</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>【ニューヨーク=川上梓】ホンダや日産自動車、米フォード・モーターなど日米企業120社で構成する企業連合が、電気自動車（EV）電池に関するデータの活用で欧州発の企業連合と連携する。電池の材料やリサイクルにつながる情報を相互に安全に共有・運用できるインフラを企業主体でつくり、EVの普及につなげる。</p>
<p>ホンダや日産、米自動車大手「ビッグ3」、IT（情報技術）企業など120社でEV電池の情報をデジタル上で管理する国際規格づくりを進めている「モビリティ・オープン・ブロックチェーン・イニシアチブ（MOBI）」が、欧州発の企業連合「GAIA-X（ガイアエックス）」と組む。</p>
<p>ガイアエックスは欧州で企業間のデータ連携を推進している。日米中心の企業連合のMOBIと、欧州のガイアエックスが組むことで、日本、米国、欧州の3地域の企業間で、電池の材料や劣化状態、充放電などの情報を相互に共有し、運用できるようにする。</p>
<p>具体的には、暗号技術を使って機密性を保ったうえで企業がデータを記録・管理できる「ブロックチェーン（分散型台帳）」の技術を使う。今後、両者で実証を始める。</p>
<p>相互運用が進めば、企業は利用できるデータの数や範囲が増え、サービスの低コスト化につながる。電池の劣化状態が見える化されれば、将来的に電池の残存価値をEVの中古車価格に反映できるようになる。利用者にとっては1つのアプリケーションから利用できるEVや充電インフラの種類が広がり、EVを利用しやすくなる。</p>
<p>電池の情報を巡っては、日本の経済産業省傘下の団体と欧州の官民データ基盤「カテナX」が連携を決めた。ガイアエックスはカテナXの上部組織にあたり、製品に使う素材や二酸化炭素排出量などのデータを企業間でやりとりする仕組みをつくっている。</p>
<p>電池の情報を管理・共有する仕組みは欧州で先行してきたが、米国企業も導入を検討している。22年に成立したインフレ抑制法でEV補助金を受けるため北米域内で電池材料や部材を調達することが条件になったためだ。</p>
<p>特に電池の材料であるレアメタル（希少金属）は中国への依存度が大きい。米国企業としては、日欧企業と連携することで電池の材料調達に関する情報を透明化したい狙いもある。</p>

<p>Authors: Zaïda Rivai (Danube Tech), Kim Duffy (DIF)</p><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs), offer an often overlooked benefit: they function as an identifier metasystem, enabling future-proofing and interoperability across diverse identity systems. This concept was the central focus of Sam Curren's session at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW), titled "DID or not? The Value of an Identifier Metasystem; Is eIDAS wrong?"</p> What is an Identifier Metasystem? <p>An identifier metasystem intermediates different digital identity systems and mechanisms, promoting interoperability and preventing conflicts. It provides a layer of abstraction above individual identifier systems, enabling them to work together seamlessly.</p><p>Starting with identifiers and identifier systems, examples you may be familiar with include:</p>  National identification systems (e.g., Social Security Numbers, National ID cards)  Domain Name System (DNS) for internet addresses  International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) for books  Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) for software systems  <p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are also identifiers that can further act as an identifier metasystem. The DID spec defines a common structure and syntax for identifiers, along with methods for resolving them to retrieve associated metadata (such as public keys and service endpoints). This allows different DID methods, each with their own specific implementation details, to be used interchangeably within a single system.</p> The Difference Between General Identifiers and DIDs <p>In general, identifiers – often stored in organization or application databases – lack context, making it difficult to determine their scope and uniqueness. In contrast, DIDs are globally unique identifiers that provide clear context. This difference is akin to the distinction between a web page describing content at another page and a hyperlink – with the latter, you are guaranteed to reach the source and obtain the latest information.</p><p>At an IT systems level, the lack of context and uniqueness in general identifiers can cause headaches for companies when merging or migrating systems, as conflicts may arise.</p> Key Benefits of the Identifier Metasystem <p>The identifier metasystem provided by DIDs offers several key benefits:</p>  Interoperability: Different systems using different DID methods can still interact and exchange data without conflicts or the need for extensive customization.  Flexibility: Organizations can choose the DID method that best suits their needs and constraints, while still maintaining compatibility with other systems.&nbsp;  Future-proofing: As new DID methods are developed, they can be easily integrated into existing systems without requiring major changes to the underlying infrastructure.  Normalized and Auditable Data Storage: DIDs enable organizations and applications to store identifiers in a normalized and auditable manner, facilitating easier rotation and updates to identity systems without substantial overhauls.  Enhanced Privacy: DIDs offer a way to bind credentials privately and securely, proving that certain credentials were indeed issued to a specific user without compromising privacy.   Addressing Common Misconceptions <p>Some common hurdles to adopting DIDs result from the following misconceptions:</p>  Belief that you have to support all DID methods: There are numerous DID methods, but implementers can choose which method(s) to support based on their requirements and restrictions.  Uncertainty around which DID method(s) to use and support: Implementers often hesitate because they're unsure which DID method to choose. The straightforward advice is to pick one that's appropriate to your use case, which aids in future-proofing and simplifies integration across diverse systems.  Belief that there are simpler ways to achieve the same results: The benefits of DIDs as an identifier metasystem can be overlooked due to the technical details of DIDs themselves. However, focusing on the benefits of the identifier metasystem provides clearer business value and future-proofing.  <p>Another potential concern around use of DIDs is the lack of an advanced standard (“W3C Recommendation” status or similar) for DID resolution and dereferencing. This is addressed as part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/04/did-wg-charter.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DID WG Charter update, effective 25 April 2024</a>, in which the DID Working Group will take over the DID resolution work currently underway at the W3C Credentials Community Group.</p> DIDs as Future-proofed Variants of Existing Tokens or Identifiers <p>Even if a system is currently required to use JSON Web Keys (JWKs), adopting the `did:jwk` method could serve as a bridge, allowing easier rotation and updates to identity systems without substantial overhauls. This approach enables organizations to store identifiers in a normalized and auditable manner while ensuring compatibility and avoiding potential conflicts in the future.</p> The European Union (EU) Perspective <p>Privacy Concerns</p><p>Some pushback towards DIDs has resulted from the perception that they can contribute to privacy violations and tracking. In some frameworks, this has led to the rejection of DIDs.&nbsp; However, employing DIDs is not inherently riskier than corresponding mechanisms; for example did:jwk offers the same privacy characteristics as JWK. And in the general case, DIDs have the potential to offer significantly improved privacy protection (see point 5 under Key Benefits of the Identifier Metasystem, above). </p><p>Regulatory Challenges and Recommendations</p><p>Regulatory recommendations around traditional identifiers like X.509 certificates are well-established, and moving away from them may not be an option. However, even in this environment, `did:x509` could be used to adhere to the existing requirements while future-proofing through the identifier metasystem and improving the ability to migrate in the future.</p> Implementing DIDs: Decisions Across an Organization <p>The benefits of DIDs as an identifier metasystem sometimes get lost due to the technical details of DIDs themselves. However, focusing on the benefits of the identifier metasystem provides clearer business value and future-proofing.</p>  System architects should view the adoption of DIDs as a strategic decision that aligns with long-term business goals, focusing on the overarching benefits of DIDs.  Product managers need to determine requirements, restrictions, and other characteristics relevant for the use case's regulatory requirements (e.g., inability to use blockchain) or user requirements.  Architects and developers should select the appropriate DID method(s) based on the above requirements, as well as any other operational considerations (tool support).  <p>The choice of DID method is also influenced by the role of participants. For institutions, the `did:x509` or `did:web` method can be preferred, while for individuals, the `did:jwk` method may be more appropriate, allowing for a cycle through various credentials while maintaining privacy and future-proofing.</p><p>Implementers should focus on building technical systems that support DIDs regardless of the environment, ensuring that the broad range of considerations is addressed, such as open standards/source, possible cost to users, whether other elements support DIDs, and whether DIDs are simply stored or if the ecosystem has first-class support for them.</p> Potential Risks and Concerns <p>While DIDs offer significant benefits as an identifier metasystem, there are potential risks and concerns to consider:</p>  Incentive for Migration: While DIDs make sense as a consideration when designing new systems, there may not be enough incentive for organizations to rewrite or migrate existing systems to adopt DIDs, given the potential costs and effort involved.  Control and Governance of DID Methods: There are questions around who gets to determine the "method" part of a DID (e.g., `did:method`), how to ensure there are no collisions or name squatting, and who gets to control and govern the various DID methods.  <p>Organizations should carefully evaluate these risks and concerns alongside the potential benefits of DIDs as an identifier metasystem when making decisions about adoption and implementation.</p><p>While the concerns around migration incentives and control of DID methods are valid, they should not overshadow the significant advantages DIDs offer in terms of interoperability, flexibility, future-proofing, and enhanced privacy.</p><p>To mitigate these risks, organizations can:</p>  Conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis to determine the long-term value of adopting DIDs, considering factors such as reduced integration complexity, improved data normalization, and enhanced privacy capabilities.  Engage with the DID community and participate in the governance processes of relevant DID methods to ensure that their concerns and requirements are addressed.  Develop a phased adoption plan that prioritizes the implementation of DIDs in new systems and gradually migrates existing systems over time, minimizing disruption and spreading out the costs.  Collaborate with industry partners, standards bodies, and regulatory authorities to establish best practices and guidelines for DID adoption and governance, promoting a more stable and predictable ecosystem.  <p>By proactively addressing these risks and concerns, organizations can confidently adopt DIDs as an identifier metasystem, leveraging its benefits to build more resilient, interoperable, and future-proof identity solutions that enhance privacy, simplify integration, and provide a solid foundation for the evolving digital identity landscape.</p> Conclusion <p>As the digital identity landscape continues to evolve, DIDs are well-positioned to play a crucial role in shaping a more connected, secure, and user-centric future. Organizations that recognize the value of an identifier metasystem and embrace DIDs will be at the forefront of building a more resilient and innovative digital identity ecosystem.</p> Thank you <p>We would like to thank Sam Curren for leading this session and all IIW attendees who contributed.

 Confirming Chicago Title Insurance Company’s VerifID™ service PCTF Verified Person Component conformance 



<p>May 14, 2024 – Toronto –&nbsp; We proudly announce that Chicago Title Insurance Company’s ID verification platform, VerifID™, obtained the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/pctf-verified-person/">Verified Person</a> certification, a massive milestone in becoming a trusted and reliable service in the Canadian ecosystem. DIACC welcomes Chicago Title’s VerifID to the <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/trusted-list/">growing cohort of certified providers</a> in digital identity, particularly in the critical area of real estate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Canada, mortgage and title fraud is a pressing concern, presenting an opportunity for fraudsters. In response, Chicago Title has developed VerifID, an innovative identity verification and fraud solution. VerifID combats fraudulent real estate transactions, demonstrating its proactive approach to addressing industry challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re passionate about stopping fraud; it’s why we developed VerifID,” said John Rider, Senior Vice President of Retail and Commercial Title at Chicago Title Insurance Company. “We wanted to take that passion to the next level by completing our PCTF certification, demonstrating our commitment to being&nbsp;the best in the business. VerifID doesn’t allow users to modify the verification process, which, in our experience, reduces the intake of valuable information; ours is the only solution that will meet DIACC standards 100% of the time.”</p>



<p>VerifID’s journey to DIACC PCTF certification was rigorous, marked by a thorough third-party evaluation that left no room for shortcuts. This evaluation ensured that the service met the stringent requirements of the Verified Person Component at LOA2, which shows Chicago Title’s commitment to leading the fraud and identity industry through continuous innovation and best practices.</p>



<p>The DIACC certification is a standardized process that includes a point-in-time audit conducted by DIACC Accredited Auditor KUMA and an independent committee review for quality assurance. As a result, DIACC has issued a three-year cycle Trustmark, subject to annual surveillance audits, and added Chicago Title’s VerifID to its <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/trusted-list/">Trusted List</a> of certified providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Chicago Title’s VerifID achieved a significant industry milestone and competitive advantage by becoming the first Canadian vendor to earn certification against the PCTF identity proofing requirements,” said Joni Brennan, DIACC President.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PCTF is a comprehensive risk management and assurance framework for validating the design of private-sector digital trust services. Its criteria address aspects of digital trust and verification, including privacy, security, and interoperability, mitigating risks associated with fraud and breaches. This framework supports robust digital verification and enhances user confidence by providing a reliable means to authenticate digital verification across services, fostering a safer and more integrated digital environment. The PCTF helps people and organizations across the public and private sectors to recognize verified trusted services.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Dear Edge Community,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well as we continue to adapt to the industry changes brought about by VMware’s acquisition by Broadcom. In our ongoing commitment to transparency and support, I want to share some important updates and reaffirm our dedication to assisting you through these transitions.</p>
<p>Pricing Changes Post-Acquisition:<br>
It has become apparent in our recent assessments and communications with Broadcom that the pricing structure for VMware’s services may undergo changes. At this time, it does not appear that Broadcom intends to maintain or reduce the prices from their current or previous year’s levels, even when considering potential discounts. This development is significant, and we want to ensure it factors into your planning and decision-making processes.</p>

In light of these potential changes, we believe it is prudent to consider alternative solutions that may better meet your financial and operational needs. We have secured a robust selection of substitute products and services under Edge procurement vehicles. Most of the market available substitutes are available through the EdgeMarket portal, and I am pleased to introduce several key points of contact who can assist you with these options:</p>

 ChatDKG.ai: Driving synergies across the AI solution landscape to tackle hallucinations, bias, and model&nbsp;collapse <p>Abusing social networks for political manipulations may look minuscule compared to a lack of trust in solutions to which we are “outsourcing” our cognition — AI systems. As we would trust them to process large amounts of knowledge and provide us inputs for our actions, or even perform certain actions autonomously, they have the highest possible requirements for transparency and verifiability.</p><p>There should be no compromise in designing AI solutions when it comes to data ownership, information provenance, verifiability of information, or bias that would include any censorship-by-design approach. The risk of this revolution not unfolding in an inclusive way is a societal threat of establishing a monopoly on&nbsp;AI.</p><p>We therefore introduced an effective way of establishing a new paradigm, using a Decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG) framework. dRAG advances the RAG model by organizing external sources in a Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) while introducing incentives to grow a global, crowdsourced network of knowledge made available for AI models to use. See an example of a ChatGPT4 without and with dRAG&nbsp;use:</p><p>The dRAG framework enables a hybrid, decentralized AI system that brings together neural (e.g. LLMs) and symbolic AI (e.g. Knowledge Graph) methodologies. Contrary to using a solely probabilistic neural AI approach, the symbolic AI approach enhances it with the strength of Knowledge Graphs, introducing a more deterministic component.</p>Figure 1: The interplay between neural (LLMs) and symbolic (KGs) AI methodologies. Source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08302.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08302.pdf</a> [4]<p>To harness a harmonious development between Web3 fundamentals and rapidly deployed AI systems, our approach is to integrate the core Web3 technologies such as the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and AI systems (OpenAI, Gemini, Microsoft Co-pilot, xAI’s Grok, and&nbsp;others).</p><p>We believe that we can realize the potential of trusted AI by creating a Verifiable Internet for AI that is founded on principles of neutrality, inclusiveness, and usability, while giving users freedom of choice with a multi-modal and a multi-model AI framework.</p> ChatDKG.ai: neuro-symbolic AI driving synergies across the solution landscape <p>Below, you can find a comparison table of AI types and frameworks with very diverse advantages and disadvantages. The globally most adopted and centralized AI solutions like Google Gemini, OpenAI, xAI, Perplexity deliver an immense value for a spectrum of use cases. Leveraging OriginTrail’s dRAG — brand name ChatDKG.ai, they can improve their shortfalls by harnessing the synergy of neuro-symbolic AI, data ownership, and better cost performance. Therefore, ChatDKG.ai is not competing against any established AI solutions, but rather empowers users to enhance them with its dRAG, driving knowledge verifiability, cost effectiveness, users’ sovereignty in owning their data and freedom of AI model&nbsp;choice.</p><p>The open source and permissionless nature of the OriginTrail DKG, allows for inclusiveness and neutrality, giving users a tremendous level of freedom on all layers — to choose AI models enabled by the DKG data portability, choose knowledge sources discoverable in the DKG, as well as pick AI services, centralized or decentralized on different blockchains.</p><p>The same principles apply to AI agents, search engines, and a growing variety of AI services integrating into every tool in existence — leveraging dRAG they will enable user freedom of choice, AI autonomy and trust, all while leveraging network effects through connectivity.</p><p>As AI becomes the new UI, make sure you are on the right side of history. Let’s build towards a Truly Open AI, together!</p><p>Apply for the <a href="https://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG.ai</a> inception program&nbsp;today!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/chatdkg-ai-driving-synergies-across-the-ai-solution-landscape-to-tackle-hallucinations-bias-and-95afe67aece3">ChatDKG.ai: Driving synergies across the AI solution landscape to tackle hallucinations, bias, and…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Markus Sabadello</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to write a few words about the&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>, which is a group where I have been contributing as co-chair for many years.</p> The fundamental role of the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>DIF was established in 2017, and has grown a lot in terms of members, working groups, and work items. The I&amp;D Working Group is one of the working groups that has existed since the beginning DIF, unlike many others which were added later. The reason for that, I would argue, is the fact that the concepts of “identifiers” and “discovery” are fundamental to pretty much any digital identity system.</p><p>In digital identity, we always need identifiers — digital addresses that we can use to refer to individuals, organizations, and things. Without identifiers for participants of a network, and without the ability to discover metadata about such identifiers, we cannot express connections or relationships, we cannot share data or exchange messages, and without that, we cannot establish higher level concepts such as reputation and trust. Another factor for establishing this working group was the (back then) new technology that became Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and would later be standardized at the W3C. So in the early days of DIF, it was logical to dedicate one of the initial working groups to the topic of identifiers.</p> The scope of the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>The scope of this working group is defined in its&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_ID_WG_charter_v1.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Charter</a>. It includes pretty much any topic related to the specification and implementation of decentralized identifiers (including, but not limited to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">W3C DIDs</a>). For example, topics include the creation and resolution of DIDs, discovery data formats and protocols, relationships between different identifer systems (e.g. DIDs and domain names), the establishment of control authority over an identifier, security and trust in identifier infrastructure, and the work on concrete&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#methods">DID methods</a>.</p><p>Explicitly out-of-scope are complex higher-level topics and protocols that use identifiers but are not primarily about the identifier infrastructure themselves, for example authentication or credential exchange protocols. For those topics, there are other exciting DIF&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#wgs">working groups</a>!</p> Noteworthy work items of the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>The working group maintains a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#work-items">list of work items</a>&nbsp;it has worked on in the past or is currently working on. In general, work items may be specifications or code or anything else that falls withing the working group’s scope. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of our work items:</p>  The&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Universal Resolver</a>&nbsp;is one of the best-known work items that has existed since the beginnings of DIF. It provides resolution capabilities for many DID methods developed by the decentralized identity community.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">.well-known DID Configuration</a>&nbsp;specification provides a way of linking a DID to a web origin.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/did-registration/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DID Registration</a>&nbsp;specification defines functions for creating, updating, and deactivating DIDs in an interoperable way.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/linked-vp/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Linked Verifiable Presentation</a>&nbsp;specification defines how to discover Verifiable Presentations using simple DID Resolution, without requiring more complex protocols such OpenID or DIDComm.  Work items also include various open-source tools and libraries, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did-resolver</a>&nbsp;(JavaScript),&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-jwt?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did-jwt</a>&nbsp;(JavaScript),&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-common-java?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did-common-java</a>&nbsp;(Java),&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-key.rs?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did-key.rs</a>&nbsp;(Rust).  Concrete DID methods&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/index.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did:peer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did:ion</a>&nbsp;have also been developed in this working group.   Interesting topics in the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>Besides “formal” work items such as the ones listed above, our working group also frequently discusses various topics related to decentralized identifiers, or receives guest presentations. In the past, such topics have for example included:</p>  Presentations about new DID methods, e.g. did:dht, did:oyd, did:self, did:webs, did:key, did:bid, did:plc, did:algo, did:polygonid, did:cheqd, and others.  Management of DIDs over time, rotating keys, referencing historical versions of DIDs.  Trust in DIDs and the DID Resolution process, DID document validation, and the relationship between DIDs and existing trusted infrastructures such as domain names or X.509 certificates.  Proposals for new functionalities related to DIDs, such as Linked Resources, service profiles, DID method enumeration, and much more.  <p>We have recently also seen demonstrations of browser plugins, and even a ChatGPT plugin that can resolve DIDs! And we are always happy to receive suggestions for new topics.</p> How to participate in the DIF I&amp;D WG <p>Easy!&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/join/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Join DIF</a>&nbsp;and participate in our working group. We have a Slack channel and bi-weekly meetings where we can discuss any topic related to decentralized identifiers and discovery!</p><p>Our working group page is&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/tree/main?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a>, and our agenda including recordings and notes is&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/blob/main/agenda.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a>.</p><p>We welcome you!</p><p>The activities of the author in the DIF I&amp;D WG are carried out with the support of&nbsp;<a href="https://blockstand.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">BlockStand</a>&nbsp;funds.

<p>The convergence of Internet, Crypto, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) appears as the antidote to many of the current shortcomings of AI — hallucinations, bias, data ownership challenges, even model collapse. It also holds the key to unlocking AI’s full societal potential by enabling a truly open AI. In a world of AI solutions relying on performance battles of pre-trained AI models, <a href="https://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG</a> stands for freedom of choice. A truly open AI approach allows anyone to define the trusted knowledge as the foundation for their AI solutions. It further extends the freedom of choice from trusted knowledge to multimodal support of a plethora of different AI models. For creators ready to take the plunge into the truly open AI future, an inception program is available to onboard them to&nbsp;ChatDKG.</p> A new paradigm for AI — Your knowledge network is your net&nbsp;worth <p>The currently prevalent approach in creating AI solutions is a siloed one — either in the shackles of a single AI model or a walled garden of external sources provided by a single organization. ChatDKG is breaking down those walls with an inclusive and open approach to creating AI solutions. Leveraging the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), it creates a neutral, inclusive knowledge foundation. As anyone publishes their knowledge to the DKG, their addition gets equipped with a timestamp, their identity, ascribed ownership, and verifiability proofs ensuring their knowledge is kept intact. Through a framework of decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG), such knowledge is made available to any AI model as input to produce outputs that both have information provenance and respect data ownership. As trusted knowledge inputs become mission-critical for AI solutions, it ignites a knowledge economy where your knowledge network is your net&nbsp;worth.</p> Getting involved with Initial Paranet&nbsp;Offering <p>In addition to building trusted AI solutions with ChatDKG, participants in this new knowledge economy can get involved in growing the DKG in knowledge domains important to them. New types of autonomous knowledge networks can appear in any domain, narrow or wide, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Decentralized Science — building a truth layer from existing scientific knowledge to power autonomous AI research and decentralized scientific advancement.  Real World Assets (RWA) — creating tokenized digital twins from any asset that exists outside the digital spectrum, such as real estate, commodities, art, and&nbsp;more.  Industry 4.0 — revolutionizing production processes to achieve the highest safety and efficiency, faster innovation, and tailored customers’ interactions with trusted AI solutions.  <p>Launching an Initial Paranet Offering (IPO) allows anyone to open up their mission to others who would like to join creating a knowledge foundation in that domain. Through an IPO, a paranet operator also ensures incentive rewards for participants that will add useful knowledge — knowledge miners. By accessing <a href="https://neuroweb.ai/">NeuroWeb</a> network incentives for mining new knowledge, the paranet’s trusted knowledge grows in a crowdsourced way.</p> Future-proofing for continuous advancements of&nbsp;AI <p>The ChatDKG’s truly open AI does not only lower dependency on any single AI company, the freedom of choice of AI also ensures that any development in the field of AI models, prompt engineering, agent frameworks, or similar, is making your solution stronger. By putting the trusted knowledge foundation in the driving seat, the tech giants working on advancing AI systems are working in your favor as you are always able to use your knowledge network with the latest AI technologies.</p> Inception program open for application <p>Those looking to build the next big thing with ChatDKG’s trusted AI solution or launch an Initial Paranet Offering can submit their application for the ChatDKG inception program to receive additional support from the OriginTrail team.

<p>Updated May 21, 2024:&nbsp;Since our original post, Sandbox Group has taken steps to make clear that CoolMathGames.com is not intended for children under the age of 13, and that children under 13 should instead use CoolMath4Kids.com. Note however, that the advertising behavior in CoolMathGames.com (particularly including the use of location information) is risky for users of any age. See the update at the end of the post for more details.&nbsp;</p>
 1&nbsp; Executive Summary 
<p>Last year, Internet Safety Labs (ISL) observed that CoolMathGames.com website (from CoolMath.com, LLC [referred to as “Cool Math”], owned by <a href="https://sbxgroup.com/">Sandbox Group</a>) contained location-based behavioral advertisements. Using the Federal Trade Commission’s guidelines on a “child-directed” website, ISL believes CoolMathGames.com may fall under the protections afforded by the US <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/2012-31341.pdf">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA).</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; ISL had seen Cool Math before, as it came up in our 2022 K-12 EdTech benchmark where twenty-five (3.8%) schools in the sample recommended or required Cool Math Games to students. Twenty-one (84%) of those 25 schools were elementary or middle schools (i.e. schools with children under the age of 13; see Table 8.1 for more details).&nbsp;&nbsp; Of note, however, there is another Cool Math site called CoolMath4Kids.com which has different ad behavior that may be compliant with COPPA. However, none of the schools in our 2022 benchmark recommended CoolMath4Kids.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Cool Math sites utilize a COPPA Safe Harbor Certified [by <a href="https://www.kidsafeseal.com/certifiedproducts/playwiremedia_kidsclub_ads.html">KidSafe</a>] advertising platform from Playwire, who is also listed as the “ManagerDomain” for both Cool Math websites’ ads.txt files. The ManagerDomain role is responsible for managing ads on the domain.&nbsp;</p>
 
 ISL wonders what Playwire’s responsibility is in ensuring that the COPPA Certified configuration is applied to child-directed sites for which it is the manager domain in the ads.txt file. 
 ISL further questions whether an ad platform really can/should be COPPA Safe Harbor certified, since they can be easily configured as either COPPA compliant or non-compliant, as seems to be the case with the Cool Math websites.&nbsp; 
 
<p>ISL requested that CoolMath.com, LLC / Sandbox Group modify the CoolMathGames.com site, removing the behavioral advertising [i.e. suggested that they use the seemingly COPPA compliant version of the ads.txt file]. Despite our repeated attempts, Sandbox Group did not modify the site and the behavioral ads remain on the site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 2&nbsp; Description of Problem(s) 
<p>Site:&nbsp; coolmathgames.com&nbsp;</p>
<p>Number of Monthly Users:&nbsp; 13.03M monthly visitors.  74% from the USA, 6% each from the UK and Australia, 5% from Canada, and about 1% from New Zealand. (Source: Similarweb.com)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Description of Problem:&nbsp; While evaluating coolmathgames.com, ISL observed the presence of location based behavioral advertising and cross-site trackers uniquely identifying users (i.e. children).&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite being contacted several times by ISL, Sandbox Group, the parent company Cool Math Games, has not acted on ISL’s request to change the advertising behavior in CoolMathGames.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 3 &nbsp;Details 
<p>The CoolMathGames.com homepage has multiple ads on its website. As seen below in Figure 3.1, without scrolling the page the user sees three (3) advertisements. Thus, upon loading the CoolMathGames.com webpage, viewer information is sent into the Real Time Bidding (RTB) stream as a part of filling the ad spaces on the homepage. This information includes data such as a unique user identifier, as well as geolocation information. These advertisements are not generic/contextual. The advertisement indicated “1”, contains geolocation information which is blurred for researcher privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 3.1</p> 
<p> Figure 3.2 shows the geolocation information in clear text in the website’s traffic.&nbsp; Along with the geolocation information, internet service provider (ISP) information is also collected and transferred.&nbsp; Again, the geolocation information has been blurred for researcher privacy.</p>
 <p>Figure 3.2</p> 
 3.1&nbsp; Ads.txt Files 
<p>Per the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) standard, any website that serves advertisements should contain an “ads.txt” file. This file can usually be found at /ads.txt, and contains a list of the Authorized Digital Sellers for ads served on the website. (Note that there is also a version of Authorized Digital Sellers for mobile apps, called app-ads.txt) Figure 3.3 shows the ads.txt files for CoolMathGames.com, which indicates that the file is managed by Playwire.com.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 3.3</p> 
<p> In network traffic, researchers saw calls to a Playwire configuration json file. Figure 3.4&nbsp;shows this configuration file, with the pertinent information for CoolMathGames.com expanded. Note the presence of a “coppa” flag [set to “false”] as well as website categories including “kids” and “games_casual”. Playwire offers COPPA compliant advertising services, but we can see this does not appear to be applied to CoolMathGames.com, despite the primary category being, by their own designation “kids”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Figure 3.4</p> 
 4&nbsp; Concerns 
<p>These findings lead to three concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 First and foremost is the concern over the presence of behavioral ads—particularly location-based—in the CoolMathGames.com website, a service that is recommended to students in elementary and middle schools around the country. In the ISL 2022 EdTech benchmark, 21 elementary or middle schools (with students as young as pre-K) recommended CoolMathGames.com (see Table 8.1).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
 Second, how much responsibility does Playwire have in this scenario? It’s clear in their pre_content config file that the site is for “kids” but the COPPA flag is set to false. Moreover, Playwire has the role of ManagerDomain for the ads.txt file. What is their responsibility in this case?&nbsp; 
 Finally, ISL questions whether ad platforms like Playwire can realistically be COPPA Safe Harbor Certified—at least in the way that it is currently being performed. COPPA certification for ad platforms requires monitoring of the deployed configuration, and that does not appear to be happening right now. ISL was able to have a discussion with kidSAFE regarding these concerns, and the issue appears to be systemic in nature, i.e. with the nature of the Safe Harbor certification program requirements as prescribed by COPPA and the FTC.&nbsp; 
 
 5 &nbsp;ISL’s Responsible Disclosures 
<p>ISL undertook the following efforts to make CoolMath.com aware of the concerns stated in this report:</p>
 
 December 12, 2023: ISL sends first email sent to CoolMath.com.&nbsp; 
 December 19, 2023: ISL receives response from Sandbox Group, including a number of questions.&nbsp; 
 December 22, 2023: ISL sends response with detailed data/files from research and answers to questions. No response was received.&nbsp; 
 January 16, 2024: ISL sends an email seeking a response. (None received.)&nbsp; 
 February 22, 2024: ISL sends another email seeking a response. (None received.)&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>ISL also sent emails to Playwire (legal@playwire.com) on December 12, 2023 and twice on January 16, 2024, all times receiving an automated and unhelpful response.&nbsp;</p>
 6 &nbsp;Call to Action for CoolMath.com LLC, Sandbox Group, and Playwire 
<p>Once again, ISL requests that CoolMath.com LLC and Sandbox Group to remove behavioral advertising from CoolMathGames.com. In particular:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inform the ad networks and exchanges you partner with that this site is child-directed and should therefore receive COPPA protections, and &nbsp; 
 Immediately change the CoolMathGames ads.txt and app-ads.txt files for the website and the two mobile apps to the appropriate “Playwire COPPA Ads.txt” files.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>ISL also requests that Playwire take a more active role in providing the right ads.txt files for child-directed sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 7 &nbsp;Safety Suggestions 
<p>ISL suggests that schools refer students to CoolMath4kids.com instead of CoolMathGames.com until behavioral advertising is removed from the latter site.</p>
 8 &nbsp;References 
<p>The following table 8.1 lists the schools from the ISL 2022 K-12 EdTech Safety Benchmark found to be recommending or requiring the use of CoolMathGames to students.&nbsp;</p>

 About ISL Responsible Disclosures&nbsp; 
<p>As a non-profit, independent product safety watchdog organization, Internet Safety Labs (ISL) is dedicated to catalyzing software changes to keep people safer while using technology. To this end, we sometimes discover serious safety risks as we conduct our ongoing research; we aren’t looking for these, but we happen upon them (such was the case with <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/blog/research/dangling-domain-from-sdk-installed-in-150-apple-apps-putting-kids-families-and-crypto-traders-at-risk/">the dangling domain that Apple ultimately purchased</a>, keeping potentially millions of people safe).&nbsp; When we find these risks, our practice is to contact the developer and request that they make a specific change. We call this a responsible disclosure of a safety risk in the software, similar to the responsible disclosure of a security vulnerability. The best outcome is that the developer makes the change, and we then commend their commitment to keeping their users safe.&nbsp;&nbsp; No organization is exempt from our safety scrutiny—whether it’s a commercial entity, a non-profit organization, or government organization. Our responsible disclosures of safety risks are offered in a constructive and supportive spirit, working from an assumption that the organization may not be aware of the risk.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
 May 21, 2024 Update&nbsp; 
<p>Since our original post, ISL has observed the following changes to CoolMathGames.com and related materials:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The CoolMathGames.com website has been modified to include a “Games for Kids” notification and link to CoolMath4Kids.com in the upper right corner:<br>
<p></p>
<p></p> <p>Figure A.1</p>  
 The CoolMathGames.com privacy policy was updated on May 11, 2024 and now includes the highlighted statement:<br>
<p></p>
 “CoolmathGames.com is designed for users aged 13 and older. By accessing our Website, you attest that you are at least 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, please visit our kids gaming website at <a href="https://www.coolmath4kids.com/">Coolmath4kids.com</a>.” 
 <p>Figure A.2</p> 
 &nbsp; 
 
 The CoolMathGames.com terms of service has been similarly updated:<br>
<p></p>
 “CoolmathGames.com is designed for users aged 13 and older. By accessing our Website, you attest that you are at least 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, please visit our kids gaming website at <a href="http://Coolmath4Kids.com">Coolmath4Kids.com</a>.” 
 <p>Figure A.3</p> 
 &nbsp; 
 
 The “Kids” tag was removed from the Playwire config file, leaving only “games_casual“. The COPPA flag remains set to “false”:<br>
<p></p>
<p></p> <p>Figure A.4</p>  
 
<p>ISL appreciates CoolMath.com, LLC / Sandbox Group‘s recent efforts in clarifying that CoolMathGames.com isn’t intended for children and students under the age of 13. This type of labeling is important and ISL would like to see it in place as a universal practice.</p>
<p>While ISL is glad that CoolMath.com, LLC / Sandbox Group made these changes, we are disappointed that the changes didn’t come when we made the initial, private disclosure, and instead only happened after our 90-day window had expired and we published the first version of this blog post. &nbsp;</p>

 “FIDO Drives Strong&nbsp;&nbsp;Authentication Results&nbsp;&nbsp;for the State of Michigan’s&nbsp;&nbsp;MiLogin” 



<p>The State of Michigan’s Department of Technology, Management &amp;&nbsp; Budget (DTMB) is a principal department of the state’s government&nbsp; responsible for providing a wide range of support functions to other state&nbsp; agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The department’s broad spectrum of responsibilities includes technology&nbsp; services, labor market information, facilities management, financial&nbsp; services, procurement, retirement services, real estate management, the&nbsp; Michigan public safety communication system, fleet and records&nbsp; management, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DTMB also plays a crucial role in cybersecurity for the state,&nbsp; providing resources and tools to protect against cyber threats and&nbsp; manage the State’s IT infrastructure. One of the DTMB’s efforts is the&nbsp; MiLogin digital identity solution, which enables over 10 million users to&nbsp; access state government services securely and conveniently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DTMB was looking to secure MiLogin, Michigan’s application that allows&nbsp; users to access multiple state applications and services with a single user&nbsp; ID, with strong authentication that improves user experience and decided&nbsp; to go with passkeys, based on FIDO authentication.&nbsp;</p>



 Passkeys are a password replacement that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices. Unlike passwords, passkeys are resistant to phishing, are always strong, and are designed so that there are no shared secrets. 



 Key Objectives&nbsp; 



<p>The State of Michigan aimed to address several key objectives with the integration of passkeys:</p>



<p>Enhance the digital user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal was to streamline the digital user experience, particularly in providing users with seamless access to critical state&nbsp; government services. DTMB aimed to simplify the login process, making it more user-friendly and efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reduce help desk support dependency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing the strain on help desk resources due to login access issues, DTMB sought to reduce users’ need to access help desk support. By implementing changes to enhance the login process, the goal was to empower users to navigate.</p>



<p>Fortify security resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no shortage of risk and vulnerabilities associated with traditional username and password authentication. A key&nbsp; objective was to fortify the system against security threats and phishing incidents, by adopting advanced FIDO strong&nbsp; authentication to mitigate the risks commonly exploited by bad actors seeking unauthorized access.</p>



 The Importance of Open Standards and Interoperability&nbsp; 



<p>Before deciding to implement passkeys, the DTMB explored a proprietary passwordless login solution offered by a cloud based identity-as-a-solution (IDaaS) provider. However, the solution lacked the interoperability required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DTMB determined early on in its process that open standard and interoperability were critical and required&nbsp; components of its strong authentication strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A standards-based approach provides interoperability across popular device types and web browsers, maintains vendor&nbsp; neutrality, allows for cost savings through community adoption, and a pathway to adopt future innovations in the FIDO&nbsp; ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 The Solution: FIDO Drives Results&nbsp; 



<p>Passkeys checked all the boxes for the DTMB, utilizing open standards and an interoperable approach for authentication.</p>



<p>The DTMB found that passkeys provide the following advantages:</p>



 
 Passkeys are based on open standards, ensuring interoperability without&nbsp;&nbsp;necessitating additional software for users to download.&nbsp; 



 Multiple vendor support for FIDO standards and the tech’s rapid&nbsp;&nbsp;adoption promotes the long-term continuity of FIDO authentication as a&nbsp;&nbsp;service.&nbsp; 



 FIDO standards accommodate various authenticator types (such as&nbsp;&nbsp;biometric sensors, hardware keys, etc.) across desktop and mobile&nbsp;&nbsp;devices, catering to the DTMB’s user base’s diverse authentication&nbsp;&nbsp;requirements.&nbsp; 



 Prioritizing user and ecosystem partner security, passkeys provide strong&nbsp;&nbsp;phishing resistance.&nbsp; 
 



 MiLogin’s Path to Passkeys&nbsp; 



<p>The DTMB’s passkey rollout involved a meticulous process to ensure a seamless, secure transition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Extensive research on passwordless authentication solutions was conducted, engaging the DTMB’s cybersecurity review&nbsp; board in the evaluation process. Upon selecting passkeys for further exploration, the DTMB delved into the analysis of&nbsp; various FIDO options and sought feedback from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working together with Deloitte, which is the DTMB’s trusted systems integrator for the State’s enterprise digital identity&nbsp; solution, a comprehensive strategy was planned for the design, development, and implementation phases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the design phase, insights from the FIDO Alliance’s usability study results were working into screen and workflow&nbsp; designs. Findings from the DTMB’s MiLogin human-centered design usability study were also used to create a user&nbsp; experience tailored to address the diverse needs of various personas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The development phase focused on integrating MiLogin with FIDO authentication methods, accompanied by the creation&nbsp; of animated user help guides and tutorial videos to drive greater user adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Post-implementation, the DTMB monitored production metrics and gathered feedback from end-users, ensuring the&nbsp; success of the implementation and identifying areas for functionality enhancements in future releases.</p>



 MiLogin’s Impressive Passwordless Results&nbsp; 



<p>Within the first six months of release, MiLogin achieved impressive results for the State of Michigan: </p>



 
 100,000+ customer devices enrolled in passkeys&nbsp; 



 ~18,000 new passkey enrollments per month&nbsp; 



 Increased FIDO-based logins with zero reported issues&nbsp; 



 Decreased help desk initiated password resets with 1,300 fewer calls&nbsp; related to password resets in a single month.&nbsp; 
 



 



<blockquote>
<p>“I am proud that our MiLogin team has brought passwordless authentication to our public&nbsp; digital identities. Passwordless brings additional protections to our public digital identities, and&nbsp; helps protect our systems from account takeover attempts such as brute force and password&nbsp; spray attacks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
– Jayson Cavendish, Chief Security Officer, State of Michigan, DTMB&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>The Road Ahead for Passwordless in the State of Michigan&nbsp;</p>



<p>The State of Michigan anticipates a significant increase in passkey adoption, targeting over 10 million public users.&nbsp; They also plan to implement passwordless authentication for their workforce, integrating with their state directory&nbsp; services solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO authentication is a part of the State of Michigan’s Zero Trust Identity strategy to establish a secure identity in citizen&nbsp; interactions with state services. It will also improve the user experience, generate cost savings for the state, and increase adoption of the State’s digital identity solution by diverse state agency partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what advice does the DTMB have for other other organizations? The State of Michigan recommends understanding&nbsp; diverse user bases and use cases, prioritizing user experience, and incorporating usability studies, clear end-user messaging,&nbsp; and a well-designed communication plan for a successful FIDO authentication implementation.</p>

<p>As mentioned in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/web3-points-library/">post introducing our points library</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Solutions SDK</a> also contains examples (found within the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/demo?ref=blog.ceramic.network">demo directory</a>) designed to help developers understand how to use the libraries within a larger application context. The remainder of this article will walk through a tutorial of the "full-stack app" example. If you prefer to follow a video tutorial, visit our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75IZp2oYncM&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">YouTube video</a> of this tutorial. </p> The Use Case: Rewarding Points for Joining a Community <p>This example offers a simple demonstration of how one could use the points library to reward community members for their engagement such as joining key platforms. To keep things simple, this tutorial will walk through the act of joining a Discord server as the trigger.</p> Getting Started <p>While an identical version of this example lives directly in the SDK repository, we've pulled it into a separate codebase for this walk-through. To get started, clone the code, install your dependencies, and duplicate the example environment file:</p> <code>// if you don't have pnpm installed
npm install -g pnpm@9

// otherwise: 
git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example &amp;&amp; cd points-example
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env</code> <p>Next, we'll need to configure a few environment variables:</p><p>NEXTAUTH_SECRET</p><p>We will be using&nbsp;<a href="https://next-auth.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">NextAuth</a>&nbsp;as our open-source authentication solution (in order to verify Discord server membership). You can create a secret easily by running the following in your terminal:</p> <code>openssl rand -base64 32</code> <p>DISCORD_CLIENT_ID and DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET</p><p>This app will use Discord as the authentication provider (wrapped by NextAuth). To obtain these credentials, navigate to the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Discord Developer Portal</a>&nbsp;and set up a new application. On the left-hand panel, click on "OAuth2" and bring over your Client ID and Client Secret from the "Client Information" box.</p><p>Finally, since you'll be running the application locally, set the following URI value within the "Redirects" box (found under "Client Information"):&nbsp;<code>http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord</code>.</p><p>CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY</p><p>This is the private key your application will use to instantiate a static key:did in order to write points using the library. This DID will act as the identifier for the issuer of points for your application (you).</p><p>If you have the&nbsp;<a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.7.x/api/modules/cli?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB CLI</a>&nbsp;installed globally, you can run the following command in your terminal to create one:</p> <code>composedb did:generate-private-key</code> <p>AGGREGATION_ID</p><p>A default value for this environment variable has been provided for you within the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/.env.example?ref=blog.ceramic.network">.env.example</a>&nbsp;file. Please leave this as-is. You can reference the "extending the default library interfaces" below to learn more about this variable.</p><p>PROJECT_ID</p><p>We will be using&nbsp;<a href="https://walletconnect.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect's</a>&nbsp;Web3Modal for Web3 authentication. In your&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/pages/_app.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">_app.tsx</a>&nbsp;file, you will need to enter an active value for the&nbsp;<code>PROJECT_ID</code>&nbsp;constant defined on line 10.</p><p>You can set up a developer account for free by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">cloud.walletconnect.com</a>. Once authenticated, create a new app and copy over the "Project ID" value (found in the dashboard view for that corresponding app).</p> Extending the Default Library Interfaces <p>For our use case let's assume the following about our point reward structure:</p>  Participants can earn points related to engaging on certain platforms (such as Discord)  There are various ways participants can earn points across each platform (for example, following, posting, liking, and so on)  <p>As such, our application logic has the following requirements:</p>  Our application needs to easily access platform-specific subtotals for each participant  Our application also needs to easily access "global" totals for each participant as a sum of all eligible behavior  <p>The points library's default implementation of the <code>PointsAggregationInterface</code> serves only the second requirement above:</p> <code>type SimplePointsAggregation implements PointsAggregationInterface
  @createModel(
    description: "Simple points aggregation to an account at a specific date"
    accountRelation: SET
    accountRelationFields: ["recipient"]
  ) {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
  date: DateTime!
}</code> <p>This default model defines a <code>SET</code> accountRelation using the "recipient" subfield, which ensures that there can be only 1 model instance document any given account can create that points to a specific recipient. This will be useful for logging the global total for each participant, but would not be ideal for our first requirement.</p><p>Conversely, the <code>SimplePointsAllocation</code> model, the default type implementation of the <code>PointsAllocationInterface</code> (found in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/blob/main/composites/points/schemas/1-init.graphql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">schemas</a>), defines a <code>LIST</code> accountRelation, and is designed to track the history of allocation events rather than the current sum.</p><p>We've therefore chosen this example to show how easily developers can extend the defaults to meet more nuanced use cases. For this example app, we've defined a new type to fit our needs:</p> <code>type ContextPointAggregation implements PointsAggregationInterface
  @createModel(
    description: "A simple context-based point aggregation model"
    accountRelation: SET
    accountRelationFields: ["recipient", "context"]
  ) {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
  date: DateTime!
  context: String! @string(maxLength: 100)
}</code> <p>The extension you'll notice is that our SET relation now sits on two fields - "recipient" and "context". If, for example, we wanted to sum up all Discord-eligible behavior under a "discord" context value, this new accountRelation scheme ensures that our application (as the issuer) can create only 1 model instance per recipient+context combination.</p><p>For this tutorial, we've already pre-deployed this special type to the default node endpoint (if you want to create your own custom extensions, you will need to set up a node first). The model's stream ID is the corresponding value for the <code>AGGREGATION_ID</code> key provided for you in your .env file.</p> Using the Points Library in the Application <p>You can find the points library being used in our app's server logic as API routes and a context utility. If you look at our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/utils/context.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">context.ts</a> file, you can see how we've imported our <code>CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY</code> and <code>AGGREGATION_ID</code> environment variables to instantiate our reader and writer classes:</p> <code>import { PointsWriter, PointsReader } from '@ceramic-solutions/points'
import { getAuthenticatedDID } from '@ceramic-solutions/key-did'
import { fromString } from 'uint8arrays'

const CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY: string = process.env.CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY ?? ''
const aggregationModelID: string | undefined = process.env.AGGREGATION_ID ?? undefined

const seed = fromString(CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY, 'base16') as Uint8Array

// create a context writer
const contextWriter = await PointsWriter.fromSeed({
  aggregationModelID,
  seed,
})

// create a total writer
const writer = await PointsWriter.fromSeed({
  seed,
})

// generate issuer for reader context
const issuer = await getAuthenticatedDID(seed)

//create a context reader
const contextReader = PointsReader.create({
  issuer: issuer.id,
  aggregationModelID,
})

//create a total reader
const reader = PointsReader.create({
  issuer: issuer.id,
})

export { contextWriter, writer, contextReader, reader }</code> <p>We're purposely creating 2 instances of each, one of which is blank and therefore uses the default value  of <code>aggregationModelID</code> (the <code>SimplePointsAggregation</code> discussed above), while the other uses our imported extension.</p><p>In our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/tree/main/src/pages/api?ref=blog.ceramic.network">API routes</a> you'll find simple endpoints for reading and creating points. Notice how we import our writer instances from our context utility in order to mutate or create two separate documents:</p> <code>import { type NextApiRequest, type NextApiResponse } from 'next'
import { contextWriter, writer } from '@/utils/context'
import type { ModelInstanceDocument } from '@composedb/types'
import { type PointsContent, type AggregationContent } from '@/utils/types'

interface Request extends NextApiRequest {
  body: {
    recipient: string
    amount: number
    context: string
  }
}

interface Response extends NextApiResponse {
  status(code: number): Response
  send(data: { contextTotal: number; total: number } | { error: string }): void
}

export default async function handler(req: Request, res: Response) {
  try {
    const { recipient, amount, context } = req.body

    // get context aggregation doc if exists
    const aggregationDoc: ModelInstanceDocument&lt;AggregationContent&gt; | null =
      await contextWriter.loadAggregationDocumentFor([recipient, context])

    // if aggregation doc does not exist for that context, set points aggregation for both context and global total
    if (aggregationDoc === null) {
      // update context-specific aggregation
      const updatedContextAgg: ModelInstanceDocument&lt;AggregationContent&gt; =
        await contextWriter.setPointsAggregationFor([recipient, context], amount, {
          recipient,
          points: amount,
          date: new Date().toISOString(),
          context,
        } as Partial&lt;PointsContent&gt;)

      // update total aggregation
      const updatedTotalAgg: ModelInstanceDocument&lt;AggregationContent&gt; =
        await writer.updatePointsAggregationFor([recipient], (content) =&gt; {
          return {
            points: content ? content.points + amount : amount,
            date: new Date().toISOString(),
            recipient,
          }
        })

      res.status(200).send({
        contextTotal: updatedContextAgg.content ? updatedContextAgg.content.points : 0,
        total: updatedTotalAgg.content ? updatedTotalAgg.content.points : 0,
      })
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    res.status(500).send({ error: 'Internal Server Error' })
  }
}
</code> <p>As you might've noticed, the current logic only issues the points if the recipient has not yet been rewarded for the input context, which makes sense given that the app in its current form only confirms Discord server membership.</p><p>You'll notice that our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/pages/api/readPoints.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">readPoints.ts</a> route is even simpler, making use of the <code>getAggregationPointsFor</code> method our reader instances offer. </p> Requesting to View Users' Servers with NextAuth <p>If you navigate to our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/server/auth.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">auth.ts</a> route you'll notice the inclusion of an authorization URI that specifies the scope of read access we need to view a user's server (or guild) membership:</p> <code>providers: [
    DiscordProvider({
      clientId: env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: env.DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET,
      authorization:
        "https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?scope=identify+email+guilds",
    }),
  ],</code> <p>We use this access within the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">frontend component</a> of our single-page app to request guild membership and determine if one of them is named "Ceramic" (alongside checking the user's points and awarding them if eligible):</p> <code>const checkPoints = async (context: string, recipient: string) =&gt; {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("/api/readPoints", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ recipient, context }),
    });
    const data = await response.json() as { contextTotal: number; total: number };
    setTotals(data);
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

const awardPoints = async (
  context: string,
  recipient: string,
  amount: number,
) =&gt; {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("/api/createPoints", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ recipient, context, amount }),
    });
    const data = await response.json() as { contextTotal: number; total: number };
    console.log(data);
    setTotals(data);
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};


const getGuilds = async (
    accessToken: string,
  ): Promise&lt;Guilds[] | undefined&gt; =&gt; {
  const guilds = await fetch("/api/servers", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ token: accessToken }),
  })
    .then(function (response) {
      return response.json();
    })
    .then(function (data) {
      return data as Guilds[] | undefined;
    });
  console.log(guilds);
  return guilds;
};

...

const guilds = await getGuilds(access);

// check if user is in the Ceramic server
const ceramic = guilds?.find((guild) =&gt; guild.name === "Ceramic");

const points = await checkPoints("discord",`did:pkh:eip155:1:${address.toLowerCase()}`);
                 
if (ceramic &amp;&amp; (points?.contextTotal ?? 0) === 0) {
  setClaim(true);
}


// ... if claim

await awardPoints("discord",`did:pkh:eip155:1:${address.toLowerCase()}`,
20);</code>  Running the Application <p>Once you've correctly generated and entered your environment variables, you can run the application in developer mode:</p> <code>pnpm dev</code> <p>Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser and you should see the following:</p><p>Go ahead and self-authenticate by clicking "Connect Wallet." Once connected, you should see the following on your screen:</p><p>Given the instructions, you'll want to <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ceramic?ref=blog.ceramic.network">join the Ceramic Discord server</a> (if you haven't already).</p><p>After both joining the Ceramic Discord server and self-authenticating with Discord, you should now be able to check the status of your eligibility:</p><p>Go ahead and click "Check Status" to view your current server membership and eligibility to claim points (this action queries our Discord NextAuth provider mentioned above, and automatically triggers a call to the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/pages/api/readPoints.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">readPoints.ts</a> route):</p><p>If Ceramic now appears as one of the servers you're a member of, you'll be able to select "Claim Points" in order to engage your <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/pages/api/createPoints.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">createPoints.ts</a> route.</p><p>Finally, once the mutation is successful, you should now see the points you've just earned appear in the UI.</p> Integrate Allocations and Gitcoin Passport <p>As you might've noticed, this simple demo only uses the aggregation docs - after all, in this example, we're only awarding points for Discord engagement.</p><p>If you're interested in experimenting with an example that also uses the allocation docs, feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/tree/with-gitcoin?ref=blog.ceramic.network">with-gitcoin repository branch</a> (which uses Gitcoin Passport scoring as an additional means to earn points).</p> What's Next? <p>While this demo showcases a straightforward example of how to put the point library into action, we encourage our community to fork this repository and build out features you'd like to see! The library is flexible and extendable by design.</p><p>Whatever your idea is, we'd love to hear about it as you build. Feel free to contact me directly at mzk@3box.io, or start a conversation on the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Forum</a>.

 Introducing AutoGreenCharge by Energy Web: a decentralized application for decarbonizing electric vehicle&nbsp;charging  Mobile app helps automotive companies, charging companies, and EV drivers decarbonize electric&nbsp;mobility <p>Energy Web, a global nonprofit organization that builds open source software to accelerate the energy transition, has announced <a href="http://www.autogreencharge.com">AutoGreenCharge</a> by Energy Web, a new product that makes it simple for electric vehicle drivers, manufacturers, and other electric mobility companies to decarbonize electric vehicle charging. The application is designed to serve both electric vehicle drivers and e-mobility companies while bringing new levels of transparency and verifiability to the electric vehicle charging&nbsp;space.</p><p>In 2023, electric vehicles used approximately 110 terawatt hours of electricity — comparable to the annual electricity consumption of the Netherlands, and this figure is expected to increase tenfold by 2030. And although electric vehicles are far more efficient than gas-powered vehicles, electric vehicle charging in most markets around the world is not fully renewable: in the U.S. approximately 38% of charging is green while in Europe the figure is&nbsp;60%.</p><p><a href="http://www.autogreencharge.com">AutoGreenCharge</a> by Energy Web closes this gap by calculating the sustainability of charging sessions and matching the non-renewable portion with verified energy attribute certificates. These digital tokens represent renewable power generation and have been used by governments and corporations like Google and Microsoft since the 2010s to decarbonize business operations. AutoGreenCharge’s functionality extends to a mobile app, allowing drivers to clean up their charging, and can be integrated into existing apps used by EV manufacturers and charging companies. Over time, users will be able to choose certificates from a variety of power plants with different characteristics, such as solar power plants situated in particularly dirty grids that have a greater impact on decarbonization than renewable energy facilities in renewable-rich areas.</p><p>Currently, Energy Web is partnering with top EV manufacturers and additional partners to test, develop, and release AutoGreenCharge to the&nbsp;public.</p><p>Sign up to become one of the first beta-testers at: www.autogreencharge.com</p><blockquote>Sahas Katta, CEO at Smartcar, the leading connected car API platform and Greencharge partner, said “This partnership will empower EV drivers with the knowledge and confidence to maximize the sustainability of their EV charging experience. With Smartcar, Energy Web can seamlessly integrate across diverse vehicle brands, giving more EV drivers access to accurate insights into charging transparency and renewable energy&nbsp;options.</blockquote><blockquote>We could not be more excited to apply Energy Web technology to electric vehicle charging,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web Foundation. “This is a fast growing sector of electricity demand; pairing demand with high impact renewables from around the globe is a great way to bring more capital into renewable energy&nbsp;markets.</blockquote><p>About Energy Web Foundation:</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading corporates, energy companies, utilities, renewable energy developers, transportation sector majors and telecommunications leaders.

 OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph for trusted cross-organization real-time data integration in EU-funded DMaaST <p>Trace Labs, the core developers of OriginTrail, has joined the European Union’s initiative to foster a resilient and adaptive manufacturing ecosystem through the DMaaST project. Collaborating with partners from Slovenia, Spain, Germany, Portugal, Turkey, Serbia, Belgium, Lithuania, France, Denmark, and Switzerland, the initiative will leverage the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and Knowledge Assets (KA) to encapsulate all pertinent information regarding products, processes, facilities, and human expertise. This comprehensive approach will facilitate the precise mapping of data flows and knowledge interconnections, laying the groundwork for comprehensive information mapping within the manufacturing ecosystem using OriginTrail DKG. Consequently, this will ensure trustworthy cross-organizational real-time data integration.</p><p>Once more, attention has been drawn to challenges within the aeronautic and manufacturing industries following a January incident in which a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/08/boeing-shares-fall-door-plane-mid-flight-spirit-aerosystems-737-max-9">Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plug blew out</a> in the middle of an Alaska Airlines flight. If the company had established reliable cross-organizational communication, it could have prevented this incident. Such communication would enhance the value chain’s responsiveness to external and unforeseen events, as well as improve operability and production planning capacity.</p><p>Effective, transparent, and reliable data exchange are the most important points for fostering sustainability, resilience, and energy efficiency in the manufacturing industry. However, over the past years, various challenges have come to the forefront within this&nbsp;sector.</p>  Supply Chain Disruptions: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted existing vulnerabilities in global supply chains, leading to disruptions in the flow of materials and components. Issues such as raw material shortages, transportation bottlenecks, and labor shortages have persisted, impacting manufacturing operations worldwide.  Cybersecurity Risks: With the increasing digitization of manufacturing processes through technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0, cybersecurity threats have become a significant concern. Manufacturing facilities are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks that can disrupt operations, steal sensitive data, or compromise product quality and&nbsp;safety.  Data Silos: Manufacturing organizations often operate with fragmented data systems, leading to isolated data silos across departments or functions. This fragmentation inhibits seamless data interoperability and hampers comprehensive insights that could drive operational efficiency and innovation.  Lack of Standards: The absence of standardized data formats and protocols complicates data exchange and integration efforts within and across manufacturing enterprises. Without universally accepted standards, interoperability becomes a significant challenge, impeding the flow of data between different systems and stakeholders.  Data Privacy Concerns: With the proliferation of data collection and sharing practices in manufacturing, ensuring data privacy and protection is paramount. Manufacturers must navigate complex regulatory landscapes, safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access or misuse while balancing the need for data-driven decision-making.  Ownership and Control: Determining ownership rights and control over manufacturing data can be contentious, especially in collaborative environments or supply chain networks. Disputes may arise regarding data ownership, usage rights, and intellectual property, complicating data sharing agreements and hindering collaborative initiatives.  Legacy Systems Integration: Many manufacturing facilities still rely on legacy systems that were not designed with interoperability in mind. Integrating these outdated systems with modern data platforms and technologies poses significant challenges, requiring extensive customization, retrofitting, and investments in interoperability solutions.  <p>DMaaST aims to enhance manufacturing ecosystem resilience and adaptability by employing a Smart Manufacturing Platform comprising four layers. The data layer establishes a foundation for real-time data integration across organizations using ontologies and OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph. Following this, a two-level cognitive digital twin is deployed to model both manufacturing services production lines and value chain stages. It incorporates human expertise, data-driven algorithms, and physical modeling. An algorithm for multi-objective distributed decision support systems leverages this data to facilitate optimal production decisions. Outcomes will be communicated via user-friendly interfaces and timely scoreboards, assessing circularity, sustainability, and product traceability. Over the four-year period, DMaaST ensures scalability and innovation by providing insights for replicating and improving manufacturing processes, advancing technologies in aerospace and electronics sectors.</p><p>Trace Labs will lead the data working group to develop and validate technologies aimed at facilitating data understanding, interoperability, and secure cross-organization integration. With integration of OriginTrail DKG for the electronic and aeronautical sector, creating a new powerful knowledge base with artificial intelligence capabilities. The DKG will establish a decentralized database accessible to all participants in a manufacturing value chain, including manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, retailers, regulatory bodies, research institutes, and others. This will enhance the manufacturing ecosystem’s ability to autonomously withstand and adapt to external&nbsp;events.</p><p>OriginTrail DKG has been widely utilized to foster trust and transparency in enterprise knowledge exchange across various industries. Now, it is evolving to facilitate global knowledge connectivity, powering the <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf">Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG) framework</a> for more precise and inclusive AI. Given the challenges of verifying AI-generated results, OriginTrail DKG, with Knowledge Assets as its primary resource, represents a pivotal innovation in this context. It offers a robust framework for ensuring the ownership, discoverability, and verifiability of information utilized by AI systems for the manufacturing industry.</p><p>Project information available here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/how-to-participate/org-details/999999999/project/101138648/program/43108390/details">DMaaST&nbsp;Project</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-decentralized-knowledge-graph-for-trusted-cross-organization-real-time-data-integration-ef85c9943b18">OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph for trusted cross-organization real-time data integration…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>20% of the world’s top 100 websites now support the password alternative</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., 02 May, 2024 – World Password Day may soon need a rebrand, as the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> survey released today shows that half of people in the US and UK have begun ditching the password in favor of more convenient and secure passwordless alternatives.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/content-ebook-consumer-password-and-passkey-trends-wpd-2024/">independent survey</a> commissioned by the FIDO Alliance found that 53% of people have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts, with 22% enabling them on every account they possibly can. In separate research, the Alliance found that passkeys are now supported by 20% of the world’s top 100 websites and 12% of the top 250.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shift away from passwords toward passkeys is being driven by three key trends; people’s concerns over password security, their frustrations in using them, and the growing availability of passkeys on major websites and services.</p>



<p>The Alliance’s research found that in the last year, 24% of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities, and 26% had to reset or recover at least one password every month. In addition, 45% of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account. This is hugely significant for passkey adoption, as 61% of people familiar with passkeys consider them to be more convenient than passwords, and 58% believe they offer greater security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The availability of passkeys has also increased steadily over the last year, with <a href="https://aka.ms/VasuJoyWPD2024">Microsoft today announcing</a> that Microsoft accounts, including a wide range of services like Bing, Microsoft 365 and Xbox.com – now also support passkeys. This is added to support from large global consumer brands, such as Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Google, Hyatt, Nintendo, PayPal, PlayStation, Shopify and TikTok. In all, more than 13 billion user accounts can now leverage passkeys for sign in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of high-profile passkey deployments like these, awareness of the technology has grown to 62% of people, according to the research. Among people with some knowledge of passkeys, those enabling them on at least one account rises substantially to 74%, while those enabling passkeys on every account possible rises to 32%. This suggests that adoption will only increase as more people become more familiar with passkeys.</p>



<p>“It was just two years ago that FIDO Alliance, alongside the world’s largest platform providers, introduced the vision for passkeys to accelerate the scale and usability of password-free sign-ins. The market’s reaction since then has been nothing short of phenomenal, with hundreds of services enabling billions of consumers to use passkeys,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance. “We expect this trend to accelerate in the months and years ahead, and our research makes it clear that when offered, people prefer the better security and usability of passkeys over passwords.”</p>



<p>Ends</p>



<p>Notes to editors:</p>



 
 The independent survey was conducted by Sapio Research in April 2024 among 2,000 consumers across the UK and US – with 1,000 in each country. Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. In this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 2.2 percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample. 



 To calculate the proportion of the world’s top websites and services that support passkeys, the FIDO Alliance combined publicly available information with its own data on passkey deployments.&nbsp; 
 



<p>About the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.<br>Contact<br><a href="mailto:press@fidoalliance.org">press@fidoalliance.org</a></p>

<p>For those in our community who have been staying up-to-date on our thoughts and experimenting thus far as they relate to points, you already know why we see points as a logical vehicle for Web3 reputation systems. As our co-founder, Danny importantly points out in his blog post entitled <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/points-how-reputation-tokens-collide-where-it-goes-from-here/">Points: How Reputation &amp; Tokens Collide</a>, points not only align the incentives of the platform and its users, but Web3 enables point systems to be more open and composable by "...making every event driving points both transparent and verifiable..."</p><p>Given Ceramic's native composability, provenance, performance, and flexible-by-design characteristics, "points built on Ceramic" became an obvious idea for a design pattern that would appeal to teams looking to integrate reward systems into their projects. In March, we released a post called <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/points-on-ceramic/">Building Points on Ceramic - an Example and Learnings</a> meant to walk readers through a points proof-of-concept application we deployed for EthDenver '24. Later that month, we also released another post to announce <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/toward-the-first-decentralized-points-system-oamo-becomes-the-first-points-provider-on-ceramic/">Oamo as the first points provider on Ceramic</a>.</p><p>This is all to say - as an organization, we've strived to be thoughtful and deliberate about how we approach the opportunity Web3 points presents while aiming to maintain quick iteration and experimentation as engineering and product norms.</p><p>As such, we've been working on a new experiment that we're excited to share with you - a points library built on Ceramic!</p> Why Develop a Points Library?  <p>Given that we identified points as an ideal use case for Ceramic, building a points library presented an opportunity to help developers start experimenting with and iterating on Ceramic much faster. We also predicted that the approach would accelerate developers' learning rate by packaging Ceramic within an easy-to-understand paradigm. Finally, a use case-specific library allowed us to:</p>  Predefine library interfaces and base models for users, helping them bypass this development stage  Eliminate the friction of compiling and deploying a composite  Enable immediate utility and experimentation by removing the need for node setup  Help developers focus on their core application logic by baking straightforward functionality into the library  <p>...and so on.</p> Which Use Cases is it Built for? <p>Throughout this post, we'll take a high-level walk through the anatomy of the points module (and the broader SDK it lives in) which should reveal how flexible and extendable the library is. However, here are some scenarios we considered that helped inform its design and utility:</p><p>Rewarding Community Engagement</p>  A project wants to incentivize meaningful participation by rewarding points for engagement across key social platforms  The project must track a history of point allocation events per participant, as well as have easy access to a participant's total  <p>Incentivizing Collaboration</p>  A project wants to reward collaborators for contributing to a codebase  Various types of contributions under this system are eligible for point rewards  <p>Quests or Education</p>  An education platform wants to reward students for completing class modules  Points are distributed in correlation to quiz or test scores at the end of each module   What is the Points Library? <p>The points library is the first module within our larger <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Solutions SDK</a>, designed to be the eventual home for any experimental tooling our team creates for certain common patterns or use cases we've identified as priorities. While the individual libraries (points, for example) sit at the core of this SDK, this repository will also contain example applications, API documentation, and other helpful modules to support developers looking to get started.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/libraries/points?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Points Library module</a> (which is now available as an NPM module - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramic-solutions/points?activeTab=readme&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">@ceramic-solutions/points</a>) removes the common points of tension mentioned above by:</p><p>Delivering a hosted node endpoint</p><p>This is the default endpoint if no alternate is provided by the user (for test purposes only - not intended for production). This feature was designed to accelerate developer experimentation. Of course, the library also supports private endpoints as well.</p><p>Predefined Interfaces and Default Models</p><p>The points library relies on two schema interfaces (implemented by two default models) for keeping track of points. These interfaces can easily be extended by developers who desire more complex use cases, or developers can leverage the default models out of the box with no additional configuration.</p> <code>interface PointsAllocationInterface implements PointsInterface
  @createModel(description: "Interface for a single allocation of points to an account") {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
}

interface PointsAggregationInterface implements PointsInterface
  @createModel(description: "Interface for an aggregation of points to an account") {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
  date: DateTime!
}</code> <p>While the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/blob/main/libraries/points/README.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Points Library Readme</a> offers more detail, these interfaces broadly speak to the two primary utilities we anticipate developers will need. Model instances of <code>PointsAllocationInterface</code> will keep track of the history of allocation events (and if extended, can include fields to capture additional details such as when and why points were allocated). Conversely, <code>PointsAggregationInterface</code> is designed to keep track of the sum of points for a recipient at any given time (and like allocation docs, can also be extended to keep track of more nuanced data points like contextual subtotals).</p><p>Built-in Reader and Writer Classes</p><p>The two core library modules consist of a points reader class and a separate writer class, allowing developers multiple ways to instantiate an instance (the easiest of which simply requires a private key if using the default node endpoint and default models). Each class includes built-in methods to read or issue points and can accommodate extensions of the interfaces without the necessity of additional wrapping.</p> What Will You Build with Points? <p>While we covered a few examples of typical use cases for points, there are so many other possibilities out there for developers to explore. Perhaps you want to reward your community for showing up to in-person events or collaborating on projects. Maybe you want to build a service that analyzes on-chain behavior (such as interacting with certain smart contracts or holding certain assets) and uses a framework of weights to award contextual points.</p><p>We'd love to learn how you're using reward systems across your communities and projects, and whether this initial library has what it needs to support your use case. Feel free to contact me directly at <a href="mailto:mzk@3box.io">mzk@3box.io</a>, or start a conversation on the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Forum</a>. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

 Welcome to the future of AI: Building a verifiable Internet with&nbsp;ChatDKG <p>We are excited to announce the launch of a pioneering educational course, “<a href="https://alliance-academy.origintrail.io/course/origintrail-ai-builders">ChatDKG for AI Builders</a>” at <a href="https://alliance-academy.origintrail.io/home">Trace Alliance Academy</a>. This course is designed for forward-thinking artificial intelligence (AI) developers, data scientists, and technology innovators who aim to enhance the fidelity and integrity of their AI solutions through the Verifiable Internet for AI powered by the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph&nbsp;(DKG).</p> Why OriginTrail-powered verifiable Internet for&nbsp;AI? <p>Verifiable Internet for AI leverages the synergies of crypto, the Internet, and AI technologies (read more in in the <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf">OriginTrail Whitepaper 3.0</a>). With the novel Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) approach it ensures the provenance, integrity, and verifiability of information utilized by AI systems. It aims to address the challenges posed by misinformation, data ownership, intellectual property rights, and biases inherent in AI technologies, by synergizing neural and symbolic AI approaches with Web3 technologies.</p><p>In an era marked by abundant connectivity and, unfortunately, abundant misinformation, the need for reliable data has never been more crucial. The OriginTrail DKG stands out as an open-source, trusted knowledge infrastructure that leverages blockchain and knowledge graph technologies and is founded on the principles of neutrality, inclusiveness, and usability.</p><p>As Dr. Bob Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet and an Internet pioneer, notes, knowledge graphs are critical in improving the fidelity of artificial intelligence. By leveraging the synergies of knowledge graph and blockchain technologies, OriginTrail DKG enables structuring and connecting data, making it discoverable, verifiable, and ownable in the form of knowledge assets, and, as such, usable for verifiable AI solutions employing the innovative Decentralized Augmented Generation (dRAG) framework.</p><p>By introducing the dRAG framework, the OriginTrail-powered verifiable Internet for AI builds on and expands the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a key paradigm for builders in the AI space looking to feed large language models (LLMs) with specific context and datasets. Besides empowering builders to develop verifiable AI solutions based on trusted knowledge, the dRAG framework also opens up a tremendous opportunity for connecting individual knowledge bases that AI builders are creating and curating for their RAG pipelines, enabling the sharing of knowledge and value between AI systems in a decentralized way.</p><p>Builders can leverage all of these capabilities of the verifiable Internet for AI through <a href="https://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG</a> — a launchpad for trusted AI. Through ChatDKG, they can create predictable AI agents to execute tasks based on trusted data stored in the OriginTrail DKG. Their AI agents benefit from information provenance and data ownership, while the builders enjoy the freedom to choose between multiple AI&nbsp;models.</p><p>Learning to build and leverage a verifiable Internet for AI with ChatDKG, therefore, allows AI pioneers to seize the opportunities analogous to those previously seized by advances in networking that early computer networks such as Ethernet and the Internet brought about. Opportunities that have demonstrated tremendous value generation through network effects famously articulated in Metcalfe’s law.</p> What will you learn in the ChatDKG for AI builders&nbsp;course? <p>The course covers a range of crucial topics and tools essential for building and leveraging verifiable Internet for&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Here is what you can expect to&nbsp;learn:</p>  Verifiable Internet for AI: Understand the foundational concepts and key properties of verifiable Internet for AI like clear information provenance, verifiable information, and incentivization for high-quality knowledge production.  OriginTrail enablement: Explore how OriginTrail DKG facilitates a verifiable Internet for AI, including its structure and operational dynamics.  Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG) framework: Dive into the dRAG framework and learn how it ensures knowledge provenance and aids in the accurate retrieval of information to build verifiable AI applications.  ChatDKG launchpad: With ChatDKG as a launchpad for trusted AI solutions, you can turn your data into Knowledge Assets and create predictable AI agents to execute tasks using your data. Because Knowledge Assets are created on the OriginTrail DKG, your AI agents benefit from information provenance and data ownership and you have the freedom to choose between multiple AI&nbsp;models.  Integration techniques: Learn to integrate different LLMs and other tools with OriginTrail DKG to build robust and verifiable AI solutions. Start with exploring integrations with the Google Gemini, NVIDIA Build ecosystem, and Chainlink Oracle capabilities and expect new tutorials to be added subsequently.   Join us to shape the future of&nbsp;AI <p>This course is a unique opportunity to be at the forefront of creating safer, verifiable, and more reliable AI solutions. Whether you are an AI enthusiast, a seasoned developer, or a curious learner, “ChatDKG for AI builders” offers valuable insights and practical skills to navigate and shape the future of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Enroll today at <a href="https://alliance-academy.origintrail.io">Trace Alliance Academy</a> and join us in pioneering the verifiable Internet for AI. Together, let’s lead the charge in fostering a democratic, ethically guided, and economically viable future for AI applications.</p><p>To receive additional tools and support to build transformative AI solutions on OriginTrail, apply for the <a href="https://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG Inception Program</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/launching-the-origintrail-for-ai-builders-course-at-trace-alliance-academy-69a1bda6d384">Launching the “ChatDKG for AI builders” course at Trace Alliance Academy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 PolkaBotAI — decentralizing AI with OriginTrail and&nbsp;Polkadot <p>The explosive rise of Artificial Intelligence has sparked the first stages of a new knowledge revolution, comparable historically with the invention of the printing press or the world wide web. Its sudden growth also pointed at some of the threats and shortfalls such as hallucinations, bias, mishandling of intellectual property rights and even potential AI model collapses. Both the opportunities and challenges of this knowledge revolution are showing the need for convergence between Crypto, Internet and AI in a Verifiable Internet for AI proposed by OriginTrail. The Verifiable Internet for AI is effectively addressing AI’s shortfalls by decentralizing knowledge that AI systems use in their solutions. One of the pioneering implementations of the approach is <a href="http://polkabot.ai">Polkabot.AI</a> — a Decentralized AI education hub on Polkadot which will see its full release in the coming months after receiving support from the Polkadot Treasury.</p><p>Spearheading the development of Polkabot.ai is Trace Alliance, a collaborative hub that builds partnerships for creating and leveraging trusted knowledge in the age of AI. The solution is bringing the vision of decentralized AI to reality as it revolutionizes how anyone can interact and learn about the Polkadot ecosystem whether they are a novice getting through the first steps or a seasoned user looking for the latest updates. It achieves that by allowing a wider Polkadot ecosystem to get involved in creating a trusted knowledge base that Polkabot’s AI system will use to construct its responses. Unlike the solutions using solely generative AI, Polkabot is implementing a novel decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG) approach leveraging the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). Instead of Polkabot solely relying on AI to produce a generated response, it uses AI to construct a response using trusted inputs from the DKG populated by the wider Polkadot community. This gives the solution information provenance, respect for data ownership and gives the user a chance to verify each source and its issuer used in the final response. The trusted knowledge Polkabot’s AI systems access will be continuously expanded through community curation and knowledge publishing process called knowledge mining.</p><p>The Polkabot.ai initiative received backing through an <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/617">OpenGov treasury proposal</a>, which was approved on April 23, 2024. As an AI-powered educational platform that tailors learning to each user, PolkaBot.AI represents a significant leap forward in how we interact with Polkadot’s diverse content — whether within the ecosystem or in outward communications — enabling users to access trusted knowledge and get precise responses online.</p><p>Stay updated with the latest developments by following <a href="https://twitter.com/PolkabotAI">PolkaBotAI on&nbsp;X</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/polkabotai-decentralizing-ai-with-origintrail-and-polkadot-48a696a3ddb2">PolkaBotAI — decentralizing AI with OriginTrail and Polkadot</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>The functionality of Ceramic and ComposeDB has been recently enhanced by a number of new features that give developers more control over account relation  definitions and data accessibility. More specifically, you can now use the following tools to enhance your applications:</p>  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/relations?ref=blog.ceramic.network#model-to-model">SET account relation</a> - enabling users to enforce a constraint where each user account (or DID) can create only one instance of a model for a specific record of another model.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/schemas?ref=blog.ceramic.network#type-validation-directives">Immutable fields</a> - allow specific data to be prevented from being altered.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/interact-with-data?ref=blog.ceramic.network#removerestore-record-from-index">shouldIndex flag</a> - gives developers an option to manage the data visibility by choosing which fields should be indexed.  <p>In this blog post, we are going to dive into these features in more detail. For a video walkthrough, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2BRQqPI354&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">this video tutorial</a>.</p> SET account relations <p>SET relations in ComposeDB enable developers to define relations between the data models that follow specific constraints and include the user as part of the relationship. SET account relation allows users to enforce the constraint that a specific account (DID) can have only one instance of a model for a specific record of another model.</p><p>The best example to illustrate the “like” feature of a social media application. SET relation can be utilized to make sure that the user (DID) can “like” a specific post only once, while at the same time allowing the user to like multiple posts.</p><p>Let’s have a look at how SET Relations can be used in practice.</p> Ceramic Layer <p>To use SET account relation in Ceramic, you will first have to define a SET <code>accountRelation</code> in your model definition. An example below consists of two simple models - <code>POST_MODEL</code> representing the model definition for social media posts, and <code>LIKE_MODEL</code> representing the model definition for users liking the posts.</p><p>The model definition for <code>POST_MODEL</code> has the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/relations?ref=blog.ceramic.network#types-of-relations">accountRelation</a> as a list, meaning that one user account will be allowed to create multiple posts.</p><p>The model definition for <code>LIKE_MODEL</code> has a <code>SET</code> accountRelation and includes the fields which should be used to create the unique relation - <code>postID</code> and <code>userID</code>. This defines that a specific user can create only one "like" record for a specific post.</p><p></p> <code>const POST_MODEL: ModelDefinition = {
  name: 'Post',
  version: '2.0',
  interface: false,
  implements: [],
  accountRelation: {type: 'list'},
  schema: {
    $schema: '&lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema&gt;',
    type: 'object',
    additionalProperties: false,
    properties: {
      content: {type: 'string', maxLength: 500},
      author: {type: 'string'},
    },
    required: ['content', 'author'],
  },
}

const LIKE_MODEL: ModelDefinition = {
  name: 'Like',
  version: '2.0',
  interface: false,
  implements: [],
  accountRelation: {type: 'set', fields: ['postID', 'userID']},
  schema: {
    $schema: '&lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema&gt;',
    type: 'object',
    additionalProperties: false,
    properties: {
      postID: {type: 'string'},
      userID: {type: 'string'},
    },
    required: ['postID', 'userID'],
  },
}

</code>  ComposeDB Layer <p>Now let's see an example of how you can use SET account relations in ComposeDB. Similar to the example above, the key component that allows you to define the SET account relation for a specific model is the <code>accountRelation</code> scalar alongside the fields that should be used to define the unique relation.</p><p>Take the example below. Here we have two models defined using GraphQL schema definition language. The first model is a model for storing data about a Picture - the source and the dimensions of the image. The model definition Favourite implements the behavior of the user setting a picture as a favorite. Note that this model has an <code>accountRelation</code> defined as SET. The field that is used to define the relation is <code>docID</code>, which refers to the document ID of the picture record.</p> <code>type Picture @createModel(description: "A model for pictures", accountRelation: SINGLE) {
  src: String! @string(maxLength: 150),
  mimeType: String! @string(maxLength: 50),
  width: Int! @int(min:1),
  height: Int! @int(min:1),
  size: Int! @int(min:1),
}

type Favourite @createModel(description: "A set of favourite documents", accountRelation: SET, accountRelationFields: ["docID"]){
  docID: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "Picture")
  doc: Node @relationDocument(property: "docID")
  note: String @string(maxLength: 500)
}

</code> <p>All this means that the user will be able to set only one image as a favorite. They can set different pictures as favorites, but only one record per picture.</p> Immutable Fields <p>Another feature that has been recently added to Ceramic is Immutable Fields. With Immutable Fields, you are able to define which fields (for example, some critical data) should remain unchangeable no matter what and be accessible as read-only data. Any attempt to alter the data set as immutable would result in an error message.</p> Ceramic Layer <p>Defining specific fields as immutable is pretty simple. Below we have an example of a simple model defining a Person - their address, name, and other details. To make these fields immutable you simply need to include them into the <code>immutableFields</code> array. In the example below, fields like <code>address</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>myArray</code>, and <code>myMultipleType</code> will be set as immutable, meaning that once this data is created, it will be unchangeable:</p> <code>const example_model : ModelDefinition = {
  name : 'Person',
  views : {},
  schema : {
    type : 'object',
    $defs : {
      Address : {
        type : 'object',
        title : 'Address',
        required : [ 'street', 'city', 'zipCode' ],
        properties : {
          city : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 5},
          street : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 5},
          zipCode : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 5},
        },
        additionalProperties : false,
      },
    },
    $schema : '&lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema&gt;',
    required : [ 'name', 'address' ],
    properties : {
      name : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 10},
      address : {$ref : '#/$defs/Address'},
      myArray : {type : 'array', maxItems : 3, items : {type : 'integer'}},
      myMultipleType : {oneOf : [ {type : 'integer'}, {type : 'string'} ]},
    },
    additionalProperties : false,
  },
  version : '2.0',
  interface : false,
  relations : {},
  implements : [],
  description : 'Simple person with immutable field',
  accountRelation : {type : 'list'},
  immutableFields : [ 'address', 'name', 'myArray', 'myMultipleType' ],
}</code>  ComposeDB Layer <p>In ComposeDB, a specific field can be set as immutable by adding a directive <code>@immutable</code> to the fields that should remain unchangeable. For example:</p> <code>type ModelWithImmutableProp@createModel(
  accountRelation: SINGLE, 
  description: "Test model with an immutable int property"
  ) {
    uniqueValue: Int @immutable 
    uniqueValue2: Int @immutable
  }
}</code> <p></p><p>Here, we set that fields <code>uniqueValue</code> and <code>uniqueValue2</code> are going to be immutable.</p> shouldIndex Flag <p>Last but not least, let’s talk about the shouldIndex Flag available in Ceramic and ComposeDB. shouldIndex Flag allows you to control the stream indexing by toggling a boolean metadata flag. It enables you to manage data visibility and indexing. By setting the shouldIndex Flag to <code>false</code>, you can disable the stream from being indexed, making it “invisible” for indexing operations. Let’s take a look at how you can use this feature.</p> Ceramic Layer <p>When working with model documents, <code>ModelInstanceDocument</code>, there is a new method called <code>shouldIndex(boolean-value)</code> where false would indicate the stream corresponding to this model should not be indexed, and can be called with value = true to reindex an existing document, e.g.:</p> <code>const document = await ModelInstanceDocument.create(ceramic, CONTENT0, midMetadata)
// Unindex
await document.shouldIndex(false)
</code>  ComposeDB Layer <p>There are two ways to signal that a stream shouldn’t be indexed using ComposeDB. The first one is by including the <code>shouldIndex</code>option in a mutation query, setting it to <code>true</code> if it should be indexed and set to <code>false</code> in the contrary:</p> <code>const runtime = new ComposeRuntime({ ceramic, context, definition: composite.toRuntime() })
await runtime.executeQuery&lt;{
updateProfile: { viewer: { profile: { name: string } } }
}&gt;(`
  mutation UpdateProfile($input: UpdateProfileInput!) {
    updateProfile(input: $input) {
      viewer {
        profile {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
`, { input: { id: profileID, content: {}, options: { shouldIndex: false } } },
)</code> <p>The second way is to use a mutation type called enableIndexing, just like a create or update mutation, it should be paired with the model’s name, sending the streamId and shouldIndex value as part of the input, e.g.:</p> <code>const enableIndexingPostMutation = `mutation EnableIndexingPost($input: EnableIndexingPostInput!) {
  enableIndexingPost(input: $input) {
    document {
      id
    }
  }
}`

await runtime.executeQuery&lt;{ enableIndexingPost: { document: { id: string } } }&gt;
enableIndexingPostMutation, { input: { id, shouldIndex: false } },)
</code> <p>Note that the shouldIndex flag doesn’t delete the data. If set to <code>false</code>, the stream will still exist on the network; however, it will not be indexed and will not be available for data interactions.</p>  Summary <p>The powerful new features in Ceramic and ComposeDB offer users a sophisticated toolkit for data management. From enforcing unique constraints with SET account relations to securing key data with immutable fields and controlling indexing operations using the shouldIndex flag, these features empower developers to build robust and efficient data models for their applications.

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>April brings change in many forms – not just shorter days and falling leaves from our deciduous trees. For business it’s not only a new trading quarter and for some a new financial year, but also the arrival of policy exposure drafts from Government agencies that sometimes stack three, four or five deep. This is hard enough for people or organisations, but for consensus-driven community/industry groups it is quite daunting. I’ve always found it strange that while agencies recognise the value of group responses, additional time for the process is not afforded to them by default. However, it’s great that most agencies do so when approached. You know who you are, so thank you!</p>

We had 80 on the call! This sprint serves as a prelude to a workshop next month to surface the digital identity related issues that people encounter in the payments industry. The goal is to develop best practice requirements to overcome these issues as part of PaymentsNZ’s Next Generation Payments programme.</p>



<p>On Tuesday 7 May, I’ll be at the&nbsp;<a href="https://nzgovdata.co/agenda/">NZ Government Data Summit</a>&nbsp;moderating a panel with DINZ members MyMahi, MoE and DIA. DIA is up next at DINZ on Tuesday 14 May as it walks us through the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework and how it supports safe and effective digital identity services in Aotearoa.&nbsp;Register for it&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/building-aotearoas-digital-identity-regulatory-framework-guidelines-with-dia/">here</a>.</p>

<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to reliability, scalability, and performance, the Ceramic core developers have spent a lot of the last year making significant architectural improvements to our Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS). To further advance the goal of a reliable and performant anchoring system, the CAS is moving away from IPFS. This change requires developers to upgrade their Ceramic nodes to v5.3+ by 6th of May, 2024 to avoid potential data loss.</p> About the change <p>The Ceramic team is getting closer to releasing Ceramic’s Recon protocol, intended to dramatically improve the performance, scalability, and reliability of cross-node data synchronization. Utilizing our new custom Recon protocol requires moving away from IPFS pubsub as the mechanism for synchronizing Streams in Ceramic. In preparation for this change, the Ceramic team has built a new direct HTTP-based mechanism for sharing Time Events from the CAS to Ceramic nodes. This means that newer Ceramic nodes no longer have any dependency on IPFS pubsub to learn about Time Events from the CAS. Older Ceramic nodes, however, may still be relying on pubsub to learn about Time Events. Since the correct delivery of Time Events is a requirement to avoid data loss, it is important that all Ceramic nodes on the network be upgraded to at least v5.3 by the 6th of May, 2024, to avoid potential data loss.</p> What does this mean to Ceramic developers? <p>Developers must upgrade their Ceramic nodes to v5.3+ by the 6th of May, 2024. After the 6th of May, the CAS will no longer publish Time Events to IPFS pubsub which means that if you don’t upgrade to v5.3+, your node won’t get notifications about anchor successes, which in turn may result in data loss.</p> How to get support? <p>If you need support regarding the upgrade or choosing the best path forward for your project, please create a post on <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/upgrade-your-ceramic-node-to-v5-3-before-the-6th-of-may/1563?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic developer forum</a> with your project details and the core Ceramic team members will reach out to you.</p>

<p>ISL is pleased to announce the publication of the following research tools:&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/references/company-privacy-risk-dictionary/">Company Risk Dictionary</a>,&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/references/sdk-privacy-risk-dictionary/">SDK Risk Dictionary</a>, and&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/references/domain-privacy-risk-dictionary/">Domain Risk Dictionary</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p>These are the tools ISL uses to generate safety scores and populate our Safety Labels in App Microscope. The data covers all the companies that appeared in our research since 2022–mainly companies that developed EdTech apps, SDKs found in the apps, or domains found in the network traffic of the tested apps. It also includes parent companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “risk” assessed in each of these tools is data privacy risk. ISL uses a scoring range of -1 (lowest risk) to -4 (highest risk), and the scoring rubric for each dictionary is described in more detail on the resource landing page for each dictionary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update to App Microscope&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to these new research tools, ISL is delighted to announce the addition of companies receiving data in our Safety Labels in <a href="https://appmicroscope.org/app/773/">App Microscope</a>. We’ve added a summary and detailed section organized by risk level, showing the names of companies that were observed in the outbound network traffic from the app. Since the testing of each app varied a bit, it can’t be considered as complete information, but it is documented, actual traffic from the app testing session.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ISL is pleased to be able to make these tools freely available to the public through generous funding from the Internet Society Foundation and Wrethinking, the Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Company Privacy Risk is calculated from a multi-part formula ultimately reflecting Risk Impact plus Risk Likelihood. Risk Impact and Risk Likelihood are both scored from -1 (lowest risk) to -4 (highest risk), and then added together. The final score is normalized into a range from -1 (lowest risk) to -4 (highest risk). </p>
<p>Risk Impact is directly proportional to the sensitivity of the data generally accessed to provide services in the Company’s industry category/subcategory. The more sensitive the data, the higher the Risk Impact. For instance, mental health services would increase Risk Impact, as would School Information Systems, given the depth and breadth of student and parent information. </p>
<p>Risk Likelihood is calculated by the likelihood of the company sharing or monetizing personal information. This was determined by evaluating the following characteristics:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Status:&nbsp; Current Specification<br>
Superseding:&nbsp; Version 1.0 (unpublished)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ISL SDK Data Privacy Risk Dictionary scores SDKs found in ISL research (such as the 2022 US K-12 EdTech Safety Benchmark). The original SDK Privacy Risk Dictionary version 1.0 was developed in 2021 and utilized in the app scoring in the 2022 US K-12 EdTech Safety Benchmark and App Microscope but was not publicly available. Thus this is version 2.0.</p>
<p>SDK Privacy Risk is calculated from a multi-part formula reflecting Risk Impact plus Risk Likelihood. Risk Impact and Risk Likelihood are both scored from -1 (lowest risk) to -4 (highest risk), and then added together. The final score is normalized into a range from -1 (lowest risk) to -4 (highest risk). </p>
<p>Risk Impact is directly proportional to the type of data generally accessed to provide the functions of the SDK, based on its category/subcategory and tag information. The more sensitive the personal information, the higher the Risk Impact. For instance, biometrics SDKs have a very high Risk Impact; SDKs for video and photo capture or processing would also have very high Risk Impact scores.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Risk Likelihood is the likelihood of the SDK sharing or monetizing personal information. This was calculated using the following SDK characteristics:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The SDK’s primary industry category, subcategory and tags. Categories known to monetize personal information (such as<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Advertising / Marketing) received in higher Risk Likelihood. [Source: privacy policies, online research] &nbsp;</p>

 An innovative approach to support Bitcoin’s decarbonization by financially rewarding miners who use clean&nbsp;energy <p>One of the most pervasive conversations surrounding blockchain technology is sustainability. Blockchain networks — specifically proof-of-work (PoW) networks like Bitcoin — can consume large amounts of energy. Recent estimates suggest that Bitcoin mining is currently responsible annually for an estimated 85 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (<a href="https://filecache.mediaroom.com/mr5mr_paypal/186970/Green_Mining_Initiative_2024.pdf">as of April 02, 2024</a>). Even with new blockchain consensus mechanisms proliferating rapidly, Bitcoin’s PoW architecture is likely to&nbsp;persist.</p><p>PayPal’s Blockchain Research Group, in a strategic collaboration with Energy Web and DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (“DMG”), presents an opportunity to accelerate the clean energy transition for Bitcoin mining. Just like so many other mechanisms throughout web3, we propose the use of cryptoeconomic incentives to encourage desired behavior: Bitcoin miners using low-carbon energy sources in their mining operations. The full research paper, linked below, outlines an opportunity that not only rewards Bitcoin miners for operating with sustainable energy, but also increases the likelihood of participating entities to route on-chain transactions to these specific&nbsp;miners.</p><p>Read the full paper from the <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.paypal-corp.com%2Fimage%2FGreen_Mining_Initiative_2024.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cwilburns%40paypal.com%7Cd2510d3722fc4939429608dc622c4164%7Cfb00791460204374977e21bac5f3f4c8%7C0%7C0%7C638493189460006661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=eCx%2Fu0p3a6TNK7Y0VpN3x0W%2FMl9e8ZHGEcGnVo3IRGo%3D&amp;reserved=0">PayPal Blockchain Research&nbsp;Group</a>.</p> Incentivizing desired activity with cryptoeconomics <p>Rational miners are driven by cryptoeconomic incentives. They expect to be rewarded with an asset (bitcoin BTC) that is more valuable than the resources they expended to acquire that reward. Much of blockchain’s history has focused on how to get a group of disparate, individual miners to all perform honestly and responsibly in the maintenance of a decentralized ledger.</p><p>Since 2008, Bitcoin has achieved the robust, secure, decentralized, and censorship-resistant maintenance of the ledger with its decentralized miner community. In other words, the fundamental cryptoeconomic structure of Bitcoin and its PoW consensus mechanism has proven successful. Now, the question is whether additional cryptoeconomic incentives can be layered on top of the fundamental PoW mechanism thereby allowing us to encourage more environmentally sustainable actions that we desire as a community.</p><p>PayPal’s Blockchain Research Group’s partner EnergyWeb has developed a clean energy validation platform to permit Bitcoin miners to obtain low-carbon accreditation for their mining operations. These green miners are associated with public keys (which we refer to as green keys), to which rewards can be distributed. On-chain transactions are preferentially routed to green miners by being broadcasted with low transaction fees, but with some BTC reward “locked” in a multisig payout address. Green miners will be incentivized to mine these transactions, since they will be the only ones eligible for the additional “locked” BTC&nbsp;reward.</p><p>PayPal’s Blockchain Research Group hopes that this paper influences preferred behaviors by proposing ways in which fundamental cryptoeconomic incentives can be reapplied to improve and optimize existing, proven, strong networks. Sustainability is a significant topic of conversation for nearly every emerging and established industry in the world, and we aim to support the role of crypto in a sustainable future.</p><p>Read the full paper from the <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.paypal-corp.com%2Fimage%2FGreen_Mining_Initiative_2024.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cwilburns%40paypal.com%7Cd2510d3722fc4939429608dc622c4164%7Cfb00791460204374977e21bac5f3f4c8%7C0%7C0%7C638493189460006661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=eCx%2Fu0p3a6TNK7Y0VpN3x0W%2FMl9e8ZHGEcGnVo3IRGo%3D&amp;reserved=0">PayPal Blockchain Research&nbsp;Group</a>.</p><p>About Energy Web Foundation:Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CEO</p>



<p>Adoption of passkeys has grown rapidly since the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">introduction</a> of sync capabilities less than two years ago, with passkeys being offered by a large and growing proportion of the world’s most visited websites and services. This adoption has come in large part because passkeys offer a true password replacement, helping address the well-known security and user experience weaknesses of knowledge-based authentication like passwords and even other second-factor methods like SMS OTPs.</p>



<p>Market adoption of new technology naturally moves faster than the associated policy and regulatory guidance – which for user authentication still generally reflects the password-centric worldview from when such guidance was developed. This is why we are excited that NIST has taken a lead amongst government agencies and moved quickly to provide <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/giving-nist-digital-identity-guidelines-boost-supplement-incorporating">new supplemental guidance</a> confirming that synced passkeys meet Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2).</p>



<p>This new NIST guidance makes clear that passkeys – like other FIDO authenticators – can support both AAL2 and AAL3 requirements. Synced passkeys can be AAL2 and device-bound passkeys can be AAL3.</p>



<p>Crucially, the NIST supplement also cites that synced passkeys deployed in a manner consistent with the guidelines as being phishing resistant. This has obvious benefits in a world where 87% of hacking-related breaches are caused by weak or stolen passwords and where there has been a 967% rise in credential phishing since 2022.</p>



<p>Passkey adoption to be boosted by the ‘reassurance of assurance’</p>



<p>While the rate of passkey adoption to date has been nothing short of phenomenal, some organizations – particularly those in regulated industries – understandably want to see that key government bodies accept and recommend new technologies like passkeys before supporting them at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have heard this from our partners and constituents across the globe about NIST in particular, whose digital identity guidelines are a global gold standard that are frequently cited by other countries. Today’s supplemental guidance from NIST stands to remove a critical barrier to passkey adoption, which now stands to be further accelerated.</p>



<p>However, there is still work to do. We are working closely with other agencies across the globe to educate them about passkeys and the importance of phishing-resistant authentication, and are encouraging them to update legacy policies, guidelines, and regulations to ultimately allow all organizations, wherever they are, to confidently provide more secure and more convenient authentication to their users and customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building NIST guidance into business best practices</p>



<p>Identity and authentication architects should contemplate NIST’s supplemental guidance as part of their broader digital identity strategy. For example, for every use case where password + OTP was used in the past, a synced passkey deployed in accordance with the new NIST guidance is not only sufficient to meet AAL2 requirements, but also more effective. In the vast majority of deployment scenarios, synced passkeys will provide a significant security and UX improvement over today’s authentication patterns – almost all of which are susceptible to phishing.</p>



<p>If organizations have specific business, regulatory, or other security requirements, they can choose whether to accept a synced passkey as the primary authentication method, a second factor, pair it with a risk engine, or require a device-bound key. Today’s guidance frees architects up from thinking about authentication layers and to instead focus on business requirements and related threat models. And today’s primary threat model of phishing and social engineering can be directly addressed by utilization of passkeys.</p>

<p></p>      MOBI and Gaia-X 4 moveID Web3 Interoperability Initiative           <p>Global Consortia Collaborate to Implement Trusted Self-Sovereign Identities and Verifiable Credentials for Vehicles and Batteries Enabling Circular Economy</p>
          <p>Los Angeles, 22 April 2024 — <a href="https://dlt.mobi/">MOBI</a> and <a href="https://www.gaia-x4futuremobility.de/en/projects/moveid">Gaia-X 4 moveID</a> proudly announce a joint initiative aimed to advance cross-industry interoperability. The initiative focuses on the joint implementation of two pioneering <a href="https://dlt.mobi/standards/">MOBI standards</a> — <a href="https://dlt.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MOBI-VID0002TS2024-Version-2.0.pdf">MOBI Vehicle Identity</a> (VID) and <a href="https://dlt.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2024/4/MOBI-BBC0001TS2024">MOBI Battery Birth Certificate</a> (BBC). More specifically, the initiative centers around linking physical objects — e.g., vehicles and their parts such as batteries — to Web3 digital identities and credentials. The goal is to demonstrate technical interoperability using <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) open-standards to establish a secure Self-Sovereign Data and Identities framework. The collaboration builds upon W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) to manage identities of vehicles and vehicle parts along with their credentials for transactions and claims, foundational for a circular economy.</p>
<p>Gaia-X 4 moveID is set to fundamentally reshape the landscape of mobility and vehicle services, fostering a unified digital ecosystem with <a href="https://www.51nodes.io/en/ssi-self-sovereign-identities/">Self-Sovereign Identities</a> (SSI) for all traffic participants. By crafting the essential technical and economic foundations, moveID is leading the charge toward a decentralized, user-focused mobility service ecosystem, leveraging SSI and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) alongside open-source software and standards. This pioneering ecosystem is designed to support a wide range of applications, including peer-to-peer parking and charging infrastructures, ensuring seamless data availability for smart mobility services, and creating open markets for data providers, AI applications, and mobility infrastructure services.</p>
<p>MOBI, a global nonprofit Web3 consortium, unites public and private sector efforts to create cross-industry interoperability through the creation of standards and building of critical infrastructure for Self-Sovereign Data (SSD), SSI, and verifiable transactions. This infrastructure comprises two federated networks: <a href="https://citopia.global/">Citopia</a>, a decentralized marketplace leveraging VCs, and the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/">Integrated Trust Network </a>(ITN), a DIDs Registry. Citopia and the ITN work together to deliver regulatory-compliant and standardized communication protocols for near-real-time transactions. Implemented in tandem, MOBI VID and MOBI BBC standards form the groundwork for a globally interoperable, open, and connected ecosystem; critical to unlocking a vast array of new applications for a resilient and circular economy.</p>
<p>Within the circular economy value chain, countless public and private stakeholders operate with distinct processes for managing sensitive business and consumer data. In complex, connected networks where trust incurs significant frictional costs, current centralized solutions are unable to provide adequate interoperability and extensibility needed to enable secure data exchange and authentication between stakeholders. The initiative will demonstrate the effectiveness of a Web3-enabled approach rooted in global standards by equipping vehicles and vehicle parts — such as batteries — with trusted self-sovereign identities for verifiable claims and transactions.</p>
<p>The initiative’s future potential is promising, with plans to explore standardized know-your-business (KYB) and know-your-customer (KYC) processes for Phase II. While Phase I focuses on testing technical interoperability, Phase II will involve testing business interoperability, a more complex endeavor that necessitates the creation of shared standards for the onboarding of consumers, businesses, and regulators’ trusted identities and credentials.</p>
<p>“A <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/bad-bots-account-for-73-of-internet-traffic-analysis/#:~:text=Bad%20Bots%20are%20increasing%20dramatically,%2C%20and%20in%2Dproduct%20abuse.">recent study</a> estimates that 73% of all internet traffic comprises bad bots and fraud farm traffic. Generative AI increases these risks dramatically. Today, approximately 20 billion IoT-connected devices lack trusted, verifiable identities and credentials, rendering them unable to securely engage in eCommerce,” said Tram Vo, MOBI CEO and Co-Founder. “With trusted and verifiable identities and claims, IoT devices — such as vehicles and batteries — can act as autonomous economic agents to securely share and authenticate data for every transaction, ensuring regulatory compliance and a higher degree of trust throughout the entire value chain.”</p>
<p>“A holistic, transparent system architecture for the exchange of data in road traffic which meets the new data sovereignty needs is not available today. There are individual companies that already offer services. But these services are tailored to specific applications, vehicles, or customer groups. With its open and EU compliant digital identity architecture, moveID helps to solve that challenge in the future markets,” explains Peter Busch, project manager at Gaia-X 4 moveID consortium lead Bosch.</p>
