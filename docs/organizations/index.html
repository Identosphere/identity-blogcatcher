<p>On April 27, 2020, IBM and Chainyard launched <a href="https://www.trustyoursupplier.com/rapid-supplier-connect/">Rapid Supplier Connect</a> (RSC), a blockchain-based network designed to help government agencies, hospitals and healthcare buyers to identify PPE suppliers in the United States. The participants included non-traditional suppliers who had pivoted to address the shortage of equipment, devices and PPE supplies needed for COVID-19 relief efforts with a greater efficiency.</p>



<p>The blockchain network, which was launched, free of fees, to help frontline healthcare organizations confidently identify and procure PPE, had unprecedented adoption. More than 500 buyers and suppliers joined in no time to quickly find each other, accelerated verification and onboarding processes, and gained near real-time insights into inventories of life-saving equipment.</p>



<p>Six weeks from ideation to market</p>



<p>During mid-March 2020, when the pandemic hit the United States with unanticipated impact and scale, hospitals found themselves struggling to procure quality and essential PPE equipment needed in the frontline battle. Availability was uncertain, quality was questionable, and trust in suppliers was eroding. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM and Chainyard jumped in to help responders to battle the pandemic by launching RSC, leveraging <a href="https://www.trustyoursupplier.com/">Trust Your Supplier</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/au-en/products/supply-chain-business-network">IBM Sterling</a> Supply Chain Suite, within six weeks.</p>



<p>Trust Your Supplier, owned and operated by <a href="http://chainyard.com/">Chainyard</a>, is a production blockchain network with trusted source of verified supplier information and digital identity that reduces risk while simplifying and accelerating supplier onboarding and supplier management. IBM Sterling Supply Chain Suite provides inventory visibility and deep insights into supply chain activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What are the reasons RSC had such quick adoption and successfully met its objectives? When looking back we identified the following five themes for how blockchain helped when the supply chain disruption hit:</p>



<p>1. Trust was paramount, and that trust will survive the pandemic</p>



<p>When the pandemic hit the supply chain, leading to shortages, price increases and quality distortions that cascaded from factories to ports to suppliers to consumers, the buyers needed a system that could be trusted.&nbsp; Blockchain is known to create trust in the system without any one individual or company in the system ensuring the trust. The trust is achieved through trust in the ecosystem, which included trust on third party verifiers, immutable data, immutable logic and audit trail of supplier information. Trust Your Supplier, the foundation for creating the trust, and previously proven with thousands of suppliers, was the right choice to be quickly leveraged to build trust between buyers and suppliers during the pandemic.</p>



<p>2. Blockchain provides the skeleton for trust; however, it is the ecosystem that brings it to life.</p>



<p>Blockchain provides the skeleton for creating the trust. However, it comes to life and offers greater value when more trusted industry players participate and contribute as validators, verifiers and solution providers working on top of the network. Each blockchain requires the creation of new industry ecosystems in which participants must work together. RSC achieved this through multiple verification agencies helping to generate trust in the ecosystem, including:</p>

<p>3. Inventory visibility and transparency accelerates on time delivery and adaptation.</p>



<p>When the pandemic caused a shortage of supplies, the buyers’ biggest need from suppliers were inventory visibility and transparency into delivery timetables.&nbsp; The solution was expected to provide real time visibility and transparency across the key supply chain pillars of procurement, manufacturing, transportation, and distribution. In the case of a pandemic, critical supply delivery lead time misinformation could lead to significant loss including lives.</p>



<p>RSC integrated IBM Sterling Supply Chain Suite to provide inventory visibility and deep insights into supply chain activities. Increased real-time visibility helped buyers to pace the PPE orders. The network also helped to identify existing supplies and excess inventory going unused, allowing hospitals to make it available to others and redirect supplies where they were needed most.</p>



<p>4. Simple solutions to solve pain points need to be swift to the market.</p>



<p>Blockchain solutions for supply chain can be very complex, supporting myriad use cases with a large consortium providing the single source of truth. One cannot build these solutions overnight when a pandemic hits. In order to be swift in the market, reuse solutions that are proven and available in the market being used by suppliers over the years.&nbsp; The level of integrations can be daunting and can take years. RSC adopted agility against the features, made integrations simple and was quick to market to address the critical needs.</p>



<p>5. Trusted Digital Identities bridge the trust gap between reality and the digital world.</p>



<p>Blockchain-based digital identity played a major role in creating trust . Digital Identity is about linking real world identities and the digital world. Each physical object’s digital replica (known as a digital twin) is created in a way that prevents or reveals any human interference that alters information. For a digital business transaction on supply chain, it is substantially important to prove the authenticity of one’s own identity and to verify that of the transaction partner. RSC leveraged TYS’s Digital Identity services to issue verifiable credentials associated with a company identity, digitally signed, and thus verified by a trusted party.</p>



<p>Additional aspects of blockchain that also contributed to supply chain resiliency during the pandemic include data privacy, confidentiality of shared data, innovative business models that glue together stakeholders in the ecosystem, and third-party solution integrations that work on top of these ecosystems. With many blockchain supply chain solutions on the rise, and interoperability actively being addressed, our society will have quicker resilience when we encounter the next pandemic.</p>



 



<p>For more on this topic, tune into a discussion on “Leveraging blockchain to drive supply chain resilience and accountability in the face of climate change and other disruptions” at Open Source Summit Europe at 13:00 GMT, Monday, October 26. The panel will include Chainyard’s Gigo Joseph along with Douglas Johnson-Poensgen of Circulor and Marta Geater-Piekarska of Hyperledger.</p>

<p>Levels of Assurance (LOA) play a foundational role in the world of standards, digital identity, and digital transactions. Put simply, LOA is the degree of confidence in the validity of a claim, process, or authentication. In the sphere of digital identity, it is a necessary model to verify that the person or entity claiming an identity is the entity to which that identity was assigned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most Canadians don’t think too deeply about LOAs, and yet most Canadians interact with these models, unknowingly, at some point in their lives. For example, Canadian experience LOAs when opening a bank account, demonstrating qualifications for a government service or benefit, making an insurance claim, or wiring money to a client or family member.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations that use LOAs to inform their policies and processes often have dedicated strategies and teams, working out contingencies and approaches to maximize security in Canada and internationally. These teams often face challenges interacting with other service providers, meeting different standards across jurisdictions, and minimizing friction for clients accessing their services.</p>



 How the Current LOA Model Works 



<p>Imagine two people, Samir and Aiya, are trying to apply for a small business loan. Both women have very strong credentials, a passport, driver’s license and the requisite business records. Samir and her credentials are linked through a knowledge-based authentication (KBA), and are accepted after answering a security question she previously populated about her father’s middle name. Aiko and her credential are linked with an in-person ceremony, as she went to her local bank branch with two pieces of identification and her business records to complete the loan application. Aiya’s scenario offers a stronger LOA and Samir’s a weaker LOA. Despite these differences, Canada’s federal LOAs currently dictate that Samir and Aiya both have the same assurance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Canada and many places around the world, it is common for LOA structures to combine a number of factors into a single score. The result is an obscured view of the risk factors and authentication. This lack of granularity into the LOAs of specific capabilities is a challenge present in the construct of LOA models around the world. The deciding factor regarding acceptance of an identity comes down to Relying Parties (parties who rely on the validity of identities) who determine their own risk profiles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, the relying party is the bank. The banker helping Samir and Aiya also benefits from a stronger LOA as they sign off on the business loan. In addition to building a stronger relationship with the client, they are able to manage their portfolio with confidence.</p>



<p>There is widespread agreement the current LOA model in Canada is inadequate. While LOAs serve a purpose, they are not transparent and dynamic enough to address the myriad digital solutions and scenarios of today. Internationally, single LOA schemes are no longer state of the art and today’s requirements necessitate separate evaluation for specific capabilities. In the DIACC community, there is consensus that there must be separate schemes for credentials and identity, at a minimum, in order to be useful in the widest possible range of scenarios and contexts. An improved assurance model should be capable of asserting identity and credentials at different levels.</p>



 Envisioning a New Risk-based Model for Assurance 



<p>A risk-based model offers a more enduring, user- and industry-friendly path forward that enables existing LOA schemes to participate while building for a more dynamic and scalable digital ecosystem. The notion of leveraging a risk-based model is highly applicable as the application of LOAs&nbsp; today are best determined by performing a threat or risk analysis. The risk-based model must address the likelihood and impact of something happening, and the appropriate mitigation approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LOA is essential in determining liability and risk; offering a clear understanding how a Subject (customer or citizen) and a Relying Party (company or government service) can validate that they are who they say they are. It is a central component in being able to determine whether a transaction should proceed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The risk-based starts by assessing risk first and then the approach drives more value for organizations, as they confront the baseline of their current systems and assess risk realistically. It also helps adopters improve their systems through motivation to&nbsp; reduce or remove risks through various types of mitigation.</p>



<p>DIACC is on a mission to rapidly deliver a modern, risk-based LOA model that is…</p>



  Risk-based  Directive and illustrative  Non-prescriptive in execution  Evergreen  Deterministic in implementation and assessment  Congruent with existing state of the art and best practices  Inclusive in support of both the private and public sector  Supportive of evolving needs on credentials and bindings  



<p>The impact of this evolution is far-reaching, and will ensure that the&nbsp; <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>TM is strong and resilient over time. This evolution takes a framework-wide approach to address interdependencies, independencies, and support communication across platforms. This new approach ensures scalability over time as technologies and their uses evolve.</p>



<p><br>DIACC has engaged a small, representative team to rapidly deliver a new model to support the PCTF, which <a href="https://diacc.ca/2020/09/15/newly-launched-digital-id-framework-to-begin-testing-in-canada/">launched September 15, 2020</a>.

<p>As part of its commitment to provide the lowest everyday prices for its consumers, <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/our-business/international/walmart-canada">Walmart Canada</a> has a sharp focus on supply chain logistics. One vital piece: the freight transportation that ensures Walmart is sufficiently stocked to service more than 1.2 million customers across 400 stores every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Walmart partners with third party transportation companies, referred to as carriers, that work around the clock, and through all seasons, to deliver goods. These carriers are a vital link in Walmart’s supply chain. However, there is a high level of complexity to managing the information flow and invoice payments with the carriers, which is a big deal as shipping is a capital-intensive business with a high degree of cost volatility (fuel prices, delays, unexpected events).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not uncommon to have invoice disputes in the range of 70% or more for every load a carrier delivers (one invoice per load). Despite various service providers trying to solve this puzzle using the full spectrum of existing technologies, disputes continue to plague the industry with high administrative costs and lengthy payment delays, and invoice reconciliation often simply means one side or the other capitulated.</p>



<p>For Walmart, the complexity is multiplied by working with up to 70 different carriers in its supply chain, each of which has its own respective process for calculating shipping costs based on individual contracts that outline varying rates for fuel, line haul and other charges.</p>



<p>Walmart Canada enlisted the help of <a href="https://dltlabs.com/">DLT Labs</a>, a global leader in the development and deployment of an innovative enterprise-level platform using distributed ledger technology, to develop a solution that would solve the perennial dispute problem once and for all.</p>



<p>In early 2019, DLT Labs rolled out the world’s largest full production blockchain solution for any industrial application: DL Freight. Remarkably, because the platform is fully configurable, DL Freight was configured for the demanding needs of Walmart in just 60 days. The new system tracks deliveries, verifies transactions, and automates invoices in real time. Reconciliation between Walmart and its fleet of carriers is no longer even necessary because they are all working off the same information and calculations by way of smart contracts.</p>



<p>DL Freight is built on Hyperledger Fabric, an open source platform that allows Walmart to bring together all the carriers within its multi-partner freight operations under one architecture to automate and implement universal workflows across the network. At the same time, through Hyperledger Fabric’s unique “channels” feature, the solution allows independent and protected relationships for each organization directly between itself and Walmart, and the information is not accessible to other members.</p>



<p>Within DL Freight, carriers are the peers, and the governance of the platform is controlled by the applicable contracts, as in any conventional business. The difference is that the freight, legal, and finance departments of Walmart, as well as all the carriers, have all agreed that the solution fairly and accurately represents those agreements so it processes them automatically. As a result, it has removed the guesswork and any real potential for dispute over the interpretation of agreements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hyperledger teamed up with DLT Labs and Walmart Canada on a case study about the creation and adoption of DL Freight, the national standard for freight invoice management for Walmart Canada and its national network of carriers. It delves into key design decisions and outcomes as well as security safeguards and the roadmap for DL Freight as an industry platform.</p>

<p>The world of digital identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) is evolving quickly, giving much cause for optimism.

However, DIDs and their infrastructure are also starting to converge and mature as an extensible-yet-interoperable technology.</p><p>Adoption by markets, standards bodies and regulators is largely contingent upon provable security and provable interoperability, so these promising developments cannot come soon&nbsp;enough.</p><p>The Digital Identity Foundation (DIF) is very proud to be hosting one particular research and development project that could prove pivotal in this process. It is currently a work item of DIF’s <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>. However, a charter for an autonomous working group will be available for review at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">#IIW31</a> this week (20–22 October 2020) to facilitate broader participation. The project is called KERI and it is a project that could only be developed in the open, for the public good and for the widest, quickest adoption.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pucelano">Fernando Santander</a> But first, what is&nbsp;KERI? <p>KERI stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. A “key event” is a discrete event in time that involves public/private keypairs, often called blockchain identities or cryptographic identities. These events can be generalized as inceptions (creations), rotations, and signing events: the three kinds of events for which KERI generates and handles receipts. In other words, key events are cryptographic events in the history of an identifier.</p><p>Importantly, everything else a decentralized identifier says, does, or refers to is not a key event. As KERI is deliberately laser-focused on key events only, we can call these other events non-KERI events. The real world consequences of a signature or rotation are out of scope and method-specific to boot. KERI is only interested in the most universal aspect of interactions between keys and cryptographic systems, i.e. the cryptography that allows drastically different DID systems to trust each other’s security guarantees.</p><blockquote>“DID Methods exist to solve a trust issue. This does it in a different way.”</blockquote><blockquote>Charles Cunningham (Jolocom GmbH, Rust development lead for&nbsp;KERI)</blockquote><p>Each key event produces a receipt containing only checkable signatures of key event information. Nothing more. Receipts are threaded into logs tracking the history of each identifier, which is similar to a traceable audit trail of hashes — useful for confirming but not for deducing the underlying key material. These threads are compiled into logs that are shared and replicated according to a consensus algorithm and a logic of trust thresholds that creates a fabric of shared history between&nbsp;nodes.</p> Is KERI a blockchain or a DLT? No. Does it replace blockchains? Also&nbsp;no. <p>The trust fabric created when KERI nodes share and propagate key material records&nbsp;might</p><p>sound redundant to the blockchains where all of today’s DID methods store their key material chronologically. To a degree, this is true: each log containing the history of one key is a “microledger,” like a blockchain with only one participant. Inception and rotation events in all of today’s DID methods are stored in a chronological distributed ledger which can be crawled to create a log of these key events by DID. So, why the redundancy? Why replicate a subset of the blockchain’s capabilities and features in a distinct blockchain-like infrastructure just for key material?</p><p>The answer is simple and manifold: blockchains enable many features outside the scope of KERI. These features bring with them complexity, diversity, scale costs, and trust issues. Within KERI’s scope, however, only some of a blockchain or distributed ledger technology’s (DLT’s) features are necessary. Total ordering and double-spend protection, for instance, are hallmarks of distributed ledgers, but hardly justify the added complexity here.</p>Subset of blockchain/DLT capabilities required by KERI (<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/KERI2_Overview.web.pdf">Dr Sam Smith</a>,&nbsp;2019)<p>Working backwards from a short list of security features, KERI infrastructure can be a much more performant, minimalist distributed ledger system. It is still in the family tree of blockchain, DLTs and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), but it is closer to a sidechain or a trans-blockchain interoperability mechanism. In use cases where all that is needed is a self-certifying, widely-portable identifier, KERI can stand alone as a lightweight DID method. In combination with a traditional DID Method, KERI can increase key management options and strengthen security guarantees by raising a red flag at the first discrepancy between the two parallel and redundant systems.</p><p>As a scaling mechanism, KERI can also take away some of the traffic and complexity from the underlying blockchain. In implementations where key management and state maintenance (record keeping about keys that rotate over time) are entrusted directly to the KERI mechanism, these functions can be operated much closer to the edge and replicate after a slight delay. This might be a totally acceptable trade-off of efficiency for latency in many use cases. For example, a roundtrip write-and-wait-for-finality transaction on a global blockchain makes no sense in a low-connectivity Internet of things (IoT) use case, where double-spend is a non-issue.</p> KERI is both an interoperability mechanism and a standardization incentive <p>More importantly for the DIF, however, is another major feature of KERI: it could become the foundation of massive interoperability and portability at the infrastructure layer. What’s more, if adopted by enough major players, it could even speed up the standardization process of DIDs themselves. By offering a minimum level of security guarantees shared across all participating methods, it would simplify the security review process for both individual DID methods and for interoperable DIDs as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>By abstracting out the universal, minimal set of key functions, a KERI log that spans multiple ledgers or methods is just as verifiable as one that does not. This means that&nbsp;anywhere</p><p>self-certifying KERI identifiers are accepted, an identifier’s history can stretch back further than the existence of KERI. Plus, that history can include so-called “portability events”, where an identifier is deactivated on one ledger and re-activated on another. Method-specific features or records might still need to be exported and imported. The core proof of control function of a DID, however, would be universalized in a way that enabled massive portability.</p><p>This same universalizing effect of sharing a security vocabulary across all participating DID methods has the added benefit of being able to guarantee certain security features in any KERI-compliant system. Since KERI also lends itself to simple compliance tests, and since KERI logs give a benchmark against which to test method-specific and blockchain-specific security, this is a small leap for each DID method and a giant leap for standardization and security engineering.</p> KERI’s history: from whitepaper to community incubation <p>So far we have been highly technical in our explanation of the project. A careful reader, however, may already have caught the community commitment implicit in phrases such as “KERI-compliant” and “participating DID methods.” KERI is only useful if the major DID methods incorporate it, or if the set of participating DID methods becomes congruous over time with the set of major DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>It is, in a nutshell, a community project of alignment as much as a technological innovation: an agreement on the security model for the common core functionality shared across all DID methods, allowing much variety and extensibility to be preserved by the participating DID methods. Decentralized identifiers have been very decentralized in their design and governance from the beginning, with a high degree of extensibility and flexibility within the fiefdom of each DID method and its governance. KERI has been gathering steam for over a year as a countervailing force, potentially making all DIDs function in an end-verifiable and thus universal way.</p><blockquote>“Investing in KERI is investing in interoperability, standardization, and cross-community security guarantees.”</blockquote><blockquote>Dr Sam Smith, author of the KERI whitepaper and project&nbsp;lead</blockquote><p>In large part, the roots of KERI lie in debates within the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a>. For years it has been discussing the “shalls” and “mays” that define a W3C-compliant DID method (and thus a DID system). In practical terms, this process specifies what each DID method can and must assume about other DID methods for such a decentralized and open system to make appropriate security guarantees.</p><p>KERI’s creator and the author of its whitepaper is Samuel M Smith PhD., a pioneering technologist in multiple fields, including automated reasoning, distributed systems, autonomous vehicles and blockchain protocol design. Dr. Smith has been refining and experimenting with such a cross-method mechanism since 2019, presenting at every meeting of the biannual Internet Identity Workshop. First came some core principles and requirements of a key infrastructure at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/OffChain_(PKI)_Key_Management_%E2%80%93_Revocation_Rotation">IIW28</a>, then at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI:_1_Universal_DKMI_Root(s)_of_Trust_Decentralized_Systems_Primitires_%26_DKMI_Last_Mile_of_Trust">IIW29</a> a series of sessions about different aspects of a hypothetical system of witnesses that could replicate logs. For <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_(C)_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">IIW30</a>, Dr Smith brought more concrete sessions on finer points and even the roadmapping session that became the DIF working group. Along the way, he has iterated an ever-growing <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">whitepaper</a> describing and explaining all of&nbsp;this.</p><p>Now, however, Dr Smith has moved the project into the DIF under the auspices of its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a> where he sits as co-chair. Asked about the decision, Dr Smith said, “DIF was a natural choice because I wanted the work to happen quickly but in the open, with participation from the greatest number of companies and innovators across various communities.”</p> KERI’s contributors: join&nbsp;us! <p>Foremost among DIF contributors is, of course, Dr Smith, who brings to his KERI design work more than a decade of engineering experience with scale and high-performance systems. Much of this work, focusing largely on AI and streaming/scaling projects, was done through his Python-centric consulting company <a href="http://prosapien.com">Prosapien.com</a>. He has also worked with Consensys, contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/reputage/seedQuest">Seed Quest</a> project among others, soon to be donated to&nbsp;DIF.</p><p>Berlin-based <a href="https://jolocom.io/">Jolocom GmbH</a> has been a major interlocutor in the early development of KERI, since before the creation of the working group at DIF. Jolocom’s Charles Cunningham is the working group’s lead Rust developer, who has written a highly interesting post about mental models of <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/how-keri-tackles-the-problem-of-trust/">How KERI tackles the problem of trust</a> from a developer’s point of view for the Jolocom&nbsp;logbook.</p><p>Representing <a href="https://www.spherity.com">Spherity GmbH are the working group’s lead </a>JavaScript developer and note-taker. Spherity’s founder, Carsten Stöcker, has written a detailed piece for his company’s blog which called KERI “<a href="https://medium.com/spherity/introducing-keri-8f50ed1d8ed7">a more performant ledger for trusted identities</a>.”</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit, has been co-developing on the Rust side as well, working in parallel and providing input on the design considerations. The Human Colossus Foundation has also put substantial energy into promoting and socializing KERI in the Trust-over-IP Foundation, the MyData community and in the Sovrin community, including featuring an hour-long KERI <a href="https://vimeo.com/459348260">session</a> prominently in a half-day <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">mini-conference</a> it organized.</p><p>At IIW31, the KERI developers will be demonstrating their initial work to date while there is still the opportunity to get involved and determine the course of KERI as the project moves from direct mode (two-party) to witness mode (multi-party, distributed consensus). Many sessions are planned for IIW, ranging from introductions to technical discussions to use-case and requirements gathering for KERI-based ideas. Additionally there will be a live demo of the working direct-mode prototype.</p><p>Introductory reading and video materials are collected at the main DIF <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">repository</a>, but even if you don’t watch them in advance (or fully understand them if you do), there are many ways to get involved and make this community project stronger and more&nbsp;diverse.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/keri-for-every-did-a-microledger-f9457fa80d2d">KERI: For every DID, a microledger</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>When the ToIP Foundation launched in May 2020, our mission was to define a new model for achieving trust online—a model that breaks away from the thousands of siloed solutions for secure, privacy-enhancing digital identity and trust that do not work with each other. This lack of interoperability costs billions of dollars per year in complicated and time-consuming integration and hinders adoption by the very customers we are trying to serve.</p>



<p>Our goal is to drive adoption of a new model for digital trust based on open standard digital wallets and digital credentials that are every bit as interoperable as the physical wallets and paper or plastic credentials that we use every day—to do everything from getting on a plane to entering a hospital to signing a mortgage. As these new tools emerge as the primary mechanism for contactless identity verification, payments, and other online transactions, they will become as essential to our digital lives as browsers and email clients have become to the Web today.</p>



<p>As that happens, it is critical to avoid recreating the vendor-lock in and fragmentation of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars</a>” that hindered the early days of the Web. Interoperable solutions that avoid vendor lock-in are paramount for a vibrant digital marketplace where consumers are free to choose their preferred digital wallet software from a variety of vendors and use digital credentials from any issuer as they choose.</p>



<p>The need for market-driven interoperability</p>



<p>Open standards alone do not produce interoperable market solutions—there are too many ways interoperability can still go off the rails. Testing labs are another step in the right direction—but vendors need incentives to use them, and those incentives can be scarce in a new market.</p>



<p>The ToIP Foundation recognized that, as our economy grows increasingly digital and collaboration tools grow steadily more powerful, there is a new path to interoperability: tapping market dynamics to drive incubation and adoption of truly interoperable solutions.</p>



<p>With this approach, vendors and customers voluntarily work together to develop interoperability testing requirements designed to meet explicit customer needs in the market. Vendors then satisfy those requirements by passing these interoperability tests with production-ready software.</p>



<p>Introducing the ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP)</p>



<p>To facilitate this new approach to market-driven interoperability, the Technology Stack Working Group of the ToIP Foundation developed the <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/technical-stack-wg/blob/master/TIP_LIFECYCLE_MANAGEMENT.md">ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP)</a>. A TIP represents a specific combination of technologies that span each of the four layers of the ToIP technology stack in order to meet the requirements of a set of target customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>TIPs can be designed, refined and supported by multiple vendors and customers wishing to collaborate on interoperability. A TIP typically includes the following elements critical to customer success:</p>



  Use cases capturing the specific requirements of customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems.  Design principles that must be clearly defined when combining technology and business policies to formulate a solution architecture.&nbsp;  Documentation that clearly communicates the design, architecture, features, and benefits of a TIP to the digital trust ecosystems targeted for adoption.  Best practices and implementation guidance for adoption of a TIP, including how to incorporate policies from the ToIP governance stack.  Interoperability tests that enable vendors supporting the TIP to be certified for verifiable interoperability.  Adoption metrics and case study references that provide quantifiable evidence of the real market impact.  



<p>TIPs harness market forces to drive convergence on interoperability</p>



<p>Each TIP consists of two types of components:</p>



  Fully-standardized components of the ToIP stack. These components, called ToIP Standard Specifications (TSS), are standards that have already gained Foundation-wide approval.&nbsp;  Custom components that are specific to a TIP. Some places in the ToIP stack do not yet have agreed-upon specifications. For these gaps, a TIP must specify how it fills the gap via an open community specification that can be implemented by any vendor or open source project.  



<p>A conceptual “lego block” picture of a complete four-layer TIP—showing how it is constructed from a combination of standard TSS components and custom TIP-specific components—is shown in the figure below.</p>



  



<p>Launching the Saturn-V TIP</p>



<p>The first TIP published by the ToIP Technology Stack Working Group is named for the historically significant multi-stage rocket platform, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V">Saturn-V</a>. This TIP emerged from work begun at a 2019 Connect-a-Thon event held by the Hyperledger Indy community. When the ToIP Foundation was launched in May 2020, ToIP members including Commerzbank (Main-Incubator), esatus AG, Evernym, IBM, Trinsic and idRamp recognized the opportunity to coalesce their collaboration into a TIP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the ToIP Technology Stack Working Group was formed, it established the criteria for managing the lifecycle of TIP from incubation through design, demonstration, acceptance and adoption. The Saturn-V collaborators then proposed their TIP following this process and it was formally accepted as a Draft Deliverable by the Technology Stack Working Group at their 24 August 2020 meeting.</p>



<p>The next stage: mission-critical collaboration on interoperability testing</p>



<p>All the vendors participating in the Saturn-V TIP actively pair with developers from other participants to work through agreed-upon test plans. Having the Technology Stack Working Group oversee the TIP development life cycle on behalf of all participating vendors ensures a more transparent and robust joint testing project than a typical multi-vendor “plug-fest”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the technologies used for the Saturn-V TIP are Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries at<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack/img/fig-1-toip-full-stack-2020-05-06.png?raw=true"> layers 1-3 of the ToIP Technology Stack</a>, the open source Aries Test suites will be used as the baseline for all test plans. Participating vendors are currently tackling the following stages of the Saturn-V Interop Test Plan One:</p>



  Self-Validation against Aries Protocol Test Suite for Aries Interop Profile v. 1.0  Peer-Validation
 
 Core Aries Interop Profile v. 1.0 (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">Aries RFC 302</a>), which supports DID connections, issuing credentials, and fulfilling proofs 
 Connectionless Proofs using the Service Decorator (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0056-service-decorator">Aries RFC 56</a>), 
 HTTP over DIDComm (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0348-transition-msg-type-to-https">Aries RFC 348</a>). 
 
  



<p>Future missions</p>



<p>Once Test Plan One is complete, TIP Participants will define Saturn-V Interop Test Plan Two which intends to minimally include peer-to-peer validation for:</p>



  Core Aries Interop Profile v. 2.0 (content and scope not yet defined by community)  Out-of-Band Protocol (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0434-outofband">Aries RFC 434</a>)  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">End-to-End testing the Aries Agent Test Harness</a> (contributed by the Government of British Columbia)  



<p>Once these stages of interoperability testing are completed, the Technology Stack Working Group will be able to assess whether component specifications of this TIP meets the criteria to become a TSS. If so, these will be advanced to become their own Draft Deliverables for ultimate approval by the Working Group and then the ToIP Steering Committee.</p>

<p>CoinDesk Webinar: Governance, standards and interoperability – Getting past the roadblocks to peer-to-peer financial transactions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you are eyeing retail or wholesale CBDC opportunities or are looking at digital wallets, loyalty programs or other implementations of token-based transactions, you’ve no doubt realized that the technology infrastructure is just one part of the puzzle. It’s well documented that distributed ledger technologies can deliver on the mechanics of peer-to-peer transactions. The roadblocks are creating an ecosystem with a level of transparency and security that consumers, regulators and companies trust. The closer you move to central banks and fiat currencies, the higher the barriers to buy-in and deployment.</p>



<p>In this panel discussion, taking place Tuesday, October 20, at 11:00 am EDT, experts on three different Hyperledger DLT platforms will address these issues and compare notes about current and future token-based solutions from around the world.

 Lumen — The Year in&nbsp;Review  September 2019-August 2020 <p>By: Adam Holland, Andromeda Yelton, and Chris&nbsp;Bavitz</p> Introduction <p>September 2019 through the end of August 2020 marked the first year in which Lumen operated with a generous supporting grant from the Arcadia Fund. During that year, the project’s primary objectives fell within three themes: (1) technical improvements to the Lumen site and database; (2) expanding research opportunities, both internal and external; and (3) outreach, both to possible new notice-submitters and to the various constituencies of the Lumen user community. This post draws from Lumen’s first annual report to Arcadia and provides an overview of the project’s key activities during the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>To say the least, it was a complex and difficult year on a number of fronts — most notably, because of the COVID-19 pandemic that forced us into a remote work mode for much of 2020. That said, we were able to make significant progress on a number of key&nbsp;fronts:</p>  Lumen’s developers and technical support team achieved a great deal, especially on the backend of the site, and also by adding new user interface features and new notice categories.  Lumen had success increasing and improving external research using Lumen’s database, with database access credentials granted to 49 new researchers or research teams, ranging from college undergraduates and investigative reporters to law professors and economists. Several of these researchers produced substantive written work along with various other shorter articles and&nbsp;pieces.  Regarding outreach, we had conversations with a range of organizations, online service providers and individuals regarding working more closely with Lumen. The Lumen team participated in a multi-stakeholder virtual workshop in June of 2020, with more topic-specific workshops planned.  The onset of the pandemic put a wrench in the works in terms of hiring, but Lumen plans to bring onboard a new research fellow in the coming&nbsp;months.  <p>The remainder of this overview addresses and provides more details on these main themes in the order outlined&nbsp;above.</p> (1) Technical Improvements and&nbsp;Progress <p>In addition to too many small-scale bug fixes and one-off requests to name, the Lumen developers’ activity in the first year fell into several key main categories:</p> Security/anti-obsolescence updates   Lumen upgraded Rails (the web application framework the whole system uses) from version 4.2 to version&nbsp;5.2.  Lumen upgraded Ruby (the programming language in which Lumen’s site and administrative interface is built) from version 2.3 to version&nbsp;2.5.  Lumen upgraded various software libraries.  Lumen is in the process of upgrading its native search function from ElasticSearch version 5 to ElasticSearch version 7, which is expected to significantly improve the ability of researchers and others to access notices in the database.  <p>In combination, these upgrades and improvements improved system security and system performance, making the database notably faster for users. Additionally, the various improvements keep the site effectively modernized, which in turn allows developers to take advantage of and implement further improvements without too much work. Finally, the ongoing ElasticSearch upgrades allow Lumen administrators to more quickly and effectively redact sensitive data in Lumen’s notices (in addition to making site search functionality more powerful for&nbsp;users).</p><p>Overall, these technical improvements make the Lumen site easier to use by and more responsive to both its internal team and the research community. They also serve to “future-proof” the site to the extent possible, making it far more likely that Lumen will be able to continue to exist and thrive indefinitely, and making continued and sustained improvements easier to accomplish.</p> Improvements to the Lumen administrative interface   Lumen updated rails_admin from version 1.4 to version 2. As an example of modernization making more modernization easier and possible, this upgrade was only possible because of the underlying Ruby upgrade mentioned above.  Lumen added a Content Management System (CMS) to the site and migrated all the old blog posts and pages into it. The CMS will also make it much easier for the Lumen team to share out rich multimedia content on the Lumen website and write short pieces more rapidly and effectively. Some recent blog posts made using the CMS include a write-up of Lumen’s <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/lumen-best-practices-event">workshop on best practices in notice and takedown transparency</a>, <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/background-audio-takedowns">“Algorithmic Copyright Management: Background Audio, False Positives and De facto Censorship</a>” and “<a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/plandemic_DMCAs">Pandemic Misinformation Campaign Comes to&nbsp;Lumen.”</a>   Improvements to receiving and sharing notice&nbsp;data   A series of improvements to the Lumen application programming interface (“API”) improved the quality of data that the database is able to accept and process, most notably with respect to URLs submitted. Some URLs are malformed when submitted, and API improvements dramatically reduced the error rate upon submission.  Prompted by a series of distributed denial of service attacks on the Lumen site, Andromeda Yelton, the lead developer for Lumen, spent a great deal of time and effort putting into place, documenting, and continuing to improve on a series of changes and improvements for managing the requests for data that Lumen receives through its API, which represent a potential vulnerability for the site and database. These changes improved Lumen’s data security, made it easier for legitimate researchers to continue to use the site, and helped better allocate site and system resources. Andromeda later gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NvKfTSr7eU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=330">a presentation</a> about her work at Code4Lib.  Lumen added “Counterfeit” and “Placeholder” notice types. Google began accepting takedown notices referencing the presence of counterfeit goods or advertisements for them on Google sites, and in order to accommodate this new notices stream, we created a new template for such notices. Having this new type available also made it possible for the Lumen team to effectively reach out to new possible submitters, including Amazon and eBay. The “placeholder” notice is another new type that allows Lumen to accept more notice streams. Some large OSPs, like Google, receive takedown requests about which they are unable to share the details for legal reasons. Despite this, they still wish to indicate that they have received a request. In those cases, they can point their users to a “placeholder” notice that provides what details are available.   User Interface <p>Lumen made a series of changes regarding how visitors to the site see the URLs that are part of each notice. The changes make it possible for Lumen to present notice URLs in a truncated form to casual Lumen visitors, while still granting access to complete URLs to Lumen accredited researchers. Casual Lumen users can view one notice’s full set of URLs by providing an email address. Researchers with credentials can be granted access to notices within a limited time frame, up to a maximum specific number of notices, and with or without use of the Lumen API, and can also be given the ability to generate “permanent” versions of Lumen notice URLs that are suitable for use in published works or for citation.</p> (2) Research Using the Lumen&nbsp;Database <p>Lumen granted research credentials to forty-nine different researchers during the year in question. These researchers range from college undergraduates who have recently become interested in copyright law or censorship, to international researchers from a wide range of countries, including Brazil, Turkey, Ukraine, France, India, Austria, Russia, Germany, and the UK, as well as EU-affiliated researchers and international NGOs such as the Committee to Protect Journalists, as well as law professors and journalists and others in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>Many of the projects that these researchers are working on are still ongoing, such as Professor Eugene Volokh’s ongoing series of law journal articles about falsified court orders and online defamation law. Some of the completed research projects&nbsp;include:</p>  Asher-Schapiro, Avi, Zidan, Ahmed. “India Uses Opaque Legal Process to Suppress Kashmiri Journalism, Commentary on Twitter,” Committee to Protect Journalists (blog), October 24, 2019, <a href="https://cpj.org/2019/10/india-opaque-legal-process-suppress-kashmir-twitter/.">https://cpj.org/2019/10/india-opaque-legal-process-suppress-kashmir-twitter/.</a>  Fuller, Andrea, Grind, Kirsten, Palazzolo, Joe. “Google Hides News, Tricked by Fake Claims,” Wall Street Journal, May 15, 2020, sec.

Matias, J. N., Mou, M. E., Penney, J., &amp; Klein, M. (2020). Do Automated Legal Threats Reduce Freedom of Expression Online? Preliminary Results from a Natural Experiment. <a href="https://osf.io/nc7e2/">https://osf.io/nc7e2/</a>  <p>There are also many shorter articles online referencing or relying on Lumen, such as <a href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/twitter-barely-replied-indian-information-requests">this one</a>, from the Sunday Guardian Live, or <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/movie-tv-show-database-bombards-google-with-bizarre-takedown-notices-200126/">this one </a>from TorrentFreak.</p><p>Over the summer of 2020, the Lumen team also worked closely with a Harvard Law School student research assistant to begin developing a taxonomy of takedown notices, their underlying data, and the various involved stakeholders. This draft taxonomy seeks to cast light on the range of interests and incentives that a given stakeholder in the notice and takedown (“N&amp;TD”) ecosystem must balance with respect to whether a particular piece of information should come down and the degree to which there should be transparency regarding the request and any subsequent action taken. It is the Lumen team’s hope to soon turn this working draft into a white paper, as well as the raw material for a Lumen workshop, as well as use it to inform discussions on any statement of best practices regarding N&amp;TD transparency.</p> (3) Outreach  Events <p>The Lumen team’s original plan had been to hold a fairly intimate in-person workshop over the course of two days, as a way of initiating conversation between the various parts of Lumen’s user and research communities, and to plant the seed for more detailed and targeted workshops to come. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic got in the way of those plans, and as a result, the June workshop was held virtually. Although the Lumen team members were of course very disappointed to not be able to have the full in-depth workshop we had planned, especially the face-to-face network building and conversations, hosting a virtual event had some positive aspects. These included lower costs and the possibility of drawing more participants. The end result was that we were able to diversify and expand the initial invitee list substantially, including a wider range of interested parties, and — critically — giving the group more international representation. On that note, it meant that some foreign human rights activists who would otherwise not have been able to attend were present — including representatives of EngelliWeb, which has published a human rights report on Turkish takedowns that relies heavily on Lumen. The most recent of EngelliWeb’s reports can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://engelliweb.ifade.org.tr/">here</a>.</p><p>Using the lessons learned from this first virtual event, and anticipating that virtual events will be the norm for the foreseeable future, Lumen has planned a series of smaller and more topically focused events for the coming fall and winter, the first few of which will be focused on learning more from current and prospective Lumen researchers.</p> Outreach to New Sources of Notices and Notice&nbsp;Data <p>Encouraging recipients and senders of takedown notices to share copies of those notices with Lumen has proven to be one of the biggest challenges the team has faced. Although Lumen’s name recognition has clearly improved, due in no small part to the increased publicity from outside journalism and research publications, and although those companies with whom Lumen has existing relationships are generally positive about the benefits of sharing, some institutions are still loathe to share notices and notice data. Finding ways to be more effective at turning preliminary outreach into new data-sharing arrangements will be a top priority for the Lumen team in the coming&nbsp;year.</p> General Outreach and Media Participation <p>In addition to the June 2020 workshop mentioned above, and their ongoing work with Lumen researchers, members of the Lumen team participated in the following activities:</p>  Prompted by the increased attention paid to the Internet Archive after it announced its pandemic-motivated National Emergency Library, Adam Holland wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-internet-archives-new-national-emergency-library-generates-a-range-of-strong-reactions-10afc5d2abf7">Medium piece </a>examining the various points of view on the library, and urging the NEL to share any takedown notices it received with&nbsp;Lumen.  Lumen provided some statistics on Google takedowns to TorrentFreak for an&nbsp;article.  Lumen provided statistics on takedowns to Professor Rebecca Tushnet for her testimony to the<a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/the-digital-millennium-copyright-act-at-22-what-is-it-why-it-was-enacted-and-where-are-we-now"> Senate Judiciary subcommittee on the&nbsp;DMCA</a>.  Lumen Project Manager Adam Holland answered some questions from a cyberlaw professor about Google’s search index and robots.txt pertinent to the way in which the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) operates its publicly-accessible database of FL residents who have been previously convicted of various sex offenses.  As noted above, Andromeda Yelton gave<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NvKfTSr7eU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=330https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NvKfTSr7eU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=330"> a presentation on her work</a> defending Lumen against a Russian botnet to Code4Lib.  Adam spoke with a member of the data team of<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__thecorrespondent.com_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=SnvO2m0td3laYhZMLUgVrywBmVR2OC98yFxqHcbtCUM&amp;m=zxgR2e7-pX4UOhXaaySwWtN_jtXNWaknIZmgNpXreio&amp;s=jK3FtWysUuFhvb0EKv_Xg2232Wm5B2A8mtMF6Ta7gpE&amp;e="> The Correspondent</a>, a newsroom based in Amsterdam.  Adam provided general commentary regarding the DMCA and United States fair use law to Daniel Laufer, a German reporter interested in how a German company, Acromax Media, may be abusing the DMCA to take down critical reporting in Albania, and was <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2020/a-german-company-is-responsible-for-the-deletion-of-videos-critical-of-the-albanian-government/">quoted in the ensuing&nbsp;article.</a>  · Adam spoke to a New York Times reporter to give background information about DMCA takedowns for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/business/omegaverse-erotica-copyright.html">an article about a lawsuit</a> between two self-published Amazon&nbsp;authors.  Adam spoke with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/online-reputation-management-cbs-news-investigation-finds-fraudulent-court-orders-used-to-change-google-search/">CBS News</a> regarding a story about Professor Volokh’s research.  Adam spoke with the San Antonio Express News for a story posted online<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.expressnews.com_news_education_article_Someone-2Dasked-2DGoogle-2Drepeatedly-2Dto-2Dremove-2D14029141.php&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=NGg7VqmEIvldEdox2XBkRg9frrgwzBAfp51eaMWwbDg&amp;m=fku_iY8E4EEg8g4QAEQscLLAnDjbuYdpY0R00vp71YA&amp;s=1UiSarqNrgKzLfz6_DtvmOOzkdCU9H2lthmiVTF4ab0&amp;e=">&nbsp;here</a>.  Additionally, members of the Lumen team provided background information regarding Lumen, the DMCA and notice &amp; takedown generally to inquiries from journalists, activists, legislative staffers, researchers, and other interested parties.  <p>Of special note, on December 16, 2019, Lumen project manager Adam Holland and Lumen PI Chris Bavitz made comments to the Third Meeting of the Stakeholder Dialogue on Art. 17 of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market in Brussels. Article 17 references “”Use of protected content by online content-sharing service providers.”</p><p>The presentation was well-received, and also was a boost to Lumen’s broader publicity. Lumen was invited to join a multi-stakeholder mailing list regarding ongoing Article 17 discussions, in which it continues to participate, and also made several new EU contacts, including a former member to the EU Parliament, who have kept Lumen apprised of opportunities to contribute comments or thoughts to ongoing copyright and intermediary liability-related legislative and regulatory discussions within the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>A copy of the remarks can be found&nbsp;at:</p><p>Bavitz, Chris, Holland,Adam, “Lumen Presents Comments to the Third Meeting of the Stakeholder Dialogue on Art. 17 of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market in Brussels” (December 17, 2019) <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/807">https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/807</a></p><p>A recording of the day’s proceedings is available at:</p><p>“COPYRIGHT STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUES — Streaming Service of the European Commission,” <a href="https://webcast.ec.europa.eu/copyright-stakeholder-dialogues-16-12.">https://webcast.ec.europa.eu/copyright-stakeholder-dialogues-16-12</a>, (accessed October 8,&nbsp;2020)</p><p>Lumen’s participation begins at approximately the 4:00:00&nbsp;mark.</p> Other outreach&nbsp;efforts <p>The Lumen team has also had productive conversations with a variety of other activists and researchers about possible cooperative efforts, including with Carrie Goldberg, an American lawyer specializing in representing victims of so-called “revenge porn”; the “Disinfodex” project emerging from the Berkman Klein Center’s 2019–2020 Assembly Program; the Digital Public Library of America, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Harvard’s Caselaw Access Project, and the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society in&nbsp;Berlin.</p> Social Media Statistics <p>Lumen maintains a Twitter account, from which it tweets or retweets about content moderation, takedowns, censorship, academic freedoms, the “right to be forgotten” and other news related to online information. During the period from September 1, 2019 to August 31,&nbsp;2020:</p>  The account added 986 new followers, a ~25%&nbsp;increase  The engagement rate on Lumen’s tweets and retweets went up each quarter, from 0.9% in the first to 2.0 % in the&nbsp;fourth.  Lumen’s tweets received 1.41 million total impressions, and an average of between 20 and 25 link clicks per&nbsp;day.  Lumen’s top mention in terms of engagements (an order of magnitude greater than typical) was when a CNN reporter mentioned Lumen in a tweet referencing a takedown notice sent regarding Donald Trump’s&nbsp;account.   Data and Material&nbsp;Produced <p>During this year, the Lumen database added ~2.6 million more notices, referencing many millions of URLs, involving approximately fifty-eight thousand separate entities. As mentioned above in the technical improvements sections, we put into place our planned changes for displaying URLs in a truncated form to casual Lumen visitors, while granting access to full notices with complete URLs to researchers requesting access. We were and are gratified to have received relatively few complaints from users regarding the change, and none from active researchers. Current policy is to grant a single request per email address to view a notice. Lumen has consistently averaged approximately one thousand such requests per day, but may revisit and revise the bounds of that policy in the coming&nbsp;year.</p><p>During the time period from September 1, 2019 to September 1, 2020, Lumen received almost six hundred thousand unique visitors, who visited Lumen close to fourteen million times, viewing over nineteen million unique Lumen website pages. These traffic numbers represent an approximately 50% increase in activity from the previous year, which the Lumen team attributes to both more research activity and greater use of the site by the public at&nbsp;large.</p><p>The most visited Lumen URL was <a href="http://lumendatabase.org/notices/9415">http://lumendatabase.org/notices/9415</a>, which is a Google placeholder notice for search results that contain URLs reported as illegal under German youth protection laws. There is no way to be certain as to why this notice is visited often, but it may be that this notice’s popularity is a rough proxy for the number of such removals by Google in Germany and the number of searches the internet-using German public performs for the underlying material. Or, it could be the relative novelty of the new laws is driving interest.

<p>1.What is the mission and vision of Stash?</p>



<p>Our mission is to provide people with the tools and education to help them protect their online accounts. Our vision is a digital world in which people do not reuse any of their passwords across multiple accounts. Ever. <a href="https://stashpass.co/">Stash</a> is bringing this vision to reality by delivering an offline password manager that makes it easy for people to create and securely manage strong, unique passwords for every single account they have. Ultimately, removing the difficulty and frustrations of having to do it on their own.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



 <a href="https://stashpass.co/"></a> 



<p>In the digital age, it is too easy for people to remain anonymous online or claim to be someone they aren’t. In the physical world, we have ways of proving who we are through different identification methods which makes it difficult for someone to fake their identity. As we increasingly go digital, we need a form of digital identity to help people stay secure and limit their risks of being the subject of fraudulent activity.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does Stash address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Simply put, digital identity will make it safer and easier for Canadians to operate online. This will lead to people conducting more business online, nationally and internationally, in ways in which they were not comfortable before.</p>



<p>While it is clear that digital services aid in the efficiencies of businesses and organizations, trusted digital identity has been relegated to a side note by many leaders across numerous sectors in Canada. As digital solutions continue to evolve, access to such services still requires end users to create usernames and passwords – leaving them with hundreds of login credentials to manage.</p>



<p>In the digital world, it has become critical to have strong password management practices. With the ever-increasing amount of online services that require passwords, many are left feeling overwhelmed and frustrated leading them to sacrifice security for convenience. Using a password manager allows people to improve their password security while providing the convenience and peace of mind needed to go about their lives.</p>



<p>Stash Password Manager was created to remove the frustrations of trying to manage unique, complex passwords for all of our digital accounts while ensuring each of your usernames and passwords are securely stored offline and making logging into accounts easy.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada is seen by many global observers as a trustworthy, safe and stable country. Once Canada moves beyond its strategic framework and implements various capacities of digital identification, our reputation will allow us to help influence the rest of the world in adopting a standardized digital identity protocol.</p>



<p>5. Why did Stash join the DIACC?</p>



<p>We believe our patent pending Island Technology™ and our approach to online security can assist in DIACC’s mission to achieve excellence in digital identity.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about Stash?</p>



<p>The simplest way for people to protect their own digital accounts is by having a strong, unique password for every single account they have.</p>



<p>Stash was created because we realized people needed a way, that was both secure and convenient, to easily manage all of the different usernames and passwords they are forced to use in the digital age. We believe the only way to securely manage all of our login credentials (usernames + passwords) and truly keep them safe is to physically store them offline in a way that keeps them disconnected from the internet. This means they should not be managed on any device that is connected to the internet, as those devices can be hacked.</p>



<p>At the heart of Stash is Island Technology™. Island Technology™ creates an air-gapped “island” which allows a user to isolate their data and store it in a secure manner that keeps it disconnected from the internet. Essentially it acts as a dynamic, one way communication bridge that safely transfers data from a disconnected vault to the online world. Although we utilize this technology in transferring login credentials, other companies are now beginning to recognize Island Technology™ for its unique utility in additional use cases.</p>

</p><p>The 8-month Business-oriented Programme offers business and technical support to integrate SSI technology with market propositions and it’s structured in 3 competitive stages (only the best performing projects in each phase are entering the next).</p>
<p>The initial stage, which expanded for the first month, was intended for the teams to work in the Proof of concept of their projects and to start building their business case. They both presented the outcomes of their work during business pitches and technology demonstrations in the online Hackathon which took part on September 16th&nbsp;and 17th. All the 19 projects who took part in this first stage, including those by <a href="https://www.filancore.com/">Filancore</a>, <a href="https://www.wellbeingcart.com/">Wellbeing cart</a>, <a href="https://www.mydata.org/">MyData Global</a> and <a href="https://spherity.com/">Spherity</a>, will receive € 15,000 funding to reward their efforts.</p>
<p>During the second stage, which already is ongoing, the 15 selected teams will work during the next 5 months on their developments to create a mock-up and a Prototype and on their business models and will cooperate among them to create a real ecosystem ensuring interoperability and scalability. Funding linked to the participation in this stage is € 50,000.</p>
<p>Only the best-in-class teams from those will reach the third stage and focus on testing their MVPs and defining Business models to get a final funding of € 41,000.</p>

In this post, we drill down into what “standards” are, and the characteristics of an “open process” for developing standards. Supporting these open standards is where the bulk of DIF’s efforts and resources are focused. In the next post in the series, we will turn to how open source and open standards work together to create new business models and strategies with real-world consequences for cooperation, “coöpetition,” and healthy&nbsp;markets.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jimquenzer">Jim&nbsp;Quenzer</a><p>It is worth noting up front that the term standard has two slightly different usages. One is related to quality assurance or business process compliance — think of marketing that references “the highest standards of _____ ”. This refers to specifications and metrics used to grade outputs in a regulated industry or sector, like “Grade A Beef”. These are set and enforced by some combination of regulators, private-sector auditors and industry associations. Outside of software, this is usually what people refer to by “standardization:” and a specialist in any industry can wax eloquent on the politics and the consequences of decisions by standards bodies fixing those specifications and&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>In software and other IP-driven industries like medicine or engineering, standards have more to do with control and portability of data, enforcing measurable compatibility with the products of others. A common metaphor for this kind of standardization is the width or “gauge” of railway tracks — how far apart the rails are is a somewhat arbitrary decision but if they are different between two countries or regions they will have completely distinct rail systems. Software standards work much the same way, and for this reason standardization is often a prerequisite of procurements from government or substantial investments in the private sector. No one wants to invest in locomotives if all the places they want to take it… use different rails.</p><p>In the software world, as in the world of trains, standards define a given market for products and services. Compliance tests make objective (and far less controversial) the question of whether or not a given product meets a given set of requirements. Explicitly-defined, testable protocols make products provably swappable and/or interoperable. Open standards processes try to define those tests and protocols in the open, with input from initial and future contenders in that market, speeding up the timeline to legitimacy by incorporating major players and incorporating widely-sourced input.</p> Standards processes, as inherited from tangible industries <p>One way to explain standards processes is to begin with some examples in the physical world, which we learned about as matters of fact in our education. These evolved to support the creation of precise manufacturing methods and to support more seamless commerce, giving stability and safety to commodity markets. Weights and measures are classic standards that support for both: after all, there is nothing natural about our units of measure or currencies, as anyone who’s used both metric and non-metric measures knows all too well. How long is something? How heavy is something? How much liquid is in a gallon or&nbsp;liter?</p><p>Standardizing these kinds of measures was a quantum leap for commerce and mercantilism: it gave everyone a common reference point and enabled accounting systems (and “ledgers”) of vastly wider scope and simplicity. The fact that standards have been decided at the international level means it can happen on a global scale. The metric system, for example, is defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, an international standards development organization (<a href="http://unicode.org/faq/sdos.html">SDO</a>). There is little debate in 2020 about what a gram is (it’s the weight of one milli-liter of water), but things like tolerance or accuracy in weighing and marking system is still an ongoing matter of debate and specification carried out&nbsp;there.</p><p>Another physical world standard is the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691170817/the-box">shipping container</a>. A whole global infrastructure has been built around this standard-sized container that allows it to be put on truck beds, shipped on train cars and put in ships that go around the world. It also means if you can fit whatever your thing is inside that box it can get to almost anywhere in the world because there is a standards based infrastructure that can handle it. Massive economies of scale (which have terraformed geopolitics by enabling high-throughput, high-efficiency global trade networks) are unlocked by this kind of standard, which enables the movement of containers (in most cases with no knowledge, or no direct knowledge, of what is inside them) to become a kind of commodity whose price stabilizes and steadies far-flung trade. The analogy to the “packets” or “data points” of modern information technology has been a mainstay of thinking about software business models for decades, and W3C Verifiable Credentials are <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">no exception</a>.</p><p>Similar standards also govern the electricity coming out of the walls in our houses, which has become so reliable and ubiquitous over the last century that few people outside of the relevant industries think much about it, or how dangerous it would be if standards were loosened. The “amount” (load and speed) of electricity, as well as the physical form factor of plugs, wiring, and circuit boards are all standardized at the national or regional level. This creates regional economies of scale in both the delivery of energy as a resource and in the manufacturing of electricity-powered products. Indeed, much of software engineering as an academic discipline and a labor market, as well as many standards around data and their governing standards bodies, evolved out of the electrical and communications infrastructure that preceded the advent of modern software.</p> Standards processes, for bits and&nbsp;bytes <p>Digital technology also needs explicit and testable standards, deliberated by specialists and engineers in a transparent process for the common good and for the stability of huge systems of capital and human effort. As the internet has evolved, the bulk of this effort has focused on the definition of common protocols that allow information to be exchanged by different computer systems, potentially written in very different languages and operating across very different topographies, with very different inputs and automations and governance structures.</p><p>The protocols that make up the modern internet were originally created by the group that began building the ARPA network. In 1986 the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Forcehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">IETF</a>) formed and it is still the steward of many key protocols that form the basis of much of the internet, particularly around security and load-balancing at massive, infrastructure scale. The <a href="http://w3c.org/">Worldwide Web Consortium</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">W3C</a>) was formed in 1994 and works to develop the software standards for the World Wide Web’s core technologies: browsers and&nbsp;servers.</p><p>One example we all use every day is E-mail, or as it was once known, “electronic mail”. How addressing and discovery can work, the limits and parameters of a universally-recognizable address, etc are all written up in authoritative specification documents. Colloquially, these documents are often referred to as “the standard,” or “the RFCs” (“Request[s] for Comment” referring to the collective editorial process by which standards are written). Email is typical, however, in that a patchwork of multiple interlocking protocols are actually required to send and receive&nbsp;emails.</p><p>Although this list of protocols needs to move slowly to give the end-consumer stability and assurance, the list is actually in a state of permanent minor flux, as individual protocols are iterated and upgrades, support for older versions fades away, and now protocols are added that take advantage of security or performance enhancements reaching critical mass elsewhere. For decades, the dominant protocols in email have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)</a>, and underlying handshake/transport protocols like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a>. As you can see clicking any of these links, the “standard” (current best practices and specifications) are compromised of a patchwork of iterating and component specifications with a more narrow scope, allowing for a kind of modular and incremental evolution allowing markets and applications to phase components and subsystems in and out over time without interruptions to service or sudden changes in user experience.</p><p>Another example we use every day is “web standards,” i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>. These protocols are the standards that let any web server present information according to prescriptive formats which will be displayed in roughly the same way by any compliant web browser. Here, as in weights and measures, or electricity, there are always slippages and margins for error, though, as any front-end developer can tell you) This enables a diversity of web servers and a diversity of browsers. There are of course open source examples of each (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">Apache Server </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox Browsers</a> being two examples) but there are also proprietary versions of them as&nbsp;well.</p><p>To many observers, the degree of openness in the codebase matters less than the diversity and complexity of organizations involved in the governance of the protocols: in this regard, control of “browser standards” might be endangered by increasing market power on the part of browser vendors owned by private entities that also have outsized and direct control over operating systems and app store platforms, upon which any competing browser would depend directly. Neither open source nor open standards are a guarantee of a healthy and open market, although both generally contribute to that&nbsp;end.</p> Standards and Proto-standards <p>Standards development is generally a slow process taking years, driven by a balance between (rough) consensus between stakeholders refining and iterating requirements and running code against which these requirements can be measured or considered. Depending on the context, stakeholders can include vendors or commercial actors, regulators, consumer advocacy groups, affected industries, and/or individuals. The terms “running” and “code” both cover a lot of territory, but it would be impossible to arrive at a standard without at least two independent, functioning pieces of code that have been tested, audited, and hardened, ideally by some deployment at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>In some cases, this is where an open standards process begins: two maximally independent implementations decide to cooperate for greater adoption and maturity, and seek out a venue for the relevant stakeholders to debate the merits and trade-offs of their current codebases and future variations or possibilities. Different standards bodies can be more or less public in their processes, more or less transparent in their results, and more or less complex in their rules of engagement: indeed, some operate according to a rulebook as complex as that of a parliament, and a style guide as exacting as an academic institution.</p><p>For the most open of standards, however, it is possible to work in the open, deliberatively and transparently, long before this “first” step. Working in an industry group, trade association, or other neutral venue can speed up the work towards a standards by front-loading the collaboration, peer-review, market-testing, and process legitimacy needed to get an idea ready for the market and standardization sooner. These “pre-standards” venues are like containers where all those participating have signed an IPR agreement up front that means their work is unencumbered by patents or royalties and safe from being front-run or patent-trolled.</p><p>The products of these pre-standards processes are often called “pre-standard specifications” or “proto-standards” (if they are more ambitious and protocol-shaped). Groups that develop proto-standards often have explicitly-defined processes for how to publish a proto-standard, as well as when and how to hand off a sufficiently matured proto-standard to an SDO process for more formal and authoritative standardization.</p><p>We should not overstate the distinction between standards and pre-standards, however: there are many shares of grey in between. “Standards-track” and “non-standards-track” specifications alike can be more mature or legitimate depending on the parties involved, the pertinent SDOs (or lack thereof), and of course the process used to create them. For this reason, work items and working groups at the DIF avail themselves of multiple procedural options and tailor their processes to the context, which is why “scoping” and “chartering” processes can take months to hammer out between organizations and their legal departments. This is also specifications developed at DIF without being further hardened in a more formal standards body can sometimes be called “standards,” in the sense that they are adopted in the industry and function as standards. How the market and the relevant industries treat, and trust, and rely on a specification is the ultimate judge of when it can be called the authoritative text for a standard process or procedure!</p><p>In our next drill-down, we’ll go into more detail on DIF’s processes, how you can get involved, and what decisions go into assuming an active role in a working group or work&nbsp;item.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495">Drilling down: Open Standards</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>SBI Sumishin Net Bank is an Internet-focused bank jointly established in 2007 by SBI Holdings and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. In keeping with their aim to be recognized for innovation, the bank deployed FIDO Authentication in July 2020. We had an interview with the bank about the details of their deployment.</p>



<p>Q. Describe your service and how it’s using FIDO Authentication.</p>



<p>We have incorporated&nbsp; FIDO-compliant authentication into our&nbsp; existing “SBI Sumishin Net Bank” mobile application. Now, a single application is available to provide both banking and authentication functions to our customers. This eliminates the need for our customers to enter passwords and verification codes for each transaction. Instead, they can simply log in to the SBI Sumishin Net Bank App with biometric authentication. Even when transactions are made from a PC or other non-mobile application environments, the application will confirm and approve the transaction details before they are executed, preventing unauthorized transfers. Furthermore, when using the login approval function, only the registered smartphone can remove any control, which prevents unauthorized logins.</p>



<p>Q. What FIDO specification(s) did you implement?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have deployed a solution based on FIDO UAF, which uses biometrics (fingerprint and facial recognition) and PIN as the authentication methods.</p>



<p>Q. What other approaches did you consider before choosing FIDO?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We looked at continuing with the existing smartphone application “Smart Authentication,” which is a separate application the customer would have to authenticate logins and bank transactions. However, we saw it as difficult to operate two applications separately and saw it as a burden for our customers to have to use two separate applications just to bank with us.</p>



<p>Q. Why did you choose FIDO authentication over other options? What did you identify as advantages of implementing FIDO?</p>



<p>Although there are various types of authentication methods available, the fact that FIDO Authentication is a global standard developed by a global consortium FIDO Alliance, and that we have seen is increasingly being deployed in Japan and globally – were two factors that made it very appealing to us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q. Why did you decide on a standards-based approach?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two main reasons why we chose to take a FIDO standards-based approach.</p>



<p>First, FIDO Authentication provides stronger security. FIDO Authentication enables safe exchange of authentication results over the network, and the credential is stored only on the device that performs the authentication (in our case, the smartphone) and does not need to be transmitted over the network or stored on the server side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, FIDO improves convenience for our customers. By incorporating authentication into our existing banking app, we are making it possible to complete both banking and authentication functions in a single app, enabling smooth transactions without having to enter passwords or other information.</p>



<p>Q. What steps were involved in your roll out of FIDO Authentication? Did you work with a partner?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We implemented the FIDO-compliant “SaAT Pokepass Authentication Service” provided by Net Move Corporation (“Net Move”), a wholly owned subsidiary of SBI Sumishin Net Bank. The new authentication function “Smart Authentication NEO” was deployed by incorporating the client SDK for this service into the bank application.</p>



<p>Q. What other data points can you share that show the impact FIDO authentication has had?</p>



<p>On July 31, 2020, we launched a new authentication feature, “Smart Authentication NEO.” On the quantitative side, the number of new registered customers has reached approximately 100,000 in just three weeks since its launch, and we expect this number to increase further in the future.</p>



<p>On the qualitative side, many customers have commented on the convenience of being able to use a single app for both banking and authentication functions.</p>



<p>Q. What advice would you give to other organizations considering rolling out FIDO authentication?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, our company’s FIDO authentication uses Net Move’s “SaAT Pokepass Authentication Service.” By collaborating with Net Move, we were able to deployed the new authentication function “Smart Authentication NEO” in a short period of time.</p>



<p>In addition to FIDO authentication, Net Move already has an installed at more than 100 financial institutions, including “SaAT Netizen,” an anti-fraudulent remittance service, and we believe that Net Move can help to solve these issues.</p>



<p>Q. What role do you see FIDO Authentication playing for your company in the future?</p>



<p>The “Smart Authentication” service will be discontinued after January 2021, and we will move exclusively to the FIDO-enabled “Smart Authentication Neo” app. We see moving to the FIDO-enabled app&nbsp; as the key authentication function will further allow us to provide secure and convenient experiences for our customers.</p>



<p>Q. If you are able, please provide a quote from an executive regarding this deployment and the impact FIDO has had for your organization.</p>



<p>Quote from the project manager of SBI Sumishin Net Bank:</p>



<p>“Our goal is to revolutionize financial services and make society more comfortable and convenient by utilizing the most advanced technology with a customer-centric approach. Security is an extremely important factor in achieving this goal, and we believe that the introduction of FIDO will make a significant contribution.”</p>

<p>Webinar: Optimizing supplier onboarding assessment processes through SSI</p>



<p>In this presentation, Luigi Riva, head of product for Swisscom Blockchain, will show a solution for supplier assessment and onboarding. This process can be optimized using Self-Sovereign Identity capabilities. In the course of supplier assessment processes, suppliers need to disclose their audits, policies and operative processes, so that their customers are capable to analyze and assess the supplier risk through a validation of the supplier compliance data. Through the standardization of supplier onboarding processes and using SSI, the Swisscom solution allows suppliers to transport data and their customers can easily validate and trust the authenticity of it.</p>



<p>Tune on Wednesday, October 14, at 10:00 am EDT. For more information and to register, go <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/event/hyperledger-member-webinar-optimizing-supplier-onboarding-assessment-processes-through-ssi-swisscom">here</a>.</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of the Digital Technology Supercluster?</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU0HuZLGSuU&amp;feature=youtu.be">Digital Technology Supercluster </a>solves some of industry’s and society’s biggest problems through Canadian-made technologies. We bring together private and public sector organizations of all sizes to address challenges facing Canada’s economic sectors including healthcare, natural resources, manufacturing and transportation. Through this ‘collaborative innovation’ the Supercluster helps to drive solutions better than any single organization could on its own.</p>



 <a href="https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/"></a> 



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets? </p>



<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic, now more than ever we are relying on our ability to prove our identity and key personal information remotely. Over the past six months, we have worked with dozens of organizations to develop and deploy cutting-edge digital and virtual health platforms. A critical requirement to ensure uptake of these developments is ensuring that Canadians feel they are in control of their personal data and have trust in the institutions and protocols we have created.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does the Digital Technology Supercluster address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>For the Digital Technology Supercluster, we see digital identity as a key component in the adoption of our many innovative technologies – whether it’s accessing remote addiction and mental health treatment for health care workers, or receiving post-surgical treatment from home. Without secure digital identity, Canada will be unable to continue developing innovative solutions like these. As a team, we strive to collaborate with companies (large and small), organizations and academic institutions to ensure that we are addressing digital security from all sides. Ensuring privacy and control of personal information is at the heart of what we do, and organizations like DIACC provide critical guidance on this front.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>Canada is already seen as a leader in the global economy. We are known for our transparency, ethical business practices and diverse resources. This foundation puts us on solid ground for not only contributing to the policy of digital identity, but alongside DIACC, leading the way on international interoperability in this space.</p>



<p>5. Why did the Digital Technology Supercluster join the DIACC?</p>



<p>We believe there is power in coming together towards a common goal, and that there is strength in bringing different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds to the table. To reach Canada’s full potential, it is critical that we leverage our diversity and unique strengths to share knowledge and expertise.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about the Digital Technology Supercluster?</p>



<p>While we are located in Vancouver, British Columbia, our members span across the country, with 40 per cent of our 750+ membership in provinces outside of British Columbia. We are open to working with all types of organizations. By facilitating bold collaboration, we bring together companies of all sizes from a myriad of sectors within the tech ecosystem and tech-enabled companies from a variety of industries. This allows these organizations to tap into a network of knowledge and experience they would not otherwise have had access to.</p>

<p>The rise of blockchain</p>



<p>Blockchain is already a reality in the Telecommunication, Media and Entertainment (TME) industry. In fact, many companies, both established and start-ups, have implemented blockchain-based solutions to automize, digitize and re-invent some of their processes.</p>



<p>Like other industries, TME is characterized by the lack of visibility, transparency and auditability of some of its processes, making asset transactions less efficient, thus generating both extra costs and revenue leakage. In telecommunication, a good example of such a process is wholesale voice settlements. Carriers around the world exchange large amounts of money for interconnection costs, but there are no industry standards to ensure consistency and transparency. Each report is subject to dispute and reconciliation. In the media industry, we all know how difficult it is for artists and music labels to track the revenues that are due to them from streaming and video platforms.</p>



<p>Hyperledger helps in bringing efficiency to TME operations</p>



<p>The stakeholders in the TME industry are pioneers in the application of blockchain to solve some of the critical industry issues. In particular, they recognize that a platform designed for the enterprise like Hyperledger Fabric provides tangible value-adds such as&nbsp; privacy, transparency, trust and security. Leveraging these key characteristics, telco and media companies have started building consortia and projects to validate the value of the technology. These consortia can be categorized into three categories: operations-focused, customer experience and full revenue generating ecosystems.</p>



<p>In the first category, companies collaborate to improve back end processes that take place between them, with the goal of eliminating redundant costs and activities. This helps improve productivity and efficiency in the value chain. In a nutshell, this is an efficiency play. Some processes touch all players in the industry. Examples include roaming settlements for telecommunications or digital advertising supply chains for the media industry. (Recently, <a href="https://www.syniverse.com/blog/blockchain/universal-commerce/">Syniverse and IBM</a> went live with the first blockchain-based roaming solution compliant with the new GSMA billing standard.) Alternatively, some processes may interest only a major player and its closest suppliers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reinventing customer experience with Hyperledger&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second category, customer experience-focused consortia, revolves around improving the engagement of the customer rather than the efficiency of the processes. The main financial goal is not cost cutting but revenue generation, either through new services or new business models.</p>



<p>In this context, the sky is the limit: use cases are several and very different. When the goal is to provide a better customer experience, Hyperledger technologies can be used to improve customer engagement and make client-facing activities easier and less redundant. For example: IBM uses Hyperledger Fabric to simplify the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DSNdLDOZ5w&amp;t=4s">dispute resolution process</a> for commercial financing. Fabric is also used to automatically enforce warranties or reduce the time needed to port your mobile number from one carrier to another, thus improving the customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other side, blockchain can be used to create new services for telecommunication and media companies. For decades, telcos have harbored an ambition to get into the mobile payment business. Now, with blockchain, they have an easy and secure way to implement digital wallets, create tokens and exchange them in their own network or with other networks. The same can apply to the gaming industry, where the concept of credits and digital token has been popular in the last few years but was hard to monetize.</p>



<p>Carriers can also now provide digital identity services. Blockchain is the ideal platform for creating a trusted identity, and carriers are in the perfect position to enable subscribers with digital identity and to develop an ecosystem of applications. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/identity">IBM’s Verify Credentials</a> creates a decentralized approach to identity management – enabled by blockchain – building on top of open standards in combination with Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and other standards groups</p>



<p>Hyperledger Fabric is the foundation of new industry ecosystems</p>



<p>Finally, the third category, the ecosystems, comprises consortia that cover the entire industry. Consortia turn into ecosystems over time, when an initial application becomes an industry-wide platform, setting the standards for the whole industry and allowing for flexible, modular and open participation, in a “network of networks” fashion. The founder of the ecosystem can extract high value from the platform and become a winner.</p>



<p>The application of Hyperledger Fabric in the TME industry has not achieved the level of maturity necessary for the establishment of a real ecosystem, but a few companies and industry organizations are already laying the foundations for the future ecosystems.</p>



<p>There are several organizations that are creating consortia and implementing blockchain networks.</p>



 
 Companies that interact frequently are getting together to form small groups of three&nbsp; or four participants to streamline existing processes. They can either be telecom carriers that need to facilitate settlements among themselves or music streaming services that want to remunerate music labels faster and more accurately. 
 Regulators are playing a big role: in India, the local telecom regulatory agency (TRAI) mandated the use of blockchain to prevent unsolicited commercial communication. Indian mobile subscribers can opt out of telemarketing calls and a blockchain distributed ledger will manage this information for carriers, content providers and the regulators.&nbsp; IBM is working with <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/respite-from-pesky-calls-messages-airtel-awards-pan-india-blockchain-deal-to-ibm/69445537">TRAI and Bharti Airtel</a> on the commercial deployment that will initially help the operator curb unwanted calls and messages from advertisers. It will also help the operator in Mobile Number Portability, interconnect settlements, supply chain streamlining and content partner settlement. 
 The European Union, through the Horizon 2020 fund, is financing several blockchain projects to improve the way information and infrastructure is shared within telecom companies. 
 Service providers are very active organizations that are leveraging their neutrality to build industry-wide ecosystems. They can be either established platform providers that already serve the majority of their market or new start-ups trying to disrupt the competition. In the first case, service providers are improving their value proposition through blockchain. In the second case, start-ups are rethinking the way the industry works. 
 Finally, industry standard organizations are gathering their members to define how blockchain can transform their industry. This is happening both in telco and media. In telco, organizations such as the GSMA, TWI GLF and the Bridge Alliance are advocating for blockchain with the goal of establishing common standards for the most immediate blockchain use cases (e.g., wholesale and roaming settlements). In the media space, AdLedger is leveraging blockchain to re-shape the digital advertising industry. 
 



<p>2020 is going to be a KEY year for blockchain in the TME industry: we are going to see the outcome of the work done in the last couple years and the move to production of many consortia.</p>

<p>Kantara to Provide Its NIST SP 800-63-3 Conformity Assessment For Identity Proofing &amp; Authentication</p>
<p>WAKEFIELD, Mass., USA – October 7, 2020 — <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> announced today that the United States General Services Administration (GSA) is joining Kantara and plans to put its Login.gov service through the Kantara assurance and approval program based on third-party assessment against the requirements detailed in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines.</p>
<p>“NIST SP 800-63-3 is focused on modernizing the policy in keeping with rising threat levels for identity proofing, verification and authentication whilst also improving privacy in the overall digital user experience,” said Colin Wallis, Executive Director, Kantara Initiative.&nbsp; “Kantara has developed assessment criteria against each of 63-3’s normative requirements to drive consistency in assessments of applicable credential service providers (CSPs) done by Kantara 3rd party accredited assessors. Consistency in assessments drives long term integrity in Kantara’s Trust Framework and Trust Marks internationally, thereby building trust and confidence for all stakeholders in the wider digital economy.”</p>
<p>With the GSA’s oversight, Login.gov provides simple, secure, private access to participating US government digital services online.&nbsp; A single privacy-aware login.gov account can sign-in to multiple government agencies making managing federal benefits, services and applications easier and more secure for the public. Login.gov is used by over 60 applications at 17 agencies including the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy and the Executive Office of the President. To date, over 25 million people have signed up to use login.gov.</p>
<p>Kantara is one of the leading global consortiums improving trustworthy use of identity and personal data through innovation, standardization and good practice. It <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/800-63-3/">provides third party assessment against the NIST SP 800-63-3 for identity proofing and authentication</a>. US Government agencies are required to follow NIST guidelines and independent, external assessment is acknowledged as best practice to demonstrate NIST standards compliance.</p>
<p>Kantara was authorized as a US Government Trust Framework provider to the GSA’s then FICAM Trust Framework Solutions (TFS) program in 2011 and works with governments and standards-bodies internationally to align its Trust Mark program for multi-jurisdictional adoption. Kantara is one of the premier Trust Framework Providers aligned with the US National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC) program as well as similar initiatives outside the US.</p>
<p>NIST SP 800-63-3</p>
<p>NIST SP 800-63-3 is the set of prevailing digital identity guidelines to which US Federal agencies implementing identity verification and authentication must comply. It also serves as a widely-recognized benchmark for any organization or business wishing to implement identity verification and authentication services, both internationally as well as within the US.</p>
<p>About Kantara Initiative Trust Framework</p>
<p>Kantara Initiative’s Trust Framework Operations and Identity Assurance program is the industry leading program that&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/idassurance/assessor-accreditation/">accredits Assessors </a>and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/idassurance/service-provider-approval/">approves Credential Service Providers</a> (CSPs).&nbsp; The program offers three Classes of Approval that enable CSPs to seek approval of their Identity and Credential Management Services as meeting NIST 800-63 rev.3 requirements. By design, Kantara’s IAF can be applied to a range of standards-derived schemes and classes of approval to verify an organization’s conformance, including NIST SP 800-63-3.</p>

<p>Back to our Developer Showcase Series to learn what developers in the real world are doing with Hyperledger technologies. Next up is Sushma Varadaiah from <a href="https://coding-bootcamps.com/">Coding Bootcamps</a>.</p>



<p>What advice would you offer other technologists or developers interested in getting started working on blockchain?</p>



<p>I personally feel that it’s the right time to get into blockchain as it holds a lot of potential in the very near future. Blockchain will be the way that we are going to establish trust and transparency in the world as we move forward. Along with other technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things, the use of blockchain multiply.</p>



<p>Give a bit of background on what you’re working on, and let us know what was it that made you want to get into blockchain?</p>



<p>I have 6+ years of experience as a software developer. I am currently working on blockchain systems (Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric). I got into blockchain because I studied cryptography and security while getting a Master degree in Computer Science and Information Security. It was easy for me to pick up blockchain’s underlying technologies because of my Master’s studies. I recognized the technology’s potential and got into blockchain.</p>



<p>What project in Hyperledger are you working on? Any new developments to share? Can you sum up your experience with Hyperledger?</p>



<p>I am working on Hyperledger Fabric. My journey with Hyperledger Fabric started when I got my first blockchain certification from the Linux Foundation followed by a Master’s degree certification in blockchain from International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore. I have developed Hyperledger Fabric Proofs of Concept for a range of use cases including&nbsp; pharmaceutical drug supply chain, certificate verification and property registration network. You can find source code for all these in my GitHub page.</p>



<p>What are the main differences between teaching Hyperledger to students and developing Hyperledger applications?</p>



<p>While teaching at <a href="https://coding-bootcamps.com/">Coding Bootcamps</a>, the main challenge is to explain blockchain concepts to a student who is new to the technology. Troubleshooting the issues that are faced by students who are learning to develop blockchain applications is a very rewarding feeling. On the other hand, developing Hyperledger applications for a business involves different complexities like deploying and scaling the application according to user growth.</p>



<p>What do you think is most important for Hyperledger to focus on in the next year?</p>



<p>Devtools for easy smart contract development and deployment.</p>



<p>As Hyperledger’s incubated projects start maturing and hit 1.0s and beyond, what are the most interesting technologies, apps, or use cases coming out as a result from your perspective?</p>



<p>I personally feel Hyperledger Fabric has a lot of potential to bring transparency to supply chain management use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s the one issue or problem you hope blockchain can solve?</p>



<p>Increasing transparency and trust among users.</p>



<p>Where do you hope to see Hyperledger and/or blockchain in five years?</p>



<p>I hope to see applications moving towards decentralization and industry maturing towards adoption of blockchain with other technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things.</p>



<p>What is the best piece of developer advice you’ve ever received?</p>



<p>Never stop learning.</p>



<p>What technology could you not live without?</p>

<p>A crash-course in the complex world of variously-open software licensing</p><p>The ostensibly binary distinction between “open” and “closed” software gets bandied about in many contexts, often in a dangerously simplified form, as though there were only two, mutually-exclusive options. It can also be extended to standards in an imprecise or oversimplified way. Sometimes people refer to groups like DIF “working on open-source standards,” but speaking precise, no such thing&nbsp;exists!</p><p>Only software code can be open-source, since after all, “source” is short for “source code” (pre-compiled software). Standards, whether open or not, are not code — instead, they are functional definitions and specifications that define and specify protocols that one application (or code base) uses to talk to another (or code base). Each standard can be understood as a benchmark for testing specific implementations, dividing existing and future codebases into those fully, partly, or non-compliant with its requirements.</p>“Lean Startup workshop” in Amsterdam, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@epicantus">Daria Nepriakhina</a><p>Code, whether open-source or not, can implement or “build to” a pre-existing standard, which can be developed in a variously open or closed manner; there is no inherent link or dependency between the openness or rigor of the two processes. Similarly, a standard can be “written around” one or more existing implementations, in such a way that the existing code is definitively compliant with the resulting standard tailored to it. This latter operation is an important function in open-source communities, in that it invites future developers to make new code that will be interchangeable or interoperable with that precedent. Even if that pre-existing code is closed, the resulting standard can be of great use to open-source development, particularly if the process used to write it was also “open” and participated in by the designers and implementers of that closed-source precedent.</p><p>In this series of three brief explanatory posts, we’ll first explain open-source development as a process rather than defining it by its results. In the next post, we will explain the characteristics and optionalities of an “open process” for developing standards. Supporting these open standards is where the bulk of DIF’s efforts and resources are focused. Lastly, we will turn to how open source and open standards work together to create new business models and strategies with real-world consequences for cooperation, “coöpetition,” and healthy&nbsp;markets.</p> Source Code and Intellectual Property&nbsp;Law <p>At their lowest level, computers are just machines that exercise millions of structured computations every second. They take inputs, perform computation, and produce&nbsp;outputs.</p>(public domain)<p>These computations can be combined into complex structures of data and decision-making called “programs” that interface with humans to make useful and meaningful outputs. At the lowest level, these computations still look like oceans of 1s and 0s to the untrained eye, but decades of refinement of operating systems, programming languages, scripting languages, and other abstractions make it easy for engineers to deal only with “source code” as a kind of human-readable abstraction at higher levels. This is “compiled” into more efficient, machine-readable “binaries” (ones and zeros) that can be deployed to standardized hardware in the real world where it is “run” (live software is often referred to as “runtime”).</p>by <a href="https://scs.senecac.on.ca/~chris.szalwinski">Chris Szalwinski</a> from <a href="https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~btp100/pages/content/compi.html">The C Program</a> is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/ca/">Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Canada&nbsp;License</a>.<p>Because it is human-readable and because licenses apply to compiled binaries and functional software in specific jurisdictions, the software industry has largely applied practices analogous to academic “peer review” for sharing and critiquing core pieces of source code. This complicates the open/closed distinction further, since a closed-source project and a licensed binary might still offer key components up for review through github or other channels traditionally used for open development. Furthermore, the many gradients between complete “open” or “closed” software depends on the ownership and licensing of a given piece of software, which can evolve over time or differ in its enforceability across jurisdictions. Like all legal matters, mileage may vary and always consult a licensed&nbsp;expert!</p> A thumbnail history of licensing <p>There is a range of different licensing regimes for source code. Among open-source licenses, different functions can be enabled or facilitated independently of one another: external review, attribution, innovation, maintenance, and even revenue-sharing and other conditions on business practices.</p><p>Proprietary code bases are released under closed-source licenses, which are optimized for secrecy, exclusivity, and/or sale of the results through licensing-based revenue models. For decades, this was how Microsoft licensed not only its proprietary stand-alone software, but even the bulk of the Windows operating system. The licensing landscape is much more diverse today, but before the 1990s very little commercial software was developed in the open or had its source code published after the&nbsp;fact.</p><p>The culture of academia is one of sharing and publishing intellectual work for peers to see and review — open peer-review is as central in academic computer science as it is in the hard sciences. The internet was originally imagined, architected, prototyped, and built by academics, and tinkerers, primarily supported by military and government funding. These three cultures (the military, academia, and independent “hacker”/tinkerer types) formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet_Galaxy">basis of internet culture</a>. A fourth culture was added later when the general public’s access to the internet evolved into a massive commercial industry in the early&nbsp;1990s.</p><p>For our purposes here, we can limit ourselves to the fairly direct link, sometimes biographical, between the anomalous, non-commercial origins of the internet and the development of the open-source movement within the software industry. One “origin myth” that exemplifies this link is the story of a young Richard Stallman, then working in an early Artificial Intelligence lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who wanted to customize some printer software for an expensive new printer shared across all the floors of a busy research building. To do so, he needed to get the source code from the manufacturer, which he had done to customize the previous “workhorse” printer in the same building.</p><p>The manufacturer of the new model, however, surprised Stallman by refusing to hand over the code on grounds of licensing and intellectual property rights. Stallman, to whom the motto “software wants to be free” is often misattributed, often <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823">credits the incident</a> for his deeply-held belief that the end-users of software have a right to modify and participate in the software they use, whether they paid directly for it or benefited from the procurements of governments. To this day, the details and boundaries of this right are still being debated, not only in open-source requirements for government procurements, but also in “right to repair” laws that extend these rights into the domain of hardware and the physical (and 3D-printed) world.</p> Varying degrees of “Software Freedom” <p>Stallman went on to found the Free Software Foundation and play a pivotal role in the elaboration of an open-source (and “free open source”) movement. He also created the first GNU Public Licence (GPL), still a major and influential family of licenses. All versions of the GPL have within them some version of these 4 essential “freedoms”:</p><blockquote>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (“freedom 0”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (“freedom 1”). Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (“freedom 2”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (“freedom 3”). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><p>Honoring these four freedoms textually and fully can make it very hard to sell software commercially for many reasons, salient among them that freely-available source code in a major language is trivial to compile into functioning binaries; commercial or “closed” software is generally sold as compiled binaries, keeping the source code&nbsp;secret.</p><p>Furthermore, many early open-source licenses like GPL explicitly forbid so-called “enclosure” of the code, i.e., incorporating pieces or subsets of the licensed code into a new, close-source product. Anti-enclosure licensing is often referred to as “copyleft” (because it prohibits future copyrighting!) or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license">viral</a> licensing,” since it cannot be mixed and matched with other licensing without overriding more restrictive licensing. This severely limits commercial potential of “forks” or derived variants. The entire Linux family of operating systems are licensed this way, which keeps Linux development squarely in the camp of maximally-open development throughout.</p><p>Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, the open-source movement grew and at some point the software industry could not afford to ignore it, even if directly participating with licenses like GPL was not feasible for most companies of any size. This period saw the first “compromise-licenses” and hybrid open/closed business-models evolve around them. Many of the licenses still popular today date to these early experiments. For instance, the license originally created for the University of California, Berkeley’s fork of Unix, and still known today as the Berkeley Software Development (BSD) license, is one such “commercially lenient” open-source licenses. These licenses allow developers to take code that was originally open, make significant changes to modified versions of it, and license or even sell those under more classically commercial licenses.</p><p>Similarly, more lenient variants of the Apache and MIT licenses date to this period as well. It is worth noting that Apache web servers were one of the first open-source pieces of software that replaced a dominant commercial product. Apache web server software reaching a dominant position in the previously closed-license, commercial niche was a watershed moment for open-source software.</p><p>Apache is often held up, alongside Linux, as an example of where open-source software optimizes for standardization and safety of mission-critical infrastructure, largely due to the thorough and ongoing auditing and maintenance enabled by its core components being completely open to review, testing, and improvement proposals. Conversely, however, some historians of software development point out that allowing enclosure to the degree that Apache licenses do can lead to simultaneous or “parallel” development of various (partially closed-source) forks to evolve in tandem according to various divergent business agendas. Over time, this can splinter development, wicking off talent, attention, and manpower into closed development and creating a major coordination problem for the open-source “parent” of the family tree. In the most severe cases, this can greatly diminish and forfeit the standardization and security gains that made sharing an open-source parent so desirable in the first&nbsp;place.</p> Today and&nbsp;Tomorrow <p>Today, cloud-based business models and Software-as-a-Service have revived and expanded the toolkit for closed-source development, and in turn breathed new life into the debate about how hybrid models could make open-source infrastructure sustainable by revenue shares from closed-source products that depend on it. Similarly, the so called “cloud loophole” in older GPL licenses, whereby software could be run but not “distributed,” was closed by the newer <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">Affero GPL</a> that applies to cloud environments.</p><p>Another interesting frontier in the evolving licensing landscape is being opened up in recent years by distributing computing and distributed ledgers. One key assumption of traditional licensing is that software runs on a finite set of distinct pieces of hardware, with ownership and liability that follow straightforwardly from there. Distributed computing, however, where computation work is spread out over a more diffuse and indeterminate numbers of computers, which might have limited or no insight into the “big picture” of the software they are running, muddy the waters even further than traditional cloud environment. On the radically open side of the spectrum, the distributed-computing ecosystem project HoloChain has innovated the <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/understanding-the-cryptographic-autonomy-license-172ac920966d">Cryptographic Autonomy Licence </a>to empower users (and the software running in their name) by protecting them with encryption.</p><p>New forms of “confidential computing” and encrypted, self-sovereign networking take this even further, making the boundaries of software and runtime environments similarly porous. Attempts at licensing for these new topographies have been <a href="https://sdtimes.com/os/osi-co-founder-leaves-initiative-over-new-license/">controversial</a> at times, but they are also an important precedent and context for work happening in the DIF, such as that of the Secure Data Storage <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working&nbsp;group</a>.</p><p>There are even more radical experiments and movements happening in the open-licensing problem space, which would restrict usage not [only] according to commercial terms or enclosure, but according to non-monetary and non-licensing rubrics as well. For instance, the “ICE breaker” <a href="https://icebreaker.dev">project </a>has brought more attention to the movement to license software according to so-called “<a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/licenses/">ethical licenses</a>.” These restrict derivative use anywhere it can be proven to support of human rights violations, such as in military applications or for “predictive policing” and other use-cases that run afoul of international authorities on human rights and discrimination. The provisions or triggers for such licensing might be as hard to enforce as international human rights law (i.e., very hard), but it sends a signal that specifications and standards from other disciplines such as human rights law and ethical philosophy might someday find their place among the commercial and attribution clauses in open-source licenses.</p> Further reading <p>All code developed under the DIF umbrella is strictly open source, and while DIF accepts donations of previously-closed source code, it is expected that all ongoing iterations of them will take place in the open. The original vision for DIF as a project within the <a href="https://www.jointdevelopment.org/about1.html">Joint Development Foundation</a> was to host code development, and it has since expanded to include co-developed pre-standards specifications and other educational and non-technical <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/education/home">materials</a> as well. Take a spin through our github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/">repositories</a> if you’d like to see an overview of historical and ongoing projects.</p><p>In this quick overview, we have only scratched the surface, though, and we encourage anyone working in the open software space to educate themselves further. The Open Source Initiative <a href="https://opensource.org/trademark-guidelines#Usage_That_Does_Not_Require_Permission">holds the trademark </a>on the phrase “open source” and maintains a very helpful list of licenses that it has decided are fully conformant with its principles. The <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/category">list of approved licenses</a> that they maintain is a great place to start if you are researching the licensing landscape, and they also hold <a href="https://opensource.org/events">events</a> and offer a substantial offering of <a href="https://opensource.org/osi-open-source-education">educational materials</a>.</p><p>In our next installment, we’ll turn to Open Standards and the work of the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76">Drilling down: Open Source</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome to the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/03/27/weekend-update-a-weekly-look-at-remote-blockchain-learning-resources">Weekend Update</a>. Our goal with this weekly post is to share quick updates about online education, networking and collaboration opportunities and resources for the open source enterprise blockchain community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have suggestions for resources or events that we should spotlight in a future Weekend Update, let us know <a href="https://twitter.com/Hyperledger">here</a> using #HLWeekendUpdate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Webinar: Tackling Scalability and Moving into Production</p>



<p>While DLTs are no longer a mystery to most enterprises, we still have not yet figured out how to build and scale production grade projects. It is easy to build a POC, but moving to the real world with real customers is a whole different issue. Moreover, the young age of the DLT space shows in lack of tooling. In this webinar, experts from Simbachain will explain how to use SIMBA, a smart contract as a service and blockchain innovation platform to rapidly design, build and scale production DLT applications using Hyperledger Fabric. The centerpiece of the presentation will be a live demo.</p>



<p>Tune on Wednesday, October 7, at 10:00 am EDT. For more information and to register, go <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/event/hyperledger-member-webinar-tackling-scalability-and-moving-into-production-simbachain">here</a>.</p>

<p>Bringing emerging privacy-preserving technology to a public health&nbsp;crisis</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya Young</a>, Identity Woman, Co-Founder of the Internet Identity Workshop; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucyyang1122/">Lucy Yang</a>, Co-Chair of the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</p>Photo from&nbsp;Unsplash<p>We submitted this position statement to the “<a href="https://fpf.org/event/privacy-pandemics-responsible-uses-of-technology-and-health-data-during-times-of-crisis-an-international-tech-and-data-conference/">Privacy &amp; Pandemics Workshop: Responsible Uses of Technology and Health Data During Times of Crisis — An International Tech and Data Conference</a>” by the Future of Privacy Forum. The aim is to, from two participants’ point of view, share an abbreviated case study of CCI and to highlight key challenges that arose in our efforts to responsibly use new privacy-preserving technologies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We wanted to share our submission with the CCI community and the public in the hope to invite some further discussions.</p><p>So what is this emerging technology that is just coming to market with very early adopters and innovators leading the way (including the US government, the government of British Columbia, etc.)? It is called Verifiable Credentials (VC or VCs), <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">a data format standard developed </a>and published <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">by the W3C</a> last year. It is a universal data format for one entity (person, organization or thing) to assert something about another entity. The issuer packages up the credential and cryptographically signs it to seal the data it contains. It passes this to the subject, or holder, so that the subject can share it with the receiver of the credential, the verifier. At that point, the receiver is able to use cryptography to check the seal and the validity of the issuer. VCs are privacy-preserving because the issuer (identity provider) and verifier (relying party) do not form a technical/federated link with each other. The information does not pass directly.</p><p>This technology gives people the ability to collect and manage digital credentials — similar to the cards we find in our physical wallets — in digital wallets. These digital credentials act like paper credentials because individuals do not need to have the verifier directly connect to the issuer. Why is this new? Until now, to have provable information exchanged online, the issuer and verifier would need to directly “federate” to exchange information about the data&nbsp;subject.</p><p>Immunology is a complex science, but simplified basics about how it works with some viruses are known. It was based on these simple understandings that possibilities for how VCs might be used by people and institutions to better manage risk began to be explored. One obvious use case was the ability to issue VCs that reflect some type of COVID-19 status, a proof that&nbsp;one:</p>  Tests positive for antibodies and therefore not infected/or vulnerable to being infected.  Has recently tested negative and therefore the risk of being infected is low and that one could go to work, travel or visit a facility with vulnerable populations.  Has received a vaccine for COVID-19 and therefore safe to travel or access a large in-person event.  <p>Some of these use cases as articulated are not new (e.g. the Yellow Card); it’s just new to digitize them. It makes sense to consider how this simple paper-based technology can be updated to digital. However, the mild hysteria raised about doing things today done on paper via digital means that concerns were triggered without fully understanding or exploring how to use the technology. Some individuals were so concerned that they <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/resignation-at-identity-initiative-raises-doubts-about-immunity-passes">resigned</a> from organizations whose leadership <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/safracenterforethicswhitepaper8_01.pdf">floated these&nbsp;ideas</a>.</p><p>COVID-19 status is currently shared in two forms: 1) with the patient via a phone call or text message from the doctor or testing site or 2) in a patient medical record. Neither of these solutions provides a clear way for the subject to prove results to an entity that wants to know this information (e.g. an airline). VCs offer a new innovative format that provides people with information about their COVID-19 status that is under their control and verifiable by a relying&nbsp;party.</p><p>The VC approach is in strong contrast to the <a href="https://commonpass.splashthat.com/">CommonPass</a> effort, led by a Rockefeller-Foundation-backed nonprofit, that co-arose in the same time frame. The leadership at CommonPass is connected to the conventional medical records world and proposed the creation of a global system where patient medical records in some yet-to-be-determined way would be shared with a centralized decision engine that CommonPass would run globally. They held several global meetings with hundreds of people, including government leaders attending to build momentum for their proposed solution. There are also scores of siloed proprietary solutions popping up to solve these data-sharing challenges. For example, <a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-health-screening-digital-id-48f5ee5b-05c4-4b5e-8fda-4d2f59b946b0.html">CLEAR is offering</a> a biometric data sharing solution. In a public health crisis, these non-interoperable solutions are only good when only one of them is widely adopted, which doesn’t seem to be the&nbsp;case.</p><p>The community that formed around CCI was mostly made up of small, early-stage startups who were already implementing VCs for other use cases and decided to collaborate on exploring COVID-19 use cases. This makeup of the community means that it is not connected to global elites, governments, health departments or healthcare institutions. One exception to this is a startup that had political connections and worked with a California State Legislator to have the bill <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004">AB2004</a> proposed, which opened up a committee to study the use of VCs for COVID-19 medical test results. The bill just passed the Senate and is now waiting to be signed by the governor to become a law. However, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has repeatedly voiced its opposition <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/no-california-bill-verified-credentials-covid-19-test-results">[1]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/california-tell-your-senators-ill-conceived-immunity-passports-wont-help-us">[2]</a>.</p><p>CCI has struggled to “raise voice” and be “heard” by the powers that make decisions. The experience of this group raises questions:</p>  How can emerging technology be “seen” by actors (governments, public health officials, airlines, workplaces) in the marketplace looking for solutions? Which technologists are listened to by policymakers? How are these actors making decisions about the claims these technologists are&nbsp;making?  How can networks of potential issuers of COVID-19 status credentials be spun up in such a way that the credentials issued are seen as valid by verifiers (airlines, etc.)? This set of challenges around the technology are not technical as much as they are about process and accountability systems.  How can existing norms of information sharing about people that are paper-based today be translated into a digital form in ways that make themselves and those concerned about human rights implications comfortable with the technical deployment?  How can a new privacy-preserving technology based on open standards be used for public health crises or any other time-sensitive occasions when its deployment and adoption require a lot of coordination, collaboration and communication? How can these things be facilitated by funders seeking to make a difference?  <p>We hope to hear your thoughts on the raised questions.</p>

 Zeenab Aneez &amp; Neha&nbsp;Mujumdar  Session <p>It was media theorist Marshall McLuhan who popularised the phrase ‘the medium is the message’; to him, different kinds of media engage the senses in different ways, affecting how we process it and engage with its contents. Before situating research in the digital space, it is important to ask ourselves: what is the nature of the medium are we dealing with here? How do people interact with it? What are the opportunities it provides and the risks it poses? How can we study new digital objects, such as online-first news outlets, podcasts, etc in a way that recognises the medium’s&nbsp;newness?</p><p>The proposed session is an exploration of a methodology that is informed and defined by specific characteristics of the medium, with a special focus on digital news and journalism in India. Through this, it seeks to tackle the first of the four key focus areas of the conference: How do we conceptualise, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India?</p><p>Keeping this key question in mind, we ask: how can digital methods research contribute to the study of news and journalism in the digital space? How can we use digital objects such as tags, Likes, and Comments to understand how user feedback works in the new information economy? What can the interface of a news creation platform tell us about the changing roles of Indian journalists in today’s media environment? How can we formulate a methodology for studying the metamorphosis of a news story by using Twitter and what skills are required to gather and process information for research of this&nbsp;nature?</p><p>In order to inform our responses to such questions, we borrow from Richard Rogers’ adage ‘Follow the medium’ (Rogers 2013), which argues that “natively digital”(Ibid. 19) objects like tags, links, Likes or Comments, which originate in digital networks, cannot be fully understood with methods, such as, say content analysis; an example of a non-digital method that does not recognise its digital nature. The proposed session will make use of the general philosophy embodied by Rogers’ approach and urge participants to acknowledge the specific properties of the Internet as a medium and look at news and journalism as part of the larger media ecology of the web. This calls for the use of new methods that are digital in nature; the discussion on contemporary news should expand from how the news industry is coping with the digital transition, to how we can better understand the specific elements of this transition and use this understanding to reflect upon the changing nature of journalism and news&nbsp;itself.</p><p>In order to channel the discussion, the session proposes using the framework from one particular field of digital research: platform studies. With the advent of Web 2.0 and the emergence of the ‘web as platform’ (O’Reilly 2007) and the strengthening relationship between the news industry and social media platforms(‘Reuters Institute Digital News Report’ 2015), traditional as well as digital-born news sites are increasingly adopting a platform model. Therefore, platform studies makes for a fitting framework within which to understand the workings of these platforms, their technological and formal structures, and the specific ways in which they allow users to interact with news&nbsp;content.</p> Plan <p>The session will begin with a brief introduction to digital methods (Rogers 2013) and the field of ‘platform studies’ (Bogost and Montfort 2009; Gillespie 2010; Dijck 2013), which will serve as a loose framework through which to study existing news platforms as well as perform analyses on social media platforms as sites for news and journalism. This will be supplemented by the works of Anne Helmond (2015) and Tarleton Gillespie (2010).</p><p>Following this, participants will be divided into groups of four-six, with each group anchored by a volunteer, with added support from the two co-leaders. They will then be given the task of formulating a research question that makes use of one or more of the digital methods presented and are also required to frame a methodology that makes allowances for the particularities of the Indian news environment. The session will conclude with a brief discussion based on their findings.</p><p>The goal of the workshop will be to explore how digital methods can be aligned with current concerns about news and journalism in India, and open up avenues for research that acknowledges that online news occupies a space that includes natively digital objects and information architectures and hence demands research methods specific to this environment. The workshop also aims at reflecting on potential collaborations between researchers in media studies, data scientists and technologists in developing a comprehensive methodology using which to study digital media in&nbsp;India.</p> Readings <p>Gillespie, Tarleton. “The Politics of ‘Platforms’.” New Media &amp; Society 12, no. 3 (2010):&nbsp;347–364.</p><p>Rogers, Richard. “The End of the Virtual: Digital Methods,” Digital Methods.

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of ModoHR?</p>



<p>ModoHR is a Canadian technology-driven business that provides modern solutions for the human resources industry. Our web application, <a href="https://www.screeningcanada.ca/product">ScreeningCanada™</a> was developed with the goal to empower Canadian organizations to remotely conduct background screening and digital identity verification. We help set the standard for Canadian privacy, compliance and data security; these unwavering principles provide Canadian organizations with compliant products and services that mitigate risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



 <a href="https://modohr.com/"></a> 



<p>Simply put, digital identity is the foundation of background screening. Without a candidate’s consent and identity verification, compliant and thorough background screening cannot take place. In addition, the emerging markets like on-demand delivery services and ride-sharing have further highlighted the need for speed in the background screening industry. We strongly believe that a trusted digital identity solution is critical in removing these obstacles and improving remote hiring.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does ModoHR address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identity will transform the Canadian and global economy by removing geographical barriers for individual job applicants. ModoHR is pioneering new identity verification solutions in the marketplace with tools that utilize credit file-based verification, live video verification and facial accreditation. Existing background screening processes have traditionally required face-to-face interaction with the hiring manager, or an in-person verification conducted by an authorized third party like Canada Post. ModoHR’s digital identity solutions remove barriers that previously existed for remote hiring. The process is compliant with federal and provincial physical distancing recommendations and approved by police services. This transformation will empower Canadians and organizations to increase diversity and inclusion by removing traditional remote hiring barriers.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>There is no question that Canada possesses the necessary knowledge and capabilities to be a leader in digital identity. Our national approach to privacy and compliance and the value we place on protecting personal information across all industries, is highly regarded around the world. In the coming months and years, Canadian provinces will need to work together to centralize, standardize and unilaterally protect personal information, and develop methods to securely utilize this information to verify identity.</p>



<p>Our competitors in this space are already operating on the global stage; Canada must move quickly to share resources, seek federal support and ensure that our sovereign interests will not be negatively influenced by the standards set by other nations. More importantly, we need to lead this charge to develop processes and platforms that are truly Canadian.</p>



<p>5. Why did ModoHR join the DIACC?</p>



<p>ModoHR Technologies joined DIACC to share our knowledge and experience relating to the important topic of digital identity, compliance, risk mitigation and global regulatory challenges.&nbsp; We believe that together, Canadian organizations can not only improve processes for Canadians but remain at the cutting edge of policy development globally. We look forward to networking and sharing knowledge with other DIACC members.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about ModoHR?</p>



<p>ModoHR is owned by background screening and risk mitigation industry experts. Our executive team founded the pre-employment industry in Canada 20 years ago and built the largest risk mitigation firm in Canada. These subject matter experts came together to collaborate, re-imagine and empower Human Resources with technology that ensures privacy, security and streamlines processes for organizations and individuals alike. Our drive and enthusiasm is reflected in every new risk mitigation product or service that we create. In summary – we build what’s next™.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We sat down with CYNAM Director, Madeline Howard, to find out what makes this ‘woman in identity’ tick….</p>
  
 Question 1: What do you do and what gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m delighted to wear a few different hats! My day job is the Socio-Technical Engagement Manager at Cygenta, where I work on the human side of cyber security. I particularly focus on awareness, behaviour and cultural change. I love my field of work as I constantly feel as though I’m making a positive difference to help people and organisations to live more secure lives.</p>
<p>Cygenta also supports me as an <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/industry-100-introduction">i100 for the National Cyber Security Center</a> and their CyberFirst Schools programme. I dedicate one day a week to this – and I absolutely LOVE this part of my job.</p>
<p>Here, I get to work with amazing international, national and local companies to inspire, excite and enthuse the next generation about computer science and cyber security. It’s so rewarding to make a difference to the futures of young people while also supporting the industry talent pipeline.</p>
<p>Finally in my spare time, I’m a Director of Cyber Cheltenham, CyNam. It is a real privilege to be a Director of the UK’s largest cyber cluster and support the development of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>So what gets me out of bed in the morning? Well I’m passionate about making a positive difference. Whether that is in improving organisations and individuals cyber security awareness, exciting the next generation about their future opportunities or developing the incredible cyber security ecosystem we have, I always want to make a positive impact.</p>
 Question 2: How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>It was not exactly a ‘traditional’ route! I studied Geography at Newcastle University and really didn’t know what I wanted to do. Well that’s a lie, I knew my dream job was to be a weather girl… still true! When I finished university, I started in a role within cyber security working in business development. In months I knew I’d found my niche! I loved the pace at which this sector moves and it’s great to be constantly learning about how we engage with technology.</p>
<p>I was keen to pursue a career, raising awareness about cyber security. At Cygenta, I am extremely lucky enough to work for – and be mentored by – Dr Jessica Barker. One thing I recognise is that I’ve always been really lucky to have lots of fantastic people to turn to for advice and guidance and support when I’ve had to make tough decisions during my career.</p>
 Question 3: What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The biggest lesson I’ve learned is to go with your gut, ALWAYS.</p>
<p>I’ve had lots of great opportunities but I nearly turned down some of these simply because I over-thought things. Sometimes things can feel like a risk but if it feels right in your gut it normally is . And, if it doesn’t work out, you’ll still have learned so much simply by learning to take a risk – it’ll all help to shape the future you.</p>
 Question 4: What’s your advice to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>STOP: Thinking that your employees are your ‘human firewall’ against cyber attacks and incidents. The human firewall suggests your employees should prevent attacks and incidents. When it comes to cyber attacks, you can’t prevent every incident, and so this is a totally unrealistic ask on individuals. It also doesn’t prepare people for what to do when something does go wrong.</p>
<p>START: Developing individuals as ‘Human Sensors’. The concept of human sensors suggests that individuals know how to detect and respond to incidents. They understand the indicators of compromise and feel empowered to approach the correct individuals or platforms to report incidents. This ultimately minimises the fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) they may have when they think an incident has occurred.</p>
<p>CONTINUE: Investing in cyber security – not just the technology but talent development and people skills. Ensure your employees feel confident and empowered to positively engage with cyber security to improve your response and resilience capabilities.</p>
 Question 5: In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>In all aspects of life, diversity is the enabler for growth, innovation, collaboration and positive change.</p>
 Question 6: What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p><a href="https://thegogiver.com/">“The Go-Giver”</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It really resonated with me. In short, it suggests we shouldn’t do things because we expect something in return but because we just want to help. It is a fantastic ethos to live by – it’ll empower you to become the best version of yourself!</p>
 Question 7: What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Care less about what people think of you.</p>
<p>It’s not ‘uncool’ to want to achieve.</p>
<p>Go with your gut and everything will work out.</p>
<p>And, finally, accept that you can’t be in control of everything.</p>
<p>I tell myself everyday ‘I wonder if the stars will align?’. If something works out, the stars have aligned. I don’t know anything about the stars but sometimes when things work out, it’s nice to visualise the stars aligning and shining for you.</p>
 Question 8: Where can we find you on social media / the Web?

<p>Since 1980, the United States has suffered more than 250 extreme weather disasters causing more than $1 billion damage each. Every time a natural catastrophe strikes, state regulators quickly ask insurance carriers to send them data about the affected properties. This data helps regulators model risk, monitor market activity, protect consumers, and plan for future emergencies.</p>



<p>These ad-hoc reports come on top of routine quarterly and annual statistics that insurance carriers must provide to regulators. But the reporting process was flawed. Insurers could barely keep up with the requests for data, in various formats and often with short deadlines, coming in from 50 different state regulators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a national, not-for-profit member association that gathers, aggregates and anonymizes data from its property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurance industry members to inform legislative policy, Chicago-based American Association of Insurance Services (AAIS) saw the reporting problems first hand. In fact, everyone in the industry saw the need for a more resilient and efficient resource: a system that would yield data to inform policymakers and also help carriers operate efficiently and the platform to compete and innovate in the marketplace.</p>



<p>AAIS invited carriers and regulators to brainstorm a solution they could build and deploy to address the industry’s data problem. As discussions progressed, the group raised the idea of using blockchain. And, to address the cost concerns, using open source software. By starting with an existing open source framework, AAIS wouldn’t have to code a blockchain platform from scratch. The team could get on with building the higher-level components and interfaces for their system, which they named the Open Insurance Data Link (openIDL).</p>



<p>That led to the choice of Hyperledger Fabric. After AAIS picked a blockchain platform, it needed a development partner with all the skills and resources to bring openIDL to life. The team decided to partner with IBM because of the organization’s track record with Hyperledger Fabric and their expert team. With shared philosophies that included design thinking and agile development, AAIS and IBM developed and tested a prototype in record time. With the first prototype, they were able to test five million records in less than 90 days.</p>



<p>In 2018, openIDL went into production as the first blockchain network connecting data across the American insurance industry. Insurers have the option to manage their own node or use the multi-tenant environment managed by AAIS. And, to help insurers spin up their own nodes, IBM created openIDL in a Box: a managed service offering everything an insurer needs to join the blockchain network.</p>



<p>Hyperledger worked with AAIS to document key steps in engaging stakeholders in planning openIDL and building a network that ensures data privacy for insurers and reporting for regulators. Read the full <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/openidl-case-study">case study here</a> for more on the design process, solution architecture and next steps for openIDL.</p>

The addresses take the form of a long, opaque “string” (a long block of letters and numbers, in this case of a fixed length), and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID “documents”</a> that get returned when they are queried contain some cryptographic key material and, depending on the particularities of the returning system, maybe a few other pieces of information or addresses.</p><p>Identity systems have traditionally been largely hierarchical, focusing on asymmetrical or vertical relationships. The most open system that allows horizontal communications between users in different systems is email, and even there, user-to-user communications are mediated by servers, which banlist each other based on a federated reputation system. DIDCommunications (DIDComm), on the other hand, is a set of tools to allow horizontal (or at least, power-neutral) and bidirectional channels of communication between two entities that know each other’s DIDs and nothing else. It resembles today’s end-to-end encryption systems like Signal, Telegram, and Whatsapp more than it resembles traditional email.</p> How DIDComm&nbsp;works <p>DIDComm is a cross-community standard that creates libraries and design patterns for two or more DID-controlling entities from diverse DID-based systems to communicate directly with one another. It creates a secure communication channel between software controlled by each of these entities, which can be people, organizations or things. This constitutes an “authenticated channel,” in that control of a given DID’s private keys is, barring a failure of design or operational security, proof of authenticity of the party represented by that&nbsp;DID.</p><p>This architecture is powerful because it provides a way to do mutual authentication between any two parties. Right now many systems of messaging and communication on the open web don’t provide for mutual authentication with cryptography; they ask individuals to authenticate to sites or businesses (nowadays mostly with single-sign on integrations, i.e. “log in with your XXX account” buttons), and these businesses vouch for and secure the end-user. In exchange, businesses get valuable insight into the communications or commercial activity they facilitate — insights they often sell to third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Furthermore, while the onus is on individuals to authenticate themselves to these enabling institutions and middlemen, the business themselves do little to authenticate themselves reciprocally. Over time, the “lock icon” next to URLs in modern browsers has come to be a useful norm (and users have been habituated to reacting suspiciously to any website which cannot provide on). However, phishing attacks, where intercepted or falsified communications lead users to malicious websites impersonating ones they trust, continue to be a major attack vector for fraud and identity theft. By supporting mutual authentication, a more uniform and democratic protocol is established for secure communications, which raises the bar for user expectations for security assurances from institutions and websites.</p> A Quick History of DIDComm and the Aries Protocols <p>DIDComm was first developed within an international and collaborative open source co-development project called <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a> (hosted at <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger</a>) and under a IPR regime <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs#about">designed to cover</a> software but not specifications. Aries was spun out of the earlier Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> project, to both iterate, expand, and make more blockchain-agnostic the codebase and tooling created earlier for the identity blockchain Indy. In the same process, Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Ursa</a> was also created to advance the underlying cryptographic elements independently of the blockchain and the identity systems relying on it. The Indy project continues evolving as well, from a single blockchain to a family of <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=36734079">interoperable</a> ones.</p><p>The name “DIDComm” and version 1 of its libraries and designs evolved in this context: it adapted the Indy-specific horizontal communications libraries to a more agnostic Aries context and iterated them to be more configurable for new contexts and implementations. At some point, however, it became clear that further interoperability would be best served not by writing specifications based on existing Aries implementations, but by a more “green-field”, specification-first design process with interlocutors from further afield. This work came to be co-sponsored by DIF and Hyperledger partly to engage these outside interlocutors, and partly because the IPR protections of DIF were more appropriate to a specification-first open-standards process. The charter of the DIDComm working group at DIF&nbsp;.</p>Source: CHAPI101/DIDComm101 <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI)_and_DIDComm">joint session</a> at&nbsp;#<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW30</a> The Future of&nbsp;DIDComm <p>Since the chartering process began in September of 2019 at the post-IIW DIF Face to Face, the work of designing a new core for DIDComm and thinking through new features and structure has proceeded at a steady clip. The implementations and details are still being hammered out in some places, but the feature set is stable. The benefits of the new protocol will&nbsp;include:</p>  Mutual authentication  Robust, email-like threading support for relying messaging systems (including error-handling and other machine-readable messaging systems)  Support for new security and transport primitives like the <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">JWM&nbsp;envelope</a>  Asynchronous by default, but with synchronous communication modes also supported  Offline support so that two agents who are not online can exchange information via bluetooth or QR&nbsp;Code  Easy to support with a web server (among many other topographies)  Many of the positive qualities of the earlier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/soap12/">SOAP</a> protocol, include message format standards, routing, transport agnostic support, and subprotocols.  <p>This effort has the direct support and participation of many core members of the Aries community. It is within the plans of the Aries community to migrate to DIDComm V2 as it becomes ready for use and tested. In both existing DIDComms (many of which are already in production), protocols relying on a DIDComm-encrypted channel for authentication or communications functions will be moved over. The relationship between DIDComm and these relying “subprotocols” is quite similar to the relationship between HTTP and the APIs created on top of HTTP — an upgrade to the underlying security or feature set will not affect the relying applications that just need a secure&nbsp;channel.</p><p>There is <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/111">some consternation</a> about the use of the term “DIDComm Protocols” to describe the various different types of exchange or transactions that could be built on a DIDComm foundation. Regardless of whether one chooses to call them “protocols” or something else, a cross-community standard will be crucial to co-developing broadly interoperable capabilities and common libraries on the basis of secure, authenticated DIDComm channels. Some examples of what these would&nbsp;include:</p>  Secure user messaging or even chat-like instant messaging  Issuing a credential  Presenting a credential or an identity&nbsp;proof  Interactions with IOT systems or even directly with specific, authenticated devices  Payment coordination   Getting involved <p>A good place to jump in would be this video recorded by DIDComm WG Chair Sam Curren at the June DIF Face-to-face meeting:</p><p>With this background, a read through the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_DIDcomm_WG_Charter_v1.pdf">charter</a>, the mailing list <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/didcomm-wg/topics">archives</a>, the github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/DIDComm-js">repository</a>, or the Slack channel of the DIDComm <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">working group</a> at DIF will make a lot more sense; as will DIDComm sessions at the new IIW and F2F meetings.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/understanding-didcomm-14da547ca36b">Understanding DIDComm</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Whether, why, and how to attend the biannual conference along with&nbsp;DIF</p><p>The <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com">Internet Identity Workshop</a> is an interactive “un-conference” that has convened various kinds of researchers, identity technology companies, and thinkers since 2005. It brings together a wide swath of people working towards great control of the digital representations of themselves, incorporating theoretical, market-building, research, and policy-oriented projects. This coming month, the 31st edition will be held entirely only on the Qiqochat platform, like the 30th edition before&nbsp;it.</p> The Storied History of&nbsp;IIW <p>Kaliya Young, Doc Searls and Phil Windley founded the conference in 2005. At the time, all three were active in a group known as “the Identity Gang”. They had been discussing identity technology concepts in detail on a mailing list since meeting each other at Digital Identity World in the fall of 2004; after a year of passionate discussions, there came a point where an in-person meeting felt necessary. The first meeting was in Berkeley, California, and ever since it has been hosted at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. It has moved online-only since the Covid-19 pandemic began in early&nbsp;2020.</p><p>In 2005, many in the community were blogging and writing about identity and related themes. Some had made broad and widely acclaimed pronouncements like Kim Cameron, most known in this regard for his essay, <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">The Seven Laws of Identity.</a> One early collaboration within the community was a <a href="http://wiki.idcommons.net/Lexicon">Lexicon</a> that has aged well. Many were also writing code and founding projects to realize their various visions. At the first IIW, eight different projects gave structured presentations on the first day, while the second day was devoted to a more open-ended and collaborative synthesis, facilitated by Kaliya Young using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space Technology</a>.</p><p>At that first event, several of the projects focused on using URLs as identifiers for individuals, who could authenticate against these as they moved around the early Web 2.0, commenting on different sites. Conversations at the event were formative on the OpenID protocols and the OpenID Foundation. Since then, many different protocols have been conceived and/or nested at the conference, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, <a href="http://www.simplecloud.info/">SCIM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_card">Information Cards</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Resource_Identifier">XRI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDI">XDI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebFinger">Web Finger</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_(protocol)">Salmon</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSub">PubSubHubbub</a>, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>The event attracts people from all over the world and continues to be the “biggest tent” for collaboration and ideation across the various user-centric identity spheres and communities, particularly for what is now called “decentralized identity” or “self-sovereign identity”. You can see the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">book of proceedings</a> from most of the IIWs for the last 15 years, refined and edited in the month after each organic and <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/engagement-guidelines/">self-organizing</a> event.</p> The Decentralized Identity Foundation at&nbsp;IIW <p>IIW has always been a neutral venue where diverse groups across the community focused on the decentralized identity, that often work in parallel between IIWs, come together to report out and understand each other’s projects. Furthermore, many attendees come from established sectors of the software industry, such as Enterprise Identity and Access Management (EIAM), Cybersecurity, or Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). This creates a healthy mix of specialists, professionals, activists, and novices, balancing the “bikeshedding” of technology specifics with societal conversations and industry-wide trends and roadmaps. The open culture of DIF and its commitment to integrations with today’s identity technologies thrive in this environment, and many key DIF collaborations have begun or successfully recruited new participants at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>Anyone who attends from any of the myriad organizations in the space can put agenda/discussion topics forward, which also makes it a very generative place for researchers, innovators, and market-watchers. Many of the DIF working groups present their latest work at the event for technical or business review, and it is a key venue for soliciting insightful feedback from related organizations and industry stakeholders. Sometimes projects in early stages of development, specification, or scoping even do requirements gathering or technical sanity-checks at the&nbsp;event.</p><p>Historically, the DIF has hosted a one-day face-to-face meeting immediately before or after the IIW conference proper to take advantage of the geographic co-location of so many key players. This time around, however, DIF is experimenting with a more spaced-out approach to allow for a period of processing of the IIW sessions to allow for a more complementary role 5 or 6 weeks after the fact. Stay tuned for more details about design or development sprints to take place bookended by the two&nbsp;events.</p> Hot Topics across #IIW30 and&nbsp;#IIW31 <p>At the last IIW, DIF working groups put forward these sessions:</p>  The internal governance group shared its new <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Code_of_Conduct_-_at_DIF">Code of Conduct </a>and the <a href="https://identity.foundation/open-groups/glossary.html">Glossary Group</a> also gave a presentation on its <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/finding-the-bell-curve-of-meaning-61a1d22b7bdd">methodology</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Glossary_Results_-_Credentials,_Wallets,_Agents_Defined._%2B_Next_Steps">results</a>  There were four different sessions presenting and gathering feedback on four different aspects <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/%22KERI_(A)_Key_Event_Receipt_Infrastructure._A_ledger_agnostic_framework_for_decentralized_identity._KERI_unifies_many_DID_methods_types.">of</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_-Part_B_Key_Event_Reciept_Infrastructure.A_ledger_agnostic_framework_for_decentralized_identity._KERI_unifies_many_DID_methods_types.">the</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_(C)_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">KERI&nbsp;</a><a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_Implementation:_Whats_Next_DID:UNI_Method._Ref_Imp._DIF_Project.">project</a>.  Similarly, there were multiple presentations on the BBS+ signature suite at the heart of both the Aries <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/BBS%2B_JSON-LD_ZKPs_and_Aries_%26_Indy._Your_Thoughts%3F">AnonCreds2</a> system for verifiable presentations and a novel <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD_using_BBS%2B_-_Round_2">JSON-LD-based system</a>, development of which continues to be lead by Mattr&nbsp;Global.  The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm</a> WG gave a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/DIDComm_WG_Progress_Update">progress report</a>, which was particularly important to many stakeholders in the Aries community not involved in the autonomous research &amp; development project. A separate session was held on the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/JSON_Web_Messaging_(JWM):_What_are_they_and_why_are_they_useful_for_secure_messaging_sytems%3F">JSON Web Messaging (JWM)</a> proposal that the DIDComm WG submitted to the&nbsp;IETF.  Similarly, there was a well-attended joint progress report on the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Sidetree_Protocol_/_Element_DID_and_Friends">SideTree Protocol / Element DID and Friends</a>&nbsp;, as well as an update from the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/TxAuth_and_XYZ_(and_Maybe_someday_OAuth_3)">XYZ project</a> to iterate the OAuth protocol.  A breakthrough <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI)_and_DIDComm">panel</a> (which was recorded — see previous link) explored the potential interaction or combination of the complementary browser-based CHAPI communications/transport protocol and the more browser-independent work of the DIDComm&nbsp;WG  Frameworks and ecosystem maps were presented by the new Trust-over-IP foundation, the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Understanding_MyData_Operators_-_white_paper_published_today">Operators</a> <a href="https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/Understanding-Mydata-Operators-pages.pdf">project</a> of MyData Global; certification programs were announced and outlined by the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Intro_to_the_Me2B_Alliance_Testing_Specification">Me2B Alliance</a> and the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ID2020_Certification:_feedback_and_next_steps">ID2020</a>&nbsp;project.  For a more detailed overview of highlights, see Juan Caballero’s <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/lessons-from-the-internet-identity-workshop-2020-89a4915c4658">detailed recap</a> for the <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">company blog</a> of DIF member organization, Spherity&nbsp;GmbH  For the complete, edited notes from all sessions, see the <a href="https://github.com/windley/IIW_homepage/raw/gh-pages/assets/proceedings/IIW_30_Book_of_Proceedings.pdf">Proceedings Book</a> (sponsored by DIF member organization, Jolocom&nbsp;GmbH)   Heading into the 31st IIW, we can expect significant interest and attendance at sessions on these&nbsp;topics:   A progress report on the alignment of the browser-native Presentation Exchange DIF specification and the relevant Aries RFCs and libraries  Moving KERI from prototype to actual implementations (and integrations!), as well as Drummond Reed’s less-technical introduction entitled “KERI for Mere&nbsp;Mortals”  Cross-method interoperability and portability, within and beyond Indy networks (which are proliferating quickly in&nbsp;Europe!)  Test Suites and a process to incentivize (or even fund?) revisions of major specifications to include more explicit test&nbsp;vectors  Lessons from the mid-2020 DID-Core sprint and PING W3C Security&nbsp;Review  Updates on OIDC-DID bridging work, OAuth &amp; GNAP, and fast-moving regulatory changes in Europe and North&nbsp;America   Making your IIW&nbsp;plan <p>DIF has had great success presenting work at IIW — and increasingly, it is becoming an important aspect of our educational and outreach efforts to post recordings of these presentations on our youtube <a href="https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCicZIzvOXOyij0A6jlA7nxQ?c=UCicZIzvOXOyij0A6jlA7nxQ">channel</a>. We’re hoping this tradition will build more momentum at the upcoming&nbsp;IIW!</p><p>The event is a great opportunity for those who are already very active in the community working on standards and code related to decentralized identity. It is also a great opportunity for those who are very new to get up to speed quickly via what language professors call “deep immersion.” It is very welcoming and friendly, and since each session includes experts from different fields, there are few assumptions and much level-setting. DIF leadership attends the event and encourages its membership to actively participate.</p><p>For those already planning to attend, please note that a skeletal structure is already <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/schedule/">posted</a>. The most important sessions to attend are each day’s “agenda creation” sessions; the “demo hour” sessions for live demos of new products and prototypes, and the “closing circle” readouts from each day’s events are close seconds. Cordoning off those timeslots in your calendar weeks in advance is highly recommended, as a way of keeping those timeslots free of conflicts in your home time&nbsp;zone!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-at-iiw31-f8aafe64c985">DIF at #IIW31</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The financial services market has long turned to technology to address a range of back-end challenges and enhance customer-facing services. Blockchain is increasingly becoming a go-to technology for advancing many different financial systems and solutions with different Hyperledger platforms serving as the core for an array of applications now in production.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on for just a sampling #HyperledgerFinTech solutions, built using a mix of Hyperledger technologies:</p>
<p>Bakong</p>
<p>Sponsored by the National Bank of Cambodia, the country’s central bank, <a href="https://bakong.nbc.org.kh/">Bakong</a> is the first retail payments system in the world using blockchain technology. Built on Hyperledger Iroha, Bakong delivers value for customers, merchants and banks. Individuals can now transfer money and buy from merchants with a simple smartphone app. Merchants gain a fast, cashless, and secure payments system. And banks can do interbank transfers at much lower cost.</p>
<p>Bakong was developed by <a href="https://soramitsu.co.jp/">Soramitsu</a> and, after a soft launch in 2019, is now expanding with 16 financial institutions using the system and more expected to join in the near future. The project was also designed to promote financial inclusion for the country’s large number of unbanked citizens. Any citizen of the country can open a Bakong account, even if they don’t have a traditional bank account. The more than 500 merchants that accept Bakong can be viewed in a map inside the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>daura&nbsp;</p>
<p>Built atop the private<a href="https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/company/innovation/blockchain.about.internal.html#stc"> Swiss Trust Chain</a> run by Swisscom and Swiss Post and powered by Hyperledger Fabric, <a href="https://www.daura.ch/en/">daura</a> is a digital share platform for financing and investing in Swiss SMEs. With daura, the share register is easily digitized and capital increases are carried out quickly and inexpensively at the push of a button. Shares can be split into any number of small lots and the share register is always digitally maintained, complete and up-to-date. With daura, companies have also transitioned virtual Annual General Meetings as a response to COVID-19 with authorization and access are granted directly via the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ioCash</p>
<p><a href="https://io.builders/">ioBuilders</a> is a blockchain technology company focused on building regulated fintech and enterprise solutions based on distributed ledger technology to help businesses succeed in their blockchain adoption. The company offers professional services, including technical, business and regulatory, and develops its own product line. ioBuilders has been one of the first adopters and advocates of Hyperledger Besu, providing essential feedback to improve its enterprise requirements capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://io.cash/">ioCash</a>, one of ioBuilder’s core products, is a fintech platform enabling the use of regulated fiat money on blockchain networks, making it programmable with smart contracts and able to interact with other blockchain use cases. ioCash’s platform operates under an electronic money licence, providing accounts (with or without IBAN) and complex payments functionalities through API and smart contracts connectivity. ioCash is also available as a technology license for financial institutions that hold banking or electronic money licences and are aiming to add the benefits of blockchain into their payment systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memberpass</p>
<p><a href="https://www.culedger.com/">CULedger</a>, a credit union service organization (CUSO) that began when a group of credit unions came together in 2016 as a direct response to the increasing threat of fraud, set out to bring a decentralized identity solution product for credit unions to market. The result was <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass</a>, a permanent, portable digital identity credential for credit union members.</p>
<p>Built in partnership with <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a> and using Hyperledger Indy, Memberpass replaces vulnerable authentication processes such as common knowledge-based questions. Now credit unions are able to issue a digital credential to members, giving them a hassle-free way to control and prove their identity quickly and easily while protecting their personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verified.Me&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://verified.me/">Verified.Me</a> offers a secure and convenient way to help Canadians verify their identities.</p>
<p>Verified.Me is a service offered by <a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey Technologies Inc</a>. The Verified.Me service was developed in cooperation with seven of Canada’s major financial institutions – BMO, CIBC, Desjardins, National Bank of Canada, RBC, Scotiabank and TD. The Verified.Me network continues to evolve adding new identity providers and service providers to make your life easier.</p>
<p>Verified.Me is built on top of the IBM Blockchain Platform which is based on Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Fabric v1.2, and will be interoperable with Hyperledger Indy projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users of the Verified.Me mobile app or web browser experience are able to get a free credit score with Equifax, register with Sun Life, verify their identity when registering for Dynacare Plus, an online and mobile service that lets users manage their health remotely, and more.</p>

<p>Dear OpenID Foundation Members:</p>
<p>It is with a heavy heart to share this news with you. Don Thibeau, after many years of his excellent service, informed the OpenID Board of his intention to move on from his position as the Executive Director at the end of 2020 to pursue other opportunities and challenges in the identity space. This is such a loss for the Foundation, as we would never have grown to what we are without Don’s dedicated service as a colleague and friend to many of us.</p>
<p>Don has committed to the Board of Directors to provide the time needed to ensure a successful transition to new leadership in 2021. Don will continue to be instrumental through his tenure in the many liaison relationships that the Foundation has under way.</p>
<p>I have asked Vice Chairman Bjorn Hjelm to lead the Foundation’s transition to new leadership in 2021. The Executive Committee and the Board of Directors have started this work under Bjorn’s direction and will continue to communicate with membership and the community at large on our progress. If you have any questions or input into this process, please direct your inquiries to <a href="mailto:bjorn.hjelm@oidf.org">Vice Chairman Bjorn Hjelm</a>.</p>
<p>This is an important transition in the evolution of the OpenID Foundation. The Board of Directors is committed to taking the time required to successfully execute a transition plan while being transparent in our efforts, and continuing the work of the Foundation with its members and working groups. Thank you for your continued support and contributions to the OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,&nbsp;</p>

 Urs Gasser on two new books — and what’s&nbsp;ahead <p>The precariousness of the early days of the pandemic turned parents into educators and scholars scrambling to make sense of the historic challenges faced by our societies and the institutions governing them.</p><p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ugasser">Urs Gasser</a>, the Executive Director of the Berkman Klein Center (BKC) and Professor of Practice at Harvard Law School, has co-authored two timely books that inform both of those struggles.</p><p>Gasser co-authored <a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/john-palfrey/the-connected-parent/9781541618022/?fbclid=IwAR0ulyZ9NQKm-mqVQdg6WidnjTpS6IqSswaAgAChB2W7OJOV6IVGjV035kU">The Connected Parent</a> with <a href="https://www.macfound.org/about/people/president/">John Palfrey</a>, president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which turns a decade of academic research into practical guidance for parents raising children in a “digitally connected” world. He also wrote an essay series published in German (<a href="https://www.helbing.ch/detail/ISBN-9783719044022/Pandemie-als-Verbundkrise-und-digitales-Ph%C3%A4nomen">Pandemie als Verbundkrise und digitales Phaenomen</a>) that focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic, risk, digitization, and the law. This book is co-authored with <a href="http://drolshammer.net/work-experience/">Jens Drolshammer</a>, professor emeritus at the University of St. Gallen and former BKC faculty associate.</p><p>We spoke with Gasser about the books, threads between them, and what he is working on&nbsp;next.</p> You’re the co-author of two new books to be published within a few weeks’ time. Let’s start with “The Connected Parent”. In a nutshell, what is this book&nbsp;about? <p>“The Connected Parent”, written with my friend and long-time collaborator John Palfrey, offers advice to parents and other caregivers on how to support their children as they grow up in an increasingly digitally connected environment. The book includes very practical advice and suggestions. John and I summarized the best available research, including 15 years of <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">youth and media</a> work at the Berkman Klein Center (BKC), to help parents figure out how to think about issues like screentime, social media usage, privacy and well-being, digital activism and citizenship skills, to name just a few — and what to do about them to minimize risk and embrace opportunities.</p> Your second book focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic, risk, digitization, and the law. Can you tell us more about&nbsp;it? <p>This book is published in German and in the form of an essay collection. It offers initial reflections on COVID-19 as a specific type of risk that Judge Posner a decade ago in a seminal <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/catastrophe-9780195306477?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">book</a> described as a “catastrophic risk” — something most recently also taken up in Tony Ord’s <a href="https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/toby-ord/the-precipice/9780316484893/">new&nbsp;book</a>.</p><p>The texts were written during the “lockdown” and in collaboration with my former teacher and previous BKC associate Jens Drolshammer. Switzerland serves as a country case study to better understand what role the law plays during such a massive crisis. We have heard and learned a lot from public health experts during the crisis. Understandably, the legal system has been less front-and-center. Yet, it turns out that law is almost everywhere and hugely relevant especially during a crisis of this magnitude. Some of the essays also explore the historic role digital technologies play in dealing with COVID-19 — I call it metaphorically the first “digital pandemic.” We talk about the intersectionality of these&nbsp;things.</p> Both of these books are timely to the ongoing pandemic, in different ways. Are there any connecting points between these two&nbsp;books? <p>We submitted “The Connected Parent” manuscript before COVID-19 arrived in the US and were only able to add small references to it as our publisher was initially skeptical about how much of a “big deal” COVID-19 would be. Well, of course, now we know better. Parents and educators are trying to figure out how digital tech can be used to support kids around the world as their education is so deeply disrupted by COVID-19. The book will not give a full answer to the current crisis, but might be still helpful in the present based on the connected parent philosophy we sketch in the book. And we believe it offers sound longer-term guidance that helps parents to engage with their kids — and be connected with the digital world they live in. The book on the pandemic reflects on some of the educational experiences in real-time, albeit from a policy and not necessarily a parental perspective. There are also other connection points between the two books. Both are written with a broader audience in mind, and both are the fruit of collaboration.</p> What motivated you and John Palfrey to write “The Connected Parent”? Isn’t it unusual for scholars to write a parents’&nbsp;guide? <p>Yes, it is! John and I have already written several books together, including our 2008 and 2016 book “<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/node/99526">Born Digital</a>,” and in some ways, the new book is its cousin. Since our last book, we’ve been asked many times for more practical guidance than we were willing to offer in our previous work. And at some point, we decided to take on this challenge and translate what we can learn from research in ways that it translates into recommendations for parents. For me, it’s been a great learning experience to write this book. As academics, we are used to making all sorts of caveats — “can’t say, more research is needed” — where the data is shaky. But as a parent, you have to make decisions, whether you have scientific evidence or not. So we’ve tried to take this seriously and be helpful even where we don’t have all the answers. We did so by being very honest about what we know and what we don’t know — and then still give advice based on what we think makes sense based on our own experiences as researchers, educators, and parents. The <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">Youth and Media</a> team at BKC has been very helpful to keep us honest and grounded.</p> In the introduction to the essay series on the pandemic, risk, digitization, and the law, you and Jens Drolshammer state that the book is an experiment. What do you mean by&nbsp;that? <p>It’s been an experiment in multiple ways. It’s experimental in the sense that it was written during the early moments of the pandemic, with lots of uncertainty and even unknown unknowns. The texts offer real-time observations and reflections, without a rigorous methodology, which of course means that our observations are not scientific and offered more in the spirit of early hypotheses. We looked at it like writing initial observations and questions into a personal journal and making these entries publicly available because it might be of interest to others as well. We did so based on stories, reports, news coverage, etc. we’ve collected from the first day of the pandemic based on a set of 10 criteria.</p><p>So both the format and working style is experimental, at least for me. We hope that these early and only tentative entries into what we termed our “logbook” might invite more rigorous work over the years to come. It’s also an experiment to write and publish such a book across the Atlantic during such an extraordinary time.</p> Will you publish an English translation of the&nbsp;book? <p>I don’t think so. While I enjoy the challenge of writing and publishing in two different languages, I generally don’t feel excited about translating what I’ve written in one language to the other. To me, it’s about more than translating the text: When writing in German or English, I think differently about what I am going to say and how — it’s like flipping a&nbsp;switch.</p><p>That said, a brief summary with some of the key observations, as well as a transatlantic conversation with Professor Martha Minow and John Palfrey that is included in the essay collection, is also <a href="https://medium.com/@ugasser/pandemic-as-a-composite-crisis-and-digital-phenomenon-ba45cb5e3b9b">available on&nbsp;Medium</a>.</p> Do you plan to continue writing books, and if so, what’s&nbsp;next? <p>I try to keep a balance as far as types of contributions are concerned. I’m working on a number of shorter articles right now, but have another book project lined up — this time a book on the turn to information and information law, which brings me back to the roots of my academic&nbsp;life.</p><p>On a personal level, I enjoy working on books because it forces me to learn and engage in different ways than what has become the dominant mode in today’s professional lives. I’m acutely aware that both reading and writing books are an enormous privilege, and I couldn’t be more grateful for&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/urs-gasser-on-two-new-books-and-whats-ahead-de04c663b385">Urs Gasser on two new books — and what’s ahead</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m working for HSBC and have been here since May 2016 doing a variety of roles, but recently (well since Jan 2018), I have been getting my fingers dirty in something very exciting –&nbsp; defining and creating a brand new strategic capability for the Bank called – Events Based Data Assurance – which will underpin our Digital Identity efforts.</p>
<p>Essentially, all Digital Identity is customer data that we trust. We have a lot of customer data in the Bank but we don’t record why we trust this data and so we ask the customer to prove who they are over and over again. i.e. when someone wants to open a new account, we ask them to prove their ID by showing us their passport. Someone in the Bank will look at the passport, match the photo on the passport to the person standing in front of them, and confirm that they match. However, what is recorded is the person’s name, DOB, Nationality BUT not the event of ‘passport check in branch’.</p>
<p>If we recorded ‘why we trust the data’ using a new type of data called ‘EVENTS’ i.e. the event which led to us knowing why we trust a piece of data (in the above example, Suzie, a Branch advisor in our Canary Wharf branch checked that the photo on the passport matched the person in front of them and it matched, it unlocks a huge opportunity inside the bank to ‘RE-USE’ data across markets and functions – resulting in a fantastic customer experience and reduction in costly and often duplicative processes.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I started on the Barclays Bank Graduate Programme and tended to move around every 3 years or so to new places.</p>
<p>I had a curious mind and wanted to do ‘new’ things rather than be in a BAU type role.</p>
<p>I was hungry to learn and develop and so sought opportunities every time I felt like I had learnt all I could from an organisation. I’ve tried my hand at all sorts of things from Banking, to Management Consulting, to starting up a brand new dotcom business, to digitising an insurance company, studying for an MBA, moving to the online travel industry and then back to Digital Banking and now most recently, qualifying as a Personal Performance Coach and setting up a Coaching Business as a side hustle!&nbsp; I absolutely love helping people understand what their potential is and to guide them to go and realise this!</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The most important lesson I have learnt along the way is to be your authentic self, don’t try and be someone who you’re not. I know this is difficult because we all suffer from this, especially us women. We’re always comparing ourselves with the person who is always getting the promotions, the attention, the recognition etc – but by trying to be like her, you slowly start to move away from who you are at your core – your authentic self.</p>
<p>This will only result in a lot of frustration and unhappiness which can become a huge problem.</p>
<p>Remember, you’re an individual with skills, experience and a personality which is unique to you. Embrace this and become comfortable in your own skin and let people see the real you! You’ll be surprised where this can lead!</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
 
 
 
 Writing down your internal business activities in a granular way – so that others can understand why they should trust this piece of data 
 Agree on a common data model which can be used to describe events 
 Define the key trusted providers in your country (utility companies, passport office, mobile phone companies, travel companies) who are willing to start exchanging data/ events with you; get them to write down what they do to assure data in a machine readable way (using the same data model) 
 
 
 Stop:
 
 Trying to solve for the World – start small, and then scale focusing on real life use cases 
 
 
 Continue:
 
 to have dialogue with organisations, governments and customers/ citizens to keep the conversation going so that potential solutions/ way forward are relevant 
 to define key customer/ citizen/ employee pain points and look to solve for these 
 
 
 
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>We are all unique and with this uniqueness, we each bring a different viewpoint to the same problem so be tolerant, embrace this difference and experience the powerful results that follow.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>I’d highly recommend ‘Man’s search for meaning’ by Viktor Frankl because it teaches us/demonstrates the power of the mind and resilience.</p>
<p>I absolutely love the quote in the book: “he who has a WHY to live can bear with almost any HOW……and what alone remains is the last of human freedoms is the ability to choose one’s attitude in a given set of circumstances.”</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Don’t be afraid, speak your mind, be yourself and think positive thoughts. As a kid growing up in the UK, I suffered from both racial discrimination and bullying – which impacted hugely on my self -confidence. I hid in my shell and didn’t feel as valued, important or equal to my peers and therefore didn’t take the opportunities that presented themselves to me because of this.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about what people will think; ask the ‘stupid’ questions and never feel that you’re not good enough!</p>

Photo: Pixabay<p>Should tech companies follow human rights law to govern online speech? This proposal has tremendous appeal. International human rights law can offer a set of rules designed in the public interest with the broad support of a global community. This certainly appears superior to the status quo wherein a handful of CEOs set rules for the speech of billions of social media users. Unsurprisingly, scholars (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3250950">here</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/lawless/8504E4EC8A74E539D701A04D3EE8D8DE">here</a>) and civil society organizations (<a href="https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Regulating-speech-by-contract-WEB-v2.pdf.">here</a> and <a href="https://www.observacom.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Estandares-regulacion-grandes-plataformas-Internet.pdf.">here</a>) have expressed their support and the project has gained a lot of traction since David Kaye — then UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression — <a href="https://www.undocs.org/A/HRC/38/35">promoted</a> it in&nbsp;2018.</p><p>However, adopting international human rights law might not lead to more legitimate content moderation rules. First, international human rights law is not a set of universally accepted rules. The framework favors some speech standards over other reasonable alternatives. The choice for those standards should itself be subject to a legitimate rule-making process. Second, international human rights law is in many areas highly indeterminate. It offers guidance but no precise answers to many challenging questions. In those cases, human rights law might not constrain the power of tech firms but instead only create the appearance of legitimacy. In other words, the proposal could mean business as usual with the added ‘legitimacy-aura’ of human rights&nbsp;law.</p> International Human Rights Law Is Not&nbsp;Neutral <p>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the Covenant) offers the primary international guidance for free expression standards. The Covenant puts a priority on some normative options over others in areas in which reasonable disagreement between legal systems, experts, and communities exists. Two current controversies illustrate this&nbsp;point.</p><p>In July, the <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">Stop Hate for Profit</a> campaign brought together hundreds of companies. For one month, they withheld advertisement from Facebook demanding that the tech giant curb the spread of hate on the platform. Among other demands, the campaign requests the removal of groups focused on Holocaust denial. Although sensible and understandable, the request is in tension with Articles 19 and 20 of the Covenant. The Human Rights Committee, the body that authoritatively interprets this international treaty, <a href="https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/gc34.pdf">has said</a>, “Laws that penalize the expression of opinions about historical facts are incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant imposes.” Indeed, in 2019, Kaye explicitly <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25174&amp;LangID=E">used</a> the bans on Holocaust denial as an example of a law that breaches states’ international obligation to protect freedom of expression.</p><p>In other areas, human rights law sides with the campaign’s demands. Stop Hate for Profit also asks that platforms apply their rules equally to politicians and other users. Twitter and Facebook, however, see things differently. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they decided not to delete President Trump’s posts violating their rules on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274323/trump-twitter-glorifying-violence-minneapolis-shooting-looting-notice-restriction">glorification of violence</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/technology/twitter-trump-tweet-warning.html">election integrity</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/08/05/trump-post-removed-facebook/">COVID misinformation</a>. They reasoned that the public interest of citizens in learning what their representatives think in these cases outweighed the harmful effects of such speech. In other instances, Facebook did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/technology/trump-facebook-coronavirus-video.html">remove</a> a video posted by Trump’s campaign for spreading COVID-19 misleading information, and both firms <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199845/twitter-tweets-brazil-venezuela-presidents-covid-19-coronavirus-jair-bolsonaro-maduro">took down</a> content that Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro had posted in violation of their&nbsp;rules.</p><p>In this contentious debate, international law falls much closer on the side of the Stop Hate for Profit campaign. Kaye’s 2019 report (see para. 47) explains that even though exceptions to protect political speech could in exceptional cases be acceptable, in principle politicians and the public ought to be subject to the same rules. According to the report, harmful speech can even be more dangerous when uttered by political leaders. Therefore, there are even stronger reasons to apply speech rules to these&nbsp;figures.</p><p>The main point is that reasonable disagreement exists about how to balance these different considerations when governing politicians’ speech. And the choices that international law (or the Human Rights Committee) makes in these debates are not obvious and not universally accepted. They should themselves be subject to the control of the people. Rather than shifting decision-making power from tech companies to the UN (although certainly a step forward), it is urgent to focus on building processes that can actually involve the public in the deliberation over speech&nbsp;rules.</p> Lending Legitimacy to Unconstrained Power <p>At the same time, international human rights law leaves many speech questions unanswered. I have written about the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/why-international-human-rights-law-cannot-replace-content-moderation-d3fc8dd4344c">contradictions</a> between regional human rights systems that the UN framework does not solve. A more fundamental open question is how to apply the legitimacy requirement of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to content moderation.</p><p>According to Article 19, all restrictions to freedom of expression must have a legitimate end. Legitimate ends for governmental restrictions on speech are the protection of national security or of public order or of public health or morals. Evelyn Aswad <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3250950">asks</a> the right questions: Which ends would be legitimate for content moderation rules set by private companies? Could tech companies claim a business interest as a legitimate purpose? And even if they were not entitled to rely on the most explicit commercial interests such as advertisers’ preferences, could these companies claim that a specific content moderation rule helps them shape the type of community they want to&nbsp;foster?</p><p>Most supporters of the proposal would acknowledge that it is necessary to let companies disallow content for the purpose of meeting the preferences and expectations of different users. This appears sensible. Otherwise, all the speech that international human rights law protects — including adult nudity, pornography, and many graphic depictions of violence — would likely have to be allowed on platforms such as Facebook. This would render platforms nearly useless to a large set of users that does not want to navigate through all forms of legal, but perhaps undesirable, speech. But the line between permissible and impermissible ends becomes blurry, and the Covenant, designed to be applied to states, definitely does not draw such a&nbsp;line.</p><p>As long as no line exists, international human rights law poses few constraints on what companies can do. For any rule a company might wish to set, it could articulate a public interest end that the rule advances. For instance, for nudity rules, tech firms could claim they are trying to avoid all possible non-consensual distribution of intimate images. For hate speech that does not incite violence, they could posit that they are creating a “safe” environment for communities that are disproportionately the target of such speech. And the list goes on. Susan Benesch has <a href="https://www.yalejreg.com/bulletin/but-facebooks-not-a-country-how-to-interpret-human-rights-law-for-social-media-companies/">proposed</a> helpful guidance to translate the requirements of Article 19 to content moderation. But unless broad consensus can be built around the meaning of terms such as “the protection of moral,” human rights law will lend its legitimate framework and vocabulary without meaningfully constraining private regulatory power.</p> International Human Rights Law as a Framework <p>Adopting human rights law as default content moderation rules can be a project of translation, meaning: take international law standards that already exist and translate them into implementable content moderation rules. For the reasons I discussed earlier, I have little faith in that&nbsp;project.</p><p>However, another proclaimed virtue of international human rights law is that it offers a common framework and vocabulary to guide the discussion between multiple actors on how to come up with a new language, a new rulebook specifically designed for online speech. Indeed, it may still be valuable to rely on the human rights framework not to answer all questions but to agree on what questions need to be asked (does the rule have a legitimate end? is the rule necessary to meet that end? are less intrusive measures available?). Tech companies (or anyone making the rules) can contribute to public reasoning and deliberation by being transparent about the lack of unequivocal answers. They should explain, instead, why they prefer certain rules and how they think about them through the lens of the standards set forth in Article 19 of the Covenant. That type of transparent reasoning could be the start of a dialogue with other actors in a shared language.</p><p>Such an approach resembles what Larry Lessig refers to as “latent ambiguities.” Lessig tried to imagine how judges would react to novel legal questions posed by the development of technology. In some cases, translation of already existing rules would be easy: for example, extending the protection of mail to electronic communications. In other cases, however, there is no unequivocal answer, and there is a need to decide anew how to regulate. For those situations, Lessig imagined that judges could promote democratic deliberation by identifying those “ambiguous” areas, proposing possible paths forward, and explaining how their own decisions would advance constitutional values.</p><p>There is one fundamental difference between Lessig’s work on judicial adjudication and content governance. In the case of judicial decision-making, legislatures could later contest the judges’ decisions. Lawmakers can debate and vote for a different rule. In the governance of online content, although civil society may well play a role in contesting the reasoning and choices tech firms offer, no institution has the authority equivalent to that of a legislature to move the dialogue forward. In that sense, the transparent reasoning of companies can be the beginning of a conversation, but it remains unclear who can “speak”&nbsp;next.</p><p>As Jonathan Zittrain <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3458435">argues</a>, the current era of content moderation requires experimentation with processes and institutions that can reconstruct legitimacy and open opportunities for people’s participation in online governance. Looking at international human rights law, to the extent that it offers a common framework to enable conversations, might be a step in that direction. I have tried to begin exploring which positions that framework gives priority to and to emphasize the need for finding other actors that have the capacity to contest the public reasoning of tech companies. Only then will international law be able to foster an actual conversation rather than a monologue uttered by tech firms in the guise of human rights language.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/international-human-rights-law-is-not-enough-to-fix-content-moderations-legitimacy-crisis-a80e3ed9abbd">International Human Rights Law Is Not Enough to Fix Content Moderation’s Legitimacy Crisis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Governments and Businesses to Begin Testing Across Canada 



<p>TORONTO, September 15, 2020 – The<a href="https://diacc.ca/"> Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada</a> (“DIACC”) today announced the launch of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>TM (“PCTF”), a set of digital ID and authentication industry standards that will define how digital ID will roll out across Canada. Its launch marks the shift from the framework’s development into official operation and will begin alpha testing by public and private sector members in Canada. The alpha testing will inform the launch of DIACC’s <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">PCTF Voila Verified Trustmark Assurance Program</a>&nbsp; (“Voila Verified”), set to launch next year.</p>



<p>“The pandemic has pushed digital adoption five years into the future. Without the proper infrastructure for digital ID and authentication in place, we’ve seen firsthand how Canadians have been left vulnerable and with limited access to essential services” said Eros Spodotto, Executive Vice-President, Technology Strategy and Business Transformation at <a href="https://www.telus.com/en/">TELUS</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“Trust and security are the foundations of the digital economy. The key to unlocking a true digital experience comes from having a digital ID ecosystem that extends beyond any one sector.”<br> – Franklin Garrigues, VP Digital Channels at <a href="https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/">TD Bank</a>, and DIACC Board Vice-Chair</p></blockquote>



<p>From open banking to e-health, digital ID is a key enabler in unlocking the next frontier of our digital economy. Banks and telcos fortunately have been able to leverage existing digital ID services to support Canadians. “Digital identity verification has helped countless Canadians receive financial aid during the pandemic,” notes Andre Boysen, Chief Identity Officer at <a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey,</a> “but it’s not enough. Now, we need to leverage that momentum, and push out a solution for digital ID in all levels of society. The PCTF is that answer.”</p>



<p>“The PCTF launch marks an important milestone in Canada’s digital transformation initiatives,” exclaims Dave Nikolejsin, Board Chair at DIACC, “Canadians have had to deal with identity theft and fraud, high anxiety in accessing services that they were in dire need of while facing social distancing measures, and attempting to go about their lives as normally as possible. Digital ID minimizes all of those pain points, and elevates the livelihoods of Canadians everywhere.” Joni Brennan, President of DIACC, adds, “Our economy has also been heavily impacted by all this, and we know digital identity has the potential to add at least 3 percent of GDP, which is <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=33&amp;pr.y=15&amp;sy=2016&amp;ey=2021&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=156&amp;s=NGDP_RPCH%2CNGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPPC%2CPCPIPCH&amp;grp=0&amp;a=">potentially almost $100 billion</a> back into our Canadian economy. This is why we’ve accelerated the launch of the PCTF. The time for digital ID is now.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“The Digital ID Laboratory of Canada is a proud partner of the DIACC, with a strong community that is ready to support the launch of the PCTF and ensure that together, we can accelerate the adoption of user-centric and interoperable digital ID solutions across the country.”<br> – Pierre Roberge, General Manager of the <a href="https://digidlab.ca/">Digital ID Laboratory of Canada</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Alpha testing of the PCTF will be carried out by over 20 Canadian public and private sector <a href="https://diacc.ca/membership/">DIACC member organizations</a> during the next two quarters with the purpose of operationalizing the framework as fast as possible. Organizations that have volunteered to take part in the alpha test seek to gain strategic and operational insights to become demonstrated leaders in digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learnings taken from the alpha testing will help DIACC identify what is needed to scale up a digital identity infrastructure across Canada, and help Canada secure international digital interoperability and accreditation by working with international and third party partners such as <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/trust-services-and-eid">eIDAS</a> and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/what-we-do/">Kantara Initiative IAF</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Digital ID Trademark You Can Trust</p>



<p>The alpha testing will also inform the launch of the DIACC <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">PCTF Voila Verified Trustmark Assurance Program</a> (“Voila Verified”). The program is set to launch in fall 2021, and will issue a PCTF Voila Verified Trustmark to organizations who demonstrate compliance with PCTF components. Voila Verified will enable solutions and service providers to leverage the trustmark to elevate their market leadership and allow them to collaborate securely with assurance, providing their customers with the digital-first experience that they demand.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“We’re pleased to work with the DIACC to help recognize the Voila Verified Program on an international scale. It is through secure global credentials that we can transform the state of digital identity, and progress the digital economy worldwide.” <br>– Colin Wallis, Executive Director of <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/">Kantara Initiative</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Multijurisdictional Collaboration: Enabling Trusted Digital Inclusion for All</p>



<p>The launch of the PCTF comes at a time when having a strong digital economy is no longer a ‘nice-to have’; rather, it is imperative for Canadians. More than 70 per cent of Canadians want to see the government and private sector collaborate on a joint identity framework in Canada. “We’ve seen the benefits and advantages of digital ID for people in British Columbia during this pandemic,”, said CJ Ritchie, Associate Deputy Minister and Government Chief Information Officer for the Province of British Columbia, “From government to healthcare, commerce, and financial services, the entire provincial economy is being impacted by COVID-19. Having a robust digital identity/trust ecosystem allows all Canadians to do more online, in a safer, more secure and confident way.”</p>



<p>The PCTF was developed collaboratively between public and private sector stakeholders, with contributions from a broad array of individuals and organizations around the world. Over 3,400 public comments were provided over four years that helped progress the framework to its launch today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The framework released today was created through an incredible collaboration involving hundreds of people who worked to contribute, comment, and lend their ideas,” noted Peter Watkins, Program Executive for the Pan-Canadian Digital ID at the Institute for Citizen-Centred Service, “we’re committed to continuing our multi-jurisdictional collaboration as we move into the next stages for this important work.”</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CMO&nbsp;</p>



<p>The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Insights_Actions_to_Counter_Email-Based_Attacks_on_Election-Related_S508C.pdf">&nbsp;issued an advisory</a> Thursday recommending cyber attack remedies for election-related activities&nbsp; including the use of FIDO authentication to thwart phishing&nbsp; attempts and account takeover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advisory, entitled “ACTIONS TO COUNTER EMAIL-BASED ATTACKS ON ELECTION RELATED ENTITIES” noted that 78 percent of cyber-espionage incidents are enabled by phishing. CISA makes specific recommendations on protecting against cyber attacks to aid organizations involved in election-related activities.</p>



<p>Among other recommendations, FIDO Authentication was highlighted to thwart phishing attempts and protect against account takeover for cloud email and other high-value services. Specifically, CISA cites <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a> Security Keys as a tool that campaigns and organizations can, and should, use to protect themselves. The advisory also recommends that, when available, campaigns and organizations should enroll users in advanced protection services such as <a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/">Google Advanced Protection</a>, which leverages FIDO Security Keys as a best practice over other 2FA methodologies to protect workforces from account takeovers related to malicious attacks.</p>



<p>FIDO security keys offer protection against phishing attacks by working as a second, physical factor of authentication and only authenticating when a user is on the correct website. Thus, even if a user is tricked into supplying their password to a phishing website, the physical security key will still block attackers from accessing their account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phishing continues to be a problem and remains one of the most popular means by which cybercriminals obtain data. Embracing FIDO technology is smart politics, and smart policy for those who understand the gravity of the cyber threat. As the election draws near, we’re increasingly seeing foreign agents <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/biden-campaign-firm-hit-by-suspected-kremlin-hacking-attack">attempting</a> to infiltrate, influence and disrupt our elections.</p>



<p>As the CISA advisory implies, phishing and other cyber attacks are a critical issue with widespread and damaging implications to U.S. national security. The CISA advisory highlights the importance of locking down email systems, which have become a preferred vector for malicious activity. The CISA recommendations are intended as a preferred method for protecting the 2020 and future political campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In June, NIST put out a call for comments on the next iteration of its Digital Identity Guidelines, SP 800-63-4. We welcomed the opportunity to comment; read our full comments in the <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FIDO-ALLIANCE-Response-to-NIST-800-63-3-call-for-comments.pdf">Government &amp; Public Policy area of the website</a>.</p>



<p>Up front, we note that SP 800-63-3 represented a significant improvement in NIST’s Digital Identity Guidelines, taking a more modern approach to identity proofing, authentication, and federation. That said, technology and threat are both never static, and we are encouraged to see that NIST is embarking on another revision of the document.</p>



<p>In our comments, we make three recommendations for SP 800-63-4:</p>



<p>1. NIST should adjust its approach to AALs to help implementers clearly differentiate between tools that are phishing resistant and those that are not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, a variety of authenticators based on shared secrets – including Look-Up Secrets, Out-of-Band Devices (i.e., Push), and OTP apps and tokens – are given the same weight in AAL2 as authenticators based on asymmetric public key cryptography, such as FIDO. Given how attackers have caught up with the former, it no longer makes sense to combine&nbsp; these two types of authenticators under a single designation. Doing so misleads implementers into thinking these two categories of authenticators are equivalent in strength or resiliency. In our comments, we provide NIST with several ideas for how it can adjust the AALs to provide more differentiation between tools that are phishing resistant and those that are not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. NIST should engage with FIDO Alliance to explore other alternatives to enable FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 requirements</p>



<p>When SP 800-63-3 was first published, it created a path for some FIPS 140 validated FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 – if those authenticators were deployed in concert with Token Binding to deliver Verifier Impersonation Resistance. Since that time, most major browser vendors have withdrawn support for token binding. Per discussions with NIST, we understand that this means that FIDO authenticators can no longer meet AAL3 without implementing other approaches to mitigate the loss of token binding. As NIST embarks on the next revision of SP 800-63, we urge NIST to engage with FIDO Alliance to explore other alternatives to enable FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 requirements.</p>



<p>3. Provide more direct references to FIDO</p>



<p>SP 800-63B describes Requirements by Authenticator Type but is inconsistent in how it points to standards that support that type. This has created some confusion in the marketplace when implementers consult SP 800-63B and see reference to standards like OTP and PKI but do not see any specific reference to FIDO. In our comments, we offer three suggestions for how the guidance can directly reference FIDO so that implementers have a clearer understanding of where FIDO fits in and supports the requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We greatly appreciate NIST’s consideration of our comments and look forward to ongoing dialogue and collaboration as they seek to update the Digital Identity Guidance.</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Celero?</p>



<p>Our vision is to be a leading provider of technology solutions to the financial industry that…</p>



  Others aspire to be  People want to work for  Clients know they can rely upon.  



<p><a href="https://www.celero.ca/about-celero/">Celero</a> is realizing this vision is by delivering a digital technology, integration and payments ecosystem to credit unions and financial institutions across Canada. This is accomplished through an innovative mindset, commitment to delivery, strong external partnerships and an unrelenting focus on reliability and security.</p>



 <a href="https://www.celero.ca/"></a> 



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>As a provider of technology solutions to credit unions, we recognize the growing expectation our clients face from their members who demand convenience, innovation and robust security in every financial experience.</p>



<p>Digital identity is the mechanism to enable our clients to secure their members’ trust as they serve them in an increasingly digital world. Beyond that, digital identity can be an enabling force for Canadians who are unbanked or underbanked. We believe in supporting the financial health of our customers’ customers and recognize that authentication of identity is a means for a more financially inclusive Canada.</p>



<p>Overall, Celero recognizes we have a critical role to play in enabling our clients to build trusted and lasting relationships with their current and future members through a trusted digital identity framework.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does Celero address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>To protect consumers, organizations put safety measures in place that can also cause constraints on convenience. This has been an ongoing challenge for financial institutions, and today’s ‘on-demand’ culture has served to spotlight these issues.</p>



<p>A trusted digital identity framework for Canada will provide a backbone of security in convenient transactions – removing barriers, streamlining service delivery, and strengthening national and global economies.</p>



<p>Celero can help shape the framework with a&nbsp; credit union perspective and can seek out the potential use cases and applications that can benefit our clients and their members and contribute to the DIACC’s goals through our expertise in financial technology and cyber security.</p>



<p>For instance, the Celero Xchange™ digital integration ecosystem platform enables financial institutions to seamlessly connect their secure platforms, such as their core banking system, to fintech applications – without the complexity of managing different standards for sharing data between products and partners.</p>



<p>Authenticating and authorizing a credit union member without compromising the security while maintaining a seamless member user experience is a key component of our platform and value proposition.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>Canada has a growing fintech industry that is constantly seeking new ways to address digital innovation challenges and better serve consumers. The industry is becoming internationally recognized, and that expertise can serve Canada well in shaping a world-class digital identity framework that sets the standard for other countries to follow.</p>



<p>5. Why did Celero Solutions join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Our goal in joining the DIACC is to participate in driving forward solutions for digital identity trust in Canada, while obtaining new insights to apply with our clients in offering their members security, flexibility and convenience in a digital first society.</p>

 Local Ambassador, Helen Chua, gives a round-up of the latest WiD launch on August 28th 2020 
<p></p>
<p>There has been much discussion of the role of digital identity since the pandemic. Most countries have experienced lockdowns and are now looking to digitise many traditional services.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the pandemic clearly highlighted the digital divide. While much has already been done to fill the gap, there is still more to do. This was a key point made by Minister Indranee, the keynote speaker at our recent webinar.</p>
<p>She explained that the Singapore government’s enduring vision is to have a fair and just society where everyone has equal opportunity to fulfill their dreams. But, like many countries, social divisions have widened during COVID-19.</p>
<p>The launch of the WiD Singapore chapter is a timely one as it emphasizes the importance of digitalisation and digital identity. &nbsp;The Minister believes that, in order to encourage women into careers in these areas, we have to start educating young girls to the benefits and opportunities of STEM subjects.</p>
<p>Ms Rama Sridhar, EVP at Mastercard, highlighted that the establishment of WiD will further encourage women to participate as subject matter experts around various aspects of technology. It is one of WiD’s core objectives to encourage and support women into leadership roles.</p>
<blockquote><p>The establishment of WiD will further encourage women to participate in speaking as subject matter experts around various domains of technology.</p>
<p>Rama Sridhar, EVP at Mastercard</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I am very excited about the role that WiD can play in Singapore, promoting digital identity and digital inclusion. Digital identity empowers every business and individual to reach their full potential.&nbsp; This is just the beginning of our journey as the Singapore chapter and we really want to reach out to more Singaporeans to elevate, inspire and support women in their STEM careers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Group</a> (eKYC &amp; IDA WG) of the OpenID Foundation welcomes the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12528-EU-digital-ID-scheme-for-online-transactions-across-Europe/F548976">proposal of the Commission to extend the scope of eIDAS trust services</a> by introducing a new trust service for identification, authentication and for the provision of attributes, credentials and attestations and allowing the provision of identification for devices (Option 2 in the EC Revision of the eIDAS Inception Impact Assessment). This will allow companies operating identity solutions to contribute to securing digital transactions across the EU.</p>
<p>The eKYC &amp; IDA WG is a dedicated working group of the OpenID Foundation (the technical standardisation body specifying OpenID Connect and accompanying extensions). The OpenID Foundation delivers specifications for interfaces that enable interoperability between implementations, and the eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Group is focusing on use cases and extensions to OpenID Connect for communicating strong identity assurance. (<a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/</a>).</p>
<p>Most commercial identity providers have built their solutions on OpenID Connect because of its strong support for mobile platforms, ease of integration, formally proven security, and the ability to have users explicitly consent. Billions of transactions are performed every day using OpenID Connect. A significant number of identity providers, e.g. financial institutions or telecommunications operators, are also able to assert digital identities on a level comparable to eIDAS trust level substantial or high. A significant number of relying parties and their developers are familiar with OpenID Connect as it is used for Open Banking as well as their own use cases. In order to leverage the respective digital identities for the EU Single Market, we recommend the commission to endorse OpenID Connect beside SAML (which was already endorsed under Implementing Act 2015/1501) as a technical standard for eIDAS.</p>
<p>We would also like to mention that several Identity Providers provide access to government issued identities via OpenID Connect and even eID systems use OpenID Connect, namely itsme (Belgium), BankID (Norway, Sweden, &amp; Finland), and France Connect (France). We think this is a strong evidence that OpenID Connect could facilitate the implementation of all options given in the inception impact assessment document.</p>
<p>We also know that most commercial identity providers provide a mixture of attributes maintained according to different trust frameworks and at different trust levels (just think of name vs eMail address) and even self asserted attributes for the same identity. Technical standards utilised to implement the updated eIDAS regulation should consider and support such use cases by providing a clear delineation between identity attributes verified and maintained according to different trust frameworks as well as accompanying metadata about sources, validation process, and trust level (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/TorstenLodderstedt/identity-assurance-with-openid-connect">https://www.slideshare.net/TorstenLodderstedt/identity-assurance-with-openid-connect</a>).</p>
<p>The commission might also want to consider use cases where the digital identity of EU citizens is used beyond the boundaries of the EU. The eKYC working group focuses on an international standard that is relevant to many jurisdictions with representatives from Japan, Australia, UK, US, France, Czech, and Germany. In our experience, international use cases increase the requirement for dedicated representation of the aforementioned metadata in the technical standard for attribute provisioning in order to allow the relying party to process identity data in a robust fashion.</p>
<p>Since the consultation paper mentions blockchain based identity solutions, we would like to point out that technical diversity in implementations is of utmost importance for innovations. However, adoption across member states and services requires technical interoperability. That’s why there is also work under way to provide a bridge between blockchain based identity solutions and relying parties via the mature and simple integration with OpenID Connect standard.</p>
<p>As subject matter experts in digital identity, we are thrilled with the direction eIDAS is taking and are more than happy to offer our advice in the course of targeted stakeholder interviews.</p><p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2020/09/03/the-ekyc-ida-working-group-welcomes-the-proposal-of-the-european-commission-to-extend-the-scope-of-eidas-trust-services/">The eKYC &amp; IDA Working Group Welcomes the Proposal of the European Commission to Extend the Scope of eIDAS Trust Services</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a>.</p>

<p>1. What’s your organization’s mission and vision?</p>



<p>Based in the United States and India, <a href="https://www.vlinder.io/">Vlinder’s</a> vision is to enable an inclusive and sustainable ecosystem, with trust as the underpinning foundation.</p>



<p>Vlinder platforms are built harnessing new-gen technologies including blockchain, IoT and artificial intelligence to foster inclusion and sustainability within the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vlinder platform offerings are focused on helping private and public enterprises working towards the seventeen <a href="http://un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy?</p>



 <a href="https://www.vlinder.io/"></a> 



<p>Globally, there are 1 billion people without proper identification,  which equates to roughly one seventh of the world’s population. This population typically includes low income and vulnerable groups including women and girls, migrants, refugees, individuals with disabilities, and indigenous populations.</p>



<p>Not having access to proper ID restricts these vulnerable populations in obtaining basic essential services such as health, education, and financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ID is a foundational element that is a direct and indirect enabler of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including:</p>



  Access to finance  Gender equality and empowerment  Access to basic health and education  Child protection  Social protection  Labour Markets  



<p>Building an inclusive sustainable ecosystem will not only better the lives of vulnerable populations, but will also help improve the global economy as more people will be contributing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. How does your organization address the needs of this transformation?</p>



<p>Vlinder has built a decentralized ID platform, Klefki, which enables citizens to:</p>



  Own their identity.  Accept credentials from issuers and store them securely in mobile wallets.  Share credentials with verifiers using consent on demand.  Disclose selective details of credentials, as opposed to sensitive data.  



<p>Enables issuers to:</p>



  Issue credentials directly to the users wallet.  View all the credentials issued.  



<p>Enables verifiers to:</p>



  Verify credentials with citizens directly.  



<p>Our platform is being piloted in various countries, and is focused on bringing trust and inclusion to the broader population, while enabling the existing system to be more efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>All countries have a role to play in accelerating progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Canada is a leader in technology and with a progressive mindset is well positioned not only to transform the ID (and peripheral) ecosystem within the country, but to bring change and transformation to the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any transformation led by Canada will be seen by the world and developing economies as a reference model for adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join DIACC and what else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Vlinder joined DIACC to participate and contribute to an important initiative, which is not only transformational for the Canadian population, but to the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>

There are a growing number of interpretations and implementations of various decentralized standards. These standards are at different stages in their development lifecycles, harmonizing gradually. As a result, there are lots of data, from lots of sources, that, without a little planning, won’t play nicely with other data. It is exciting to see the enthusiasm around the standards we know and love and to watch the proliferation of verifiable and portable data. With implementation boundaries as a hindrance, data interoperability will continue to be difficult. We could lose much utility and portability of the data. Luckily, in the midst of this excitement, a great opportunity presents itself: to forge bridges between data islands and promote the cross-pollination of methodologies for generating and exchanging verifiable data. Enter: the Presentation Exchange specification.</p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">Claims &amp; Credentials working group</a> has been hard at work on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange specification</a> for months. The effort, starting in January 2020, began to provide a solution to the question, “How should we request and exchange credentials across implementations and systems?” Though <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">a few solutions</a> <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0037-present-proof">have been proposed</a> <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">before</a>, none have been as inclusive in the data model and transport agnosticism, or able to attract broad adoption, as Presentation Exchange. The working group is working towards the first release — at the time of writing, we have made over 100 commits and closed 37 GitHub&nbsp;issues.</p><p>The specification prides itself on its adaptability, aiming to be “both credential format and transport envelope agnostic, meaning an implementer can use JWTs, VCs, JWT-VCs, or any other credential format, and convey them via OIDC, DIDComm, CHAPI, or any other transport envelope.” At the same time, Presentation Exchange has garnered the interest and support of many key-players throughout the ecosystem, a step crucial to fulfilling the ambitions of the specification.</p><p>You may be wondering, what’s up with the title? Isn’t interoperability much broader than sharing credentials? Yes! Absolutely. Sharing credentials is only part of interoperability. Universal wallets, secure data storage, transports, identifiers, DIDComm, and so many more pieces are paramount to thriving in an interoperable, decentralized ecosystem. At the heart of many of these interactions, we find ourselves exchanging verifiable data. By driving a standardized method for requesting and returning verifiable data, which adapts to many data models and functional use cases, we cross an important threshold in making interoperability possible. Without working software to back up the specification, it is merely an interesting idea. We need to go further — to make it an interesting reality.</p><p>Recognizing how important the Presentation Exchange spec and reference implementations could be for accelerating real interoperability and healthy competition, we, on the <a href="http://credentials.workday.com">Workday Credentials</a> team, are involved in the specification’s development and are investing significantly in one of its first demonstrable implementations. Workday has been a very active member of DIF since 2019. Our interests lie across the DIF stack, with a focus on standards compliance, affording us opportunities to interoperate with community members and standards adopters alike. Towards that end, we have <a href="https://github.com/workdaycredentials">open-sourced much of our code and specifications</a> relating to decentralized identity. For Presentation Exchange, we have <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange-implementations">recently pushed a Golang representation</a> of the object model that can be useful in building and validating presentation definitions, submissions, and verifiable presentations (as defined by the W3C standards). We are building out more Presentation Exchange logic that we plan to open source in the coming months. We intend to adopt Presentation Exchange at Workday as we gain confidence in the specification and its other implementations. We are considering different ways Presentation Exchange can be useful in interoperating with verifiable data that does not originate on our platform.</p><p>We are looking forward to seeing others contribute reference implementations in other languages and we encourage you to consider contributing to Presentation Exchange and DIF!

 Silpa Mukherjee, Ankita Deb &amp; Rahul&nbsp;Kumar  Session <p>We propose to design the panel as a workshop with three paper presentations followed by an open discussion with the house exploring the key question of media objects‟ (in the form of film/film music/memes/gifs/trolls) changing relations with law; copyright and piracy having attained newer connotations in the age of media convergence. While we deal with the materiality of cinema in the new media moment, the session will open out debates on the mutability of media objects in a networked digital terrain ushered in by fast growing and cost-effective internet culture in urban&nbsp;India.</p><p>In terms of methodology the panel deploys media archaeology to trace the mutations that film culture has undergone in the digital age. The coexistence of the obsolete media copyright with its meme and its digitally re-mastered copy on torrent informs the research that the three papers involve. A certain engagement with the logic of informed/fan-cinephilic digital labour that unwittingly maintains and updates the algorithmic database of Web 2.0 services will run through the presentations. Along with archival research and interviews with professionals involved with online media companies and “users” who are now the “pirate/prosumer-cinephiles” of media objects, we will carry out extensive digital ethnography to map the chimera of digital territory that user traffic based internet culture in India helped&nbsp;produce.</p><p>The digital is a space of intervention: a space for the users to intervene and play with the material online. It is a constant form of participation underscoring a potential for democratic authorship. The definitive notion of authorship voices the overarching body of the state through its legal status. Thus copyright as a legal entity produces a discourse of power through this form of authorship. The contemporary medium or rather the multi-media constellation driven by internet culture in India produces an alternative discourse on authorship, complicating the notion of copyright and piracy at the same time. This charged terrain of (il)legality is also due to the nature of piracy in the digital domain, which does not exist in isolation but have now created bodies or spheres where it has been appropriated as a sub-cultural practice. The figure of the “pirate”/ the “troll”/ the “fan” and the “cinephile” now merges with the technologically enabled body of the user of new media who negotiates with the medium in multiple ways (and morphs it) and thereby touches all kinds of spaces within and outside the webspace. It has changed the physical scope of cinephilia as addressed in the paper “A Laptop and a Pen-drive: Cinephiles of Mukherjee Nagar,” where the culture of networked sharing evolves from and further complicates physical stations. It has permeated into the body of film music in the paper “Licensed, Remixed and Pirated: Item numbers and the web”, which interrogates the layers of user-based morphs that the text of a dance number in Bollywood undergoes in the culture of web based remixing and hacking. It changes the way protected materials like films circulate in the space designated as YouTube, marked by its ability to reproduce copyright materials without violating the law as the third paper titled “Online Streaming in the Era of Digital Cinephilia” points out; the logic of the obsolete license of old Hindi films which gains a new viral life on YouTube with its official upload vying with the multiple hacker-user uploads.</p><p>Thus the panel intends to explore the dizzying overlaps that produce this internet induced distinct zone of ambiguity that neither the law nor the state or the author can claim ownership over. The very embodiment of the material in the digital is in transition i.e. in a state of being morphedby the blurring of the identities of the multiple bodies at work at each moment. Through the three papers we intend to chart this transitional aesthetic sometimes contained and sometimes flowing out of the body of the media text onto the physical, technological and extra textual objects as well. The panel seeks to position this new world of media objects that overlap and form an uncontainable entity, seeking newer forms of negotiations with the older existing order. We seek to explore then what happens to the very essence of author(ity)ship when digital enters its&nbsp;domain.</p> Plan <p>A Laptop and a Pen-drive: Cinephiles of Mukherjee Nagar</p><p>With the changes technology has brought to contemporary life, cinephiles — for whom movies are a way of life, films and how they are experienced have undergone major changes. The classic cinephile, as the term was adopted in the 1960s has undergone a major change in the era of internet piracy. I will look at the way pirated films via torrent downloads are consumed by students in certain pockets in New Delhi especially around Mukherjee Nagar area. These students who come from the upwardly mobile Indian middle class families are engaged inpreparations of competitive exams to land a lucrative government job. Circumstances dictate that these students own a laptop to watch films but not a high speed internet connection. To fuel their cinephilic urge, they are dependent upon soft copy vendors of pirated films. These vendors are like a video library, the repository here being a laptop and a storage drive. These professional film pirates depend upon the p2p file sharing commonly referred as “torrent.” DVD and Blu Rays released by official sources are ripped at a bigger size by certain uploaderswhich are downloaded by another one who rips it to an even smaller size, fit enough to be downloaded by pirates with a slower broadband till it reaches places like Mukherjee Nagar. Using this particular case study, where the world of online film piracy merges with a third world piracy domain, I plan to interrogate the logistics of a new kind of cinephilia and try and frame this particular form of informal circuit of media production and consumption into a coherent perspective.</p><p>Relevant websites: <a href="https://kat.cr/">https://kat.cr</a>, <a href="https://yts.la/">https://yts.la/</a>, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/">https://torrentfreak.com</a>.</p><p>Relevant software: Handbrake, uTorrent / Deluge /&nbsp;Vuze.</p><p>Relevant reading: Treske, Andreas. The Inner Life of Video Spheres: Theory for the YouTube Generation. Institute of Network Cultures, Amsterdam, 2013</p><p>Licensed, Remixed and Pirated: Item Numbers and the&nbsp;Web</p><p>The coming of new digital technologies has rendered the relationship of media objects’ with law extremely malleable and volatile. It urges us to rethink certain categories we have been working with, viz. piracy and copyright. The specific focus of the paper will be on item numbers’ relationship with changing technology and the law. The proprioceptive body being the central node of enquiry here: the law that affects the body that moves on screen and the body that is moved by the screen is made flexible in the digital age with Web 2.0’s unique design that spawns hackability and remixability. Through the registers of music licensing to YouTube, circulation of content offline as MP3 downloads in cheap mass storage devices, user generated morphed content related to item numbers (in the form of memes, GIFs, trolls, posters, tumblr blogs and listicles) spawned by amateur digital culture and remixing videos of film content the paper traces the gray zone between web based music piracy and its copyright rules. It will interrogate the moment when the entertainment industry has recognized the clear shift of its spectatorship from the older media to the more digital platforms and appropriates the contingency brought in by the algorithmic anxiety of Web 2.0 and its unique relationship with law and hence censorship regulations to innovate newer means of mass circulation and bypassing censorship.</p><p>Relevant content: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2O2dBonBok">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2O2dBonBok</a>.</p><p>Relevant user-traffic-oriented platforms: <a href="http://www.memegenerator.com/">http://www.memegenerator.com</a>, <a href="http://www.trolldekho.com/">http://www.trolldekho.com</a>, <a href="https://www.imgur.com/">http://www.imgur.com</a>, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">https://www.tumblr.com/</a>.</p><p>Relevant curated online media platforms: <a href="http://scoopwhoop.com/">ScoopWhoop</a>, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/india">Buzzfeed India</a>, <a href="http://blog.erosnow.com/">blog.erosnow.com</a>.</p><p>Online Streaming in the era of Digital Cinephilia</p><p>Digital piracy has allowed for certain democratization of film distribution and consumption through a parallel economy of piracy. The lack of control over these channels of distribution produces a blatant threat to the copyright and intellectual property rights that are quintessential to the mainstream culture of commercial film distribution. This paper will focus on the intersection of these two dichotomous cultures through the experience of watching old films via online streaming. The resurfacing of old films hosted by big corporations like Shemaroo, Venus and Ultra who began as film rights and video rights owners at one point host their old video content in a user generated space called youtube. The video content is a very specific form here. It is an obsolete entity, defined by its ambiguity with copyright that is able to make a legal transgression in order to circulate.</p><p>The circulation of the feature films in a web space that is primarily known for its clip culture also provides an interesting paradigm for the copyright material. The big corporate copyright floats in a culture of pirated experiences where the legal domain becomes a dizzying site of contradictions. Through this paper I will draw parallels between the history of these companies and their work in the field of film circulation and to the creation of a new form of cinephilia and its complicated relationship to the law. I will use a variety of archival sources, legal documents and discourses on online streaming to contextualize my argument.</p><p>Relevant websites: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ShemarooEnt">https://www.youtube.com/user/ShemarooEnt</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/VenusMovies">https://www.youtube.com/user/VenusMovies</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/UltraMovieParlour">https://www.youtube.com/user/UltraMovieParlour</a></p> Readings <p>None.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day1.DigitalDesires">IRC 2016: Day 1 #Digital Desires : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Silpa Mukherjee is a Delhi based research scholar.

<p>Esme Wardhaugh sat down with Andrew to talk about identity, and the digital community.</p>
 What is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Andrew Weaver
<p>I wear a number of hats – from Digital Identity Aotearoa/New Zealand, to independent consulting, helping equip organisations with payments technology through to supporting mahi aroha (literally ‘love work’) with charities and social enterprises. I love supporting people to reach their full potential, especially if it involves challenging the status quo.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>A common thread of applying knowledge of technology and systems (including human systems) to improve and add value. I’m most definitely not a fan of shiny tech for shiny tech’s sake!</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Knowledge and wisdom is everywhere around us – in nature, in history, in different perspectives and worldviews. My most effective and rewarding role is in exploring and drawing that wisdom out, rather than assuming my own narrow perspective is shared by everyone.</p>
 What’s your message to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they start, stop or continue doing – and why? 
<p>Identity is Taonga, a Māori word meaning something that is treasured and cherished. When we change our view of identity information and recognise it as something very personal and very precious we will start to treat it with a lot more dignity, care and respect. That means stopping treating identity as a means to a monetised marketing end and stopping the wholesale harvesting and sale of personal information.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>I have to quote your own motto (which I do all the time, by the way) – Identity systems built for everyone are built by everyone. #ForAllByAll</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>Technically Wrong is a great book on inclusive design.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Explore More</p>
 Where can we find you on social media / the Web? 
<p>On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewweavernz/">LinkedIn</a> and at <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">digitalidentity.nz</a>.</p>

 Guiding Principles 
<p>At Women in Identity, we strive for a diverse, inclusive, and equitable workplace iwhere all volunteers and members feel valued and respected, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, sexual orientation or identity, education or (dis)ability, .experiences and heritages and will ensure that all voices are valued and heard equally.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We aim to create a model for diversity and inclusion that the identity industry can adopt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide informed, authentic leadership for cultural equality, Women in Identity strives to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 See diversity, inclusion and equality as critical to the well-being of our staff and the identity communities we serve.&nbsp; 
 Acknowledge and dismantle any inequalities within our policies, systems, programs and services and continually update and report our progress.&nbsp; 
 Explore potential underlying, unquestioned assumptions that interfere with inclusiveness.&nbsp; 
 Advocate for and support board-level thinking about how systemic inequalities impact our organisation, and how best to address that in a way that is consistent with our mission. 
 Help to challenge assumptions about what it takes to be a strong leader and champion diversity of leadership at all levels of our organisation &nbsp; 
 Practise and encourage transparent communication in all interactions. 
 Lead with respect and tolerance. We expect all members to embrace this notion and to express it in organisation interactions and through everyday practices. 
 
<p>Women in Identity commits to promoting diversity and inclusion in our workplaces:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Pursue cultural competency throughout our organisation by creating substantive learning opportunities and formal, transparent policies. 
 Generate and aggregate quantitative and qualitative research related to equity<br>
to make incremental, measurable progress toward the visibility of our diversity, inclusion, and equity efforts. Once the content is curated it will be added to our website so others can access. 
 Improve our cultural leadership pipeline by creating and supporting programs and policies that foster leadership that reflects the diversity of communities that the identity industry serves.&nbsp; 
 Pool resources and expand offerings for underrepresented constituents by connecting with other identity organisations committed to diversity and inclusion efforts. 
 Develop and present sessions on diversity, inclusion, and equality to provide information and resources internally, and to members, the community, and the identity industry.&nbsp; 
 Develop a system for being more intentional and conscious of bias during the hiring, promoting, or evaluating process.&nbsp; 
 Include a salary range with all public job descriptions.&nbsp; 
 Advocate for public and private-sector policy that promotes diversity, inclusion, and equity. Challenge systems and policies that create inequity, oppression and disparity. 
 
 Our 2020 Goals 
 
 Opening a US entity 
 Restructuring Board of Directors 
 Renewed focus on supporting non-western markets&nbsp;
 
 Ambassador in India 
 Seeking out multiple ambassadors for Africa 
 
 
 External Diversity Review

<p>In the digital space, people need new solutions to know the identity of who they are dealing with and whether or not they can trust them. A number of initiatives are working on the future of digital identity. Some of them are government-led while others are linked to specific private institutions or proprietary technologies.</p>
<p>Banks and insurers are in a unique position to offer trust verification services built on their long track record of protecting personal information and providing banking privacy. They also have much at stake in how digital identity develops. The future of the customer relationship could be significantly altered in some scenarios, while in others they can build on traditional strengths, leverage their capabilities and monetize services they provide to the data economy. Recent developments have heightened the implications as COVID-19 accelerated digitalization and placed greater emphasis on Digital Identity as a critical underlying building block of the economy. At the same time, large tech firms are rapidly enhancing their capabilities as hubs of health data (in addition to the other areas they dominate).</p>
<p>The Institute of International Finance is collaborating with the OpenID Foundation, member firms, officials and various other entities to support the Open Digital Trust initiative, an interoperable and open source development with the objectives of introducing foundational trust into the global digital economy. It aims to create a vibrant marketplace for Digital Trust services which help individuals and entities to confirm identity and understand and manage risk. Specific workstreams have been mobilized (each with their respective working groups), with the IIF leading on policy development &amp; OpenID leading on technical standards.</p>
 
 Technical protocols: This group is developing updated standards by 2021. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.openid.net">openid.net</a> or contact Don Thibeau, Executive Director at <a href="mailto:don@oidf.org">don@oidf.org</a> 
 Policy initiative: will develop policy recommendations, requirements, and guidance for both public and private stakeholders in support the project’s wider objectives. Publishing target Q4’2020. 
 
<p>The Open Digital Trust Policy Initiative will build on guiding principles with focus groups developing the specific details in the following areas:</p>
 
 Individual centricity / purpose: Balance protecting individual rights (control, privacy) with a perspective among all stakeholder interests (individual, societal, corporate). Look across jurisdiction and regional approaches, such as the EU and ASEAN, to balance individual privacy with broader societal interests. 
 Liability / legal frame: Create a market-based mechanism for addressing liability and legal frameworks of reference. 
 Interoperability: Explore frameworks across geographies and develop “concordance mapping” across platforms to demonstrate interoperability and common values across different sectors, countries, and models such as self-sovereignty. 
 Role of governments / public sector / academia 
 
<p>Participation in each of these working groups and their deliberations are open to all, without any cost or obligation.</p><p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2020/08/27/open-digital-trust-initiative-a-proposal-for-financial-institutions-to-use-an-open-standards-protocol-to-verify-identity-protect-privacy-and-build-trust/">Open Digital Trust Initiative: A Proposal for Financial Institutions to Use an Open Standards Protocol to Verify Identity, Protect Privacy and Build Trust</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a>.</p>

<p>Members of the <a href="http://id2020.org">ID2020</a> Alliance are united in the belief that identity is a fundamental and universal human right and that we all deserve better ways to prove who we are — both in the physical world and&nbsp;online.</p><p>As a community of technologists, advocates, implementers, and funders, we also believe that ethically implemented, privacy-protecting, user-managed, and portable digital ID solutions offer a better alternative to the current “data as a commodity” paradigm.</p><p>A new report from KPMG entitled, <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2020/new-imperative-corporate-data-responsibility.html">The New Imperative for Corporate Data Responsibility</a>, suggests that the American public increasingly agrees with this perspective. Based on a survey of 1,000 respondents, the report concludes that consumers expect corporations to “take significant steps to better protect, manage, and ethically use their&nbsp;data.”</p><blockquote>“The findings are unmistakable,” says Orson Lucas, Principal, KPMG Cyber Security Services. “Data privacy and protection are clear priorities for consumers. Close attention to customer data handling, management, and protection practices are key, foundational elements of establishing and maintaining digital&nbsp;trust.”</blockquote><p>The report outlines valuable findings regarding how the public feels about the security of their data, the issues that concern them, and who they believe bears responsibility for creating a more secure and trustworthy digital ecosystem.</p><p>Key Findings: Beliefs</p>  97 percent of respondents say that data privacy is important to&nbsp;them  87 percent believe that data privacy is a human&nbsp;right  86 percent believe that data privacy is a growing&nbsp;concern  68 percent don’t trust companies to ethically sell their private&nbsp;data  54 percent don’t trust companies to use their personal data in an ethical&nbsp;way  53 percent don’t trust companies to collect data in an ethical&nbsp;way  50 percent don’t trust companies to protect their personal&nbsp;data  <p>These insights should not surprise us. After all, a majority of Americans have, at one time or another, been personally affected by a data breach. On the one hand, it is encouraging to see that public opinion is shifting; our experiences have made us all more cognizant of how our identity and personal data are being misused and mismanaged. On the other hand, these experiences are also contributing to a growing mistrust of all forms of digital ID. For those who work in this space, this is a timely reminder that, as we develop and deploy new forms of digital ID, we must do so with an intentional focus and abiding commitment to rebuild and maintain public&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Key Findings: Concerns</p>  83 percent of respondents worry most about the theft of their Social Security Number, followed by their credit card number (69 percent), and their passwords (49&nbsp;percent)  Only 16 percent are worried about their medical records being stolen. Medical records are the most commonly cited example of data that consumers trust companies to protect (57&nbsp;percent)  <p>Given these rapidly changing consumer opinions, and with our vision of good digital ID for all as our guiding star, we at ID2020 regularly revisit the question: how do we get&nbsp;there?</p><p>The data suggest what we have long believed: that, in the coming years, market forces (i.e. consumer demands) will drive tectonic shifts in the data economy. But will market forces be&nbsp;enough?</p><p>Most telling in the data is that the public is most likely to trust healthcare companies to protect the privacy of their medical records. Laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) establish robust data protections and stiff penalties for companies that mishandle data. These offer the public a degree of confidence that their health information will be held sacrosanct.</p><p>The house is on fire and that the public is finally smelling the smoke when it comes to data security. Market forces can be extremely powerful, but we expect that governments will play an equally important, catalytic role by establishing the regulatory frameworks and consumer protections necessary to rebuild trust and encourage the broad adoption of safe and secure digital ID applications.</p><p>Here as well, the KPMG data provides some valuable insights for policymakers.</p><p>Key Findings: Who is Responsible</p>  91 percent of respondents say that corporations should take the lead in establishing corporate data responsibility  56 percent say that companies should prioritize giving consumers more control over their data in&nbsp;2020  84 percent are open to state legislatures giving consumers more control over their&nbsp;data  <blockquote>“Data privacy issues are not going to go away,” says KPMG Cyber Security Services Principle, Steve Stein. “In fact, consumer protections around data privacy, like the ones provided by the CCPA, are very likely to be codified in other states and eventually at the federal level. Simply put, privacy laws are only going to increase in volume and rigor. That’s why visibility, protection, and trust is gaining such momentum in the marketplace and also why leading-edge companies are not looking at data privacy as just another compliance or check-the-box exercise. They see privacy as one of the pathways to growing their business by improving trust with their customers.”</blockquote><p>So…How DO We Get&nbsp;There?</p><p>Identity systems rely on trust to function; trust between issuers of identity and relying parties and, critically, that of those who use the system to prove their identity to access various goods, services, and privileges.</p><p>ID2020 was established in 2016 to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions. To achieve this vision, we are working simultaneously along three&nbsp;tracks.</p><p>We are helping shape the market through the ID2020 Certification, which applies 41 rigorous, outcome-based Technical Requirements to certify best-in-class digital ID solutions. We are working with policymakers in the United States and internationally to advocate for the ethical implementation of better forms of digital ID. And, as the technologies continue to evolve, we are implementing programs in the field to test and apply what we learn as these systems are replicated and brought to&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Fully realizing the potential of digital ID will require businesses, technology providers, policymakers, and civil society to collaborate — and quickly — to build and implement functional, privacy-preserving, user-managed ID systems, and work to overcome the mistrust which could impede their broad adoption. We developed the ID2020 Alliance model to foster this collaboration.</p><p>The road to good ID for all is riddled with potholes…and we have one chance to get this&nbsp;right.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implementation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights, while ensuring data remains private and in the hands of the individual.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/new-report-highlights-public-concerns-about-data-privacy-6cfd1e248d49">New Report Highlights Public Concerns About Data Privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 “Covid State of Play” examines sick buildings, planning lags, and reopening <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/carolyn-schmitt">Carolyn&nbsp;Schmitt</a></p>A tent hospital in Central Park. Photo: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Central_Park_tent_hospital_(2)_jeh.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a><p>In the absence of leadership guidelines for mitigating COVID-19, creative solutions — in concert with established public health recommendations — are&nbsp;key.</p><p>Low-cost air quality sensors, rethinking what schools look like, and identifying new modes of collaboration are a few of the creative approaches discussed during a recent discussion hosted by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a> and <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/margaret-bourdeaux">Magaret Bourdeaux</a> of the Berkman Klein Center’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/bkc-policy-practice-digital-pandemic-response">Digital Pandemic Response</a>&nbsp;program.</p><p>The talk examined the current “Covid State of Play,” and covered COVID-19 testing, school reopenings, and ventilation. Their guest, <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/joseph-allen/">Joseph Allen</a>, is an Assistant Professor of Exposure Assessment Science at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public&nbsp;Health.</p><p>Bourdeaux, also of the Harvard Medical School’s Global Public Policy and Social Change program and the Harvard Kennedy School’s Security and Global Health Project, outlined the current testing situation in the United States, urging for more action and implementation.</p><p>“I think this is all about hard work. It is about systematic planning. It is about leadership and not counting [on] that there’s going to be some miracle cure, some miracle intervention that is going to save us. We are going to have to actually do the work that is required to control this outbreak and we just have to grow up and do it,” she&nbsp;said.</p><p>Allen added that there ongoing work on a rapid saliva-based at-home test, which needs to be reviewed by the FDA but has the potential to be a quick, accessible, low-cost test. “There is the technology available for at-home rapid tests. To Margaret’s point, we need it now,” he said, noting that the test isn’t the same as the PCR tests currently in use. “It takes a different mentality. It’s not a diagnostic test like we expect at the doctor’s office. It’s a tool to control the pandemic or help control the pandemic, so we need a mindset shift here and think about how we think about testing.”</p><p>School reopenings without testing infrastructure and public health implementations are also a pressing concern. Atop the testing challenges, many schools and universities have buildings with poor ventilation, Zittrain pointed out. Bourdeaux and Allen emphasized how being outside is safer than being indoors, but buildings with good ventilation are important for mitigating the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>“We are in the sick building era,” Allen said, meaning many buildings meet only minimum air quality standards to save energy. “So we’re paying the consequence right now for our choices that we’ve stopped designing buildings for&nbsp;people.”</p><p>Zittrain inquired about the use of carbon dioxide sensors in indoor spaces to monitor the air quality, a tool Allen said is already in use, and that his lab has also built. “Some of these can connect to the building information system, so in real-time it can, to your point, ‘hey, your CO2 hit a certain level. Let’s open up the dampers in here.’ In fact, it’s called demand control ventilation,” Allen explained.</p><p>But the availability of low-cost carbon dioxide sensors means employees can also raise red flags about air quality. “It’s democratized this healthy buildings idea and people are sharing that data. They are sharing that. Buildings are getting labeled sick buildings,” he said. “People can finally make the invisible visible with these cheap sensors.”</p><p>With “sick buildings” as a backdrop, the conversation shifted to whether schools should reopen. Allen, a <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/harvard-expert-outlines-recommendations-for-school-reopenings/">proponent </a>for reopening schools, argued there should be prerequisites to opening: “One, you have to control the spread and two, you have to make enhancements to your risk reduction strategies within the school. So it’s the when and the what. When to open and what has to be done, and so that’s where I’ve been bullish to say hey, if you do those things, sure, schools should&nbsp;open.”</p><p>Allen cited recent reopening failures in states like Georgia as examples of when these conditions were not met and should not have opened. “I am confident if we meet those metrics you’ll have low community spread and the probability of entering into the school and your new cases lower, that’s obvious as a numbers game. And then if you put these other strategies in place which we know work in hospitals and elsewhere, including and beyond airborne transmission, it’s mask-wearing, it’s de-identification, it’s managing flows of people and queues of people,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Bourdeaux echoed Allen’s concerns, emphasizing the importance of controlling community transmission, including case counts, and “understanding how robust your public health measures to end community transmission are.”</p><p>She compared the current response to the virus to the way people experience a hurricane, where the storm blows over and the perceived danger subsides. Instead, she said, there is more work to do from a public health perspective before having the reopening conversation. Bourdeaux said having a national plan and for having the important conversations to help stop the spread of the virus should be part of this action&nbsp;plan.</p><p>“We’re not having a very intelligent conversation about really what we’re dealing with to date, and so that’s not related to schools and whether schools could be made safe,” she said. “They absolutely can be made safe. We’ve seen buildings like hospitals, as Dr. Allen has pointed out. We can make places safe but I think that it’s asking a lot to say okay, let’s reopen schools when we’re not having a smart conversation about where we stand with community transmission in general.”</p><p>While children have lower infection and mortality rates, Allen countered that schools play an important function for many students, and other risks — such as access to food and virtual dropout — should be factored in as well. “If we don’t think there are consequences to keeping tens of millions of kids outside of school, they’re at higher risk of abuse and neglect, exploitation. The loss of learning. The loss of socialization. Over 30 million kids rely on schools for meals. These are massive costs and it’s horrifying to recognize that our country hasn’t prioritized this,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Along similar lines, Zittrain asked whether any official guidelines for reopening might further intensify the inequalities between wealthier communities — who have access to more resources — and marginalized communities, who are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.</p><p>These inequalities will still exist with virtual schooling, Allen said. “This virus is exposing deep fissures within our society, the structural racism that’s in our society that exists within these schools. If we keep kids all at home that’s going to exist for the exact same reason and if you bring back some, well that inequality, inequity is going to exist and be exacerbated as well. There’s no simple answer here other than honestly it’s a systemic issue that needs to be fixed and fixed&nbsp;fast.”</p><p>To address these myriad challenges presented by COVID-19, Zittrain asked about best practices for sharing information and working together. Both Allen and Bourdeaux underscored the great opportunities and responses they have seen. Allen described the past few months as a period of great collaboration and camaraderie with “the whole world, every scientist and medical professional is focused on the same problem.” As an illustration of such new collaboration, he cited <a href="https://schools.forhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2020/06/Harvard-Healthy-Buildings-Program-Schools-For-Health-Reopening-Covid19-June2020.pdf">a report</a> he worked on to advise school superintendents. Bourdeaux similarly emphasized how so many people are trying to take action to help and support during the pandemic, and referred to a <a href="https://apnews.com/9126a38ef22c244f9ca18f9584061f8d">recent poll</a> that says most Americans support a mask&nbsp;mandate.</p><p>The trio also explored creative ways to host schools, such as makeshift schools outside, similar to how hospitals made tented spaces in parks. Allen pointed to an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/27/we-can-must-reopen-schools-heres-how/">op-ed he wrote </a>outlining steps to reopen, which includes temporary school&nbsp;spaces.</p><p>“Let’s put some tents. Let’s use the ball field. Let’s get creative. Look at what the medical community did…There were tents in Central Park,” he said. “We should turn convention centers into schools. Let’s put tents in every park. We can get real creative here instead of saying well, we have this old crumbling infrastructure, what are we going to do? Let’s just jam a thousand kids back into it and do everything the same way. Instead, I think there are some creative solutions out&nbsp;there.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/no-simple-answer-99085ffd0623">“No simple answer”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

It highlights why digital identity offers many different ways to present ourselves and walks through the basics of how ID today is dominated by mega-IdPs (identity providers). It gets to the conceptual heart of what SSI is about. It also shows a real live demonstration of a scooter-authorization project spearheaded by T-Mobile&nbsp;Germany.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81GkdBRmsbE&amp;t=9s">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Foam Figure Explainer v2</a> 9min<br>John Phillips from 460 Degrees, a consulting firm from Sydney, AU, updated his earlier video in January of 2020. This level-setting and first-introduction was designed to help Phillips’ clients understand what SSI looks like from a business-process perspective, which is the key perspective from which large enterprises are mostly likely to decide how much to invest in researching and considering SSI solutions. For more guidance on B2B sales and education, see his longer <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/explaining-ssi-c-suite-executives-anyone-else-john-phillips-webinar-48/">February presentation</a> at SSI Meetup about how to explain SSI to C-Level executives.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AydQmOTcECk">The True Meaning of Identity </a>38 min<br>In September 2019, Kaliya Young presented to SIBOS (the conference of the SWIFT settlement network central to global banking) in their Innovation Track.

For these, they invite leaders of influential SSI projects from around the world. These events have a loyal following of regular attendees, making for a spirited Q&amp;A session at the end of each video. While most of the videos tend towards deep dives in specific technical, governance, business, or regional topics, some of them can be useful, accessible, and inspiring for novices. Here are a few we recommend in particular as “novice-friendlier deep&nbsp;dives”:</p>  At the Core of SSI is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcfy9wd5bZI">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> 50min by Drummond&nbsp;Reed  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/self-sovereign-identity-explained-cios-steve-manning-webinar-44/">CIO Brief: Why SSI is Important</a> 65min by Steve&nbsp;Magennis  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/hyperledger-aries-open-source-interoperable-identity-solutions-nathan-george-webinar-30/">Introduction to Hyperledger Aries</a> 71min by Nathan&nbsp;George  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/sovereignty-historical-context-self-sovereign-identity-natalie-smolenski-webinar-18/">Sovereignty in Historical Context</a> 55min by Natalie Smolenski  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/self-sovereign-identity-healthcare-dr-manreet-nijjar-webinar-21/">SSI In Healthcare</a> 63min by Manreet&nbsp;Nijjar   — Organizational Centers of Gravity in&nbsp;SSI  <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (you are&nbsp;here) <p>This organization was formed as a Joint Development Foundation project in 2017 and has grown to be a major venue for IPR-protected co-development among large and small industry players. It has historically focused on the development of both working open-source code and pre-standard specifications for decentralized identity, but it is starting to branch out into non-technical forms of cooperation for the purposes of market-building and to promote all open decentralized identity technology, whether created in DIF or elsewhere.</p> <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">The W3C Credentials Community Group</a> <p>This public discussion group is affiliated with the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), a standards organization for web technologies supported by membership dues and responsible for the management of core protocols like HTML and TLS.

Organizational members and individual members come together to create an ongoing dialogue between “consumers” and ethical businesses to shape new types of markets for digital services. Rooted in the values of the <a href="https://mydata.org/declaration/">MyData Declaration</a>, they focus primarily on elaborating refined, nuance, and bottoms-up models for data governance; only from a solid governance foundation do they begin to make policy, business, and technology decisions. They recently published the <a href="https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/Understanding-Mydata-Operators-pages.pdf">MyData Operators paper</a>, bringing their policy, business, and technological goals more squarely into the realm of decentralized identity.</p> <a href="https://sovrin.org/">The Sovrin Foundation</a> <p>Since the early days of decentralized identity, Sovrin has been one of the major hubs of innovation and entrepreneurship, serving as a kind of all-in-one community, codebase, blockchain, and better business bureau. They have also published many canonical educational and marketing texts that have been foundational to the development of “self-sovereign identity” as a sector of the software industry. The Aries project (housed in the Hyperledger Foundation) and the Trust-over-IP foundation are, in a sense, spin-outs of the Sovrin foundation, and both remain loosely based (sometimes by design, sometimes by momentum) on the Sovrin community’s codebase, ledger, and design principles. The fastest way to familiarize yourself with these is the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/">whitepaper library</a> on the Foundation’s website.</p> Standards organizations <p>These centers of gravity are where ideas and business models evolve in broad conversation. Inevitably, structuring ground rules and governance models for these eventually have to be negotiated between technical experts and standards adopted before major investments (of capital, but also of legislation and public good will) can be approved.

<p>ID2020 is proud to announce the certification of Immunity Passport from BLOK Bioscience, a digital ID-based solution for COVID health status certificates. Immunity Passport is the first COVID-focused solution to be certified by&nbsp;ID2020.</p><p>Immunity Passport offers individuals a self-sovereign record of their testing, antibody and, ultimately, vaccination status. Initially envisioned as a means to help businesses and governments manage the safe and incremental return to public life in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the solution is expected to be applied more broadly in the future to support immunization certificates and the transmission of other medical test&nbsp;results.</p><blockquote>“The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust digital credentials into the global spotlight,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “As we consider digital ID-based solutions for public health applications, getting the technology right is not negotiable. We intentionally set a high bar for certification and are delighted to recognize the BLOK Bioscience Immunity Passport solution for meeting our high standards for privacy protection, user-management, portability, and&nbsp;more.”</blockquote><p>To be eligible for certification, solutions must adhere to 41 functional, outcomes-based<a href="https://id2020.org/uploads/files/Technical-Requirements.pdf"> Technical Requirements</a>. In addition to providing a roadmap to help developers create better products, the ID2020 Certification also provides a “third-party seal of approval” so that implementers — and ultimately, end-users — can trust that the technology was developed in accordance with the highest ethical and technical standards.</p><blockquote>“Pandemic management is essentially an entirely new solution domain,” said BLOK Solutions Chief Technology Officer, Areiel Wolanow. “The precedents we set now will set the standard for how the future unfolds, so we have a duty to get things right. By starting with the principle that individuals should always be the sole owner of their data, it is our hope at BLOK that this a standard that others will find it exceedingly difficult to deviate&nbsp;from.”</blockquote><p>The ID2020 Certification is already impacting the technical landscape for digital ID and technology providers of all sizes are increasingly aligning their technical approaches to comport with ID2020’s requirements. To date, more than 30 technology providers from every corner of the globe have submitted applications and worked with the ID2020 staff and advisory committees to complete the application process.</p><p>Today, Immunity Passport joins Kiva Protocol, Gravity.earth, and ZAKA as part of a small, but rapidly growing, cadre of ID2020 certified digital ID solutions.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p><a href="http://www.id2020.org/">www.ID2020.org</a></p><p>About BLOK BioScience, Ltd.</p><p>BLOK BioScience is part of the BLOK Group. With a network of global experts and a robust and far-reaching supply chain, we provide trusted and authentic solutions to help respond to the rapidly changing population wellness landscape.</p><p>Our unique combination of medical and strategic expertise and technical knowledge results in secure and compliant solutions for tracking and verifying immunity, and we use rapid antibody testing and recording to enable governments and industry to manage viral outbreaks and mitigate the economic and social effects of pandemics</p><p><a href="http://www.blokbioscience.com/">www.blokbioscience.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-announces-certification-of-blok-bioscience-immunity-passport-1f86013e9da5">ID2020 Announces Certification of BLOK Bioscience Immunity Passport</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">Support for FIDO in browsers and operating systems</a> is widespread and growing fast. Enterprises now have better tools to replace easily compromised passwords with simpler, stronger FIDO Authentication and eliminate phishing, man-in-the-middle and other security attacks. But, if you want to deploy FIDO in your enterprise, what are the first steps? Do you need to explain “why FIDO?” to your CISO? What do the timelines look like? Should you build your own server or work with a vendor? What FIDO authenticators should you accept? How do you manage&nbsp; them?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance Enterprise Deployment Working Group (EDWG) will answer these questions, and more, in its new white paper series. The series aims to educate corporate management and IT security on the improvements available for authentication today and how to leverage them within their own organizations. This work is dedicated to eliminating passwords and securing the simple act of logging into company systems and applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First up in the series is the primer “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/">CXO Explanation: Why Use FIDO for Passwordless Employee Logins</a>?” This document is the guide for you and/or the executive leaders in your organization as to why you should invest in FIDO2 deployment for your employees.</p>



<p>It addresses all of the common questions from CXOs on the value proposition of FIDO Authentication and how the FIDO2 passwordless framework addresses the authentication needs and challenges of companies for the modern workforce. Read it now at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/">https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/</a> and pass it along to colleagues.</p>



<p>Subsequent entries in this educational series will focus on server deployment, authenticator choices, authenticator life-cycle management, and credential acceptance in the enterprise. This series is part of the Alliance’s strategy to provide expert deployment guidance to our community in order to support the rapidly growing number of FIDO implementations across a variety of use cases. Please watch this space as we publish more in this Enterprise Series over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Mavennet?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mavennet.com/">Mavennet’s</a> vision is to build a new world of trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We strive to empower large enterprises with better and more effective ways to securely share information and value. We build on technologies such as blockchain and AI to help transform entire industries. Our focus extends to several industries: financial services, supply chain, energy, the public sector and media and entertainment. Our business focuses on challenging the status quo of industries that are in need for disruption, either internally or externally.</p>



 <a href="https://www.mavennet.com/"></a> 



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Identity is at the foundation of any sharing of value or information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional identity management systems are vulnerable to single points of failure, they raise privacy issues for the data they carry and limit the possibility of secure interoperability. In industries with business processes that rely on complex workflows or transactions amongst multiple stakeholders, the need for trustworthy digital identity becomes paramount.</p>



<p>At Mavennet, we are implementing decentralized identifiers to our suite of supply chain products to be able to associate a robust digital identity to actors and assets along a network. In conjunction with verifiable credentials (VCs) we&nbsp;enable cryptographically sound and privacy preserving claims that provide transparency and traceability to value chain participants. Ultimately, this trusted digital history of physical assets enables industries to have reliable provenance of goods and attribute actions to stakeholders. This addresses the most pressing pain points of global supply chains: traceability, auditability, flexibility and stakeholder management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlocking trustworthy digital identity in a way that is easy to implement in existing enterprise environments and can be readily adopted by multiple industries is crucial. It opens new pathways to emerging markets that are vulnerable to lack of trust amongst participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does Mavennet address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the lack of responsiveness and flexibility of global supply chains, as evidenced by the spike in closures of manufacturing facilities and the unmet demand for basic commodities. An added concern for international trade is the rise in counterfeiting, which exceeds&nbsp;$900 billion USD annually. These threats to the security and stability of global supply chains can be in part offset by the adoption of digital identities. Their power to unlock fast, secure and trustworthy exchanges, can significantly improve the operational and business process efficiency of industries as a whole. This overhaul of internal traditional processes translates into more globally competitive businesses and positions Canada as an incrementally valuable trading partner.</p>



<p>Mavennet has been deeply involved in the space of decentralized identities and VCs&nbsp;through the deployment of an energy traceability platform that provides end-to-end visibility of assets. This solution, called Neoflow, has laid out new standards for exchange of data in the form of VCs between supply chain stakeholders by identifying them with a unique decentralized identifier. Our goal is to aid the transformation towards digital identities by providing a set of standards and APIs that enable seamless integration with other vendors with the same vision and legacy systems.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>Canada is particularly well poised to act as a leader in this space, given its strong international voice relative to its size.</p>



<p>Canada has a unique opportunity to drive the standards for adoption at an international level, due to its position as a global emerging innovation ecosystem and technology hub. Further, as a top global exporter of crude oil, gold, wheat, aluminum and others, Canada plays a key role in the way that international trade is conducted. The country has the international relevance to coordinate and propagate digital identity initiatives.</p>



<p>5. Why did Mavennet join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Defining identity standards collaboratively is an essential step when you are looking at transforming entire industries. Up to now we have been doing work with decentralized identity and VCs standards applied to the industries we focus on. We hope to leverage our experience and vision to contribute to the work DIACC does and help raise the water level for Canadian technology as a whole.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about Mavennet?</p>



<p>We are currently working on exciting solutions for governments and multinational companies in Canada, US and Europe. The core IP of these solutions involves identity management, asset traceability, digital assets, analytics and artificial intelligence. Some of these are:</p>



  <a href="https://www.mavennet.com/solutions/neoflow/">Neoflow</a> – provides end-to-end digital traceability for energy. In particular we are working with the United States Department of Homeland Security&nbsp; to help with traceability in the oil and gas sector. Multiparty, real-time, immutable data and insights gathered by Neoflow allows governments and key stakeholders to make data-backed decisions on supply/demand, regulation policies and tariffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.mavennet.com/solutions/metaltrail/">MetalTrail</a> – traces the steel value chain, including materials’ dependencies, to certify the true origin, quality and environmental footprint of steel products.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.mavennet.com/solutions/qcad/">QCAD</a> – is the first fully-regulated Canadian Dollar Stablecoin. This product was created through Stablecorp, a joint venture between 3iQ and Mavennet.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.mavenstamp.com/">MavenStamp</a> – seamlessly provides “immutability as a service” through an API. It enables non-technical users to timestamp data on the blockchain and obtain&nbsp; evidence of its existence.&nbsp;  



<p>Earlier this year Mavennet launched an EU sponsored multinational blockchain research project funded at $12 million CAD. Mavennet leads the consortium as the technical lead. In this way, we are excited to continue contributing to the digital identity space and to be in such a privileged company with the DIACC.&nbsp;</p>

 Daphne Keller discusses CDA 230, the executive order, and content moderation Daphne Keller (left) joined Oumou Ly (right) for the latest episode of The Breakdown.<p>In this episode of The Breakdown, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/oumou-ly">Oumou Ly</a> is joined by <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/daphne-keller">Daphne Keller</a> of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center to discuss the Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, content moderation and Big Tech platforms, and recent events that propelled them into the spotlight in recent&nbsp;months.</p><p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, or “The Twenty-Six Words That Created The Internet,” provides platforms legal immunity for third party speech — including by their users. It came under fire recently when President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/28/863932758/stung-by-twitter-trump-signs-executive-order-to-weaken-social-media-companies">signed an executive order </a>to limit protections for social media companies.</p><p>Read the transcript, which has been lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to the Breakdown. My name is Oumou; I’m a staff fellow on the Berkman Klein Center’s <a href="https://www.bkmla.org/">Assembly: Disinformation program</a>. Our topic of discussion today is CDA 230, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, otherwise known as “The Twenty-Six Words That Created The Internet.” Today I’m joined by Daphne Keller from the Stanford Cyber Policy&nbsp;Center.</p><p>Thank you for being with us today Daphne, I appreciate it, especially this conversation will help to unpack what has turned out to be such a huge and maybe consequential issue for the November election and certainly for technology platforms and all of us who care and think about this information really critically.</p><p>One of the first questions I have for you is a basic one, can you tell us a little bit about CDA 230 and why it’s referred to as The Twenty Six Words That Started The Internet?</p><p>Daphne Keller (DK): Sure. So first, I strongly recommend <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501714412/the-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet/">Jeff Kosseff’s book</a>, which coined that Twenty Six words phrase, it is a great history of CDA 230, and it’s very narrative.</p><p>So Intermediary Liability Law is the law that tells platforms what legal responsibilities they have for the speech and content posted by their users. And US law falls into three buckets. There’s a big bucket, which is about copyright, and there the law in point is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the DMCA, and it has this very choreographed notice and takedown&nbsp;process.</p><p>The other big bucket that doesn’t get a lot of attention is federal criminal law. There’s no special immunity for platforms for federal criminal law crimes. So if what you’re talking about is things like child sexual abuse material, material of support of terrorism, those things, the regular law applies. There is no immunity under CDA 230 or anything&nbsp;else.</p><p>And then the last big bucket, the one we’re here to talk about today is CDA 230, which was enacted in 1996 as part of a big package of legislation. Some of which was subsequently struck down by the Supreme Court, leaving CDA 230 standing as the law of the land. And it’s actually a really simple law, even though it’s so widely misunderstood that there’s now a <a href="https://twitter.com/badsec230takes?lang=en">Twitter account</a>, a Bad Section 230 Takes, just to retweet all the misrepresentations of it that come&nbsp;along.</p><blockquote>“Broadly speaking, the Internet could not exist the way we know it without something like CDA&nbsp;230”</blockquote><p>But what it says is, first, platforms are not liable for their users’ speech. Again, for the category of claims that are covered, so this isn’t about terrorism, child, sex abuse material, et cetera. But for things like state law defamation claims, platforms are not liable for their users’ speech. And the second thing it says is also platforms are not liable for acting in good faith to moderate content. So to enforce their own policies against content they consider objectionable.</p><p>And this, that second prong was very much part of what comes Congress was trying to accomplish with this law. They wanted to make sure that platforms could adopt what we now think of as terms of service or community guidelines and could enforce rules against hateful speech or bullying or pornography, or just the broad range of bad human behavior that most people don’t want to see on platforms. And the key thing that Congress realized, because they had experience with a couple of cases that had just passed that happened at the time, was that if you want platforms to moderate, you need to give them both of those immunities. You can’t just say you’re free to moderate, go do it. You have to also say, and if you undertake to moderate, but you miss something and there’s defamation… still on the platform or whatever, the fact that you tried to moderate won’t be held against&nbsp;you.</p><p>And this was really important to Congress because there had just been a case where a platform that tried to moderate was tagged as acting like an editor or a publisher and therefore facing potential liability. That’s the core of CDA 230. And I can talk more if it’s helpful about the things people get confused about, like the widespread belief that platforms are somehow supposed to be neutral, which is&nbsp;—</p><p>OL: Well, would you please say something about&nbsp;that.</p><p>DK: Yeah. Congress had this intention to get platforms to moderate. They did not want them to be neutral; they wanted the opposite. But I think a lot of people find it intuitive to say, well, it must be that platforms have to be neutral. And I think that intuition comes from a pre-Internet media environment where everything was either a common carrier, like a telephone, just interconnecting everything and letting everything flow freely. Or it was like NBC News or The New York Times — it was heavily edited, and the editor clearly was responsible for everything that the reporters put in there. And those two models don’t work for the Internet. If we still have just those two models today, we would still have only a very tiny number of elites with access to the microphone.</p><p>And everybody else would still not have the ability to broadcast our voices on things like Twitter or YouTube or whatever that we have today. And I think that’s not what anybody wants. What people generally want is they do want to be able to speak on the Internet without platform lawyers checking everything they say before it goes live. We want that. And we also — generally — also want platforms to moderate. We want them to take down offensive or obnoxious or hateful or dangerous but legal speech. And so 230 is the law that allows both of those things to happen at&nbsp;once.</p><p>OL: Okay. Daphne, can you talk a little bit about the two different types of immunity that are outlined under CDA 230 we call them shorthand (c )(1) and (c )&nbsp;(2)?</p><p>DK: Sure. So in the super shorthand, (c )(1) is immunity for leaving content up, and (c ) (2) is immunity for taking content&nbsp;down.</p><p>OL: Yeah.</p><p>DK: So most of the litigation that we’ve seen historically under the CDA is about (c )(1). It’s often really disturbing cases where something terrible happened to someone on the Internet, and a speech defaming them was left out, or speech threatening them was left up, or they continue to face things that were illegal. So those are cases about (c )(1). If the platform leaves that stuff up, are they liable? The second prong (c )(2) just hasn’t had nearly as much attention over the years until now. But that’s the one that says platforms can choose their own content moderation policy that they’re not liable for choosing to take down content they deem objectionable as long as they are acting in good&nbsp;faith.</p><p>And that’s the problem that does have this good faith requirement. And part of what the executive order attempts is to require companies to meet the good faith requirement in order to qualify for immunities. If someone can show that you are not acting in good faith, then you lose this much more economically consequential immunity under (c )(1) for contents that’s on your platform that’s&nbsp;illegal.</p><p>And the biggest concern I think for many people there is if this economically essential immunity is dependent on some government agency determining whether you acted in good faith. That introduces just a ton of room for politics because my idea of what’s good faith won’t be your idea of what’s good faith, won’t be Attorney General Barr’s idea of what’s good faith. And so having something where political appointees, in particular, get to decide what constitutes good faith and then all of your immunities hanging in the balance is really frightening for companies.</p><p>And, interestingly, today we see Republicans calling for a fairness doctrine for the Internet calling for a requirement of good faith or fairness in content moderation. But for a generation, it was literally part of the GOP platform every year to oppose the fairness doctrine that was enforced for broadcast by the FCC. President Reagan said it was unconstitutional. This was just like a core conservative critique of big government suppressing speech for decades, and now it has become their critique, and they’re asking for state regulation of platforms.</p><p>OL: That is so interesting to me, both that and the fact that CDA 230 in so many ways is what allows Donald Trump’s Twitter account to stay up. It’s really, really interesting that the GOP has decided to rail against&nbsp;it.</p><p>DK: It’s fascinating.</p><p>OL: So just recently, the president signed an executive order concerning CDA 230 pretty directly. Can you talk a little bit about what the executive order&nbsp;does?</p><p>DK: Sure. So I think I wanted to just start at a super high level with the executive order in the day or so after it came out, I had multiple people from around the world reach out to me and be like, this is like what happened in Venezuela when Chavez started shutting down the radio&nbsp;station.</p><p>It has this resonance of like, there is a political leader trying to punish speech platforms for their editorial policies. And that — before you even get into the weeds — that high-level impact of it is really important to pay attention to. And that is the reason why [the] CDT (the Center for Democracy and Technology) in DC has filed a First Amendment case saying this whole thing just can’t stand, we’ll see what happens with that&nbsp;case.</p><p>But, and there again like that’s not a bad idea, but then it leads to things in the executive order that I think don’t work. So then there are also in the executive order for other things that might be big deals. So one is that [the] DOJ has instructed to draft legislation to change 230. So eventually, that will come along, and presumably, it will track the very long list of ideas that are in the DOJ report that came out this week. [Editor’s note: this interview was recorded on June 18, 2020] A second is it instructs federal agencies to interpret 230 in the way that the executive order&nbsp;does.</p><p>This way that I think is not supported by the statute that takes the good faith requirement and applies it in places it’s not written in the statute. Nobody’s quite sure what that means because there just aren’t that many situations where federal agencies care about 230, but we’ll see what comes out of that. A third is that Attorney General Barr of the DOJ is supposed to convene state attorneys general to look at a long list of complaints. And this is like, if you look at it, if you’re an Internet policy nerd, it’s just all the hot button issues… are fact-checkers biased? Can algorithmic moderation be biased? And, well, it can. How can you regulate that? You will recognize these things if you look at the&nbsp;list.</p><p>And then the fourth one, and this is one that I think deserves a lot of attention is that DOJ is supposed to review whether platforms, particular platforms are quote problematic vehicles for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, unquote. And then, based on that, look into whether they can carry federally funded ads. This is I think for most platforms the ads dollars part is not that big a deal, but being on a federal government block list of platforms with disapproved editorial policies, just like has this McCarthyist feeling.</p><p>OL: Can you talk a little bit about the role of CDA in relation to the business models that the platforms run?</p><p>DK: Sure. So broadly speaking, the Internet could not exist the way we know it without something like CDA 230. And that’s not just about the Facebooks of the world, that’s about everything all up and down the technical stack DNS providers, CloudFlare, Amazon Web Services is another backend web hosting. And also tons of little companies, the knitting blog that permits comments or the farm equipment seller that has user feedback. All of those are possible because of CDA 230. And if you pull CDA 230 out of the picture, it’s just very hard to imagine the counterfactual of how American Internet technology and companies would have&nbsp;evolved.</p><p>They would have evolved somehow and, presumably, the counterfactual is we would have something like what the EU has, which boils down to a notice and takedown model for every kind of legal claim. But they’d barely have an Internet economy for these kinds of companies. There’s a reason that things developed the way that they&nbsp;did.</p><p>OL: Yeah. Do you think that there’s any, maybe not what you think, but I’m sure that we can all agree this is likely to be the case, if the liability shared with that 230 offers platforms is removed, how would that change the way that platforms approach content moderation?</p><p>DK: Well, I think a lot of little companies would just get out of the business entirely. And so there’s an advocacy group in DC called Engine, which represents startups and small companies, and they put together a really interesting <a href="https://www.engine.is/news/primer/section230costs">two-pager </a>on the actual cost of defending even frivolous claims in a world with CDA 230 and in a world without CDA 230. And it’s basically, you’re looking at 10 to 30 thousand dollars in the best-case scenario for a case that goes away very, very quickly even now. And that’s not a cost that small companies want to incur. And the investors there are all these surveys of investors saying, I don’t want to invest in new platforms to challenge today’s incumbents if they’re in a state of legal uncertainty where they could be liable for something at any time. So I think you just eliminate a big swath of the parts of both the existing parts of the Internet that policymakers don’t pay any attention to.</p><p>You make them very, very vulnerable, and some of them go away, and that’s troubling, and you create a lot of problems for any newcomers who would actually challenge today’s incumbents and try to rival them in serious user-generated content hosting services.</p><p>For the big platforms, for Facebook, for YouTube they’ll survive somehow, they’d change their business model, they probably&nbsp;… the easiest thing to do is, you use their terms of service to prohibit a whole lot more and then just like take down a huge swath, so you’re not facing much legal&nbsp;risk.</p><p>OL: Yeah. It’s hard to imagine living in that kind of a&nbsp;world.</p><p>DK: It is, it&nbsp;is.</p><p>OL: Yeah. Thank you so much for joining me today, Daphne. This was a great and enlightening conversation, and I’m sure our viewers will enjoy&nbsp;it.</p><p>DK: Thank you for having&nbsp;me.</p><p>OL: Thanks.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-daphne-keller-explains-the-communications-decency-act-84c93775f3b0">The Breakdown: Daphne Keller explains the Communications Decency Act</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>DIACC’s Written Submission for the Pre-Budget Consultations in Advance of the 2021 Budget</p>



<p>Ahead of the 2021 federal budget, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/FINA/StudyActivity?studyActivityId=10877390">asked</a>&nbsp;Canadians to share their input.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DIACC is pleased to have submitted a brief, calling on the Federal Government to implement the following recommendations:&nbsp;</p>



  Secure adoption of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PCTF-Overview-FINAL.pdf">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> by businesses and governments to ensure Canadians are well-protected and supported post-pandemic.  Work with provincial and territorial partners along with Citizenship and Immigration Canada to ensure that all Canadians have access to an ISO compliant government-issued digital ID credential with economy-wide utility by December 31, 2021.  Have digital identity and authentication efforts co-led by the Minister of Digital Government and the Minister of Innovation, Science, and Industry to ensure that both government service delivery and economic prosperity requirements are met.  Prioritize the funding and integration of digital ID as part of the <a href="https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/">Digital Technology Supercluster</a> Initiative.&nbsp;  Champion and educate on the crucial role of digital identity for businesses, health care centres, academic institutions, civil society, and all Canadians.

<p>Editor’s note: For the background information on the 2020 Hackathon in Korea, see the April blog post: “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-hackathon-goodbye-password-challenge-in-korea/">2020 FIDO Hackathon: Goodbye Password Challenge in Korea</a>.”&nbsp; To learn more about examples of proposed development ideas, please read the June blog post: “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-hackathon-in-korea-learn-implement-phase/">2020 FIDO Hackathon in Korea: Learn &amp; Implement Phase</a>.”</p>



<p>In the afternoon of July 1st, 2020, a Mid-Term Meetup Event for FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge was held at Telecommunication Technology Association (TTA). Originally, the Hackathon Steering Committee had planned a full-day onsite final implementation and evaluation day, followed by a month and a half online training phase.&nbsp; Due to the global pandemic, we had to change our schedules in accordance with school calendar disruptions and summer holidays. We decided to have a half-day mid-term meetup event for participants. This allowed us to help the teams to stay on course while providing a safe environment for people to learn from each other face-to-face.</p>







<p>Nineteen different teams participated in the event, half of them face-to-face with strict public health guidance applied, and the other half virtually. The meeting gave opportunities for teams to share their FIDO protocol-based online service development ideas and current development status, learn from each other and receive valuable feedback from FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group members.</p>







<p>In addition to sharing their projects’ current development status, the teams had the opportunity to present the “homework” they have completed after online training.&nbsp; The homework was writing a simple article on the web, with answers to the following questions:</p>



  What is FIDO Alliance?  What are the FIDO protocols?  What are the benefits of implementing FIDO protocols?  (Option) What services/products are you developing for the 2020 FIDO Hackathon and what would be the value of adopting FIDO protocols for online authentication?  



<p>We were very pleased with the articles we received. You can read examples (mostly in Korean) by visiting these following links:</p>



  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/yeocw3/222029532562">No matter how passwords are complicated, they are not safe!&nbsp; Learn FIDO concepts</a>  <a href="https://pongdang-pooh.tistory.com/9">FIDO Authentication: Good security knowledge to learn while you are quarantined at home</a>  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/owjs3901/222030081852">2020 FIDO Hackathon Homework – My Plan to Develop FIDO Based IoT Solution for Home</a>  <a href="https://blog.naver.com/lcwlyw/222032889174">FIDO – New technology standard to solve problems with IDs and Passwords&nbsp;</a>  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/woojim11/222011830343">Let’s learn about FIDO Alliance and FIDO Specs</a>  <a href="https://codstice.tistory.com/78">Summary on FIDO Alliance and FIDO Specs</a>  



<p>We hope this short blog gives you a better understanding of the current status of the 2020 FIDO Hackathon in Korea.&nbsp; We will be back soon with more updates after the final evaluation — scheduled for this week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation has made a considerable investment in 2020 in transitioning the certification program’s conformance test suite to a single, Java-based system. The Financial-grade API (FAPI) tests have been Java-based since early 2019 and now we are preparing to finish transitioning the OpenID Connect tests to the Java-based conformance test suite on Monday, August 31, 2020, at which point we plan to decommission the existing Python-based conformance suite. See <a href="https://openid.net/certification/migration/">https://openid.net/certification/migration/</a> for details on the migration.</p>
<p>If you are currently testing your OpenID Connect implementations, please note this transition date and migrate your testing from the Python-based suite to the Java-based suite prior to that. If you are considering testing your OpenID Connect implementations, please include the transition date in your planning.</p>
<p>The transition to a single code base for the conformance test suite will enable the Foundation to more efficiently manage the program and add new profiles for testing. Thank you to those community members who have assisted in “testing the tests” and helping us reach this important milestone in the Certification Program’s history.</p>
<p>Please send any inquiries or issues encountered to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:certification@oidf.org">certification@oidf.org</a>&nbsp;and/or submit issues about the Java-based conformance suite at&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite/-/issues">https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite/-/issues</a>.</p>

<p>We interviewed Dia Banerji, one of our UK Ambassadors, to find out more about her passion for innovation and technology.</p>
 What gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Dia Banerji
<p>I am passionate about the power of innovative technology &amp; its potential in creating a better world. As an individual, I enjoy solving problems with technology solutions. I consider myself to be fortunate to be able to pursue my passion in the work I do.</p>
<p>I am the founder of ID4V. It is an early stage start-up focused on building a platform to enable Self Sovereign Digital Identity for Cross-Border Travel Visa Applications using Blockchain Technology. ID4V aims to address the inefficiency in our travel visa application system which affects millions of people around the world. Very few experiences in life can be compared to the joy of creation. I am thrilled to be on this journey.</p>
<p>I also work as a Consultant to the Blockpass identity Lab at Edinburgh Napier University where I advise on commercialization of emerging technology. I help identify industry applications for Blockchain &amp; Privacy Preserving Machine Learning research. Every day I spend at the lab I learn something new. I am surrounded by brilliance and get to work with innovative cutting-edge research. It is truly inspiring.</p>
<p>This is a very exciting time to be in Identity. We are creating a gateway to access the digital economy. What we build today &amp; how we build it, will shape our future. My work in Identity allows me to be part of this incredible evolution.</p>
<p>Roosevelt once said “Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.” To me, working in Identity as an Entrepreneur and a Professional is work worth doing and I love it!</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>The short answer would be ‘CURIOSITY’!</p>
<p>Prior to embarking a career in the technology sector, I spent over fifteen years in the financial services industry and worked for some of the top global banks in the world. Around 2016, within my fraternity there was a lot of noise about Bitcoin. Most of my peers and friends who were in Financial Services were naysayers and opposed Bitcoin with the utmost passion. Wall street greats like Warren Buffet famously called Bitcoin ‘Rat Poison Squared’! This got me curious. I wanted to learn more about Bitcoin to be able to figure out where I stood on the debate. This pursuit led me to studying Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies. I was amazed with the potential of this technology in solving real world problems. I wanted to be part of it. So, I pivoted my career to outlining use cases for Blockchain especially within Financial Services sector. And in that journey, I came to narrow my focus on Digital Identity and got to where I am today.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The most important lesson that I learned was not to be intimidated by the things I did not know and appreciate the value of stepping outside my comfort zone. I was a financial service professional before I entered the world of Technology and Digital Identity. I have an MBA and not a computer science degree. There will always be somethings that we do not know and that is absolutely fine! Especially when one is working within the Identity Industry which is constantly changing and new standards are being incubated as we speak. Knowledge has a way of demystifying complex concepts. And once you understand something in depth you are no longer intimidated by it. The key thing is to never stop learning. And one of the most enjoyable aspects of my work is that I get to learn something new all the time. This to me this is both inspiring and empowering.</p>
 What should leaders in identity start, stop and continue – and why? 
<p>The concept of identity has been broadly accepted as a fundamental human right. A legal identity enables individuals to participate in society and have access to rights and services. It is a prerequisite to financial &amp; social inclusion.</p>
<p>Identity management is a global problem. The current system does not scale and is in much need for disruption. For, those of us in the developed world we are plagued with inefficiencies of legacy systems, data privacy breaches &amp; leaks leading to trust issues with central authorities. For the citizens of the developing nations many are denied access to financial &amp; social services for lack of verifiable identity. According to World Bank, it is estimated that approximately one billion people across the world do not have access to an officially recognizable identity!</p>
<p>As the world transitions to a digital economy we need to have a more secure, scalable, interoperable and citizen focused digital identity management solutions to ensure inclusion.</p>
<p>So, my advice to the CEO’s in the identity space would be the following:</p>
<p>START: Collaborating with one another and build solutions and platforms which are interoperable. Have diverse teams within the organisation so that the solutions reflect the wider needs of society. Both are imperative for mass adoption!</p>
<p>STOP: Building centralized identity management solutions! Be citizen focused and build applications on the principles of self-sovereign digital identity. Allow individuals to own, control and manage the distribution of their personal identity. This is essential to be able to build scalable and secure systems with no central point of failure and reduce risk of data theft.</p>
<p>CONTINUE: Identifying new uses cases for Identity management solutions and apply innovative technologies to enhance efficiency and security of applications. Digital Identity is a relatively new industry and is constantly changing. We need to continue to fund new research and explore new use cases. This is crucial, for the creation of robust digital identity management platforms for the future.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>I have always looked to nature to find order and to me diversity is the purest form of natural existence and the only way to live and thrive in this world.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>I would recommend the film, The Matrix. It is a beautiful film and the script is almost Shakespearean. If one sees beyond the action-packed computer graphics there is a deep spiritual message and a tale about the constant strife between ignorance and enlightenment faced by mankind. Like most great works of art, it leaves you questioning. Definitely worth a watch!</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>I would advise my teenage self to be ‘fearless’ and ‘take chances’. In order to walk the path that no one has ever walked before requires one to be brave and follow one’s gut. Greatness is seldom achieved by being careful. So, go ‘ALL IN’ and follow your passion and don’t seek external validation. Believe in yourself!</p>

<p>Esme Wardhaugh interviewed Janelle Riki-Waaka, for an interesting discussion on the digital identity sphere.</p>
 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Janelle Riki-Waaka
<p>As Queen Whitney says, I believe the children are our future, teach them well and let them lead the way! Cheesy I know but no truer words were spoken. I am so privileged to work with educators and support them in their professional learning needs.</p>
<p>Education systems world wide originated from the need to prepare kids for the workforce. In the industrial era this meant reflecting the work conditions they would eventually go into – large warehouses became classrooms and the smoko bell became the school bell. In terms of education for young girls, it was often crafted around antiquated expectations of a ‘woman’s work’. In terms of education for indigenous kids, this was primarily designed to assimilate them into the dominant culture. This practice was considered to be ‘in their best interests’ and would ensure a more ‘fair’ and just society for all. The education system wasn’t designed to empower indigenous kids to be deeply connected to their language, identity and culture and we are still feeling the ramifications of the trauma that this caused for indigenous people across the world. Until we actively start to redress that trauma, we will continue to experience inequity in its most harmful forms.</p>
<p>So what gets me out of bed in the morning? It’s the responsibility I feel to be a voice for those indigenous kids who are continuing to experience inequity in our education system. It’s the understanding I have through my own learned experiences that our kids rely on us to be their allies, their advocates and their cheerleaders. They deserve to walk into schools and be empowered to be who and what they are and be secure in the knowledge that they are surrounded by adults who are working really hard to know better and do better.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Pure determination to prove people wrong! I hated the stereotypes about Māori women so becoming a single mother in my early 20’s lit a fire in me to push as hard as I could against those stereotypes and become more than what society expected of me. I worked really hard and I leaned into my support network. I read and learned and listened to people that inspired me and I set goals and just ticked them off one at a time. I went from a high school failure and a young single mother, to a self sufficient, empowered woman with a Masters Degree. At the start of my journey the degree was my aspiration and I was fuelled by wanting to prove a point. But the real reward for me was the self assurance that I could in fact achieve anything I dared to dream about.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Gosh so many! I think the most valuable lesson for me was to learn to trust my gut. Over the years I have come to realize that female intuition is probably the most powerful tool in our arsenal! I’m not referring to that little voice in our head that is most often our harshest critic, I’m talking about that gut feeling you get right when you need to get it! Looking back over things you can often remember a time when your gut warned you this was the wrong path. Or it screamed at you to just have faith. When things are tough in my world and I can’t see the wood for the trees, I always try to block out the noise and tune into my female intuition to allow it to guide me on my journey.</p>
 What’s your advice to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>STOP considering only your learned perspective of what identity is. There are so many diverse definitions of identity and it’s important we don’t narrow the lens here. It would be dangerous to assume there is one definition of identity and even more dangerous to assume the western world view is the correct one! We need to allow diverse perspectives of identity to inform our practice for the future as one size will definitely not fit all and it’s too important to get wrong.</p>
<p>START educating people about digital identity. If you work in this space you might be forgiven for assuming everyone understands it but I assure you this is far from the case. Education should empower people to make informed choices and we must be careful not to educate through fear. We need to start to look at how we can educate our kids about their digital identity and integrate this important knowledge into school curriculum.</p>
<p>CONTINUE exploring alternative ways, processes and perspectives. You know what they say true collaboration is – it’s about the ideas that don’t exist until you get everyone in the room! So as you are continuing to explore innovative solutions to new emerging challenges ask yourselves this – who’s voice is missing in the conversation. And then go engage with those missing voices. They may just have the very solution you’ve been searching for.</p>
<blockquote><p>We need to allow diverse perspectives of identity to inform our practice for the future as one size will definitely not fit all and it’s too important to get wrong.</p></blockquote>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Because everyone should feel important and valued for who they are.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>The Whale Rider is an amazing book by Witi Ihimaera and the film is phenomenal. It gives a great insight into the Māori culture and practices and it’s a go to for me when I need a reminder about having faith and trusting my intuition. It also explores a Māori perspective on identity and the importance of understanding indigenous world views and practices.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Have faith, be present and take it easy on yourself! You’re loved and strong and trust me, it’s all coming to you.</p>

 Aakash Solanki, Sandeep Mertia &amp; Rashmi&nbsp;M  Session <p>The session intends to initiate a discussion on digital literacies in the wake of ‘Digital India’ programme drawing on the empirical insights from three different field situations. The discussion will be anchored in the social and material context of Digital India but will not be limited to it. The questions we raise in this specific context may be extended to understand the current conceptual as well as practical deployment of many ICT4D programmes as envisioned by both government and non-government actors. The idea of digital literacy is central to both the conceptualization and the execution of such programmes, and the actors in charge work with their own understanding of the context and needs of the people they aim to empower. There have been very few attempts to systematically understand the concept of digital literacy which leave much scope for either lenient contextual interpretations or context insensitive one-size-fits-all approach towards technological interventions. This session is an effort to begin one such discussion which we hope will refine the prevalent understanding of digital literacy/literacies in&nbsp;India.</p><p>From a glance at the structure of Digital India programme, it is apparent that the programme is designed to achieve digital inclusion and is primarily directed towards the digitally marginalized in spite of having a more comprehensive agenda. The schemes such as National Digital Literacy Mission (NDLM) and the way they are conceived are indexical of the kind of target groups which the programme plans to address. A key concern for us is to think through the mismatches between the frameworks of the digital literacy initiatives and the local socio-technical contexts which we observed in our field sites. The objective of the session is not as much to arrive at the definitional fixity of the concept of digital literacy as it is to complicate and problematize the prevalent definitions of digital literacy implicit in both visualization and execution of such initiatives. We plan to meet this objective through empirical insights we have on three different field&nbsp;sites.</p><p>The session will also focus on certain methodological questions that might help us better understand digital literacy. This part of the session addresses questions such as: how can we conceptually define digital literacy/literacies? What parameters should go into the measuring of digital literacy? How should we theoretically understand it — as technical skills or knowledge or some higher cognitive ability? How can we best pedagogically achieve it given the complexity of ground reality? The questions will be directed towards encouraging thought in this area rather than providing answers. The session will also try and discuss various kinds of policy and pedagogical documentation available on digital literacy and critically debate their conceptualization and execution by juxtaposing them against various uses of ICTs on the ground by specific groups of users. This part of the discussion will draw upon scholarly and other kinds of documentation available on the topic and use them to evaluate various government and corporate initiatives to achieve digital literacy in&nbsp;India.</p> Plan <p>In keeping with the spirit of the conference, the three discussants’ will try to put forth empirical insights from their respective field situations and frame nuanced research and discussion questions on digital literacies at the margins of techno-cultural capital and/or access. Further the discussion will be aided by specific readings and the insights drawn from them. The idea is to have a symmetrical, reciprocatory and anthropologically comparative conversation on questions of technology, materiality, access, meaning making, development and literacy, by moving back and forth between different fieldsites and interpretive frameworks.</p><p>Field Note&nbsp;I</p><p>The first discussant’s work on social media use in rural Rajasthan discusses socio-technical changes instituted by the introduction of ICTs despite their developmental failures. He claims that these changes have been often viewed from technologically or socially deterministic positions and that there are significant empirical gaps between such technocratic discourses and the grassroots experiences of technology. There is a growing usage of social and digital media in rural areas where ICT4D and e-Governance pilot projects have failed to meet their goals. Based on an ethnographic study of ICTs in two villages of Rajasthan, his work aims to situate social and digital media in a complex rural society and media ecology using co-constructivist approach. Focusing on context sensitive meaning making of ICTs, it will seek to contribute to an empirically sound discourse on media, technology and rural society in&nbsp;India.</p><p>Field Note&nbsp;II</p><p>The second discussant’s work on mobile phones and multimedia consumption among the digitally marginalized users in Bangalore brings into focus the popular usage of ICTs, specifically mobile phones, among the subaltern users. While such popular usage indicates a certain level of literacy already achieved by the digitally marginal groups by mere exposure and peer learning, it is not sufficient to do away with all kinds of guided training required to make such users participate in informationalized environments. Her observations on the mobile phone usage among the subaltern users in Bangalore problematize the notion of digital literacy and invite us to think about it as a more layered and stratified concept. They raise questions such as ‘what constitutes digital literacy?’ — some complex use of gadgets learnt by mere exposure and peer knowledge or an awareness about the social relevance of the technologies and knowledge about their appropriate deployment in different social contexts? While mere access and some nominal training might be helpful in equipping people with some knowledge about gadget-use, her study points out that such initiatives are far from achieving the right degree of digital literacy needed to make these people participate in new media ecologies. Thus it contends the claims of 1. Organic literacy attained by mere exposure and peer sharing of technological knowledge and 2. Literacy attained by current training programmes which might equip the digitally marginalized with knowledge of technological use but not necessarily inform them about the context relevant knowledge needed for their appropriate deployment.</p><p>Field Note&nbsp;III</p><p>The third discussant’s work on e-governance initiatives in an Indian state plans to return the gaze on to the bureaucracy itself and takes the conversation from the margins back to the centre. His work moves away from the target groups generally alluded to in programs such as the NDLM. It takes into accounts the struggles, anxieties, hopes and promises of/for a bureaucracy in coming to terms with a gradual but seemingly eventual shift from paper work to digital paper work. The users in this case are staff members tasked by the higher-level bureaucracy-who have little or no clue about it themselves- to learn a new tool and migrate all paper work to the digital domain. Many of e-governance projects are spearheaded by corporate organizations, which in turn dictate the terms of the conversation on Digital Literacy even within the government. What impact does this have on how Digital Literacy is understood, articulated and executed in ICT4D programs within and without the government.</p> Readings <p>Terranova, Tiziana. 2004.

 Special two-part episode delves into BKC’s Assembly program, big challenges with disinformation Jonathan Zittrain joins Oumou Ly for the latest episode of The Breakdown. Photo: Lydia Rosenberg<p>This episode of The Breakdown featuring Assembly Staff Fellow <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/oumou-ly">Oumou Ly</a> in conversation with Professor <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a>, is shared in two parts. Part one delves into the Berkman Klein Center’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/assembly">Assembly program</a> — which focused on disinformation from a cybersecurity perspective for the 2019–2020 year — and some of the big challenges that surfaced from Assembly work this year. Part two explores disinformation in the context of trust and platforms, and looks ahead at Assembly in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Read the transcript, which has been lightly edited for clarity and&nbsp;brevity.</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to The Breakdown. My name is Oumou. I’m a staff fellow on the Berkman Klein Center Assembly: Disinformation Program. Our episode today features our very own Jonathan Zittrain. Jonathan is the George Bemis Professor of International Law at Harvard Law School. He’s also a Professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, a Professor of Computer Science at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Director of the Law School Library and Co-founder and Director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society. Thank you for joining us today, Jonathan.</p><p>Jonathan Zittrain (JZ): It’s my pleasure. Thank you,&nbsp;Oumou.</p><p>OL: So our Assembly Program is wrapping up for the 2019 through 2020 year and you’ve joined us in your capacity as faculty advisor for the Assembly Program and also as a Co-founder and Director of the Berkman Klein Center of which the Assembly Program is&nbsp;based.</p><p>Can you talk a little bit about yourself, a little bit about the Assembly Program and how it came to&nbsp;be?</p><p>JZ: At one point we had gotten word of one of our fellow universities getting on rather abrupt notice a $15 million grant to improve the state of cybersecurity. We were certainly thrilled for our peers and then couldn’t help but brainstorm, gosh, if we unasked had $15 million appear, which I won’t say has happened yet, what would we do with it and how would we deploy it in a way that did justice to the confidence of whoever would be entrusting us with that much&nbsp;money?</p><p>JZ: What emerged from that discussion was a sense that in some ways the reach of academia is limited. But what if people who weren’t dispositionally inclined to sit down and write 250 manuscript pages could be brought together around these really hard problems that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries?</p><p>What would it look like to gather people around hard problems and work on them? Our first efforts were on cybersecurity and specifically on what we call the going dark problem as framed by law enforcement.</p><p>Our group, which included government officials, civil libertarians, academics, and human rights folks, had really good discussions about that and put a report entitled <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont_Panic_Making_Progress_on_Going_Dark_Debate.pdf">Don’t Panic</a>. In a way, it said to law enforcement, don’t panic and to the civil libertarians, maybe you should panic because there are a bunch of fronts on which to worry. That’s just an example of the sorts of things our group came together to do in that instance and the intervening years. Most recently, as you know, we’ve taken up the problem of disinformation. How big is it, how bad is it, how would we measure it and know if it’s getting better or worse and who, if anyone, would we trust with an intervention designed to do something about&nbsp;it?</p><p>I should say quickly, the Assembly Program as it’s evolved has roughly now three pillars, three tracks, one of which involves our students at the university. Graduate students looking for thesis topics across multiple departments, including law students looking for meaningful applied experiential work, lend their talents to projects, come together as a cohort to do independent work, and meet faculty from other departments that they normally wouldn’t have a chance to come across. That’s the Assembly student fellowship. We also have Assembly fellows who are people from industry, nonprofits, NGOs, and outside academia.</p><p>It doesn’t mean they’re running a particular company, but they are the people within the engineering rooms of those companies trying to make a difference. By calling them together, having them spend some time on campus here full time, and then scatter again,that can maybe yield something interesting. That was the premise. For now several years, our Assembly fellows have bonded as a group, done multiple projects and presented those projects.</p><p>Then the third pillar is what we call the Assembly Forum. We convene senior officials and senior executives or their representatives and get them talking with one another in the kind of setting that they wouldn’t get in their own natural environment. These are people that might well be thinking about this kind of stuff all the time, and are trying to see things from a new angle. Those are the three pieces of Assembly.</p><p>OL: Were there any issues that we discussed over the course of the year on which you experienced a perspective shift, had your mind changed? Or, did you perhaps change someone else’s&nbsp;mind?</p><p>JZ: I certainly found my own thinking deepened and changed on some things. First off, you certainly can’t just assume that disinformation is a scourge or undifferentiated. Across the board, some of the slicing and dicing that academics want to do and that we found some of the companies are doing too, is them trying to create measurements to counter it where they want to weigh in. It really makes a difference to figure out, “Well, all right. What are we defining as misinformation?” Even… I mean, to some listeners, this may be a kind of new distinction to everybody who’s new at one point, the difference between misinformation and disinformation.</p><p>OL: Absolutely.</p><p>JZ: Misinformation being, “Oh, you just got it wrong”, and disinformation being, “You are wrong. You’re trying to get other people to get it wrong”, with the latter being propaganda. Even that isn’t sufficient because you would think that if some government cooks up a piece of disinformation in a lab and releases it, that is the disinformation. But if somebody repeats it too credulously, they really believe it themselves, they’re engaging in misinformation with the disinformation they got. It might well be that if you’re a platform conveying that or amplifying that speech, you would react to it differently if you know the actor is intending it versus the actor just being a credulous vehicle for it. So being more careful and precise so that we can cut to action that more narrowly addresses the worst aspects of the problem, seems to me really useful in a way that just otherwise makes the problem feel so inchoate and overwhelming that it’s hard to even start with your spoons scooping out the&nbsp;ocean.</p><p>I think that in the particular instance of political mis- and disinformation, there are interesting questions. If you have a platform like Facebook, or you have a government intelligence agency that’s charged with protecting the nation, looking for threats and they see another government trying to salt falsehoods and trying to make those falsehoods are coming from fellow Americans — now what? You would think, well, at least you should disclose what you see. Certainly if I’m on Facebook, I would prefer that if I saw something that was supposedly from a neighbor, and it turns out it’s from somebody thousands of miles away getting paid by their government to pull my leg, I should know about&nbsp;that.</p><p>OL: Right.</p><p>JZ: But it’s very complicated. One of the hypotheticals we entertained as a group was, all right. Suppose the government, the US government, absolutely with great certainty can say, “Here’s disinformation. This is coming from this other country. It’s targeting this political candidate.” Do you tell the candidate? If you tell the candidate, what do you tell them? By the way, it’s like another country has it in for you? Should that be all? Do you say, “Here are the specific posts”, and then do you tell them, “By the way, it’s classified, so you can’t tell anyone&nbsp;else?”</p><p>JZ: If not, why did you tell them? What are they supposed to do with it? Those are real questions and I’m not sure I have answers to them all. But we should be thinking about situations wherein some of us know what’s going on and are prepared to share it, or have an inkling and aren’t certain — and what we would advise the disclosees to do about it. What’s the right course of action that advances the cause against disinformation? That seems to me a better articulated question than I had when I was going into&nbsp;it.</p><p>OL: What concerns you most about the current state of play with regard to disinformation? Is it that the problems are so intractable that we find ourselves at a status quo that seems untenable? What really keeps you up at&nbsp;night?</p><p>JZ: What keeps me up at night is the absence of trust in any referee. Just to take an example from the foundations of a legal system: Two people have a dispute so intractable and important to them that they are willing to endure litigation… they’re ready to go into a courthouse and spend potentially years and tens of thousands of dollars trying to just get an answer from a jury or a judge and an appellate court.</p><p>OL: Yeah.</p><p>JZ: It would be nice to know that at the end of that, when somebody wins and somebody loses, although the loser will be disappointed, they don’t feel it’s the case that they were robbed. We don’t want it to be the case that they wonder, “Why did I even have the faith to go into that courthouse?” It is valuable to have a legal system that can settle disputes without the system itself being rightly called into question in every case as to whether it is the&nbsp;problem.</p><p>The fact that we don’t have a significant majority of people trusting anything is a huge problem. There’s a necessity to create more trust and buy in among us. My thought was to have political ads submitted to a platform, then assigned to an American high school class, which under the guidance of their teacher and maybe a school librarian work through whether this ad contains disinformation or misinformation. The class determines whether the ad remains on the platform, they write up their findings, and get graded as to how well they do it. Maybe the decision favored by two out of three classes is the final decision. That’s an example of an idea that I acknowledge is clearly crazy. But I’m hard pressed when I think about it to say why it’s worse than the status quo, which is clearly unacceptable to&nbsp;me.</p><p>OL: Do you think that this lack of trust in traditionally trusted institutions is the result of the disinformation situation that we’re in? Or do you think that there was the sentiment that preceded it and this has just exacerbated it? I talked with Renee DiResta for our <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/q-a-renee-diresta-on-disinformation-and-covid-19-7e285232d6e5">first episode of the series</a> and she said something interesting to me, which is that social media had this democratizing effect in terms of who we consider to be a credible source. At the same time, we’re experiencing disinformation that degrades the credibility of traditionally respected sources. Where do you think that this has come&nbsp;from?</p><p>JZ: It’s likely a sadly mutual cycle. An example is this tale about how 5G relates to COVID. Anybody could sit down and write a page of word salad that invokes a bunch of words having to do with physics to explain how the vibrations actually change the vibrations of the… It’s incoherent. But, the fact that it could have purchase begs the question — all you needed was to have your eyes encounter those&nbsp;words?</p><p>That’s partly the worry about deep fakes. That you see something, you feel like your eyes aren’t lying and you’re already inclined to accept it for various reasons, including just wanting to rationalize what you may already believe or want to have happen in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>OL: Our forum wrapped on May 12th and we had our last two sessions were really heavily focused on COVID. Of course, it’s topical as so much of what we’re seeing online is COVID related or COVID focused. In our last two sessions, platforms, researchers and others in our group talk[ed] about the challenges that they’ve encountered as they work to manage the sheer volume of disinformation surrounding this issue. Then just recently, sustained attention has really shifted to issues of racial inequity, injustice and police brutality.</p><p>As you take stock of the challenges that are mounting in the world at large, and maybe amongst the countering disinformation community as well, are there particular reforms that you hope to&nbsp;see?</p><p>JZ: Well, I think part of the throughline of the examples you’re talking about is disinformation that could contribute to violence or to harm, including self harm in the health&nbsp;context.</p><p>OL: Yeah.</p><p>JZ: It makes the stakes real. When it’s disinformation that could lead to violence and conflict and purveyors of disinformation are putting it out exactly for that purpose, it makes it awfully hard to just say this is just too thorny a&nbsp;problem.</p><p>So while acknowledging all of the difficulties that come from figuring out who’s supposed to be the truth police here, having no police here is also the stakes are very real, very immediate. When the denominator of people involved is in the billions and you know that slight tweak to the platform here could greatly change the views of tens of millions of people, it is not a non neutral position. There’s just whether you’re going to be stirring the pot or whether third parties, including state actors will be stirring the&nbsp;pot.</p><p>OL: I completely agree with you. What is on tap for next&nbsp;year?</p><p>JZ: We’ve taken up other issues like cybersecurity and the ethics and governance of AI. This problem of disinformation requires calls for more than just the one academic year’s worth of focused attention. There’s a lot of momentum and I think enough collective feeling within the various groups that the status quo really isn’t working, and that it’s worth pressing on to solve it other than just keeping on with some of the measures already in place. It’s really calling out for new thinking and new experiments.</p><p>I’m also mindful that a lot of the action here, both in understanding the dimension of the problem through access to data and in implementing attempted solutions — that’s largely in private hands. Figuring out the right way to bridge those private companies that happen to shape speech so much with the public interest is a really important role that our group can play and model and work with for the coming&nbsp;year.</p><p>So my sensibility is that we’ll certainly continue through the November US elections, but even beyond with the relationships that have been forged among us and we’ll see if we can bring more to the table as we&nbsp;go.</p><p>OL: Thanks so much for joining me today, Jonathan.</p><p>JZ: It’s my pleasure. Thank you,&nbsp;Oumou.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-jonathan-zittrain-reflects-on-2019-2020-assembly-program-disinformation-8954966648bd">The Breakdown: Jonathan Zittrain reflects on 2019–2020 Assembly program, disinformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A DIF-hosted resource for community development  Introduction <p>It has been almost three years since DIF began working on the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">Universal Resolver</a> (GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver) </a>— a foundational piece of infrastructure for the Decentralized Identity ecosystem (see the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">original announcement</a>). Since then, our vision of being interoperable across ledgers and DID methods has seen a lot of support. Thanks to community contributions, the Universal Resolver now supports around 30 different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>Today, we are happy to announce an updated set of instances where the Universal Resolver is deployed. One stable and one experimental version will be iterated, maintained, and hosted by DIF as a service to the community!🎉</p><p>While this is undoubtedly a useful resource for research, experimentation, testing, and development, it is important that it not be mistaken for a production-grade universal resolver. It should be pointed out&nbsp;that:</p>  This infrastructure is neither intended or approved for production use cases and that nobody should rely on it for anything other than for development and testing purposes.  These two specific deployments are not production-ready. The preferred scenario continues to be that all DID-based information systems, run by a method operator or otherwise, production or otherwise, host their own instance of the Universal Resolver (or other DID Resolution tools).  DIF withholds the right to limit or modify the performance of this free service in case usage for production, commercial, and/or malicious purposes is detected.   Two Deployments <p>The following two deployments are now available as a community service:</p><p>* <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> — Hosted on IBM Cloud by DIF (thanks IBM!). While not considered production-ready, this instance is expected to be relatively stable. It will be tested before and after manual updates from time to time, with versioned releases.<br>* <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a> — Hosted on AWS by DIF. This instance is more experimental, will be updated frequently, and is connected to CI/CD processes. It may be down from time to time or have unexpected functionality changes.</p><p>Note: For backward compatibility, the original URL <a href="https://uniresolver.io/">https://uniresolver.io/</a> will now redirect to <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a>.</p> Documentation <p>See the following links for more information about testing, release, and deployment processes of the Universal Resolver:</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@polarmermaid">Anne&nbsp;Nygård</a>  AWS Architecture: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md</a>  CI/CD Process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md</a>  Branching Strategy: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md</a>  Release process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md</a>  Periodically, this standing work item is discussed in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>, so that group’s recorded meetings and discussions on Slack and <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/id-wg">mailing list</a> may contain further insight on the above&nbsp;topics.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540">The Universal Resolver Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 and how today’s most powerful authentication mechanisms can be decentralized <p>It is a mouthful of an acronym: it stands for OpenID Connect — Self-Issued Identity Provider. Unless you are familiar with the terminology of the OpenID community, knowing what the acronym stands for doesn’t illuminate much, but rest assured, this is one of the most exciting developments to support the widespread adoption of Verifiable Credentials across the&nbsp;web.</p><p>This post will explain how it’s exciting and what kinds of adoption it could galvanize. First, we will cover OpenID &amp; OpenID Connect, then touch on how decentralized identity (or “self-sovereign identity”) relates to “authentication” and “user accounts,” and finally how they can work together, with two educational videos along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>While there is substantial and sophisticated <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/blob/master/docs/README.md">prior art</a>, particularly in the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Aries</a> community, for integrating verifiable credentials with OpenID Connect, using DIDs for OIDC is still emerging and approaching its first stable specification in the coming months. This is the culmination of substantial collaborative work to develop this bridge between the DID Authentication Working Group at DIF and various interlocutors at the OpenID Foundation. This post breaks down key elements of this development and shares more resources if you want to explore it&nbsp;further.</p> What is OpenID &amp; OpenID&nbsp;Connect <p>The first seeds of OpenID were sprouted at the very first Internet Identity Workshop in 2005. All the companies interested in URL-based protocols got together and collaborated together on their various models for designing authentication for users against URLs they controlled, like their personal blogs. This protocol has evolved and the latest iteration is based on sophisticated OAuth (Open Authorization) standards and&nbsp;tooling.</p><p>The basic and most typical flow used by OpenID Connect can be described as follows: an individual, which in this context can be called a “user” of the identity system, first gets a fresh proof of authenticity of their digital identity. This unique proof is minted in the course of an interaction with a service called an “Identity Provider” (IP), i.e. Google or Facebook. This proof usually takes the form of a “token,” a single-use cryptographic access code linked to the corresponding identity record at the IP. The user then takes that token to a second site that they are going to login to, with is called the “Relying Party” or RP, which can then trust they are dealing with the same person identified (usually very strongly) by the Identity provider.</p>OpenID Login&nbsp;Flow<p>The teams of professionals that created OpenID Connect had enough imagination to anticipate more complex use-cases that weren’t immediately needed by the commercialized web of 2005, but for which the technical foundations were still worth laying. Among there, there was a clear idea that users would, in some cases, prefer or need to bring their own identity with them rather than a pointer to a record on an IP’s server. This identity would thus be “self-issued,” a capability they designed into the OpenID core specification.</p><p>The vision of DID-SIOP is a way of bringing decentralized identity concepts into alignment with the ideas of “self-issued” portable identity that the original OpenID innovators had. It was good that they included and preserved this underutilized capability in their immensely popular and internet-powering framework, which is the basis of modern social login (i.e., “Sign on with Google/Facebook/etc”). After all, it would have been simpler not to, but enough of designers and thinkers involved anticipated much of what has developed in parallel, the decentralized identity technology that the DIF serves to&nbsp;support.</p> How do decentralized identity systems&nbsp;work? <p>In this conceptual framework, the “Identity Provider” has been cut down a notch, and is instead referred to as a mere “Issuer” (of credentials and information, perhaps of identities over which it has less control).Similarly, the “user” is defined less by borrowed tools and more by owned ones, assuming the title of “Holder” of information and identity, whether issued or self-issued.. The “verifier” relies less on the identity provider, choosing instead to verify information and identities presented by their holder on their own terms (with some cryptographic assurances about the&nbsp;issuer).</p><p>One interesting difference between traditional OIDC and decentralized systems is that in the latter, all parties have identifiers that make it possible to verify signatures; it is hard to tell from a DID whether it corresponds to an institution, an individual, or an inanimate object, because it could be any or all of those. Whatever it represents, it points to ways of verifying signatures with so-called “key material” (public keys, hints to how to classify and use them). Most often, this happens by looking up the material on a distributed ledger, but this is not, strictly speaking, definitive of the framework..</p><p>The key material from an OIDC issuer proves the veracity of whatever information or identity is being presented in a way that is tied back to that issue by similar key-material guarantees, and a self-issued OIDC token works the same way. (In a self-issued OIDC credential, the holder’s key material is used in the place of an institutional issuer’s).</p> How OpenID and Decentralized ID can fit&nbsp;together <p>One of the big challenges for any new technology that needs an identity system is getting adoption of the needed components so the system can actually work at a sustainable scale. This usually required buy-in from various kinds of actors in an ecosystem: at the very least, it needs critical mass of users/holders, IPs/issuers, and RPs/verifiers, each maintaining their end of the infrastructure and “keeping the lights on,” as it&nbsp;were.</p><p>This is exactly where the two systems can really help each other: achieving and maintaining critical mass of all three, as the distribution of more and less centralized solutions changes, and self-issued credentials come to be accepted in theory and in practice. OpenID Connect has a large “install base”: there are literally millions of websites running OpenID Connect tooling as the authentication mechanism at their “front door” for users. Indeed, while a vanishingly small portion of internet users have ever heard of OIDC, it is the nuts and bolts of the most universal and familiar UX and user flow of the contemporary commercial web, including online banking and government services.</p><p>OIDC-SIOP leverages the code that OpenID Connect relying parties already have in place across all these millions of sites, and the lion’s share of the 10,000 most used websites. Think of the screen that reads, “Log in with Google / Facebook / Twitter / Github / etc.” OIDC-SIOP enables organizations to ask for Verifiable Credentials that an individual holds in their wallet instead of a token from Google / Facebook / Twitter / Github. These can be single-use access codes with cryptography built in, or more reusable credentials, or richer credentials containing various kinds of information otherwise requested from an IP. This mechanism is provided by the Self-Issued OpenID Provider flow described by the core specification:</p><p>If successful, this will be a huge win for decentralized identity, because it addresses the perennial “Relying Party” problem of adoption: how do you get relying parties to adopt a new technology, install and trust a new “doorway,” adapt their security and business processes to a new set of strengths and weaknesses? In the popular imagination and even in much of the technology press, scaling a business or a technology is often imagined as a quest for users, but they are often the easiest shareholder to get on board, particularly for something convenient and powerful. The relying parties (or, in economic terms, the “demand side” of identity) is often a much harder business problem, and in this case, no “big lift” is required of the verifiers or “relying party” consuming a new kind of authentication credentials because they only have to make minor adjustments to the nearly universal OIDC tooling they already&nbsp;have.</p> Further Reading <p>The purpose of the DID Authentication <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html">Working Group</a> at DIF is to design, recommend, and implement authentication protocols that rely on open standards and cryptographic protocols tailored to today’s and tomorrow’s systems for handling DIDs and DID documents, the primitives of decentralized identities. In last six months, the group has been actively working on the OIDC bridge, and they presented their latest work at DIF’s June 2020 virtual “face to face”&nbsp;meeting:</p><p>Here is a link to their draft specification, nearing stability and ratification at time of press: <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">https://identity.foundation/did-siop/</a>. For an explanation of some of the design principles and conceptual fine points, see the article “<a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">If You Build an Island You Need a Boat</a>” from DIF member Mattr Global&nbsp;(NZ).</p><p>Finally, if you want to go even deeper into the technical nitty gritty (particularly if you are unfamiliar with OIDC best practices), watch this video of a two hour presentation about OIDC-SIOP put on jointly with the DIDAuth group and the OpenID Foundation June 25th&nbsp;2020.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/where-to-begin-with-oidc-and-siop-7dd186c89796">Where to begin with OIDC and SIOP</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Melissa Carvalho, Nicole Landry and Chanda Jackson represented Women in Identity at the 2020 IdentityNORTH annual summit where over 500 people attended a two day conference. While going virtual this year, the IdentityNORTH team was able to produce 3x more content than in previous years and offer a professional development certificate at 1/4 the price of their typical in-person events.</p>
<p>Before committing to the event, Melissa, Nicole and Chanda carefully analyzed the content to ensure that the summit reflects the values held by Women in Identity.</p>
<p>They were very impressed with the diversity of speakers – 46% of sessions featured speakers that are women, Indigenous or people of color. Sessions ranged from public and private sector business to health, democracy and inclusion and representation.</p>
<p>The team is pleased with the feedback obtained from other conference attendees. We’ve met many new people and look forward to building our relationships with those championing diversity in identity. We’re currently working with one of the groups, who would like to sponsor WiD, to launch a co-branded event this fall.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identitynorth.ca/downloads/IdentityNORTH-2020-Annual-Summit-Summary.pdf">IdentityNORTH 2020 Annual Summit event summary</a> can be found online. It’s a great source of information for those looking to learn more. In the summary, you’ll find that the IdentityNORTH team featured Women in Identity in the following excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s so important to understand when you build and deliver something to market, it’s not only going to be used for the purpose that you intended for, but it can be used for another purpose,” Chanda Jackson, Canadian Co-Lead of Women in Identity and Sr. Manager, IAM Planning at Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) reminded participants. There’s a whole world of untapped potential and possibilities out there, Jackson noted – it’s time to open the door to more ways of thinking.</p>

<p>Setting a tone for inclusive collaboration</p><p>An important part of supporting a community where people are coming from all over the world and from a variety of backgrounds is putting in place a code of conduct that provides a baseline understanding about what is ok and what is not. The purpose of DIF’s Code of Conduct is to create an open, healthy and productive culture where members and the community can build and grow together.</p><p>During the DIF Virtual Face-to-Face Meeting in June of 2020, this Code of Conduct was reviewed:</p><p>In lieu of an executive summary, we would here like to offer a few highlights:</p> 1.) Community Advocates <p>One of the innovations in the code of conduct is the creation of a role we call community advocates. Each of these is a community member who takes seriously their power and responsibility as facilitator. We are working to provide formal training to support these advocates and give them a firm foundation on what to listen for and how to speak to conflicts. If you are part of the community and would like to volunteer as a community advocate, please let us&nbsp;know.</p><p>In particular, these advocates can diffuse, mitigate, and failing both, escalate conflicts. See in particular the expanded dispute escalation section of the&nbsp;code:</p><blockquote>Dispute Escalation and Incident Resolution Mechanisms</blockquote><blockquote>We are all here to contribute value and reap the benefits of community collaboration. While it is natural to have disagreements and find situations uncomfortable, DIF believes that resolving any issues should take place within the community via open communication.</blockquote><blockquote>DIF has within it a group of members who have some training and skills in supporting healthy conflict resolution that can be volunteer community advocates.</blockquote><blockquote>If something does happen, open communication and shared, cross community healing is a must. The community should get better as a&nbsp;whole.</blockquote> 2.) Diversity front-of-mind <p>Informed by a substantial corpus of experiences throughout the broader identity technology community where perspectives from marginalized groups were actively or unwittingly excluded, we felt our code of conduct needed to be explicit about the most nefarious and effective tool of silencing: scope management. To this end, we put into our code of conduct the following definitive statement:</p><blockquote>Diversity is never definitively out-of-scope or foreclosed as irrelevant to more urgent business.</blockquote> 3.) Proactive inclusivity <p>Here are some more important excerpts from the code of conduct that cover our statement on inclusivity and diversity</p><blockquote>Inclusive: We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable, threatened, or unheard/dismissed (explicitly or implicitly) is not a productive one. We should be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with people outside our community, contributing to an atmosphere of inclusion. DIF takes seriously the maintenance of substantive inclusion in which any member feels empowered to contribute; if any do not feel the group’s chairs are doing enough to create this atmosphere, they may go elsewhere in DIF for help achieving this&nbsp;change.</blockquote><blockquote>Diverse: DIF welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we will always work to treat everyone fairly. No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, dis/ability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability. Diversity of perspective, identity and experience should be considered a positive contribution. Diversity and empathetic, pro-actively inclusive ways of stewarding cooperation is an ongoing commitment, not a one-time gesture; DIF’s Steering Committee and Working Group Chairs and Editors concretely support ongoing training or cooperative learning between leaders of working groups, mailing lists, and other&nbsp;venues.</blockquote> A living, open-source document <p>You can read the full code of conduct <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io/blob/master/assets/code-of-conduct--ratified-document-june20-2020.pdf">here</a>, or if you would like to suggest edits or open issues, you can do so on github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">here</a>. As Balázs mentions in the video, the code of conduct is licensed for being “forked” and adapted anywhere it can be helpful, and we look forward to contribution and discussion as it continues to&nbsp;evolve.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/difs-updated-code-of-conduct-a0c2d9dce1ad">DIF’s Updated Code of Conduct</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Adversarial machine learning (ML), the study of subverting ML systems, is moving at a rapid pace. Researchers have written more than 2,000 papers examining this phenomenon in the last 6 years. This research has real-world consequences. Researchers have used adversarial ML techniques to identify flaws in<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10099"> Facebook’s micro-targeting ad platform</a>, expose vulnerabilities in<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/three-small-stickers-on-road-can-steer-tesla-autopilot-into-oncoming-lane"> Tesla’s</a> self driving cars, replicate ML models hosted in<a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/cloudleak-large-scale-deep-learning-models-stealing-through-adversarial-examples/"> Microsoft, Google and IBM</a>, and<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kxp83/researchers-easily-trick-cylances-ai-based-antivirus-into-thinking-malware-is-goodware"> evade anti-virus engines</a>.</p><p>Studying or testing the security of any operational system potentially runs afoul of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the primary federal statute that creates liability for hacking. The broad scope of the CFAA has been heavily criticized, with <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-asks-supreme-court-rule-violating-terms-service-isnt-crime-under-cfaa">security researchers among the most vocal</a>. They argue the CFAA — with its rigid requirements and heavy penalties — has a chilling effect on security research. Adversarial ML security research is no different.</p><p>In a new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16179">paper</a>, Jonathon Penney, Bruce Schneier, Kendra Albert, and I examine the potential legal risks to adversarial Machine Learning researchers when they attack ML systems and the implications of the upcoming U.S. Supreme Court case Van Buren v. United States for the adversarial ML field. This work was published at the Law and Machine Learning Workshop held at 2020 International Conference on Machine Learning&nbsp;(ICML).</p><p>In the paper, we consider two CFAA sections particularly relevant to adversarial machine learning.</p>  First, intentionally accessing a computer “without authorization” or in a way that “exceeds authorized access” and as a result obtains “any information” on a “protected computer” (section 1030(a)(2)(C)). This landscape is particularly complex and confusing given the current circuit&nbsp;split.  CFAA Interpretation By Circuit Court&nbsp;Region  Second, intentionally causing “damage” to a “protected computer” without authorization by “knowingly” transmitting a “program, information, code, or command” (section 1030(a)(5)(A)).   Takeaways from the&nbsp;paper <blockquote>Is the Adversarial ML Researcher violating the CFAA when attacking an ML system? Depending on the nature of the adversarial ML attack, and which US State the lawsuit is brought, the answer&nbsp;varies.</blockquote>  Using the example of a ML service whose rules are based on Google API’s Terms of Service (TOS), we considered a range of adversarial ML attacks in light of the CFAA. We show how taking into account the circuit split on how section 1030(a)(2) should be interpreted, and 1030(a)(5)(A), whether the researcher is committing a violation or&nbsp;not.  Adversarial ML Legal&nbsp;Risks<blockquote>If the Supreme Court follows the Ninth Circuit’s narrow construction when it decides Van Buren, it will lead to better security outcomes for adversarial ML research in the long&nbsp;term.</blockquote><p>2. If ML security researchers and industry actors cannot rely on expansive TOSs to deter against certain forms of adversarial attacks, it will provide a powerful incentive to develop more robust technological and code-based protections. And with a more narrow construction of the CFAA, ML security researchers are more likely to be conducting tests and other exploratory work on ML systems, again leading to better security in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>Link to full paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16179">https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16179</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/legal-risks-of-adversarial-machine-learning-research-b2e0b8e106ee">Legal Risks of Adversarial Machine Learning Research</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

We’ll take a deeper dive into:</p>
 
 the extra security in FAPI-RW 1.0 and FAPI 2.0 
 the security checks done in the certification suites (is this just the FAPI suite or do the OBIE tests cover some security checks?) 
 the security advantages of the OB directory model vs eIDAS 
 the apparent conflict between security and interoperability, especially in bank environments 
 how the certification programs attempt to ensure both security and interoperability 
 
<p>OIDF and OBIE continue to collaborate to help drive global open banking initiatives with the following goals:</p>
 
 To update participants on the latest developments in both the OIDF Financial-Grade API (FAPI) profile and the OBIE Standard. 
 To demonstrate the respective conformance tools and the benefits of certification including why conformance and certification is critical to ensuring standards are secure and interoperable. 
 To provide participants with help and support in using these tools. 
 To encourage a greater number of certifications. 
 Ultimately to help grow the open banking ecosystem, enhancing security and benefits for participants and end customers.

 Today, ID2020 announced its newest Alliance partner, the National Cybersecurity Center&nbsp;(NCC). <p>ID2020 was founded in 2016 to ensure that all people have access to better forms of digital ID, bringing together nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>Founded in 2016 by the former Governor of Colorado, John Hickenlooper, the National Cybersecurity Center (NCC) is a Colorado Springs-based nonprofit committed to promoting cyber innovation and awareness.</p><blockquote>“We are delighted to welcome the National Cybersecurity Center to the ID2020 Alliance,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “Because technology is evolving so quickly, many of the transactions that once took place in person and required traditional forms of ID are today being conducted digitally. Cyber threats, whether criminal or state-state sponsored, underscore the urgency and importance of ID2020 and the NCC’s collective efforts. We look forward to sharing our expertise and learning from their world-class team of cybersecurity experts.”</blockquote><p>With a mission to “secure the world”, the NCC has four main initiatives:</p><p>● Secure the Vote seeks to increase voter confidence in the U.S. on the accuracy of vote-counting, and to generate greater awareness of possible solutions to critical gaps in the voting infrastructure. Secure the Vote supports jurisdictions’ efforts to offer a secure, auditable mobile voting option for overseas voters through coordinating, and evaluating pilots across the&nbsp;country.</p><p>● Secure Smart Cities: Hyper-connectivity amongst smart devices and urbanization drive the need for cities to become more efficient in their operations as they continue to grow, but the concern of security impedes the overall advancement of several cities with “Smart”&nbsp;agendas.</p><p>● The NCC’s Cyber Education Program provides cybersecurity leadership, and one of the main pillars is K-12 education. As our nation addresses the critical gap in skilled cybersecurity talent, NCC addresses the importance of cyber education through programs and partnerships that invite students to participate in an ecosystem that encourages them to learn, explore, and build their&nbsp;skills.</p><p>○ The NCC’s K-12 initiative, the National Cybersecurity Center Student Alliance (NCCSA) offers opportunities for middle and high school students to improve technical literacy through fun, interactive, and challenging camps, field trips, workshops, and events. NCC encourages STEM education for all students, with special attention towards creating inviting and collaborative opportunities for girls and other underrepresented groups in the cyber ecosystem.</p><p>● The Space Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), a separate nonprofit organization, has the mission to facilitate collaboration across the global space industry to enhance our ability to prepare for and respond to vulnerabilities, incidents, and threats; to disseminate timely and actionable information among member entities; and to serve as the primary communications channel for the sector with respect to this information.</p><blockquote>“Digital citizenship is an increasingly critical space as more of our identity is online,” said NCC Director of Business and Government Initiatives, Forrest Senti. “The NCC’s work to secure cyberspace intersects directly with ID2020’s work to protect individuals’ online identity and to ensure that policies created around that protection are fair and equitable and ensure the utmost security for citizens around the world. We look forward to working with ID2020 to pioneer new ways to secure the future of identity.”</blockquote><p>The future of digital ID is at an important crossroads. As policymakers in the US and around the world struggle to confront the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, some are considering plans for digital identity-based health credentials to facilitate a return to work, school, and other social activities. The risks to privacy and security are high, as are the rewards of doing it right. ID2020 is working urgently with its partners and other stakeholders to ensure that privacy and data security are built into the technical architecture of these systems and that the appropriate legislative and regulatory are developed to guide their implementation.</p><p>ID2020 and the National Cybersecurity Center share a common mission to secure our individual and collective privacy and security. We welcome them to the Alliance and look forward to working collaboratively to advance our shared&nbsp;goals.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions. By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p><a href="http://www.ID2020.org">www.ID2020.org</a></p><p>About National Cybersecurity Center</p><p>Established in 2016, The National Cybersecurity Center exists to help secure the world using knowledge, connections, and resources to solve global cybersecurity challenges and develop a protected cyber ecosystem. An independent and non-profit think tank based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the NCC provides cyber innovation and awareness and is a leader in cyber education, workforce development, and informing public&nbsp;policy.</p><p><a href="http://www.cyber-center.org">www.cyber-center.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-welcomes-the-national-cybersecurity-center-to-the-alliance-a8af0261e69f">ID2020 Welcomes the National Cybersecurity Center to the Alliance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The FIDO Alliance has launched a new microsite, LoginWithFIDO.com, for high level, non-technical information about FIDO for consumers and service providers. As part of this project, we wanted to learn more about consumer attitudes and habits around authentication. What are their password habits? What do they think about the FIDO approach? Do they want to see FIDO at login?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To find out, we conducted a survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers – the results of which we’ll be sharing on this webinar. Join us to see the findings from our research and to learn how you may be able to utilize the data for your own FIDO offerings and/or deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join this webinar to hear:&nbsp;</p>



  How many different passwords consumers really use for their online accounts  What tactics they use for password management and how often they are resetting passwords and&nbsp;  Their familiarity with various types of authentication technologies including SMS OTPs, biometrics and others  The types of apps and services where consumers most want to use FIDO  How consumers want to be communicated with about FIDO at enrollment and login  



<p>We will also give the audience a detailed look at LoginWithFIDO.com and how you can consider using it for your own educational initiatives around FIDO. You’ll learn:</p>



  How to navigate through the microsite and its two landing pages  How you can reference the site and its materials for your own offerings and deployments  Added insights into how to utilize FIDO’s consumer-facing marks

<p>Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CMO, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>At its WWDC, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10670/">detailed</a> that its upcoming release of Safari in iOS and MacOS 14 will enable users to use Touch ID and Face ID for web logins, and we couldn’t be happier. It marks a giant step forward in the industry’s quest to move beyond passwords in favor of cryptographically secure authentication based on FIDO standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The functionality, based on the WebAuthn API in the FIDO2 standard, will make logging in to a website as easy as it is to unlock your iPhone or iPad using whichever biometric option is available. Apple’s built-in support in its stock web browser means that every modern device platform now has built-in FIDO support, which furthers our aim of making FIDO Authentication as ubiquitous as other critical internet protocols.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To that end, we’ve recently provided a resource that shows the latest progress for FIDO support across browsers and platforms.&nbsp; This image (shown below) is permanently hosted on our <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">WebAuthn resources page</a>.&nbsp;</p>







<p>It’s been really cool to watch this diagram grow both wider&nbsp; (adding in the Apple operating systems) and greener over the past 12 months or so since Apple ramped up its FIDO support. This rapid maturation and support for WebAuthn is accelerating adoption; with over 85 percent of today’s browsers now supporting FIDO Authentication, many service providers are now actively working to deploy FIDO to their customers worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance was founded on a singular mission: To eliminate dependence on passwords by creating and driving adoption of open standards for simpler, stronger user authentication. Today, we’re closer to reaching that audacious goal that the FIDO ecosystem has been working on for the past several years. Thanks, Apple!</p>

 Becca Savory, Sarah McKeever &amp; Shaunak&nbsp;Sen  Session <p>Since its early days the Internet has been conceived in terms of both movement and landscape — from “cyberspace” to the “Information Superhighway” — and in popular perception is often viewed as a boundless space imagined in terms of limitless possibilities. Indeed, across our research fields, from digital media to performance and social activism, we find that the Internet is frequently perceived as a space of mobilisation: where moving bodies are remediated within online content; where the movement of images, ideas and bodies can occur freely, with the rapid transmission of the “viral”; and where movement(s) frequently spill over into physical geographies.</p><p>Yet increasingly the Internet is also a space of fractured and fragmented movement(s): of blockages and blockades, discontinuities and disappearances. Landscapes become territorialized and movement(s) confined or obstructed. On this basis, we propose an interdisciplinary discussion session around the theme of “#InternetMovement(s)”. We ask how we can conceive of movement(s) in relation to the Internet in India, in terms of both mobility and immobility, fissure and&nbsp;flow.</p><p>To encourage fluidity, we propose to structure the session around three “nodes” rather than three separate research papers. Our nodes are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  How can we conceive of movement(s) in relation to Internet research in&nbsp;India?  What are the forms that movement(s) take in our respective fields?  What “stop” or blocks” movement in these&nbsp;cases?  <p>The three co-conveners will each prepare a 5-minute response to each of these nodes, based on our specific areas of research. At each nodal point we will then allow time for wider discussion, enabling inter-disciplinary discussion and flow to underpin the&nbsp;session.</p><p>We perceive the session to speak to the first of the conference’s core questions: “How do we conceptualise, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India?”</p><p>Each of the three co-convenors is approaching this question in their own research, asking how online media and communications mediate, remediate and transform the fields of film-media, social activism, and performance. We also ask the corollary: what are the limits and impediments to those transformations or mediations? The following section outlines the co-convenors’ approaches in more&nbsp;detail.</p> Plan  Statement of Intent&nbsp;I <p>The internet increasingly impresses traces on nearly all media technologies everyday. The once stable film body, gets disaggregated into various new forms of loop videos, GIFS, photo-memes, as clips and stills from disparate films get extracted, re-edited, patched and re-moulded into new user-generated media material. Solitary moments and gestures from films (a menacing wink by Jack Nicholson from The Shining, a clap from Charles Kane, a tear from the Tin-Man in The Wizard of Oz) get completely unchained from the original narrative context and used as discrete independent communicative units (Kane’s a popular Birthday wish gesture, while Nicholson’s Is a common linguistic unit signifying playful flirtation.) One of the primary ontological pegs of cinema — movement, today becomes the center of urgent debate around the status of photographs, movement-image forms like GIFs, and traditional moving images as the basic configuring elements of contemporary cinema. Using the film-GIF form as its primary vector this paper opens up the category of ‘movement’ philosophically as well as a constituent form to understand cinema today within the context of&nbsp;India.</p><p>As the cinematic object disperses into thousands of fragments hurtling through innumerable new online contexts, questions related to stardom also get radically transformed. I will be investigating a particular site of cinematic re-instansiation — the recent Alok Nath meme phenomenon. Long relegated to the margins of films as the venerable Hindu middle class father, the ‘’Alok Nath is so sanskaari..’’ set off a viral maelstrom that suddenly recast his cinematic body and the memory of a whole host of films (the Suraj Barjatya Hindu joint-family films). The paper focus on questions around movement as a philosophical arena as well as radical new form re-inscribing the cinematic in hitherto unprecedented shapes&nbsp;today.</p> Statement of Intent&nbsp;II <p>An examination of social movements with digital components in India begs several questions: What forms do social movements take in the digital world? How do we conceptualise social movements using digital and physical evidence? How does the context of India — as a functioning democracy — allow or restrict digital and physical social movements and define what is an “acceptable” protest movement? Engaging with these questions demands an interdisciplinary perspective, and exploring the interplays between the physical and the digital in regard to social issue protest movements.</p><p>Movement in my particular research area is understood in two aspects: the physical mobilisation of individuals to protest against perceived grievances and the movement of information around specific issue areas. The physical movement of bodies in public places is intimately connected to flow of information throughout digital networks, generating entangled and complex interfaces between the digital and the physical and creating new imagined possibilities of the efficacy of social protest (Castells 2012; Gerbaudo 2012). Examining recent social movements in New Delhi allows us to explore the linkages and disjuncture between the physical and digital, using theoretical developments in social movement theory to anchor the study (Earl, Hunt, and Garrett 2014; Krinsky and Crossley&nbsp;2014).</p><p>Examining the repercussions and strategies of physical/digital mobilisation can lead to a confrontation between the “imagined” possibilities of digital mobilisation and the realities of technological and physical blockages. These blockages can exist at the level of the network — both in digital and physical limitations — but also at the level of digital informational flow and who is allowed to view data? Confronting the “imagined” capabilities with the reality of entrenched power networks contests the notion of the digital as a free superhighway of information into a series of blocks and stoppages, restricting what is possible and feasible. By exploring question of movement(s) in New Delhi, I will explore the disjuncture between the imagined possibilities and the restriction of information — by nature of the algorithms that govern our capabilities and our own social networks — and complicate the triumphal narrative of the affordances of digital mediums on protest movements.</p><p>References</p><p>Castells, M.

Pgs.&nbsp;1–21</p><p>Statement of Intent&nbsp;III</p><p>My research centres on the recent history of flash mob performance in India and analyses the transformations that have taken place within the genre: firstly, as an initially American, then “global,” performance form becomes re-situated and adapted within an Indian context; and secondly, as the form has evolved over time in relation to the transitioning of the Internet from a predominantly text-based medium to a predominantly image- and video-based one (see Strangelove 2010).</p><p>In the field of flash mob performance, we see moving bodies becoming re-mediated as moving images, and mobilised into the flow of global circuits of online reception. My underlying concern when approaching this research is: who is mobile in these contexts? Who becomes visible through movement, and by extension, who may disappear in these same&nbsp;moments?</p><p>I intend to approach this session by examining what is enacted through the movements of flash mob performance, focusing on the more recent phase of the genre in which flash mobs become mobilised through online video-sharing practices. I argue that they perform mediated representations of “New India” for an online national and international audience, valorising the new “non-places” (Augé 1992) of Indian supermodernity, through the acts of a mobilised “digerati” (Keniston 2004). If we consider that performance can play a role in the construction of cultural memory (Roach 1996; Taylor 2003), and that the Internet as an archive can become a repository of performances and thus memories(Gehl 2009), I ask if online performance in these contexts may be seen as an aspect of the processes that structure a “politics of forgetting” (Fernandes 2006) in globalising India. Which narratives are rendered visible and which invisible through these performances? Who appears and who disappears? Movement on the Internet thus becomes a political question concerned with comparative mobilities, visibilities, and participation in the narratives of “India” that are constructed for global circulation.</p><p>References</p><p>Augé, M., 1992.

<p>Banks in Europe have deployed customer authentication solutions for several years. These solutions have served their purpose well and enabled customers to safely log in to their bank accounts. In the world of e-commerce, these solutions, when used, have been successful in combating online payment fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and its associated Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) dramatically change the payment landscape, considering:</p>



  The mandate for strong, multi-factor authentication,&nbsp;  The emergence of Third Party Providers (TPP) accessing accounts via open APIs  



<p>The success of PSD2 will ultimately be determined by how well banks can balance user convenience with security obligations, while maximizing reach. As such, they may want to evaluate how well their legacy authentication solutions meet this new need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO authentication standards have been proposed as a way for banks to meet all requirements in a PSD2 world — but is the change from a legacy method to FIDO worthwhile?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join this webinar to learn more about FIDO Authentication standards and how they compare with legacy authentication methods used to access an account or secure an online payment. The methods compared are SMS OTPs, hardware OTP generators, CAP readers, and proprietary smartphone and biometrics-based solutions in terms of PSD2 compliance, security, usability and scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join us to find out: Why change to FIDO?</p>

A new global framework for regulating the crypto industry is coming into place this year. One of the most important new rules that businesses interacting with crypto has to implement is what is known as the Travel Rule. The Travel Rule, which is also known as The Wire Transfer rule, requires a business managing crypto on behalf of their user to transfer KYC’d (Know-Your-Customer) Identity Information to a receiving institution. Pelle Braendgaard, CEO of Notabene, will share his insights and explain how his company is tackling this business challenge for the industry.

Complying with this rule provides many challenges for the industry. Several industry groups have already started to invent several new protocols to solve this. Notabene helps financial companies be compliant with new, global anti-money laundering (AML) regulations for crypto transactions coming into effect right now. Pelle believes this is a critical use case for SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity). In this talk, he will go over the rule itself, industry protocols, how he sees SSI can help here, and how they are helping to solve it.

While many are struggling with the effects of social distancing, financial distress, or fear of contracting the virus, here at the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI)</a>, nearly 300 individuals from 100 organizations have united around a cause worthy of our collective efforts: supporting projects that deploy privacy-preserving Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and strengthen our societies and economies.</p><p>We are a global community that shares a vision for the effective use of technology to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We believe that, when used responsibly, VCs can be great privacy-preserving components of solutions addressing the numerous social and economic challenges caused by this and future pandemics. We are aware that without a holistic perspective from the onset, many COVID-19 technology solutions may introduce unintended results (e.g. surveillance, abuse of personal data, social inequalities). To avoid such outcomes, we have committed ourselves to open collaboration with a diverse range of experts, embracing open standards, and protecting the fundamental privacy and personal data rights of all stakeholders.</p><p>If you lead a project implementing VCs in your local communities and are aligned with our values, we want to hear from you. We also wish to share and discuss our work openly, including its technical, medical, legal, ethical, and business implications. We invite your input on these considerations as well as any other important aspects that can help build responsible, human-centric VC solutions to fight COVID-19.</p><p>If you are ready to contribute or collaborate, please join us at <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">https://www.covidcreds.com/</a>.</p>

<p>The global movement in support of “good ID” advanced another step today as ID2020 announced ZAKA as its third “certified” digital ID solution.</p><p>Most of us take the ability to prove our identity for granted. But for one in seven people globally, the lack of a widely recognized form of ID means being unable to access basic legal protections and social services and being unable to participate fully as citizens and voters. Worldwide, more than one billion people are systematically excluded from the modern economy because they lack any form of formal&nbsp;ID.</p><p>In 2019, ID2020 announced plans to launch the first certification mark for digital ID at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The<a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-launches-technical-certification-mark-e6743d3f70fd"> Certification </a>recognizes solutions that adhere to ID2020’s stringent standards for user-management, privacy-protection, portability, and interoperability and offers technology companies a roadmap for the development of ethical, inclusive digital&nbsp;ID.</p><p>To be eligible for certification, applicants must adhere to 41 functional, outcomes-based<a href="https://id2020.org/uploads/files/Technical-Requirements.pdf"> Technical Requirements</a>. To date, 29 technology providers from every corner of the globe have submitted applications and worked with our staff and advisory committees to complete the process. In March, ID2020 announced its first two certified solutions, Kiva Protocol and Gravity. Today, ZAKA joins this esteemed community of technology providers.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust digital ID technology into the headlines as countries around the world consider plans for digital health credentials and technology-assisted contact tracing. There has never been more urgency to “get the technology right”.</p><blockquote>“Digital ID can be a powerful force multiplier for global social and economic development, but it can also be used to exclude people or even persecute vulnerable populations like refugees, children, and the homeless,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “As governments and businesses rush to adopt digital ID solutions, the ID2020 Certification is proving a valuable tool for those who are developing user-centric, privacy-protecting solutions to meet the needs of all&nbsp;people.”</blockquote><p>The Certification also provides a third-part seal of approval so that those implementing and using these technologies know that they were developed according to the highest ethical and technical standards and with full consideration of both the benefits and&nbsp;risks.</p><p>This market-based approach is already shifting the technical landscape and several multinational technology providers have adapted their technical approaches to comply with ID2020’s Technical Requirements.</p><p>About ZAKA</p><p>Based in the UK, ZAKA is committed to the idea that any person, with any phone, should be able to access any service, at any time. Like ID2020, ZAKA shares the perspective that, in an increasingly connected world, digital trust is an essential enabler of thriving economies.</p><p>ZAKA’s mobile app and software development kit (available in Android, iOS and USSD) helps individuals to build a set of verifiable digital credentials that are private, secure and portable, allowing them to connect with services such as mobile health, financial services, and education. And for service providers, ZAKA’s web dashboard allows them to configure their digital trust requirements and roll-out the solution to remotely verify and onboard customers. This allows services to concentrate on developing and distributing high-quality services, rather than be held back by high distribution and customer acquisition costs. ZAKA has also developed proprietary voice biometric technology which can be deployed together with, or separately from, it’s&nbsp;Apps.</p><p>In recent months, ZAKA has also extended its solution to support the response to, and recovery from, COVID-19. Their NewNorm™️ service is now being used by universities, employers, and event organizers to support a safe return to the “new&nbsp;normal”.</p><blockquote>“We are delighted to receive the ID2020 Certification,” said ZAKA CEO and Co-Founder Nick Mason. “We expect a great return on our investment of time and resources in this process and look forward to using the ID2020 certification to set ZAKA apart from our competition. The rigorous evaluation of our company by ID2020 should give prospective partners confidence that our solution is meeting global standards and advancing the vital mission of bringing “good ID” to&nbsp;all.”</blockquote><p>ZAKA is already implementing their its technology in Turkey, Rwanda, and the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>In partnership with the United Nations Development Program and led by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ZAKA is helping refugees obtain verifiable digital ID credentials that are portable and owned by them. Refugees can use these credentials to connect with services in a dedicated marketplace for services that support their self-sufficiency. Through the app, refugees can also receive promotional information from their chosen services about beneficial opportunities.</p><p>In Rwanda, ZAKA is working in partnership with the utility regulator, Airtel, and other private and public partners to implement a solution that leverages voice biometrics for remote customer verification. This can be used by banks, telcos, and healthcare providers to serve rural customers, whether they own a smartphone or feature&nbsp;phone.</p><p>Here in the United States, ZAKA’s COVID-19 status tracking solution, NewNorm™️, is helping employees and customers be safe in the “new normal”. This is being used by two New York University departments that have returned students, staff, and faculty to on-site instruction.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>Based in San Francisco, ID2020 harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of responsibly implemented, user-managed, privacy-protected, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>Through its advocacy, project funding, technical support, and now by certifying best-in-class identity solutions, ID2020 is helping build the infrastructure needed to strengthen social and economic development and ensure that all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-announces-certification-of-zaka-group-ltd-de019220362d">ID2020 Announces Certification of ZAKA Group Ltd.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Last April, the FIDO Korea Working Group announced our initiative to distribute FIDO Security Keys to Korean citizens to help better secure their identities, data and systems while working remotely due to the Coronavirus outbreak. We were able to do this thanks to FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group Deployment &amp; Marketing Sub-Group’s efforts and in-kind sponsorship by FIDO Security Key vendors like TrustKey (previously known as eWBM), AirCuve (Yubico’s local partner) and Octatco. Today, we are happy to share the results of this initiative, which ended with positive impacts and pleasant surprises.&nbsp;</p>

  The campaign was covered by 15+ local online media, spreading positive awareness of FIDO Authentication  We reached out to 52 organizations and individuals exposed to greater cyber risk by working at home and distributed 156 FIDO Security Keys  70% of them were new relationships that we had not previously had through previous on/offline events (e.g. hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare centers, patent offices, online game developers, ecommerce owners, retail shop owners, architects, hospitality industries, financial institutes, financial investors, school teachers, semiconductor industries, sports video analyst, advertisement agency, etc.)  25% of them had potential to be business partners or relying parties

<p>Here are some remarks by recipients of free FIDO Security Keys who agreed to disclose their identities:</p>



<p>“We are a group of 5 university hospitals working together on a suicide prevention project.&nbsp; Securing personal and medical information of these patients are very important, especially when we are working remotely.&nbsp; We hope to try out the FIDO Security Key through this giveaway campaign and find out how to adopt it into our database protection system.” – Mr. Dohyun Kwon, Seoul National University Hospital</p>



<p>“It is a shame but we have been writing passwords on a wall thus far, so we do not have to ask each other when logging into shared computers.&nbsp; It is scary that these passwords can be exposed to others with bad intentions.&nbsp; We have a great hope that FIDO Security Keys would eliminate these worries and even enable architects to work at home while feeling secured and safe.” – Mr. Taehoon Hur, Ruha Architectural Design Firm</p>



<p>“I operate over 10 healthcare and fitness centers in Seoul and always felt uncomfortable about having all these members’ personal information sitting on our computer where any staff with passwords can access it , not to mention some staff with such privileges kept on forgetting these long and hard-to-remember passwords.&nbsp; It would be interesting experiments for us to test out these FIDO Security Keys in practice.” – Ms. Jaehee Yoon, STAR Health Care and Fitness</p>



<p>“We are food product wholesalers mainly doing businesses online.&nbsp; Due to the Coronavirus outbreak, we would have to have our staff work at home with much of our purchasing and customer information in their laptops.&nbsp; Hope our staff would not have to expose the passwords by using these FIDO Security Keys.&nbsp;Thank you!” – Mr. Hoyoon Jung, NongGa Food Products</p>



<p>“WIPS is the number one patent database related services and consulting firm in Korea.&nbsp; We are used to working under Bring Your Own Device environment but have struggled managing passwords.&nbsp; Happy to take part in this experiment program and hope to see positive results.” – Mr. Taewoo Kwon, WIPS</p>







<p>Once again, we truly appreciate the undivided attention and efforts given by all FKWG members on this campaign, and especially recognize TTA (Telecommunications Technology Association) and Dr. Heung Youl Youm, for their extra efforts in the early stage of ideation and promotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Dr. Stephen Oh, the Co-Leader of FKWG Deployment &amp; Marketing Sub-Group said, “It was an amazing experience not just because we have learned a lot from the market where we could not usually reach through conventional approaches, but also it only took less than a month from ideation to full execution.”</p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Editor’s note: For background on the 2020 Hackathon in Korea, see the April blog post: “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-hackathon-goodbye-password-challenge-in-korea/">2020 FIDO Hackathon: Goodbye Password Challenge in Korea</a>.”</p>



<p>These are the faces of 2020 FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge participants, captured during online interviews which took place in the first two weeks of May.</p>







<p>A little over 40 applications were received by the end of proposal submission deadline, and 25 teams were given the opportunity to have online interviews, which helped them to crystalize their ideas and understand the full details of the Goodbye Password Challenge Program. About 100 people from 22 teams are now at the Learn and Implement Phase, which is being delivered through a specialized designated online communication platform.</p>



<p>We will not be sharing full details of the participating teams until they reach the final evaluation date the first week of August, but we would like to share some examples of proposed development ideas:</p>



Type of TeamDevelopment IdeasVentureThe specialists from 5 university hospitals got together on a suicide prevention project.&nbsp; They are going to develop an application that would enable sharing of patients’ personal and medical information, with FIDO implemented as a means for strong and simpler authentication.&nbsp; The unique aspect about this team is that the leader of the team got to know about the FIDO Hackathon after receiving free FIDO Security Keys, which FKWG supported for those who were recently forced to work at home due to public health issues.StudentsFour students from different universities got together and aim to develop a FIDO protocol-based smart home environment.&nbsp; They plan to come up with a miniature model which can demonstrate control of home temperature, curtains, windows, appliances, etc. The leader of the team did participate in the 2019 FIDO Hackathon, yet was not able to reach the top 3. This year, he aims to reach the top 5.Study GroupFour experts (entrepreneur, engineers, healthcare specialist) are aiming to develop a FIDO + DID-based electronic healthcare card system. There are reports of fraud use in local healthcare card systems, and the team wishes to eliminate it by implementing a FIDO protocol based biometric authentication system.StudentsFour university students work at their school’s IT helpdesk and they want to change how they work through developing a new application. As of today, they receive a phone call requesting a repair or replacement, and write down the log on paper.&nbsp; They plan to develop an application that can not only manage these helpdesk support requests but also verify the caller’s identity.StudentsTwo teams submitted similar ideas on developing innovative door locks by implementing a FIDO authentication system. Most current smart door locks in Korea are password-based and cause lots of trouble because they are easy to forget, vulnerable to exposure, etc. It is also noted by these students that currently fingerprint smart door locks in Korea share the secrets to servers, which raises high risk for hacking. It would be quite interesting how these two teams would be able to differentiate themselves with final results.StudentsThree university students have an idea to develop an innovative voting system by implementing FIDO protocols. They hope this novel voting system will lower costs, bring up voting rates and verify actual voters in a speedy manner.StudentsThese two university students are high school alumni and they have been working on various projects in the past. For 2020 FIDO Hackathon, they proposed an idea to manage different levels of security zones by implementing various levels of FIDO authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;Study GroupFive experts (university student, engineers, high school student) are committed to developing a FIDO protocol based Single Sign On System (SSO).&nbsp; They claim that they can differentiate themselves from existing SSOs, so let’s see how things unfold. This is the only team with a high school student.StudentsSix university students have an idea to prevent minors from purchasing alcohol and tobacco by developing a FIDO protocol based application. The local government is pushing the Mobile ID system, thus this would be an interesting proof of concept.StudentsTwo students from two different universities have an idea to develop a Blockchain + FIDO based online ticket purchase application, so they can eliminate black-market activities.StudentsFour students from the same university have an idea to develop a FIDO-based kiosk that can provide school documents for students. The school they attend already has such a kiosk that can print out their records but the system requests too much personal information and they are based on IDs and passwords.



<p>On July 1, we will have the mid-term meet-up event to share each team’s current development status and plans for the rest of the implementation phase.</p>



<p>Please stay tuned and we will come back with more updates on 2020 FIDO Hackathon in Korea.</p>

We are very proud to release a special webinar to introduce the next chapter of the “Self-Sovereign Identity Book” from two of the most eminent authorities on digital identity in government: Tim Bouma and Dave Roberts, senior public servants with the Government of Canada and major contributors to the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF).

In this chapter, Tim and Dave explain the PCTF model and how it maps to the SSI model and the Trust over IP (ToIP) stack.

This webinar describes how a world leader in digital identity (which Canada has been for two decades) sees the opportunity in the new decentralized identity model represented by SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity).

 Ishita Tiwary, Sandeep Mertia &amp; Siddharth Narrain  Sessions <p>The Internet today, as we know, is one of the most challenging socio-technical systems to understand and theorise. As a hybrid medium that perpetually, reinvents, redesigns and re-markets itself and its publics it defies all forms of historical, social, legal and technological determinisms and/or generalisations. The complex nature of the medium and the social and cultural lives of the information packets which flow through it can perhaps be better understood by heeding critical attention towards longer histories of media circulation, technology-society relationships and legal regulations.</p><p>The panel attempts to understand the way digital technologies (the Internet/the current digital moment) mediate aspects of our contemporary being through the history of media circulation, legal regulation and data infrastructure. The papers in the panel focus on three crucial periods — the 1940s early history of statistical mediation, the 1980s video moment and the early 2000s advent of legal regulation of the Internet. Each of these moments is marked by socio-technical, cultural and legal disruption as seen through both moral anxieties and utopian claims that circulate at the time. The panel attempts to understand media technologies through their technological affordances (unpacking current debates around data analytics through a history of statistical mediation) and the social and legal disruptions that follow their advent (video in the 80s and the Internet in late&nbsp;90s).</p><p>The papers in the panel approach the Internet and networked digital media as an assemblage of media infrastructures, bringing together both conceptual and material layers of their experience. The papers in this panel use a media archaeology approach (Elsaesser, 2004) to engage with the longer history of electronic communication in India by looking at both its material nature (how law produces the representation of digital media and the Internet), and the history of non narrative framework of databases (the Internet as a massive data infrastructure) which have become increasingly diverse and distributed through a network of institutions, practices and technological platforms.</p> Plan <p>Abstract I: ‘What is Video?’ Video and the Moment of Legal Disruption</p><p>The advent of YouTube changed the way users interact with media content as now they are making videos, watching videos, editing them, sharing them and discussing them at a frantic speed, creating new communities as they go along (Manovich, 2008).</p><p>The YouTube phenomenon and its implications cannot be understood without contextualizing it within the broader history of video. In India, the Asiad Games heralded the arrival of analog video technology, although there was no legal producer of video content in the country. In a sense video was an illegal object that spawned a vibrant economy of video films, video magazines and pornography.</p><p>Video cassettes were primarily in the pirate economy and circulated all across the country through video libraries and parlours. New Bollywood and Hollywood releases as well as pornographic films were available on video cassettes which initially did not have any film certification regulation. The new mode of circulation made these video exhibition spaces a lynchpin of moral paranoia and economic anxiety for those in authority-video was like a plague that needed to be monitored and regulated. This led to a string of legal regulations to keep the ‘video menace’ in check. Associations, organizations and forums protested the new wave of regulations as it pitched the medium of video against that of cinema, demanding new medium specific laws instead of amendments to previous laws on&nbsp;cinema.</p><p>In this paper, I will examine how the wave of regulations and contesting bodies creates a charged force field of the period that gives one a sense of a social, cultural and legal disruption caused by the arrival of a new technology. Particularly, I want to focus on how video as an illegal object circulates through informal circuits at a rapid pace and how the law deals with this new technological development. By looking at the example of video, it would be productive to think about the resonances the extended genealogies of how the law is interacting with the current digital moment through the prism of analog&nbsp;video.</p><p>Abstract II: Big Data 2.0 — A History of Statistical Remediation</p><p>One of the fast emerging themes in the understanding of the Internet is centred on its various technological affordances to generate, collect, measure, analyse, mine andvisualise data. With the recent (circa 2010) advent of the hype cycles of Big Data and data revolution, the socio-technical imaginaries which reveal the Internet as a massive data infrastructure have been gaining momentum. ‘Data’ which in many ways is an ontological byproduct of the Internet, is now increasingly becoming the object of thought and computation for understanding and analysing the Internet. This moment of flux invites us to reflect upon the genealogies of the concepts, techniques and practices which are consciously or otherwise informing the incredible epistemic investment in data-driven systems. With an aim to unpack some of the long histories of the contemporary data analytics movement and moment, this paper tries to trace some of the inflection points in the genealogies of analytics and statistical remediation in colonial and post-colonial India, with an emphasis on the works of P C Mahalanobis and the statistical framing of planning and governance in the pre- and post-independence era.</p><p>The author will utilise ethnographic and archival material from his on-going fieldwork on emerging data-driven systems in the social sector in India, to reflect upon the shifts in materiality of data, classificatory affordances of paper and software based systems, and their epistemic implications across two different epochs. In addition, as a methodological reflection, the paper will argue that — developing lateral, conceptual connections between pre-digital circulations and meaning making of numbers and their contemporary algorithmic ecologies, is crucial for moving beyond causalities and the Big Data hubris, towards a thicker anthropology of data-driven knowledge production across times, infrastructures and networks.</p><p>Abstract III: The History of Internet Law in&nbsp;India</p><p>The relationship between law and media technology in India has been broadly characterized as the law catching up with technological change. To unpack this statement, one needs to take into account how the law both shapes and is shaped by media technologies. As the law ‘catches up’ with new technology, it also characterizes this technology, brackets it, and helps reinforce popular perception of technology. This paper will examine the early history of Internet law in India, the debates that arose in the pre web 2.0 era, and the ways in which a wide variety of factors, over a period of 15 years, has gradually shaped the scope and extent of the law that governs the Internet, the Information Technology Act (IT),&nbsp;2000.</p><p>The IT Act, being relatively recent legislation is an ideal illustration to study the manner in which government policy, public perception, judicial pronouncements, parliamentary committee proceedings, legislative debates, and rapidly changing technology have influenced the shaping of this specific media infrastructure. By examining these documents I would like to open up a series questions around law and media technology How is the relationship between law and media technology staged through public discourse? What are the ways in which both the extremes — utopian hope and moral panic play out, and how are these then related to the more functional aspects of technology? Who were the major actors, individuals and institutions, who drove Internet law and regulation at this&nbsp;time?</p><p>By addressing these questions, this paper seeks to examine a small slice of the longer history of electronic communication in&nbsp;India.</p> Readings <p>Lovink, Geert and Nadiere, Sabine ed.

Samuel M. Smith will present KERI that stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. Its a ledger-less approach to identity that enables a universal decentralized key management infrastructure (DKMI). KERI is the basis for a new proposed universal DID method DID:uni. Because KERI identifiers are portable they are truly self-sovereign. The primary root-of-trust in KERI is a self-certifying identifier that is cryptographically bound to a set of key-pairs. These have fully generalized derivation mechanisms including content addressability with support for both rotatable and non-rotatable key-pairs. Its secondary root-of-trust are end-verifiable key event receipt logs. End verifiability means that KERI is not dependent on any intervening infrastructure. This fixes the primary security weakness of internet identity system security overlays thereby making KERI a candidate for a universal trust spanning layer for the internet to replace DNS-CA. KERI is an open-source project within the Decentralized Identity Foundation.

Samuel M. Smith Ph.D. works at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and decentralized computing systems as both an entrepreneur and strategic consultant. He has written and continues to write seminal white papers on decentralized identity, reputation AI, distributed computing, and tokenomics.

Ceramic is a new permissionless protocol for creating and accessing unstoppable documents that serve as the foundation for a connected, interoperable web without silos. Joel Thorstensson is the founder and CTO of 3Box and the primary author of the ceramic protocol as well as several Ethereum standards for identity and will provide a conceptual and technical intro to Ceramic.

At the root of many of the internet’s problems is that apps and services today are built primarily in silos. This includes identity registries and credentials, user data and access permissions, infrastructure, and services. It not only puts control over data and identities in the wrong hands, but it’s a fundamentally outdated and inefficient model for building digital products.

Ceramic unlocks information interoperability between all platforms and services across the web, allowing participants to create and resolve documents for any type of information without any centralized service. Ceramic uses DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers), IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data), signed messages, and blockchain anchoring to create a trusted and shared graph of verifiable documents. While flexible, these documents are especially well-suited for self-sovereign identity systems, user-centric data ecosystems, and open web services.

 Sailen Routray &amp; Khetrimayum Monish&nbsp;Singh  Session <p>The discussion in this session will focus on the cultures of practices around digital / information networks. The objective would be to open up the understanding around notions of identity and rights in the context of governance on one hand, and the proliferation of various subcultures on the other. The objective is to try and understand the political and cultural imaginations ‘of and as the public’ enabled by internet and digital technologies. In this, we are trying to connect the whole discussion to the first two questions the conference focuses&nbsp;on:</p><p>How do we conceptualise, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India?</p><p>How do we frame and explore the experiences and usages of internet and digital media technologies in India within its specific historical-material contexts shaped by traditional hierarchies of knowledge, colonial systems of communication, post-independence initiatives in nation-wide technologies of governance, a rapidly growing telecommunication market, and informal circuits of media production and consumption, among&nbsp;others?</p> Plan <p>Each discussant will present for 20 minutes after which the session will be thrown open for discussion amongst all the participants of the&nbsp;session.</p><p>Abstract I</p><p>Internet in India has led to the proliferation of practices and notions of governance and citizenship simulated by information networks and data. On one hand, the internet has captured the imagination of citizens and the reassertion of user agency; on the other, the experiences with the internet reflects the new ways of how the state imagines itself and the citizens. Hence, not only a critical mass replete with the possibilities of user agency, but also one aggregated by the state as part of a political project. Initiatives such as Digital India, the Aadhar project, rural internet and increased emphasis on mobile internet services are some of ways through which the logic of access and participation now operates. The paper will draw perspectives from four case studies in Assam — the Mahanagar Project (internet and mobile services), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) update, the Aadhaar Project and rural internet kiosks (Common Service Centers). With these, it focuses on the larger context of the cultures of digital practices; and techno-politics through the various sites and projects through which the internet operates in&nbsp;India.</p><p>Abstract II</p><p>Those of us who have jumped or meandered across to the wrong (or perhaps the right) side of thirty by now, first came to consume internet in what were called, and are still called, cyber cafes or internet cafes. Their numbers in big Indian cities is dwindling because of the increasing ubiquity of smartphone, and netbooks and data cards. The cyber café seems to be inexorably headed the way of the STD booth in the geography of large Indian cities. The present paper is a preliminary step towards capturing some of the experience of running and using internet cafes. With ethnographic fieldwork with cyber café owners and internet users in these cafes in the Chandrasekharpur area of Bhubaneswar (where the largest section of the computer industry in the state of Odisha is located), this paper tries to capture experiences that lie at the interstices of ‘objects’ and spaces — experiences that are at the same time a history of the internet as well as a personal history of the city. By doing so it tries to ask and answer the question — what kinds of publics does the consumption of the internet in spaces such as cybercafes create?</p> Readings <p>Escobar, Arturo, et al. 1994.

<p>Megan Shamas, Director of Marketing, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Over the last several years, eIDAS regulation has been widely adopted by the EU member states, and several eIDAS-compliant services and eID schemes have been rolled out across Europe.</p>



<p>eIDAS stands for “electronic identification, authentication and trust services.” It builds the legal basis for cross-border interoperability of electronic identification, authentication, and electronic signatures amongst EU Member States. eIDAS is meant to enable mutual recognition of eID and trust services across the EU in a regulated, secure and private manner. In a world where transactions are increasingly digital and without borders, this recognition and trust is essential.</p>



<p>FIDO Authentication is a natural fit for the delivery of services that meet eIDAS regulations, and many of our members are working with governments and service providers to enable secure and seamless electronic interactions throughout the EU. To give an overview and more in-depth details on how FIDO and eIDAS intersect, we’ve released two new white papers. The first, “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-introduction-of-fido-eidas-services/">Introduction of FIDO and eIDAS Services</a>” serves as an introductory white paper describing the relationship between FIDO2 standards and eIDAS compliant schemes that can accommodate modern authentication protocols. The second, “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-using-fido-with-eidas-services/">Using FIDO with eIDAS Services</a>” is a more detailed look at how FIDO can be used with eIDAS services, including architectural concepts for integration of FIDO2 into the eIDAS interoperability framework.</p>



<p>Sebastian Elfors, Solutions Architect at Yubico, the lead contributor for the new papers, had this to say about the intersection of FIDO and eIDAS:</p>



<p>“The modern FIDO standard, and its wide adoption by the largest IT-companies all over the globe, provides a viable framework for expanding and modernizing eIDAS services across Europe. In the intersection between eIDAS and FIDO, there are a number of emerging deployment scenarios that will benefit the public sector in the European Union. There are already several eID schemes being notified by the EU Commission this year, the number of Qualified Trust Service Providers are constantly growing, and more government services are enabling cross-border eID support.”</p>



<p>To expand on this topic and information in the new white papers, Sebastian will join our executive director and CMO Andrew Shikiar to lead a webinar on May 28 at 15:00 CEST. The webinar will include:</p>



  An introduction to eIDAS  An overview on how to use FIDO as part of an eID scheme  An overview on using FIDO2 for authentication to Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs)  



<p>There will be time for Q&amp;A, so please bring your questions!&nbsp;</p>

Jaehoon Shim, a blockchain researcher at LG CNS and the founder of SSIMeetup Korea, will introduce the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) ecosystem of South Korea. South Korea became a hotbed of Self Sovereign Identity in the last couple of years. The number of government-funded projects, including the mobile credential for government officials, requires using DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers). Also, hundreds of enterprises joined public/private consortia on decentralized identity to empower the digital transformation of the South Korean society. Jaehoon will explain in detail the current ecosystem and discuss opportunities for the future.

The European Commission developed the SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) eIDAS bridge, an ISA2 funded initiative, to promote eIDAS as a trust framework for the SSI ecosystem. It assists a VC (Verifiable Credential) issuer in the signing process, and helps the verifier to automate the identification of the organization behind the issuer’s DID (Decentralized Identifier). Simply by “crossing” the eIDAS Bridge, a Verifiable Credential can be proven trustworthy in the EU. Ignacio Alamillo will present at this SSI Meetup webinar the insights gained from this report.

In the context of the eIDAS bridge project, we performed an analysis on how eIDAS can legally support digital identity and trustworthy DLT-based transactions in the Digital Single Market, and this is reflected in the SSI eIDAS legal report, available at this link. The objective of this report is to evaluate the potential legal issues that are important to an SSI solution and make some recommendations to be used as policy input for the eIDAS 2020 review. The report outlines short-term objectives, where changes in the Regulation would not be necessary, but also mid to long-term scenarios requiring major changes in the Regulation to comply with the SSI design principles.

The different scenarios described in the report are aligned with the proposed architectural and procedural considerations designed in the SSI eIDAS Bridge project and the European Self Sovereign Identity Framework.

 Governments, nonprofits and private sectors across finance, health care, enterprise software and more team up with Linux Foundation to enhance universal security and privacy protocols for consumers and businesses in the digital era 
<p>The ToIP Foundation is being developed with global, pan-industry support from leading organizations with sector-specific expertise. Founding Steering members include Accenture, BrightHive, Cloudocracy, Continuum Loop, CULedger, Dhiway, esatus, Evernym, Finicity, Futurewei Technologies, IBM Security, IdRamp, Lumedic, Mastercard, MITRE, the Province of British Columbia and SICPA. Contributing members include DIDx, GLEIF, The Human Colossus Foundation, iRespond, kiva.org, Marist College, Northern Block, R3, Secours.io, TNO and University of Arkansas.</p>
<p>Businesses today are struggling to protect and manage digital assets and data, especially in an increasingly complex enterprise environment that includes the Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and much more. This is compounding the already low consumer confidence in the use of personal data and is slowing innovation on opportunities like digital identity and the adoption of new services that can support humanity.</p>
<p>Without a global standard for how to ensure digital trust, these trends are bound to continue. The ToIP Foundation will use digital identity models that leverage interoperable digital wallets and credentials and the new W3C Verifiable Credentials standard to address these challenges and enable consumers, businesses and governments to better manage risk, improve digital trust and protect all forms of identity online.</p>
<p>“The ToIP Foundation has the promise to provide the digital trust layer that was missing in the original design of the Internet and to trigger a new era of human possibility,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director at the Linux Foundation. “The combination of open standards and protocols, pan-industry collaboration and our neutral governance structure will support this new category of digital identity and verifiable data exchange.”</p>
<p>The Linux Foundation’s open governance model enables the ToIP Foundation to advance a combination of technology and governance standards for digital trust in a neutral forum that supports pan-industry collaboration. An open governance model that can be integrated into the development of the standards for digital trust is essential where the business, legal and social guidelines for technology adoption impacts human trust and behavior.</p>
<p>The ToIP Foundation will initially host four Working Groups. The Technical Stack Working Group and the Governance Stack Working Group will focus on building out and hardening the Technical and Governance halves of the ToIP stack, respectively. The Utility Foundry Working Group and the Ecosystem Foundry Working Group will serve as communities of practice for projects that wish to collaborate on the development of ToIP utility networks or entire ToIP digital trust ecosystems.</p>
<p>The ToIP Foundation will host an all-digital launch event on May 7, 2020 at 9AM PDT that will feature a panel discussion, interoperability demonstration and live Q&amp;A. <a href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_EpGdgdcITrymDTDfPP2HjA">Register now</a> for the live event. A <a href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_lRFkWHgVQnWeQYF9geLEbg">second event</a> will be hosted for the APAC region.</p>

<p>Steering Member Comments</p>
<p>Accenture</p>
<p>“The internet and digital technologies are a critical part of the way we engage with each other and with organizations. Accenture has a deep commitment to developing solutions to build trust, protect privacy and put control of an individual’s data squarely in their hands. The Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation is bringing together a powerful mix of experts and doing it at the exact right time given the urgent need to encourage greater adoption and increase trust in data privacy and ownership,” said Christine Leong, managing director, global lead for Decentralized Identity &amp; Biometrics at Accenture.</p>
<p>BrightHive</p>
<p>“Now, perhaps more than ever, networks of public and private sector organizations know the value that can be created by collaborating with one another around their combined data to create novel insights and better align their work. But they also want to collaborate in the most responsible way possible. The work of the Trust over IP Foundation will radically strengthen the infrastructure of responsible data sharing by establishing a global standard for digital trust—ensuring that the very way that data is exchanged and verified creates a much-needed layer of security, privacy and trust. BrightHive is excited by the promise of this standard, and proud to partner with the other members to help see it realized,” said Matt Gee, CEO, BrightHive.</p>
<p>Cloudocracy</p>
<p>“Trust is the foundational element of all relationships between government, organizations, and each of us as individuals.&nbsp;Trust at Internet-scale, serves our greater global community and is best accomplished by communities of trust ecosystems. The Trust Over IP Foundation is the next stage of enabling this journey globally.&nbsp;The paradigm-shifting model of decentralized, person-centric identity is likely one of the most important breakthroughs in data privacy, cyber security and unlocking business value in many years.&nbsp;Cloudocracy seeks to facilitate coalitions of government, supply-chains and individuals to embark on journeys to establish value-based trust ecosystems towards achieving highly secure and empowered private ecosystems and the public-private ‘Internet of Value.’&nbsp;The global shift will go beyond enabling government and organizations to reduce costs, complexity and add value but will also help steer to a better compass heading in protecting individual data privacy, health and biometric information, while also reducing risks and economic impacts of cyber security data breaches,” said Will Groah, executive director, Cloudocracy.</p>
<p>Continuum Loop</p>
<p>“The leaders we work with know that trust on the Internet isn’t working. They want to start building deep trust with their customers and partners. Our clients are investing, as are we, in the Trust Over IP Foundation. We all want to make sure we are involved in building the digital trust layer that the Internet needs. The technology works – now it is about building business cases and governance,” said Darrell O’Donnell, president and CEO, Continuum Loop.</p>
<p>CULedger</p>
<p>“The credit union movement is based on the idea that trusted interactions between people connected by a common bond are the best interactions.&nbsp; A self-sovereign, secure, trusted identity, like MemberPass, is essential in the world ahead, and CULedger is paving the way for credit unions and financial cooperatives worldwide to pioneer this important effort and bring this frictionless digital experience to more than 270 million credit union members.&nbsp; The work developed out of the Trust over IP Foundation will be the cornerstone to facilitate these trusted interactions in the new digital age.&nbsp; We are excited about the opportunity to be working with other leading organizations in support of this effort,” said John Ainsworth, president/CEO, CULedger.</p>
<p>Dhiway </p>
<p>“Dhiway is happy to join the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation as one of the founding members. Our strategic initiatives are designed to bring a higher degree of assurance to the exchange of data between peers, over the Internet and other digital networks. Our participation is aligned with our vision to make the world more transparent and trusted,&nbsp;using digital frameworks that can be universally referenced, understood and consumed.&nbsp; We intend to contribute our knowledge and expertise to support the ToIP foundation in its mission to build an interoperable architecture for Internet-scale digital trust –&nbsp; empowering a growing ecosystem of companies and communities to exercise control over their digital assets. It’s encouraging to see the open collaboration that has led to the formation of this Foundation, and we are humbled and thrilled to be a part of this pioneering effort,” said Satish Mohan, Founder &amp; CTO, Dhiway.</p>
<p>esatus</p>
<p>“On our mission of enforcing information security, strong trust relationships are essential. We need them to be equally strong in the real world and online. The Trust over IP Foundation facilitates easy composition, ramp-up and maintenance of digital trust components. Conveying real-world trust online is ultimately possible at flexibility and scale. esatus enterprise solutions employ digital trust components already, making next-gen security and privacy available to its customers today. Being a founding member of the Trust over IP Foundation is a natural fit,” said Dr. André Kudra, CIO at esatus AG.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Evernym</p>
<p>“Evernym believes the only way to truly solve the avalanche of trust problems on the Internet is with an open standard and open governance model that is as universal as the TCP/IP stack that created the Internet itself. We have helped build the architecture of the ToIP stack layer by layer for the past three years, including the W3C Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers standards that are at the heart of this new model, because we believe it will unlock a new explosion of value for every person, business, community and government using digital communications. We are thrilled to help stand up the ToIP Foundation at the Linux Foundation and hope that it attracts every company and contributor who wants to build a strong and lasting trust layer for the Internet,” said Drummond Reed, chief trust officer at Evernym and co-editor of the W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification.</p>
<p>Finicity</p>
<p>“The Internet has fueled incredible innovation over that past few decades. And yet it has been significantly handicapped due to a general lack of trust. As we solve the trust dilemma, we will see a rapid acceleration of innovations that will change the way we do business, connect with others and consume information and entertainment,” said Nick Thomas, president &amp; chief scientist and innovation officer, Finicity. “Finicity looks forward to advancing digital trust standards through its participation in the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation.”</p>

<p>“In today’s digital economy, businesses and consumers need a way to be certain that data being exchanged has been sent by the rightful owner and that it will be accepted as truth by the intended recipient. Many privacy focused innovations are now being developed to solve this challenge, but there is no ‘recipe book’ for the exchange of trusted data across multiple vendor solutions,” said Dan Gisolfi, CTO, Decentralized Identity, IBM Security. “The new Trust over IP Foundation marks an evolutionary step which goes beyond standards, specs and code, with the goal of creating a community-driven playbook for establishing ‘ecosystems of trust.’ IBM believes that the next wave of innovation in identity access management will be for credential issuers and verifiers to partake in these ecosystems, where trusted relationships are built upon cryptographic proofs.”</p>

<p>“Formation of The ToIP Foundation will transform and improve how digital services operate. Traditional centralized identity systems are hinged to vast security vulnerabilities that are not sustainable in a growing digital economy. Centralized services for things like mufti-factor authentication or social login encumber user flow and unnecessarily expose sensitive information to third parties. Decentralized systems resolve these problems but struggle with interoperability and standards to accelerate mass adoption. The Trust Over IP Foundation will help formalize and simplify adoption of Trust as a basic digital utility for everyone. The TOIP stack provides the foundation for a new generation of digital identity services. These services will provide high security frictionless interaction that put the user in control of their personal data. Organizations will establish personal connections with employees and user communities that are immune to the vulnerabilities of centralized systems. Individuals will be able to connect with one another without exposing personal information to the mediators that regulate digital interactions today. This will help businesses move beyond complex identity security investments that erode the bottom line and slow innovation. Verifiable digital trust in a decentralized data economy will open a world of possibilities for all individuals and businesses. As a founding member of the ToIP foundation, IdRamp is committed to helping businesses build a new decentralized digital economy that will evolve organically from traditional centralized systems,” said Mike Vesey, CEO, IdRamp.</p>

 Dibyajyoti Ghosh &amp; Purbasha&nbsp;Auddy <p>The proposed workshop will focus on internet usage in India and the possibilities that the internet offers for representation of data. The workshop will be divided into two parts, the first, of a more general nature, and the second, will focus on one specific aspect of data — representation. While the first part will be more of a documentation exercise, the second part will be a hands-on exercise of some data representation tools that are available on the internet.</p> Plan <p>Part I: The Nature of Internet Usage in&nbsp;India</p><p>The workshop will engage the participants in trying to map the ways that they use the internet in their daily lives, such as circulating emails, using social networks, downloading software, online commerce, academic research, circulating audio and video, etc. This part of the workshop will try to study ‘the starkly hierarchical and segmented experiences and usages of the [internet] in India’. The study will try to distinguish between those who are consumers of data and systems and those who, in addition to consuming, also produce data and systems. Various types of production of data will also be looked at, such as crowdsourcing data (such as in Wikipedia, or restaurant review or hotel review websites).</p><p>The workshop will be conducted in an interactive manner, where the participants will enter their responses in an online collaborative platform (Google Sheets), which will be editable by all the participants. This brief documentation exercise will also be used to prepare a report at the end of the conference.</p><p>After completing this exercise of mapping the usage of the internet, the second segment of the workshop will try to explore various ways of representing data. This exercise will be done by using tools available online.</p><p>Part II: Representation of&nbsp;Data</p><p>This part of the workshop will deal with various kinds of data representation, of various kinds of data that users contribute to the internet through websites, such as social networks, blogs, etc. The workshop will try to look at the various existing ways in visualising and representing such data through the internet, such as chronology timelines, location mapping, network mapping, enhanced text representation such as through display of XML-Text Encoding Initiative (XML-TEI) files, etc. so as to enhance the data and open up other aspects of the data not usually evident in forms such as lists and spreadsheets.</p><p>The participants will be led through to the creation of small chronology timelines and location mapping in particular. Therefore participants will be requested to contribute data in the form of simple and small English texts which have either several markers of time, or several markers of location, so as to enable such visualisation. Examples of such texts include biographies, travel narratives, etc. The workshop will discuss how to filter ‘structured data’ from prose text to get desirable result from the softwares.</p><p>This part of the workshop will try to answer the question as to ‘how do we begin to use the internet as a space for academic and creative practice and intervention?’ The workshop will use open-access tools and software so as to highlight the low-investment infrastructure that is often sufficient enough to represent and enhance&nbsp;data.</p> Readings <p>Participants are requested to look at two visualisation tools in particular (both of which were developed by the Knight Lab in Northwestern University, USA), one for creating a chronology timeline (<a href="https://projects.knightlab.com/projects/timelinejs">https://projects.knightlab.com/projects/timelinejs</a>) and the other for creating a location map (<a href="https://projects.knightlab.com/projects/storymapjs">https://projects.knightlab.com/projects/storymapjs</a>).</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day2.SpottingData">IRC 2016: Day 2 #Spotting Data : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Dibyajyoti Ghosh is a PhD student in the Department of English, Jadavpur University.

<p>In a <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/immunity-certificates">white paper</a>, published today by the <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/">Harvard University Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics</a>, ID2020 Executive Director Dakota Gruener urged policy makers, technology providers, and civil society organizations to collaborate to ensure that digital health credentials or “immunity certificates”, if implemented, are intentionally designed to protect privacy and civil liberties.</p><p>Over the past couple weeks, public health officials and policy makers have begun making the case for digital health credentials or “immunity certificates”. If implemented in conjunction with large-scale testing (for the COVID-19 virus and antibodies), immunity certificates could facilitate an incremental and orderly return to economic and social activities. While this presents a compelling opportunity, and one which may be worth considering, such a system cannot be allowed to compromise personal privacy rights, promote exclusion, or exacerbate existing social inequities.</p><p>“We all share an obligation to protect public health. But doing so should not mean giving up our right to privacy,” noted Gruener. “Proven technologies, grounded in a respect for equity and human rights, can be redeployed to help protect society from a resurgence of the disease and put control of personal health information in the hands of the individual. But this approach must be pursued cautiously, with a full acknowledgement of the risks, and detailed plans to mitigate&nbsp;them.”</p><p>Immunity certificates would enable workplaces, schools, medical facilities, airlines, and other public or private venues to identify those who have tested positive for the antibody (OR who have recently tested negative for the virus) through a verified credential issued by a medical provider (or certified testing center) and carried on a mobile phone. Because the credential is stored on the phone, rather than in a centralized database, it is vastly more secure and would enable the user to share it when, and with whom, they&nbsp;choose.</p><p>At this point, testing continues to lag far behind what would be needed to properly implement immunity certificates. But, with sufficient public investment and political will, the necessary level of testing could be achieved in the weeks and months ahead. Scaling access to serological testing will also help firm up our understanding of the virus, including the presence and duration of immunity and the potential for re-infection. At this time, these remain open questions.</p><p>The white paper is intended to further the public discourse about immunity certificates and ensure that such systems are developed consistent with the principles outlined in the <a href="https://id2020.org/manifesto">ID2020 Manifesto</a> for digital ID (developed in 2018 in partnership with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees). The Technical Requirements that underlie the <a href="http://id2020.org/certification">ID2020 Certification</a> also provide a valuable roadmap to assist technology providers and governments in the development of ethical, inclusive digital identity solutions, including digital health credentials.</p><p>Widespread social distancing orders have proven an effective strategy for containing the spread of the virus. But these strategies are not without significant economic, social, and psychological consequences. The time is now to begin planning for the next phase of the COVID-19 response and recovery. “If we need to do immunity certificates”, said Gruener, “let’s make sure we do them&nbsp;right.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/immunity-certificates-if-we-must-have-them-we-must-do-it-right-7524829901d6">Immunity Certificates: If We Must Have Them, We Must Do It Right</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Akriti Rastogi and Ishani&nbsp;Dey  Session <p>Amour fou is saturated with its own aesthetic, it fills itself to the borders of itself with the trajectories of its own gestures, it runs on angels’ clocks, it is not a fit fate for commissars &amp; shopkeepers. Its ego evaporates in the mutability of desire, its communal spirit withers in the selfishness of obsession. (Bey,&nbsp;1985)</p><p>Confronted with consolidating rhizomatic concerns that inevitably crop their heads in any forum on internet discussions, let alone cinema, AF, or Amour fou encapsulates the very essence of free access cinema — AF is “not the result of freedom but rather its precondition” (Bey, 1985), AF is Cinema in web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>The proposed session will be an interactive conversation exploring the Indian scenario of internet based independent filmmaking. The key concerns mediating this dialogue are the mobilization of the internet as a space of exhibition and distribution and its implications in moving through extra-legal spaces, garnering cultural capital and articulating desires of its audience. The purpose here is to engage with cinema within “the broader industrial, institutional, and market contexts in which film exists” moving away from film scholarship focusing solely on the “meaning of the text” while disregarding the very circumstances in which those texts or discourses are “produced and circulated” (McDonald, 2013:&nbsp;147).</p><p>Drawing from traditional methods in cinema scholarship, we turn to our own research methods in trying to articulate contextual engagements with amorphous forms of medium, media and archive. We explore the research potentials that the internet provides as an immediate archive of the contemporary while providing provocations to engage with the internet as an alternative space for film exhibition, distribution and funding. While Ishani Dey explores the mobilization of internet’s potential as an alternative space for film exhibition tracing connections that link pirate circuits, film festivals and subversive mainstream aesthetic shifts; Akriti Rastogi provides an overview of entrepreneurial space of internet based independent filmmaking and the surge in DIY filmmaking in web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>The session concludes with mediations over the poetics of technological access. The internet’s prolific open access archive’s potential to foster cinephilia and the mutations in viewing habits that ensue lead to novel cinematic experiences and their implication for the profilmic aesthetic. In continuum our encounters with the mainstream and anonymous figures etches out the narrative of experiencing cinema and filmmaking in web&nbsp;2.0.</p> Plan <p>This session proposes to conceptualize the implications of open access digital media spaces for cinema in India. Reading cinema as a product of market driven industry factors it interrogates the shifting industrial, institutional, and market contexts which contemporary India cinema negotiates and the implications of contingent media, mode and exhibition on the cinematic experience. The primary concern is to form methods to navigate the expansive archive of the internet and mark the potentials for alternate production and distribution practices that lie within. The session proposes to walk through a number of case studies illustrating the dissolution of dichotomies that is brought about by the interventions of digital and new media technologies. Drawing parallels between earlier shifts in cinema studies discourses with the coming in of videotape and satellite television in India in the 80s and the contemporary debates surrounding digital film practices and direct to home transmissions, the session attempts to historicize cinephilia within the milieu of technophilia in&nbsp;India.</p> Provocations <p>Informal distribution networks like peer-to-peer distribution and pirate circles come to the foreground in the discussion on the construct of the cinephile. While the space of the auteur-entrepreneur claims the spotlight in discussions surrounding linkages in film exhibition — navigating through pirate circles to film festivals, bootlegging to the big&nbsp;league.</p><p>The figure of the anonymous filmmaker stands precariously on the divide of the legal and extra-legal boundary that the internet thrives in traversing, thus emerging as a vast platform for exhibition that is then mobilized by the DIY filmmaker. The growing popularity of the short film format and the shifts in viewing screens are seen as symptomatic of internet’s effect on cinema’s aesthetic.</p><p>The essential provocation here is that while cinema affects the modes of archiving on the internet, the internet in turn affects the cinematic form.</p> Readings <p>McDonald, P.

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The coronavirus outbreak is not only raising public health concerns, but also exposing many office employees who are forced to work at home to greater cybersecurity risk, especially online phishing attacks which is known to be the origin of more than 80% of cyber attacks.</p>



<p>In order to help Koreans to stay protected from such online phishing attacks, the FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group just launched the FIDO Security Key Support Campaign. Sponsored by eWBM, AirCuve (Yubico Partner) and Octatco, the FIDO Security Key Support Campaign will provide 300 FIDO physical security keys to Koreans who are working remotely where their networks and devices are less protected.</p>



<a href="https://form.office.naver.com/form/responseView.cmd?formkey=ZGQ1NmM1YWQtMGQ5MC00ZmUyLWIyZDUtNzRlNzY0OTM2YWZk&amp;sourceId=urlshare"></a>



<p>Dr. Daniel Ahn, the Co-Chair of FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group, said, “It is our pleasure to practice social contribution by closely collaborating among the FIDO Alliance members in Korea. Similar to our 2020 FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge, we will continue to develop and provide social contribution programs that can educate the public about FIDO protocols while leaving positive social impacts.”</p>



<p>The application for campaign ends on April 17th, 2020.&nbsp; For those who wish to receive a free FIDO security key, the online application site can be found by clicking the campaign banner on the sponsoring member’s website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Links to sponsoring member websites:<br>eWBM (<a href="https://www.ewbm.co.kr/">https://www.ewbm.co.kr/</a>)<br>AirCuve (<a href="http://www.aircuve.com/">http://www.aircuve.com/</a>)<br>Octatco (<a href="https://octatco.com/">https://octatco.com/</a>)</p>



<p>We are happy to work with our members on this campaign in Korea, and plan to evaluate its success and lessons learned to inform possible programs in other regions of the world. </p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Editor’s Note: We began the Hackathon program last year to support the local developer community and drive market adoption of FIDO Authentication standards in Korea. The 2019 FIDO Hackathon was a hybrid of a three-month-long mentorship and a service development competition, which unlocked the potential of FIDO protocols along with unexpected positive outcomes. Please visit the following blog postings to learn more about 2019 FIDO Hackathon:</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-authentication-developer-support-program-fido-hackathon-in-korea/">FIDO Authentication Developer Support Program: FIDO Hackathon in Korea</a><br><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-hackathon-in-korea-qa-with-the-top-3-winners-and-their-mentors/">FIDO Hackathon in Korea: A Q&amp;A with the Top 3 Winners and their Mentors</a><br><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-hackathon-in-korea-meet-the-finalists/">FIDO Hackathon in Korea: Meet the Finalists</a></p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group is thrilled to announce the opening of&nbsp; online registration for the 2020 FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge in Korea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program can be simply summarized as following three phases:</p>



<p>LEARN – Learn how to adopt FIDO protocols<br>IMPLEMENT – Implement FIDO protocols into participants’ online services<br>CHANGE – Change to simpler and stronger FIDO authentication</p>



<p>Now, let us walk through the three simple phases.</p>



<p>Once the registration closes at the end of April, those who qualify will be invited to the online learning stage created by the FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group Technical Sub-Group. Toward the end of the LEARN phase, participating teams will be given a very easy online assignment. Those who score in the&nbsp; top 20 will be invited to the next stage. The LEARN phase is scheduled to be completed by the end of June.</p>



<p>The IMPLEMENT phase will take place in July, inviting the top 20 teams to one-day, in-person events. Participants will fine-tune their service developments in the morning with hands-on support by FIDO experts from FIDO Alliance members. In the afternoon and evening (if necessary), participants will&nbsp; go through onsite evaluation. In case there is still a concern for public health in summer, we have prepared various backup plans, including completely converting the event into multiple online evaluation sessions over a period of time.</p>



<p>At the annual multi-day FIDO Seoul Public Seminar in early September, the top 5 teams will show how they have made the CHANGE to simpler and stronger FIDO Authentication, followed by award ceremonies. The top five teams and finalists will receive trophies and certification of completion, and over KRW20,000,000 worth of gifts and prizes.</p>



<p>Dr. Daniel Ahn, the Co-Chair of FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group would like to welcome local developers to join the 2020 FIDO Hackathon with following remarks:</p>



<p>“Due to the recent global public health concerns, the needs for simpler and stronger FIDO authentication will be increased due to the increasing demands for ‘untact’ and remote working technologies. Building upon the success of 2019 FIDO Hackathon in Korea, the FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group members will diligently prepare yet another meaningful event for local developers.”</p>



<p>On behalf of all the sponsors of 2020 FIDO Hackathon, Mr. Junho Shin, the Co-Leader of FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group Public Policy and Certification Sub-Group, would like to share a few words:</p>



<p>“Without knowing what would happen early this year, we began preparing 2020 FIDO Hackathon to be as much virtual as possible, for possible global-scale program expansion in upcoming years. Therefore, we are technically and operationally fully prepared to run this event without any public health concern, so those who consider joining the program would not lose the priceless opportunity to showcase their talents to the world.”</p>



<p>We thank you for your continued interest and support for FIDO Hackathon – The Developer Support Program and welcome you to visit our official registration site by clicking the 2020 FIDO Hackathon banner below:</p>

 The COVID-19 pandemic requires various medical and government authorities to aggregate&nbsp;data about available resources from a wide range of medical facilities.&nbsp;Clearly standard schemas for this structured data can be very useful.<br><br>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the U.S. defined a set of data fields to facilitate exchange&nbsp;of this data. We are introducing <a href="https://schema.org/docs/cdc-covid.html">a Schema.org representation</a> of these data fields.&nbsp;<br><br>The purpose of this schema definition is to provide a standards-based representation that can be used to encode and exchange records that correspond to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/covid19/import-covid19-data-508.pdf">CDC format</a>, with usage within the U.S. primarily in mind. While the existence of this schema may provide additional implementation options for those working with US hospital reporting data about COVID-19, please refer to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/acute-care-hospital/covid19/index.html">CDC</a> and other appropriate bodies for authoritative guidance on the latest reporting workflows and data formats.<br><br>Depending upon&nbsp;context, any of the formats and standards that work with Schema.org may be applicable for encoding this data, including the Microdata, RDFa and JSON-LD data formats, as well as related technologies such as W3C SPARQL for data query. JSON-LD is in most cases likely to be the most appropriate format. There is no assumption that data encoded using this schema should necessarily be published on the public Web, nor that it would be used by search engines.<br><br>We will continue to improve this vocabulary in the light of <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2521">feedback</a>, and welcome <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#heading=h.5h19yhvfnjve">suggestions</a> for improvements and additions particularly from US healthcare organizations who are using it.&nbsp;This CDC-based vocabulary follows other recent changes we have made to <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>. For details of recent changes see our <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v7.03">release notes</a>&nbsp;and our <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2020/03/schema-for-coronavirus-special.html">previous post </a>announcing the <a href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a> markup, which is now supported at both Bing (<a href="https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/march-2020/Bing-adopts-schema-org-mark-up-for-Special-Announcements-about-COVID-19">blog</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/special-announcement-specifications-5cbd6249">docs</a>) and Google (<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/04/highlight-covid-19-announcements-search.html">blog</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/special-announcements">docs</a>). As the global response to COVID-19 evolves we will do our best to improve schema.org's vocabularies to represent the changes that Coronavirus is bringing to society, and to assist those using structured data to help with the response.<br><br><br>

 Ranjani M Prasad and Farah&nbsp;Yameen Source: <a href="http://www.cckonline.in/">Centre for Community Knowledge (CCK) at Ambedkar University Delhi</a> Session <p>In the last decade, the internet has aided a proliferation of information networks — Google Books, archive.org, Hathi Trust, pad.ma and similar archive based knowledge platforms — and cloud based data storage has become a useful and accessible alternative to file based&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The session opens up with questions of accessibility, ownership and hegemonies in an active archive. It takes up three archives that are being built at Ambedkar Univeristy and other similar archives to explore the emerging issues of knowledge sharing on the internet.</p>  The Lotika Vardarajan archive is an ethnographic archive putting together an academic’s research on indigenous Maritime and Textile traditions and their indepth documentation.  The Delhi Oralities Archive is an oral history archive of city memories and resident narratives that seeks to be accessible to the city as an open resource.  The Institutional Memory Archive is a living archive continuously reinventing itself according the needs of the university campus that it documents.  <p>The archiving impulses in each case are different as are the dissemination needs of the archive. How do Internet tools like social media, audio and video distribution platforms like Soundcloud and YouTube intervene in the archiving space to enable and catalyze access? Do dissemination strategies provided by Twitter and Facebook affect the use and usability of archives? Does such access threaten questions of ownership and privacy? Who owns a public archive like Delhi Oralities? What hierarchies operate in living archives to decide what is archived and who archives it? What are the limits of such knowledge repositories and the open access movement itself, especially in the light of traditional knowledge structures?</p> Plan <p>The discussion session explores questions of archives outside the academic research space. It discusses the possibility of using non-traditional platforms for data sharing to maximize access, sustainability and co-authorship for living archives.</p> Readings <p>Basic knowledge about existing social media platforms, open source repository softwares such as DSpace and familiarity with Creative Commons licensing.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day1.ArchiveAnarchy">IRC 2016: Day 1 #Archive Anarchy : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Ranjani M Prasad is a researcher and archivist, currently based out of Nilgiris and working with Keystone Foundation. She has been working with archiving methodologies over the last 8 years and is interested in intersections between histories, cultures, memories and technologies.</p><p>Farah Yameen works with public histories and digital archives. As an independent researcher operating on the margins of academia she engages with oral narratives, ethnographies, and their digital&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Note: This session was part of the first <a href="https://cis-india.org/raw/irc16">Internet Researchers’ Conference 2016 (IRC16)</a>&nbsp;, organised in collaboration with the Centre for Political Studies (CPS), at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, on February 26–28, 2016.

Attend this webinar to learn about the eSSIF-Lab (EU H2020) project with Oskar van Deventer and Rieks Joosten from TNO in the Netherlands.

WHY: the eSSIF-Lab vision, objectives, and intended benefits;
WHAT: its (initial) functional architecture/components;
HOW: ways in which you may contribute (and possibly get funded for that).

eSSIF-Lab is an EU H2020 project whose purpose is to fundamentally improve real-life transactions via the Internet, by focusing on next-generation mental models for such next generation transactions, and using SSI technologies and implementations to realize them.

Today, conducting an online business transaction consist of an individual that fills in an online form, which is subsequently processed (data is validated, and a commitment decision is made). Filling in and validating forms can be quite tedious, frustrating, time consuming and costly. Digitally inexperienced people are known to give up on requesting (social) benefits they are entitled to, enlarging the digital divide. But even people with an academic background and years of IT experience find this difficult.

In the SSI-enabled world as eSSIF-Lab sees it, an SSI IT infrastructure can help to find, provide and validate the needed data electronically. This makes filling and processing forms much easier (people no longer have to understand forms, upload pdfs, etc.), much faster (people no longer have to go places to get paperwork) much cheaper (saving tens of billions of euro’s – or even more – on verification/validation costs and IT-links).

The current wealth of SSI-related products, technologies and standards is insufficient for realizing this vision, because it generally lacks interoperability and scalability, and does not address the process- and business levels.

eSSIF-Lab calls for a scalable and interoperable technological infrastructure that is very easy to use by and integrate with (the IT, the processes and the business/policies of) arbitrary organizations and individuals to request, obtain, store and issue data objects whose meaning (semantics), origin (provenance) and integrity can be proved (verified) – which is basically what SSI is all about.

The main task of the eSSIF-Lab consortium is to coordinate between and fund projects of SME’s/startups (from EU/EEA countries) that contribute to the realization of this vision, in terms of technology and/or associated business propositions, and that will work together so as to benefit from each other’s contributions.

<p>Authenticate Event Team</p>



<p>Authenticate, the inaugural FIDO conference, will be postponed from its original date of June 2-3. The good news is we have secured a date later this year in the same location in Seattle, WA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authenticate 2020 will now take place on November 9-10, 2020, with the FIDO Alliance member plenary following on November 11-12. Please visit <a href="http://www.authenticatecon.com">www.authenticatecon.com</a> for the latest information and to register.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The industry response to Authenticate has been outstanding on all fronts. We had nearly four times the amount of speaking submissions than we had available sessions, which allowed us to put together a highly compelling agenda with some of the brightest minds in authentication. Also, sponsorships are nearly sold out – with all expo space now reserved. Lastly, registration has trended well above projections, which would point to a potential sell-out for this inaugural event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our hope is that the threat of COVID-19 will have dissipated by this fall and that we’ll be able to bring forward all of the above enthusiasm to our new dates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We greatly appreciate the support and enthusiasm from the broader FIDO Community, and we’re looking forward to a successful event in November. Until then, we hope everyone stays safe and well. If any questions about Authenticate, contact <a href="mailto:authenticate@fidoalliance.org">authenticate@fidoalliance.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This month, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) released its final “<a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/digital-identity-guidance.html">Guidance on Digital Identity</a>” for financial services regulators. FATF is a standards-making body composed of financial regulators from around the world who are charged with ensuring that the financial system is not used for money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit activities. Historically, FATF has focused on traditional banking, but as more and more financial services go digital, they have started focusing on digital identity as a key enabler of safe financial systems.</p>



<p>FATF Recommendations are the recognized standards for&nbsp; global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT). That’s why it’s so important the final guidance recognizes FIDO Authentication in several places as an example of a best authentication practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first important aspect to note is that the guidance incorporated authentication as an element of the customer due diligence (CDD) process, particularly when banks open new accounts for people with pre-existing digital identity credentials. This is the first time FATF has explicitly included authentication as part of CDD, which also speaks to broader market awareness of the imperative for sound user authentication. Secondly, FIDO is not only recognized as an acceptable form of authentication – it’s called out as a preferred approach vs. legacy authentication methods. Per the guidance:</p>



<p>“Passwords or passcodes, which are supposed to be “shared secret” knowledge authenticators, are vulnerable to brute-force login attacks, phishing attacks, and massive online data breaches, and are very easily defeated. Stolen, weak or default passwords are behind 81 percent of data breaches.&nbsp; Multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions, such as SMS one-time codes texted to the subscriber’s phone, add another layer of security to passwords/passcodes but they can also be vulnerable to phishing and other attacks.</p>



<p>Phishing-resistant authenticators where at least one factor relies on public key encryption (e.g., authenticators built off PKI certificates or the FIDO standard) can help combat these vulnerabilities.”</p>



<p>This is significant recognition of not only the importance of authentication, but the weaknesses (i.e., phishability) of some legacy MFA technologies – and how these risks can be mitigated through the use of FIDO as high assurance authentication. It’s an important distinction that we hope banking regulators strongly evaluate&nbsp; when they are looking to craft new or updated rules on digital identity and authentication.&nbsp;</p>

 The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a large number of “Special Announcements” pertaining to changes in schedules and other aspects of everyday life. This includes not just closure of facilities and rescheduling of events but also new availability of medical facilities such as testing centers.<br><br>We have today published <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v7.0">Schema.org 7.0</a>, which includes fast-tracked new vocabulary to assist the global response to the Coronavirus outbreak.<br><br>It includes a "<a href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a>" type that provides for simple date-stamped textual updates, as well as markup to associate the announcement with a situation (such as the Coronavirus pandemic), and to indicate URLs for various kinds of update such a school closures, public transport closures, quarantine guidelines, travel bans, and information about getting tested.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Many new testing facilities are being rapidly established worldwide, to test for COVID-19. Schema.org now has a <a href="https://schema.org/CovidTestingFacility">CovidTestingFacility</a> type to represent these, regardless of whether they are part of long-established medical facilities or temporary adaptations to the emergency.<br><br>We are also making improvements to other areas of Schema.org to help with the worldwide migration to working online and working from home, for example by helping event organizers indicate when an event has <a href="http://schema.org/EventMovedOnline">moved</a> from having a physical location to being conducted online, and   whether the event's "<a href="https://schema.org/eventAttendanceMode">eventAttendanceMode</a>" is online, offlline or mixed.&nbsp;<br><br>We will continue to improve this vocabulary in the light of feedback (<a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490">github</a>; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#">doc</a>), and welcome suggestions for improvements and additions particularly from organizations who are publishing such updates.&nbsp; <br><br> <a href="mailto:danbri@google.com">Dan Brickley</a>, R.V.Guha, Google.<br> Tom Marsh, Microsoft.

SSI Meetup coordinating node Alex Preukschat presents in this webinar the 2020 SSI report for Iberoamerica with the main highlights and insights gained for this edition. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is booming, and we expect it to be one of the main unifying technologies of the blockchain and decentralized world. Unlike our first report for Iberoamerica, we have chosen, for this edition, to prepare a shorter executive document that reflects the main trends in the region. In this study, we focus on Ibero-American initiatives that are either done in the name of SSI or have elements strongly resembling SSI, rather than simple authentication experiments that are further away from the principles of SSI.

Ignacio Alamillo is a lawyer, PhD in eIDAS Regulation, CISA, CISM, and EU Commission legal expert for EBSI eSSIF and the EBSI eIDAS Bridge initiatives. Ignacio will introduce SSI solutions, using the Alastria ID reference model as an illustrative example, taking into account the need for trust management frameworks, and trust anchors. Secondly, he will introduce the eIDAS Regulation, currently the major electronic identification regulation in the European Union, supporting a pan-European identity federation system, and the legal framework for the so-called trust services.

The EU has developed some key proposals arising from the legal assessment of the EBSI ESSIF use case, oriented to extend the eIDAS Regulation to SSI solutions used with public sector bodies relationships and procedures. This results were publicly presented in the 2nd ESSIF Stakeholders Meeting that took place in Brussels mid-January 2020.

The objective of the ESSIF legal assessment is to evaluate the potential legal issues that are horizontal to an SSI solution, including:

DIDs: What is the legal nature and ownership of DIDs (asset vs a special kind of pseudonym), how should be DIDs managed in case of minors and incapable persons, if DID may be subject to seizure, when DIDs may be deactivated, what is the legal regime of keys and wallets, etc.
VCs: What are the duties and responsibilities of VCs issuers, holders and verifiers. How to model the contractual/non-contractual relations between issuers &amp; verifiers, and set up liability models. We should pay special attention to the legal aspects of the VC lifecycle (issuance, suspension and revocation causes, etc).
Alignment of the SSI solution with the eIDAS Regulation: aligning VCs with eIDAS eID rules, but also linking VCs to eSeals or eSignatures.
Trust framework: legal input regarding LoAs, governance aspects, conformity, etc.
The use cases include:

Using eIDAS identification means (and qualified certificates?) to issue verifiable credentials.
Using qualified certificates to support verifiable claims (EBSI eIDAS bridge) and legal evidences with full legal value.
Using SSI VCs as an eIDAS identification means.
Using blockchain plus SSI as an electronic registered delivery service.

 In November TNO, FundingBox, BLUMORPHO and GRNET started a new EU-Horizon 2020 research project ‘NGI eSSIF-Lab’. The project will offer open calls for start-ups, SMEs and other innovators to further develop, integrate and adopt self-sovereign identity technologies for Europe. The first open calls are expected to begin in March 2020. What makes eSSIF-Lab different from other initiatives is that it focuses on scalable SSI-solutions that are mutually interoperable and not limited to solving a problem in just a specific domain. 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			   
				
				
				 
					 Are you interested? 
					  
 
 
<p>Please fill in our contact form to receive updates when an open call is published</p>
 
 
  
				 
				 <a href="https://mailing.tno.nl/ct/m8/k1/Xv-J69P3mtttDn3l7yPn7k0WlXlS8nv_PiVnkaNLjhUdFMAhAkA-pKvRrNzEMXVN/FGcIZhSQfhWMhMZ">STAY UP TO DATE</a> 
			  
				
				
				  Self-sovereign identity 
<p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) promises to empower European citizens with new means to manage privacy, to eliminate logins, and to enjoy much faster and safer electronic transactions via the internet as well as in real life. SSI promises not only to empower European organisations to speed up, secure and automate transactions with customers, suppliers and partners, resulting in annual savings of tens of billions of euros on administrative costs in Europe but also to drive a new business ecosystem with thousands of new jobs, new job categories and new business opportunities for existing and new European companies.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				  eSSIF-Lab project 
<p>The eSSIF-Lab project will provide business and technical support to integrate SSI technology with market propositions, and will accelerate SSI-related businesses and social applications. The outreach though the open calls and the prominent position in the emerging SSI community will enable the eSSIF-Lab consortium to advance the broad uptake of SSI as a next generation, open and trusted digital identity solution.</p>
<p>The project will award 62 subgrants in two types of open call: one infrastructure-oriented open call targeting technical enhancements and extensions of the SSI framework and two business-oriented open calls targeting SSI business and social innovations and applications. The infrastructure-oriented open call (open to any type of innovator) and the first business-oriented open call (limited to start-ups and SMEs) are expected to open in March 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TNO’s lead SSI scientist Rieks Joosten is excited: “While so-called SSI ‘solutions’ are popping up all over the world, the vast majority has a local scope: they solve a problem in a specific domain, are not scalable and scarcely interoperate with each other. Addressing these issues is a top priority for the eSSIF-Lab project. We invite the SSI community in Europe to come forward and apply for the open calls.”</p>
<p>The project receives funding from the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, of which €5.6 m is available for subgrants. The eSSIF-Lab project will run for three years.</p> 
			   
				
				
				  Consortium 
<p>The eSSIF-Lab consortium is a lean consortium comprised of a combination of one RTO, one funding management organisation, one business accelerator and one organisation that offers advanced e-infrastructures and innovative services. The partners have distinct but complementary profiles, spanning the whole range of activities and areas covered within the project.</p>
<p>TNO (Netherlands) is the project coordinator and brings in its extensive SSI technical expertise and understanding of innovation processes to the startup/SME/innovator community targeted by the open calls. TNO has a unique position as an RTO, with a strong connections to both fundamental research, industry, SMEs and societal stakeholders. TNO has an extensive track record in H2020 project coordination.</p>
<p>FundingBox (Poland) manages the open calls. FundingBox is the European leader in managing Financial Support to Third Parties, having distributed up to €62 m by participating in 14 projects, including FSTP, since 2014. It has a community with over 18,000 subscribers where makers, entrepreneurs and innovators meet, interact and collaborate to build growth connections and win equity-free funding to catalyse their growth.</p>
<p>BLUMORPHO (France) is a business accelerator that has 20+ years of experience in building and developing successful ecosystems around innovations. It will provide business support to the start-ups that participate in the open call projects to accelerate their SSI-related business. BLUMORPHO has a large European and worldwide network, and brings in its expertise from training and developing ideas with high potential to fully-fledged business plans.</p>
<p>GRNET (Greece) is responsible for the ongoing deployment infrastructure in the project. GRNET is the national network, cloud computing and IT eInfrastructure and services provider. It supports hundreds of thousands of users in the key areas of Research, Education, Health and Culture.</p>

John Phillips from 460degrees in Australia has been exploring with his team for more than two years for a way to describe Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) that was easy to understand. We think he has found a good method to make SSI easy to understand for any C-suite executive and business people that goes beyond the technology.

John published a video in late 2019 that we found deeply insightful and we have invited him to share this with the SSI Meetup audience. This demo has been going down amazingly well with audiences from c-suite technology execs to design students.

This approach quite literally animates the discussion. People add other objects into the mix, move things around, ask relevant, insightful, questions.

John will share the learnings he is gaining from University research, as well as the results of work in supporting capstone projects for higher education students, and how this has led us to a storytelling model to explain SSI.

Sebastian Weidenbach and Christopher Hempel from esatus AG will explain in this presentation why Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has great advantages to facilitate enterprise identity and access management. It will also go into detail about how a connection between existing identity and access management solutions and distributed identity ledgers can be implemented.

SSI enables users to create proofs over facts about themselves using a distributed ledger. In an enterprise context, this also means that an employee can send a proof to, for instance, a compatible file server containing data exclusively meant for the human resources department. If this proof is valid and contains the fact that the prover is a member of the human resources department, access can be granted automatically. The need for individual approval by a superior, common reason for the tiresome and expensive delay, is removed.

Switching enterprises’ IAM systems to SSI technology cannot realistically be done in one fell swoop, though, as migrating thousands of accounts and their privileges to a new system is an intimidating task. There are ways to connect SSI technology to existing IAM solutions, though, which are starting to enter the market using gateway components to connect the old and new worlds of identity.

Decentralized identifiers (abbreviated as “DIDs”), are the cryptographic counterpart to verifiable credentials (VCs) that together are the “twin pillars” of SSI architecture. In this special IdentityBook.info webinar Markus Sabadello, Founder and CEO of Danube Tech, and Drummond Reed, Chief Trust Officer at Evernym, co-authors of the DID chapter of the “Self-Sovereign Identity: 
Decentralized Digital Identity and Verifiable Credentials” book published by Manning will explain all the fundamentals of DIDs. Based on the did chapter of the book, you will learn how DIDs evolved from the work started with VCs, how they are related to URLs and URNs, why a new type of cryptographically-verifiable identifier is needed for SSI, and how DIDs are being standardized at World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Your guides will be two of the editors of the W3C Decentralized Identifier 1.0 specification: Markus Sabadello and Drummond Reed.

When the eyes cruise through the various logos and offerings of the MNCs in these over populated pages, one gets reminded of a decade when the front, back, and inside pages of newspaper supplements overflowed with job offerings in the lowest ranks of the IT. BPO vacancies which littered the folios primarily sought to lure fresh college pass-outs ‘proficient in English’. Back then, one was yet getting familiar with names such as ‘Convergys’, ‘Daksh’, ‘Global-Vantage’, ‘EXL’, ‘Vertex’. It made one wonder why they needed so many people to ‘walk-in’ week after week, and how they made thousands of ‘on the spot offers’ with ‘revised salaries’ following ‘quick and easy interviews’ and ‘fastest selection processes’. What these selected people actually did, once they got in, was another mystery altogether.</p><p>Some of these MNCs promising nothing short of a ‘best start’ to one’s career, that too with the ‘best starting salaries for a fresher’, often came to college campuses for recruitment. They conducted large scale interviews and generously granted immediate offer-letters to final-year students, at the end of each academic year. I happily overlooked the (fine) print, the text, design, and all the other details of these BPO ads. In fact, I never bothered to figure out what the acronym meant till such time when I was in desperate need for a gadget make-over. My age old Range-Finder camera deserved to be disposed and displaced by a Digital SLR. That was the summer of&nbsp;2003…</p>The iconic ship building of Convergys — one of the first amongst the many that stood alone fifteen years ago, surrounded by far-­‐away sketches of multistoried constructions and a cyber-­‐hub that was yet to be born and the eight lane highway leading to Jaipur, about to be built beside&nbsp;it. Say Something More About Yourself (The Interview) Call flow and traffic flow is fast and furious both inside and outside such centers of info-­exchange and mega-­data transmissions every second every&nbsp;day.<p>“You have mentioned in this form that your aim is to ‘do something different’. How would you relate that to your decision to work in a call center?” I was&nbsp;asked.</p><p>I had given more than couple of interviews, to get rejected on both occasions, and by then had realized what exactly they preferred to hear and the kind of profile that they wanted to hire. I was in no mood to miss my lunch and waste another day in the scorching heat traveling to one of these hotels where the interviews were conducted. I was tired of waiting for hours sipping cold water and looking at formally dressed men and women being dumped from one room to another — going through a series of eliminating rounds before reaching the interview stage, when they politely conveyed “…thank you very much, you may leave for now, we’ll get back to you…”, especially, to all those lacking a ‘neutral English&nbsp;accent’.</p><p>On the first occasion, I took great pleasure and interest in observing every bit of it. On the second, I was getting a hang of it. On the third, I felt like a school kid appearing for an oral examination at the mercy of the schoolmaster and was perennially requested at every step to say something (more) about oneself. But, I had no grudges. Neither the posh ambience nor the polite attitude of the employers towards hundreds of candidates walking-in everyday was comparable with the interview-scene of Ray’s ‘Pratidwandi’ [1]. The scene was acting out in reverse. Now they needed us (in bulk) more than we needed them. Any English-speaking dude eager to believe in the promises of the new-age-profession, even with less or ordinary qualifications, or with no desires to seek further qualifications, was in great demand, like never&nbsp;before.</p><p>On the fourth occasion, I thought that I had my answers&nbsp;ready.</p><p>“Well, your CV suggests something else. Why don’t you contemplate choosing a creative profession?”</p><p>The extra curricular activities’ column on my CV was getting reduced in size with each passing interview that I chose to face. Later I felt that I could have said something else instead of answering, “Madam, I am from a middle-class family, where creativity is not given much space beyond a&nbsp;point.”</p><p>I was reminded that I should use her first name instead of uttering ‘Madam’ repeatedly. “But, most of the creative minds come from the middle-class background”, she&nbsp;refuted.</p><p>“May be I don’t have much of confidence in my creative abilities.”</p><p>The conversation continued for quite long. I did not fall short of sentences to cover up this process of conscious deception. She was busy evaluating my English and was possibly overlooking the content of my answers while making points on a piece of paper as she kept asking questions regarding hobbies, movies, etc. I was asked to listen to men talking in American accent and was instructed to choose between options that summarized the probable conclusion of their conversation. Then I was asked me to wait&nbsp;outside.</p><p>The interview with the Senior Process Manager from Pune was supposedly the last round, I was told. A charming voice from across the table made me feel as if he had been waiting to hear from me since the time we met long ago, “So, how is&nbsp;life?”</p><p>“Great Sir”.</p><p>“Great? You don’t get to hear that too often. Okay, please say something about your&nbsp;self.”</p><p>There seemed to be no end to this essential inquiry about ‘the self’ at any stage! I started with my name and ended with my ambition, which was to make a career in a call&nbsp;center.</p><p>He must have found it useless to discuss the work profile with me. Truly, I had no idea about what I was supposed to do on the deck. But, I did not miss any chance to convey how keen I was to learn and deliver. This was followed by a discussion on salary, which was short, because as a fresher, I was in no position to&nbsp;bargain.</p><p>While passing the offer letter, the HR lady formally made a point to emphasize the formal dress code in the office. Looking back, I presume it was my appearance that prompted her to state the code. With the hair almost touching the shoulders, and a face not shaven for more than a month, the loose fit denims incapable of keeping the shirt tucked, I must have made a sufficient impression to instigate concern in her mind, although unknowingly. Jaswindar (the man who thought smoking bidi in the lawns of the corporate cathedral is quite cool) replied, “I don’t have any formal wear. Does the company pay any advance for buying&nbsp;some?”</p>Cyber Hub @ midnight — the nerve centre of several corporates. What If They Find Out (The First&nbsp;Day) Even sky is not the limit. The exchange of information and its pace defies border — political or physical.<p>A cold current ran through the spine of several candidates, especially the first timers, with every signature they put on the bottom left of each page of the agreement of the terms and conditions that required them to be graduates. Obviously, quite a few of them were not graduates. What if they found out that they were not? But they did not. I guess, they never cared to verify the certificates enclosed in the pink file. Nor did they care to figure out what happened to those tax-forms, provident fund forms, insurance forms signed and submitted by the 124 employees joining job on the 9th of June. Lengthy spells of instructions related to form-filling on the first day were forgotten, as most of them were happily distracted or disinterested. The crowd was busy checking out each other — the vending machine and its options, the fancy phone and its features — also enquiring or narrating previous call center experiences, the hassle in missing or getting the first pick-up for the&nbsp;day…</p><p>While these strangers were desperate to know or let the others know ‘something more about themselves’, the junior officials instructing us ‘where to tick’, ‘what to remember’, ‘how to write’, ‘when to stop’ were not in a position to exhibit how irritated they were with the tough task of managing so many recruits. Things got even worse with the daylong induction lectures on training, transport, finance, assets, ‘our motifs’ and ‘your expectations’, ‘your contribution’ and ‘our expectations’. Thankfully, there was good lunch, free internet access (quite unthinkable in those days of expensive cyber cafes) and AC cabs to follow. I fancied my relief from the heat and hostel food for the next few weeks of my paid holiday without any sense of&nbsp;remorse.</p>The Convergys building (now taken over by Vedanta) on a full moon night. The plush lawns used to be a breeding ground for generating dust haze. The compound is highly protected/exclusive zone. Epitome of global connectivity ensures complete disconnection with the local surroundings. My Camera vs Their Camera (Getting&nbsp;Trained) The ever-expanding city with all its imposed notions of urbanity on an area essentially rural leaves no scope for the evolution of the public space. On the contrary, any space outside the strict confines of these gated nations/notions invite threats of the highest order or at least it is perceived to be&nbsp;so.<p>What if they find out? No, they&nbsp;didn’t.</p><p>For the next one and a half months, we loitered around in the mornings, nights, evenings, and graveyard shifts of the classrooms and cafés (though not in every corner as mobility was highly restricted and under severe surveillance), at times enjoying and at times sleeping through the training sessions, impatiently waiting for the salary to get transferred to the Citi Bank account which they had opened for us to be swiped-out the moment the money arrived. Their surveillant eyes were not technologically advanced enough to guess the respective reasons to take up the job casually and remain appointed before absconding. A host of young fellas kept counting the number of day remaining:</p>  While the trainer with 3 kids in 7 years (now needing one more) with a ‘do it or I’ll make you do it’ attitude reminded us that prostitution is oldest customer care service, and the role of a customer care executive is one of the most prestigious ones and definitely not deplorable just because we work at night (as do the docs and&nbsp;cops).  While listening to the trainees whose primary interests varied from stock exchange to cooking for the wife to horse breeding and extending till the ‘search for truth in Himalayas’. In a free speech session in VNA (Voice and Accent Training), fitness was synonymous with Baba Ramdev for some folks and euthanasia meant mass-killing. And what about capital-punishment? “Would have known if I attended the college debates”, someone proudly said. The trainer was kind to say “Then talk about censorship”. The girl with colored hair was quick to question, “Is that an automated cruise?”  While cruising through the consonants, diphthongs, vowel sounds, and imported ‘modules’, rapid ‘mock-calls’ and learning to intonate. We bit the ‘B’s, kissed the ‘W’s and by the time we rolled the ‘R’s, reached the soft ‘T’s and faded ‘P’s, I felt that the next big revolution was here. Tongue, lip, throat, teeth tried their level best to ape the ones across the Atlantic to the norms of their phonetic&nbsp;culture.  While obviously not uttering the obvious that this entire system was a consequence of service being subcontracted to places where establishment and labour costs were way more&nbsp;cheaper.  Walls can guard the flow of trespassers but the walls can rarely be guarded against the practice of public urination. An employee relieves himself in the middle of a graveyard shift on his way back after a quick smoke during the miserly half an hour&nbsp;break. Keeping Balance (The Absconding Case &amp; The Attrition List) The building came first as isolated blocks of self-sufficient units generating its own electricity and meeting its own needs. The infrastructure external and essential to its sustenance is still in its nascent&nbsp;stage.<p>In between the lines of the Punjabi beats in the moving cab or Pearl Jam playing on the i-pod in full volume to resist the former; before and after ‘hi bro’, ‘hey dude’, ‘yo man’, ‘yap buddy’; from weekend masti to an inspirational night-out, we constantly juggled with call-center jargon and silently yapped&nbsp;about:</p>  How to revolt against ‘IST’ (Indian Stretchable Time)  Why the ‘pick-up time’ hadn’t been SMSed&nbsp;yet  Why the fucking cab driver did not come fucking five fucking minutes&nbsp;earlier  How often to ‘login’ early and ‘logout’&nbsp;late  Why the ‘systems were running&nbsp;slow’  What should be the perfect ‘call-opening’ and ‘call&nbsp;ending’  How to handle ‘high call&nbsp;flow’  How to ‘sale’ a product to the ‘disinterested customer’  How to ‘appease’ the dissatisfied ‘enquiring consumers’  How to ‘empathize’ with an ‘irate customer’  How to keep the ‘call control’ while making the customer feel empowered  How to avoid ‘escalating’ the&nbsp;call  How to make full use of the two ‘fifteen minutes breaks’ and one ‘half hour&nbsp;break’  Why not to say — “I am sorry to hear that” — to a recently divorced&nbsp;customer  Whom to give the extra food&nbsp;coupons  What to do to in order to know when your calls are being monitored  How to reduce the ‘AHT’ (Average Handling&nbsp;Time)  How to increase the ‘C.Sac’ (Customer Satisfaction) scores  Why not to take two ‘consecutive weekend-offs’  What to write in the ‘feed-back forms’  Which friend should be referred to get compensated for the ‘referral’ before leaving the&nbsp;job  What else could be done to maximize ‘P4P’ (Pay for Performance)  <p>Soon after swiping the card and clearing the balance, many of us became what they called, ‘an absconding case’ and added our names to the ‘attrition list’. The ‘cost-effective-labour’ (not ‘cheap labor’), stopped coming to office just before ‘hitting the (production) floor’ without bothering to formally say a bye, and without multiplying the hundreds of dollars that their clients had invested in our training and maintenance. Some of us had to get back to our colleges, which had re-opened. The others either complained about the team-leader or the work pressure till the time they got a call from some other call-center across the road offering a slight increment, but the same work. Others changed jobs as they habitually did twice or thrice a year to acquire a new ambience and acquaintances only to get bored yet again. One chap was smart enough to hold two offices simultaneously. The rest either perished without a trace or sat on the same chair hoping to climb the ‘vertical ladder’ by pleasing the bosses and putting more working hours while executing the ‘communicative tools’ and ‘navigation skills’ that they remembered from the training days. They were the ones the industry hoped to retain. They were also the ones too particular about their performance. Habitual consumption and consistent conflicts between the personal mornings/mourning and the professional nights took a consistent toll.</p>The city sleeps. Metros come to halt. Signs of human existence disappear. But thousands of people continue with the calls in each floor of these buildings answering queries and collecting unpaid amounts catering to a different time zone altogether.Different floors and different corners of the same floor cater to different clients across the&nbsp;globe. After-Call Wrap-Up (Remains of the Flirtatious Feedback) <p>I-cards hung like nameplates around the neck all the time along with codes that were generated from the distant land. Punching these plastic cards ensured automated entry, strictly confined to those floors where we had some business. Forgetting to carry them required prolonged human intervention to convince the security that we did deserve to get in. Losing it lead to penalty. Hiding/absconding beneath one of the many call center note-pads I found the Separation Clause 4b: “upon separation from the company, you will be required to immediately return to the company, all assets and property including documents, files, book, papers and memos in your possession.”</p><p>The termination clause 6.b.i. of one of the appointment letters stated — “During the probation period you are liable to be discharged from the company’s service at any time without any notice and without assigning any reason”. But I guess the employees left the company more often without any notice or assigning any reasons. The company, most often, had no answers for this unwanted discharge to its owners across the oceans. IT abroad/onboard was not advanced enough to predict/prevent people who made the industry look like a make-shift arrangement; a probation that would rarely lead to permanence.</p>A common sight of fleet of cabs (a service which is outsourced to external vendors) outside the building waiting for scheduled drops and pick-ups. Is There Anything Else That I Can Do to Help&nbsp;You/Me As the piling debris suggest infrastructural work perennially in progress.<p>Between the cafeteria cleaned once every hour and the adjacent murky road side dhaba; between the latest cars in the parking lot and the rickshaws waiting for those who couldn’t yet afford to pay the car-installment; between the fiber-glass windows and the jhopris (visible once the curtains were lifted) — new heights were achieved and new targets were set that were globally connected, locally disconnected.</p><p>In a site, which is otherwise devoid of consistent water supply, electricity and public transport (running it servers on generators 24X7), the vertical-limits of the translucent fiber glass and false roofs prepare the suburbs. The soothing cubicles confirm to the global standards of ‘how a city ought to look’ from a distance.</p><p>Just like the enormous demands of the IT industry, which has created its support sectors (catering, security, transport, house-keeping etc) to stray around the BPOs trying to extract their share of profit, I moved around its orbit as well for some time. Why and how there is a bit of BPO in most my creative endeavors and in the purchase of digital devices between 2003–2008 doesn’t require any further explanation.</p><p>I got better and better with my mock-calls.</p>Surrounded by the debris of development and standing tall with its emphatic presence, such an imposing architecture seems like a myth that constantly challenges the harsh realities that envelop it. The pillared peak is so representative of its desire to remain connected with the ‘distant-­impossible’ 24x7. Endnote <p>[1] The protagonist in the film violently revolted against the lack of basic amenities in the interview-space and against the idea of calling so many people for just a couple of vacancies, when people were expected to be selected not on the basis of merit,&nbsp;anyway.</p> Author <p>Sreedeep is a sociologist and a fellow with the Centre for Public Affairs and Critical Theory (C-PACT)Shiv Nadar University, Noida.</p><p>This post was originally <a href="https://cis-india.org/raw/blog_mock-calling">published</a> on the CIS website as part of the ‘Studying Internets in India’ series.

<br> https://ssimeetup.org/self-sovereign-identity-explained-cios-steve-manning-webinar-44/
Identity on the internet has been missing since the beginning. For all the amazing ways in which the internet has come to enhance our daily business, social, and personal lives, it was originally designed to simply connect digital endpoints. Networking protocols were built so that computers could identify one another, prove themselves, and safely establish a flow of bits between them. What those bits represent was never a primary concern of the architecture. Despite this limitation, for nearly 3 decades we have been creatively injecting the human narrative into the digital conversation between computers; all the while struggling with the lack of certainty about who the human is who is initiating the process.

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) have emerged as a way to address the question: “Who is really behind the other end of my digital interaction?” Together, the pair of technologies are able to do this at scale while enhancing personal privacy, increasing trust between parties, and promoting practical models of anonymity in a world where all too often our identity becomes a commercial commodity.

This presentation is for people who are thinking about how identity and trust relate to their employees, customers, partners, and competitors, and the bespoke way in which we are forced to deal with the issue. Those looking for a better understanding of the benefits afforded by SSI and VCs as well as the technical and governance underpinnings required to support solutions should attend.

Steve Magennis is a former Senior Director with Avanade and has worked closely with Accenture and Microsoft over the years to develop transformational initiatives for many Fortune 100 enterprise clients. Decentralized design is a key focus of his as it enables creating entirely new classes of solutions that can be applied to persistent, entrenched business and social problems.

<p>A new paper from the World Economic Forum (WEF) showcases FIDO Authentication as a ready-to-be-implemented option to save organizations the high costs and user experience frustrations of passwords. The paper was released this week during the WEF annual meeting in Davos.<br></p>



<p>The paper, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/whitepapers/passwordless-authentication-the-next-breakthrough-in-secure-digital-transformation">Passwordless Authentication: The next breakthrough in secure digital transformation</a>, was developed in collaboration with the FIDO Alliance and includes contributions from many of our members including Aetna/CVS Health, Google, HYPR, Intuit, Microsoft, Nok Nok, Onfido, Trusona, the UK government and Yubico.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>According to the report, ending our reliance on passwords can make us safer and businesses more efficient. Cybercrime is set to cost the global economy $2.9 million every minute in 2020 and some 80% of these attacks are password-related. Knowledge-based authentication like passwords is not only a major headache for users, it is costly to maintain. For larger businesses, it is estimated that nearly 50% of IT help desk costs are allocated to password resets, with average annual spend for companies now at over $1 million for staffing alone.<br></p>



<p>The lead of the project, Adrien Ogee, Platform for Shaping the Future of Cybersecurity and Digital Trust, World Economic Forum, points out in a press release accompanying the paper that “better authentication practices are not just possible they are a necessity.” The possibility of moving beyond passwords is more real than ever as the growing availability of next generation, FIDO-based technologies like biometrics and security keys can meet consumer demands for both user convenience and security. There are several mini case studies from our members in the report that highlight their use today, and the benefits they are seeing. A few examples:</p>



  A mid-sized U.S. retail bank saved more than $2.9 million annually and saved customers up to 30% in time to finish a payment (Source: Nok Nok)  A U.S. financial software company brought its authentication success rate to 99.9% and reduced sign in time by 78% (Source: Intuit)  Google’s internal use of FIDO security keys dropped total time spent authenticating by nearly two-thirds, and they experienced zero authentication failures  



<p>It’s validating to see WEF not only educate world leaders on the economic impact of our legacy authentication practices, but to recognize that there are viable alternatives that are ready to implement today. With cryptographically secure and convenient FIDO Authentication now supported in all major web browsers as well as Android and Windows platforms, there is no reason to delay — now is the time to move past passwords and embrace simpler, stronger authentication.<br></p>

<p>Dr. Rae Hayward, Certification Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>From consumer brands to vendors to enterprises, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-2019-progress-report/">FIDO has been embraced across the globe</a> in 2019, and this is more evident than ever with the growth in our certification programs. Today organizations are requiring certification before deploying FIDO Authentication. The increase in certified FIDO products illustrates its value to the industry.</p>



<p>With that, we’re excited to announce our newest certifications today, which puts us over 688 certified products. Certifications across all specifications were strong this quarter, as tech providers look to provide solutions for those with cross-platform and mobile-first strategies.</p>



<p>It’s notable that we now have 107 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/authenticator-certification-levels/">authenticator certifications</a> at L1 and L2 levels – big growth since this program was launched last year. This program addresses an increasingly critical market requirement for a more transparent view into the security of FIDO Certified authenticators. Certification gives enterprises and online services the ability to make better informed risk management decisions when registering credentials from FIDO-enabled devices. Today, we offer certifications at Levels 1, 2, 3 and 3+ and plan to introduce more levels in the future.</p>



<p>These
companies have achieved FIDO certification since our last update:</p>



  FIDO2: Acceptto Corporation; Authentrend; CANTON Consulting; Capy Japan Inc.; CROSSCERT: KECA(Korea Electronic Certification Authority); ellipticSecure; Excelsecu Data Technology Co., Ltd.; GoTrustID Inc.; Hanko GmbH; HID Global; Hypersecu Information Systems, Inc.; Kensington Computer Products Group; knowledgesuite,inc.; Login ID Inc.; Paywax; RSA; SEOWOOSNC Co.,Ltd.; SoloKeys; SurePassID; Target; TOKEN2; TWCA; Uni-ID Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd.; Veridium ID Ltd; XionITS; WebComm Technology Co.,Ltd.; Yubico<br><br>  FIDO U2F: Kensington Computer Products Group; Synaptics Incorporated; Yubico<br><br>  FIDO UAF: Giesecke+Devrient Mobile Security GmbH; LG Electronics; Novatek Microelectronics Co.; PNC; SurePassID; WebComm Technology Co.,Ltd.<br><br>

Alexander Shcherbakov is a software engineer at DSR working on the team at Evernym. He has a Ph.D. in Mathematics and is one of the maintainers of Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Plenum. In this presentation, he will explain the value of a decentralized ledger in an SSI ecosystem and examine Hyperledger Indy, which is the distributed ledger that has been powering the Sovrin Network for more than two years.

Our identities have to be trusted to be useful. When we meet strangers, we decide how much we trust them by what they tell us, and whether a trusted third party will vouch for them. In traditional identity systems, the trusted third party knows everything about everyone in the ecosystem. In Self-Sovereign Identity systems, we rely on a decentralized ledger to privately validate that the identity claims do in fact come from a trusted issuer.

Indy’s blockchain implementation is Plenum, which is a general purpose, public-permissioned, BFT distributed ledger. The presentation takes a technical look at the architecture, cryptography, transactions, data structures, and storage of the ledger including auditability, request processing, catch-up procedure, and support for custom plugins and custom transactions.

By Henry Lee and Sanghun Won, Co-Chairs, FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group</p>



 



<p>For our Hackathon program, more teams than we expected completed proof of concepts. We had more than 40 applications, and 12 teams made it through the initial screening process and were given the opportunity to participate in a three-month mentorship program. One team had to drop out in the midst of the mentorship program, due to the team leader receiving a promising career opportunity. This blog serves as a way to celebrate these finalists’ efforts, while introducing their ideas to unlock the potential of FIDO protocols to the world.</p>



 



<p>EASY</p>



<p>EASY is a team made up of three university students and they were mentored by CrossCert. They developed an IoT Storage Service based on FIDO protocols, so that families in low-income brackets would not have to visit certain places with their ID cards to pick up care packages from government agencies. For more technical information on the proposed solution, please <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/FIDOAlliance/2019-fido-seoul-seminar-moving-beyond-passwords">visit page 78 of FIDO Alliance SlideShare</a>. </p>

<p>Social Mix</p>



<p>Social Mix is a venture company with a business model providing simpler and more secure payment services for influencers on social networks. They wanted to find a solution for troubles that merchandise transactions on social networking services are facing. By participating in the Mentorship program by BC Card, the team implemented FIDO protocol based log-ins which not only enabled confirming buyer and seller’s identities but also sped up the transaction with a single click of a button in less than five seconds.

<p>Umbridge</p>



<p>The team Umbridge had an idea to utilize unused umbrellas at home in the perspective of a sharing economy. In a populated city like Seoul, people often buy umbrellas due to unexpected rain, and many of them keep piling up at home. The three university students, mentored by SK Telecom, wanted to increase usability of such umbrellas by introducing IoT Umbrella lockers which can be used by any citizens once they are authenticated through FIDO protocols.

<p>KISMI</p>



<p>KISMI is a startup company developing a decentralized identity-based ERP system. The team was mentored by eWBM, due to the fact that FIDO security keys were an essential part of their project. They acquired the FIDO technology from ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute), another proud member of FIDO Alliance, which expedited their development process by integrating other blocks of required technologies.

<p>GwangHae</p>



<p>GwangHae developed a Linux SSH (Secure Shell) login system with FIDO2 protocols. The team realized public IP addresses in Linux can be an easy target for attackers due to the fact about 82% of data breaches are due to poor passwords. The team, made up of only one university student, customized PAM, implemented FIDO2 authentication service for easier yet more secure logins while eliminating needs for end-user password management. GwangHae was mentored by Yubico and AirCuve, which are considering publishing the results as open source to the public.

  [FIDO Hackathon Award Ceremony during FIDO Seoul Seminar in September 2019] 



<p> By Henry Lee and Sanghun Won, Co-Chairs, FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group</p>



 



<p>Interviewees</p>



<p>Mentors: Dongho Kim, Samsung SDS, Kieun Shin, LINE and Sangwook Han, CrossCert<br>Mentees: Yeojin Lee representing Team Jekyll &amp; Hyde (mentored by Samsung), Yushin Cho representing Team N-Key (mentored by LINE), and Nohyun Kawk representing TEEware (mentored by CrossCert). </p>



 



<p>Question: As FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group Technical Sub-Group Co-Leaders (Dongho and Kieun), what was the background or purpose of running a FIDO Hackathon – Developer Support Program this year?</p>



<p>Dongho: Since FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group announced 2019 would be the year of FIDO deployment, the members sought various ways to make it happen. The idea of running a Hackathon seemed to be a perfect fit since we realized a one-day workshop or seminar had its limits to fully demonstrate the strength of FIDO protocols. Based on my earlier experiences of volunteering at school coding classes and joining local Hackathon events, it was understood that submerging ourselves with these young minds was the best way to reach out to local developer community.</p>



<p>Kieun: We have been trying our best to introduce FIDO-based services to the market. Being able to learn creative ideas and approaches to deploy FIDO was the key purpose of launching such an event.&nbsp; Identifying a potential partners and high-skilled engineers were unexpected bonuses.</p>



  [Jekyll &amp; Hyde Team Members] 



<p>Question: What motivated your team to participate in the FIDO Hackathon?</p>



<p>Nohyun: TEEware is a startup founded by members of KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) Graduate School of Information Security, and we thought the FIDO Hackathon was an ideal platform to verify our idea to combine FIDO protocols with decentralized ID for electronic contract projects.</p>



<p>Yushin: All of our team members are at their 2nd or 3rd year of university with experience of participating over dozens of local Hackathon events hosted by government agencies and private companies. We all thought the FIDO Hackathon was unique and much more meaningful, compared to other local half-day or one-day Hackathon event. It gave us an opportunity to engage deeply with Mentors with lots of hands-on experiences in the industry, which eventually helped us realize the FIDO-enabled Kiosk proof of concept in a timely manner.</p>



<p>Yeojin: As a school graduation project, our team members had an idea to make authentication much stronger and simpler by combining FIDO protocol with QR codes, but did not know how to move forward, due to the fact that we never had such scale of project experiences as college students. By working with Mentors and communicating with other teams participating in the FIDO Hackathon, we could quickly fill the technical gaps.</p>



  [N-Key Team Members] 



<p>Question: As a Mentor or Mentee, what was the most challenging aspect of the program?</p>



<p>Dongho: In the beginning, we thought inviting talented teams to participate in the program was the most challenging, due to the fact that we weren’t able to be competitive with other Hackathon programs in terms of prize money or gifts. We stayed&nbsp; focused on what was achievable and provided a simple, clear message to the public about what we wanted to accomplish. In the end, magic happened. Not only did more than 40 teams participate in the initial screening process, but we had 12 of them completing the proof of concepts through the mentorship program.</p>



<p>Yeojin: Right from the beginning of the mentorship program, the team members realized that the way we do projects at school were very different from how things were done in the field. We also had to quickly build a bridge between what we know as concept or academic theory and what or how things are actually done in business. That was the most challenging, yet most rewarding at the same time, because learning something like that as a student is priceless.</p>



<p>Yushin: Our team members came from 3 different universities and we have never worked as a team before. What we thought as a simple issue in the beginning were later found to be the toughest hurdle.&nbsp; Thanks to our mentor’s close and frequently scheduled guidance, we were able to stay as a team and never give up. We learned the importance of human factors and soft skills while conducting such a project.</p>



<p>Sangwook: Unlike other teams that are consisted of university students, TEEware was a young startup with extremely demanding business schedules. By closely communicating with the team, we were able to narrow down the project scope, which fits the purpose of the Hackathon program, and successfully complete the project in a timely manner.</p>



  [TEEware Team Members] 



<p>Question: What are the tangible or intangible assets you earned from the FIDO Hackathon program?</p>



<p>Sangwook: As an engineer, I was only able to see a small aspect of FIDO protocols, log-in and log-out, so far. However, the FIDO Hackathon opened up our eyes by understanding how FIDO can be presented as a solution to various technical or social problems. CrossCert has signed a business partnership with TEEware and you will see future products spinning out from this result very soon.</p>



<p>Nohyun: By participating the FIDO Hackathon, we were able to study the feasibility of our product and closely listen to potential clients’ needs. These lessons will be reflected upon our future business and product development plans.</p>



<p>Kieun: Surprisingly, I learned a lot by teaching and communicating with these young university students.&nbsp; Acquiring new ideas, being able to set our future products or services roadmaps, and understanding how to work with external partners with fresh minds were incredible assets that I earned.</p>



<p>Yushin: Besides the fact that we have earned the Top 3 Awards with prizes and trophies, it was so satisfying to see our rough idea to successfully go through proof of concept process. It is something that I could never accomplish in any other short-term Hackathon events.</p>



<p>Dongho: I was so happy to see the general public and local developers got to understand more about FIDO protocols, fixing misunderstanding around FIDO. Internally, the FIDO Hackathon helped FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group members to collaborate with each other for the very first time, by shooting for a single target and supporting the local developer community.</p>

Daniel Hardman, Chief Architect, Evernym / Secretary, Technical Governance Board – Sovrin Foundation will show how Peer DIDs will allow off-chain transactions for the self-sovereign identity (SSI) world.

Most documentation about decentralized identifiers (DIDs) describes them as identifiers that are rooted in a public source of truth like a blockchain, a database, a distributed filesystem, or similar. This publicness lets arbitrary parties resolve the DIDs to an endpoint and keys. It is an important feature for many use cases. However, the vast majority of relationships between people, organizations, and things have simpler requirements. When Alice(Corp|Device) and Bob want to interact, there are exactly and only 2 parties in the world who should care: Alice and Bob. Instead of arbitrary parties needing to resolve their DIDs, only Alice and Bob do. Peer DIDs are perfect in these cases. In many ways, peer DIDs are to public, blockchain-based DIDs what Ethereum Plasma or state channels are to on-chain smart contracts— or what Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is to on-chain cryptopayments. They move interactions off-chain, but offer options to connect back to a chain-based ecosystem as needed. Peer DIDs create the conditions for people, organizations, and things to have full control of their end of the digital relationships they sustain.

   Addressing the fundamental problem of accessing a proof of identity is critical in combatting the abuse of vulnerable children around the world.

<p>These conditions are endemic to orphanages across the globe, and are primarily made possible by the fact that these children typically lack a basic human right: documented proof of their existence, whether through a birth certificate or other identification. Without the necessary documents to prove their identity, these children are trapped forever, unable to reunite with their families. Addressing this fundamental problem in accessing a proof of identity is critical in combatting the abuse of vulnerable children around the world.</p>
<p>How does WIN Foundation and its partners help children in need? Watch this video to see how you can get involved:<br>
</p>
<p>An estimated eight million children today reside in orphanages – yet more than 80% of these children have at least one living parent. Separated and unable to reconnect with their families, these kids are doomed to a brutal life, constantly uprooted and taken advantage of. In addition to the plague of trafficking, sexual abuse, and slavery these orphans face, they are also 500 times more likely to take their own lives. Several governments have passed deinstitutionalization laws against orphanages, but they continue to flourish as children are increasingly displaced by crises like the civil war in Syria, or the Indian government’s removal of ethnic minorities from its national ID registry. The resulting rise of statelessness means there is no longer a sense of belonging for children who are displaced, and “children in cages” at the border become children victimized in orphanages.</p>
<p>Working with local authorities, organizations like Hope and Homes for Children have managed to close many abusive orphanages worldwide. But millions of children are still waiting to be reunited with a loving family. Many of them risk being taken out of the country by human traffickers, often ending up in modern slavery or the human organ trade. <a href="https://www.hopeandhomes.org/patron/mariana-dahan/">The WIN Foundation is proud to partner with Hope and Homes for Children</a>, becoming part of a successful drive to save orphans in Moldova from an inhumane fate.</p>
Hope and Homes for Children helps families around the world find their place and lifts them to success
<p>WIN Foundation works with a local satellite of Hope and Homes for Children, CCF Moldova, to get children out of the orphanage system. We help provide them with personal ID papers, trace their family lineage, and reunite them with family members. We purchase comfortable homes for the families and cover costs for their most basic needs. Furthermore, with our support, the government of Moldova passed a law requiring every minor to possess a proof of personal ID, if they intend to leave the country. Using blockchain on top of existing systems will flag and record every unlawful attempt to exit, helping to ensure that no child is taken out of the country using fake ID documents produced by human traffickers.</p>
<p>We are proud of our work with Hope and Homes for Children, and believe this systematic approach allows individuals to take control of their own fate. Recently, acclaimed author <a href="https://observer.com/2019/10/jk-rowling-blockchain-magic-orphanages/">J.K. Rowling spoke at the One Young World Summit</a> about the dangers of “orphanage tourism,” insisting that our collective focus should instead be on the circumstances that drive these children to such terrible institutions. In Rowling’s fantastical writings, magic empowers individuals and works to bring justice and happiness to the downtrodden. We believe our work with Hope and Homes for Childen resembles magic in this regard; everyone deserves access to proof of their identity, and blockchain technology offers limitless possibilities to do it correctly – finally holding access to their own identity, vulnerable children in orphanages can realize their full potential for success. We should harness the capabilities of blockchain to elevate humanity à la Wingardium Leviosa.</p>
