<p>Steering Committee Elections - call for nominations<br>
The annual election of DIF Steering Committee members is approaching, with the deadline for nominations September 4.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee is an elected group of member representatives who lead DIF, set strategy, assure the quality of ratified work items and respond to the community’s needs. Elections occur each year to ensure a democratic process to lead and administer DIF, and to continually provide a diverse and inclusive mix of commitee members.</p>
<p>If you know someone who would be a good candidate, please submit their name to <a href="mailto:nominations@identity.foundation">nominations@identity.foundation</a> by Sept 4. Self-nominations are also fine!</p>
<p>The full election timetable is available on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/election2023/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF website </a>.</p>
<p>Korea SIG<br>
The Korea SIG met for the first time on 19th July in the city of Busan, designated a Blockchain Special Zone by the Korean Government.</p>
<p>The Kickoff event was held in conjunction with the Self-Sovereign Identity Technology Project, initiated in the first half of 2023 by the Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology (ICT).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Standardization committee members, professors, and industry officials gathered at the event. DIF was introduced, together with the specifications-compliant stacks being discussed at DIF, and the wider ecosystem DIF operates within.</p>
<p>The topic of a Legal Identity Issuance and Verification Framework for Decentralized Identifiers was introduced in preparation for further discussions at upcoming meetings, with a presentation on the topic from Professor Kim Hyun-il of Kongju University, generating considerable interest and questions.</p>
<p>In Korea, Decentralized Identity demonstration projects are ongoing every year, creating various application cases, but it is true that progress on technology standardization has been slow. Accordingly, DIF Korea SIG agreed to explore and further understand DIF's technology specifications and stacks through periodic meetings, contribute to the standardization of Decentralized Identity technology, and discover exemplary application cases to which DIF specifications will be applied already this year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The next meeting of the Korea SIG will take place on 14 September at Yongsan Army Hall, hosted by the Korea Institute of Information Security &amp; Cryptology, when DIF will be introduced at the Next Generation Authentication Research Group Workshop 2023</p>
<p>New DIF developer advocates<br>
DIF welcomes Mostafa Nagy and Pratap Mridha as Volunteer Developer Advocates. Mostafa helped to recruit a number of participants for the recent successful did:hack event and both advocates will help recruit participants for a series of upcoming hackathons.</p>

<p>Building on the momentum from a <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/r/c62019da?m=ea695cce-93ce-43b5-bf96-694d570e5ba3">presentation</a> by Dan Giurescu, Founder of Credivera, the group was pleased to have Charles Macpherson, Senior Product Manager from the British Columbia Digital Identity and Trust Program, share his experiences from BC's <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/play/7kgw4uZJ7tnbqQYhD_R495gTzsz6weNNtHhTxm1hwVeRqb5lb-XzR-TcMmyAu36lVwiR6iO8HxCVYEHc.k6hX0Z1ZgZKbr03z?canPlayFromShare=true&amp;from=share_recording_detail&amp;continueMode=true&amp;componentName=rec-play&amp;originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fus02web.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FdnbBmdt-qXcdkoCgLAc3EyH21lGji_wJ7HBPacSV2OdDrIDE2nbGkqPjovtacsx5.WOBraFFYIwDRoCpi&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">verifiable credentials pilots</a>.</p>

 <a href="https://identity.foundation/Hospitality-and-Travel-SIG/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Hospitality and Travel SIG</a> 
<p>The Hospitality &amp; Travel SIG is hard at work on a decentralized traveller profile and schema which we hope will attract broad interest and participation from the Hospitality &amp; Travel community.</p>
<p>Traveller information is today locked into narrow silos controlled by competing interests all of whom claim to own the customer. No effective data sharing arrangements exist between those parties, preventing traveller information from flowing with the traveller in transit.</p>
<p>While much of the interaction between travel and identity communities has to date been denominated by discussions around border crossing, credentials and trust, SSI offers equal opportunity for traveller experience improvement within the airport and downstream into transport, accommodation, and tourism. Collectively, we describe the targeted outcome as a seamless traveller journey.</p>
<p>Central to unlocking this opportunity is adoption of a common traveller profile and preferences.</p>
<p>The H&amp;T SIG is hoping to use the DIF collaborative process to allow the widest participation in the schema definition and creation.</p>
<p>*The Hospitality &amp; Travel SIG meets each Thursday 10 AM Eastern time for 1 hour</p>
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/SIG-IoT/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">📻 IoT SIG</a> 
<p>Daniel Fritz, Executive Director of the Pharmaledger Association, shared his insights into how the pharmaceutical industry is collaborating to create a digital trust ecosystem and how this is benefiting members, starting with a shared product enabling members to switch from paper to electronic Product Information leaflets.</p>
<p>Riho Vedler, an EU and UN expert on Logistics and Digital Transformation, also presented to the SIG on the role of decentralized identity in enabling compliance with the upcoming electronic Freight Transport Information (eFTI) regulation in the EU.</p>
<p>The SIG is currently considering potential work items and welcomes input from current partipants and the wider community.</p>

<p>Digital Identity unConference (DICE) Europe 2023</p>
<p>DIF members participated in three days of inspiration, collaboration and connection in Zurich last month as the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) format came to Europe for the first time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The event brought together innovative startups, large companies, and governments, who are building products and developing services using emerging digital identity technologies.</p>
<p>The pre-unConference day on 7th June featured presentations on both foundational and advanced Decentralized Identity topics. One of the highlights was a panel discussion in which government representatives from the UK, Finland, Bhutan, the USA, Austria and Switzerland compared notes on how each country is approaching the introduction of digital identity services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the next two days of the unConference attendees proposed, discussed and co-created valuable output on a wide range of topics including DNS and Decentralized Systems, Mapping non-technical problems, How to evaluate tech stacks for future ecosystems, Digital Ethics, Interop Profiles and Experiences for OIDC4VC, Verifiable Credentials for Education, Wallet Security, Trust Registries, Connecting SSI with the Supply Chain, Requirements for Organisational Wallets, Revocation Methods and the EIDAS 2.0 EU Digital Identity Wallet Architecture Reference Framework (ARF).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kaliya Young and Heidi Nobantu Saul, the two facilitators of IIW, collaborated with a local partner, Trust Square, and the Swiss Digital Identity and Data Sovereignty Association (DIDAS) to produce and host the event.</p>

<p>Identity Week Europe 2023</p>
<p></p>
<p>Several DIF members also participated in Identity Week Europe in Amsterdam last month.</p>
<p>The event was attended by many vendors and customers in fields such as biometrics and travel, counter document fraud, Know Your Customer (KYC) and border management.</p>
<p>DIF's senior director of communications, Damian Glover, participated in a panel discussion on Decentralized Identity with Marnix van den Bent from Rabobank, Raffael Knecht (Swisscom), Pedro Torres (Youverse) and Robert Garskamp (Id Next).</p>
<p>The session was well attended, signalling growing interest in Decentralized Identity within well-established identity-centric industries. The audience posed some interesting and challenging questions at the end of the panel discussion and it was great to engage with the wider identity and business community.</p>
<p>Guest blog</p>
<p>DIF has featured interviews and guest blogs from a range of members and community participants on our website in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Most recently, the team at Spherity <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/digital-product-passports-and-supply-chain-compliance/">talked to us about their their work on Digital Product Passports in the EU, and promoting compliance with new pharmaceutical industry regulations in the US</a>.</p>

<p>Phishing and other attacks usually have one goal: passwords. So the world could be a better place without passwords. There have already been several attempts to bury the passwords. All have failed – due to the complexity, the costs for hardware keys, for example, or the inconvenient use. The new approach with FIDO2 and Passkeys sounds more promising. By the way, FIDO stands for Fast Identity Online.</p>

<p>Spherity builds Decentralized Identity management solutions designed to power the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The company participates in standards-setting processes and interacts with developer, industry, and research communities to enable compliance and interoperability in increasingly complex technological and regulatory landscapes. Spherity is active in various industry segments, but currently has a focus on the pharma industry and works on circular economy topics.<br></p><p>We caught up with Dr Susanne Guth-Orlowski, Chief Innovation &amp; Solution Officer, Christiane Wirrig, Product Manager CARO, and Ricky Thiermann, Product Owner Digital Product Passports to learn about their work on Digital Product Passports in the EU, and promoting compliance with new pharmaceutical industry regulations in the US.<br></p><p>Why did you adopt a decentralized approach to implementing the EU Digital Product Passport, Susanne Guth-Orlowski? <br></p><p>The decision was taken by the European Commission (EC), not us. Currently manufacturers have to provide data such as product certifications for chemicals and automotive parts and energy labeling data for electronic products to central systems in order to comply with EU regulations (such as <a href="https://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/registered-substances?ref=blog.identity.foundation">REACH </a>and <a href="https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">EPREL</a>). <br></p><p>The EC knows how hard it is to set up and maintain these central systems and keep everybody happy. Supply chain actors in particular do not want to upload their data to centralized systems as they fear sharing business secrets and they have no control over their data, once it is uploaded.<br></p><p>The EC saw that a use case as big as Digital Product Passports across multiple product segments, with supply chain actors scattered around the world, is very complex. It is difficult to set up a single platform to manage it and to satisfy the needs of all supply chain actors concerning business confidentiality.<br></p><p>How is Decentralized Identity being integrated alongside existing systems and standards? <br></p><p>This is an area where we’re working directly with the EC’s policy officers, participating in standardization groups at Stand.ICT and CEN/CENELEC, as well as contributing to research projects such as <a href="https://thebatterypass.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Battery Pass</a>, <a href="https://cirpassproject.eu/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">CIRPASS </a>and others. We’re bringing in decentralized concepts that enable the requirements to be met, incorporating W3C standards into the <a href="https://psqr.eu/publications-resources/all-about-dpp/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">EU Digital Product Passport</a> (DPP) specifications and designing and implementing Proof of Concepts (PoCs), such as our latest <a href="https://medium.com/@susi.guth/resolving-digital-product-passports-f08ac8f11b5a?ref=blog.identity.foundation">T-Shirt use case</a>. Textiles are one of the first regulated product segments, and therefore we are using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as a product identifier and resolver technology to reach the Digital Product Passport, and verifiable credentials for the product information. <br></p><p>What Decentralized Identity capabilities are you leveraging? <br></p><p>Information discovery is highly relevant in the DPP use case, and is fully solved by Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). Being able to locate a product’s DID and obtain all kinds of information from the DID document or service endpoint(s) enables you to meet so many use cases, from compliance certificates to pointing end customers to the product website. There’s so much flexibility.</p><p>Verifiability is another major driver. If you’re using the DPP to query a product’s carbon footprint, you need to ensure you’re looking at verified data. Products with a large footprint will be taxed more, creating an incentive for fraud. We need to ensure we can validate the data is accurate. <br></p><p>Verifiability has several important ingredients. <br></p><p>The first is cryptographic standards and protocols including signature schemes. <br></p><p>Then there’s trust verification, which is the ability to trace documents and data back to the supply chain’s root of trust (such as the digital signature of a competent authority). <br></p><p>Finally, there are semantics and calculations. It is critical to have standardized definitions (such as <a href="https://www.carbontrust.com/our-work-and-impact/guides-reports-and-tools/briefing-what-are-scope-3-emissions?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Scope 3 emissions</a>) and methods for calculating these values. <br></p><p>How are you handling product identification and data exchange? <br></p><p>For some products such as batteries, it makes sense to use Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) from Day One. The end product’s digital passport will include the identifiers of all materials and components, which in turn will have their own passports. This makes it possible to validate the product’s carbon footprint by summing the footprints of the pre-products and checking that it tallies. <br></p><p>For other categories such as textiles, existing systems in retail are built around the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) and Global Location Number (GLN). For those systems it will take some time until they can handle Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as globally unique identifiers. &nbsp;<br></p><p>With regards to data exchange, we are looking at using different methods depending on the requirements. For example, a Verifiable Presentation request might be handled via OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VP) for human identity use cases. On the other hand, we see the need for ongoing trusted connections between the supply chain actors associated with a finished product, so we are planning to use <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DID Communications (DIDComm)</a> for data exchange within the supply chain. <br></p><p>Turning to <a href="https://caro.vc/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">CARO</a>, Spherity’s credentialing service for &nbsp;US Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) compliance, what value does Decentralized Identity bring in this use case, Christiane Wirrig? <br></p><p>The way the pharma industry is set up in the US requires a decentralized approach. The FDA (US Food &amp; Drug Administration) doesn’t work like the EMA (European Medicines Agency). In the US, you have all these product repos sitting with the manufacturers themselves. Moreover, there’s no central register of participants in the supply chain.<br></p><p>From November 2023, supply chain actors, such as wholesalers and dispensers, will be required to verify the authenticity of the pharmaceutical product they are trading in a new way. Those opting for an automated solution can use a Verification Router Service (VRS) provider for the product verification. However there’s still an unanswered question, namely how do the pharma companies know who’s enquiring and responding?<br></p><p>This is where CARO comes in. The solution enables participants in the pharmaceutical supply chain to obtain a Verifiable Credential confirming their Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) status. In combination with VRS, this enables them to prove their legitimacy and complete an electronic product enquiry in real time.<br></p><p>The US pharmaceutical supply chain sounds quite fragmented. How is this being coordinated? <br></p><p>In a decentralized ecosystem, it’s essential to provide a safe environment for information exchange as well as shared standards as pointed out earlier by Susanne. We saw the need for a neutral body to play the role of ecosystem coordinator. That’s why we are one of the founding sponsors of the <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)</a>. <br></p><p>The OCI is where the industry comes together to agree the format of the ATP credentials, who is authorized to issue, hold and verify these and other considerations such as how to handle credential revocation. <br></p><p>Creating OCI was a stroke of genius because it lowers the barriers to entry for everyone. Service providers understand the required benchmarks and service users can expect interoperability and a degree of consistency across providers.<br></p><p>What Decentralized Identity capabilities are you leveraging in the CARO solution, Ricky Thiermann? <br></p><p>OCI has standardized on W3C Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials. CARO allocates Ethereum-based did:ethr as unique identifiers to its users. <br></p><p>Veramo is one of the core libraries we use and to which we contribute. We also use DIF Credential Manifest, and some of the cryptographic signature pieces being standardized in DIF. <br></p><p>Hyperledger Aries RFCs and DIDComm are very important for CARO, and will be the standard for Presentation Issuance and Exchange between OCI-compliant wallet providers. Aside from the technical benefits, it’s also about ecosystem efficiency and lowering the market entry barriers. At the moment the service provider ecosystem is small and we still have the capacity for active collaboration to align on shared standards and processes to avoid homebrewed niche approaches. Imagine if even just a couple of issuers and a handful of wallets had to integrate with each other’s provider-specific hook-ups in every possible combination!<br></p><p>Using DIDComm, there’s no need for issuers and verifiers to integrate. Once you’ve put the work in upfront to comply with the specification, you’re interoperable by design. This allows for an open market to emerge, and will ultimately enable the solution to scale. <br></p><p>What value does DIF bring? <br></p><p>We need the standards to be out there and recognized in order to implement a solution around Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) successfully. For that, we need a home that further develops Decentralized Identity technologies and specifications in a highly professional way, and closes any gaps that emerge around industry needs. For us, that’s what DIF brings to the table. <br><br><br></p>

 Part 1: Digital Twins in a Surveillance Economy <p>This article is the first in a two-part series. It aims to clarify the benefits and limitations of digital twinning technologies and why recent developments in AI continue to raise global concern regarding the inevitable socio-ethical dangers of digital twinning conscious entities–––a virtual model of "digital self"–––and our quest to protect free will and human agency in the current surveillance economy, where humans hope to leverage insights from digital twins for material objects and processes rather than being beholden to a virtual representation of "self" in the digital space.</p><p>Waking up to an unwelcome reality: Before the Internet of Things (IoT) brought the term "wearables" into fashion, people have been extending our physical and cognitive abilities for generations through supportive inventions such as glasses, watches, walking sticks, hearing devices, and wheelchairs, or used mind-altering consumables to extend our natural capabilities beyond previously known limits to assist us in our daily routines and activities, influencing the imagination of "self" as we evolve as an intelligent species.</p><p>In light of recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), creating a virtual representation of ourselves for self-determined interactions in the digital world is a societal issue as much as a technological one, pointing directly to our species' sense of being. Therefore, delineating between "what is human" and "what is a machine" lies at the heart of technological innovation in determining how humans engage with digital systems, with "human consciousness" a dominant factor in that delineation.</p>







  






















  <blockquote>
    ““It is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long for&nbsp;and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy.””
  </blockquote>
  — — Thucydides (c.455-c.400 BC)




  <p>The philosophical concept of "Sovereign Reason" states that all humans possess the inherent right to have supreme or ultimate power of a self-determined cause, explanation, or justification for an action or event, acting as the sole instrument of "<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/free-will">free will</a>."</p><p>Analogous to marine life struggling to survive beyond aquatic ecosystems, engaging in a digital world remains overwhelming to humans. Our ability to adapt to and comprehend the ramifications of deploying next-generation technologies is still embryonic. At Human Colossus, implementing any disruptive technology without fully understanding its influence on societal well-being is unfathomable. When AI is intrusive enough to result in coining the term "Digital Twin," societal vigilance is necessary for any technology deployed under that banner. Humans are conscious entities, not material objects. Developing a digital twin of a conscious entity is dangerous. An accurate virtual representation of "self" must never be in the form of a digital twin.</p><p>Refactoring AI innovation could narrow the current analogue/digital divide, providing a more realistic digital representation of real-world interactions with other entities in a virtual environment.</p> Why the notion of a digital twin of a human being continues to raise global concern <p>A "digital twin" is a virtual model designed to accurately reflect a physical object or process. They are created by collecting enough data to model an object in the digital space with enough accuracy to serve a specific purpose.</p> The benefits of digital twinning material objects and processes <p>A simple example of a "digital twin" is a digital image captured by a digital camera viewed on the camera's image display. The captured image is the digital counterpart of a negative in a roll of film, a photographic image stored as a single frame captured by an analogue camera. By creating a digital representation of the analogue photo, the photographer can enhance the image through digital image processing, a set of underlying algorithms to process existing data about the digital photograph mathematically. The image processing algorithms may include low-level methods, noise removal, and colour enhancement. AI algorithms provide data actioning recipes to accurately process data packets to represent material objects and processes in the digital domain. You can experience the digital counterpart of a material object or process remotely.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most well-known companies using digital twins is Tesla, which creates digital simulations for every car it sells. Each vehicle has sensors and sends data to the cloud, and Tesla then uses AI to analyse their performance.</p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>Organisations use digital twins for compound use cases. By collecting enough data about a physical object or process, digital twinning enables their corresponding representation in a digital environment, where the supporting data is ingested into virtual simulations to observe performance, check for physical limitations (e.g., crash tests), stress test critical components, and verify behavioural response in varying conditions. These simulations significantly reduce operational costs. After all, how often can an aviation company such as The Boeing Company, for example, afford to crash its Boeing 737s to test their handling in harsh weather conditions. Mechanical engineers can repeatedly crash a plane in a simulation without significant financial burdens or consequences. So, digital twins are disruptive to product lifecycle management (PLM) processes in most industries; they enable product owners to access an enormous amount of real-time data collected using sensors to ingest factual information about a physical object (the "product") or behavioural information about how that object responds to changes in environmental circumstance through its digital counterpart in simulation.</p><p>Previous technological limitations confined product owners to only being able to test early-stage life cycles in a lab before releasing a product to market. However, due to the ever-decreasing costs of digital sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has scaled digital twinning technologies, with digital twins now able to provide algorithmic reasoning for performance monitoring at every stage of a product life cycle, with data insights about consumer products accessible in real-time. Product owners can create digital twins for a product and create digital twins for an instance of a product. That level of granularity makes past impossibilities in trend analysis now possible, with product insights more accessible across the board.</p><p>So, how can we use digital twins? Well, digital twins can run practical simulations to study multiple real-time processes, such as predicting failure, improving response times, and informing customers about maintenance information to prolong a product's functioning life. With simple controlling mechanisms built into the devices, we can monitor responses, inform product customers, and remotely solve issues before they happen, enabling automated self-healing functionality. Digital twins can fully control a device without unnecessarily burdening the consumer, allowing a more seamless user experience.</p><p>Digital twins allow product owners to monitor granular processes across an entire product lifecycle, including at all stages of research and development (R&amp;D), design, manufacturing, service and maintenance, and daily operation.</p> The socio-ethical dangers of digital twinning conscious entities <p>For the most part, developing digital twins for material objects ("products") and processes can significantly benefit organisations wishing to streamline product development and optimise costs, and their customers, who benefit from greater product efficiency. However, if virtual representations of objects can profoundly benefit society, can we produce a digital twin for a conscious entity, such as an intelligent animal or human? A virtual model of "digital self."[1]</p><p>In truth, through corporate surveillance, many companies already have enough data about customer buying behaviour and other traceable patterns to develop virtual representations of consumers (without consent) to benefit the organisation in any digital environments they control, an unwelcome economic reality and, in light of digitally twinning civilians, a sobering thought.</p><p>For large swathes of the global population, humans are well connected as an ever-evolving species reliant on technology. However, through our various online interactions with service providers and product owners, organisations can leverage personal data gathered through their collection processes to benefit their companies. With the sheer amount of personal data collected, by integrating a small amount of consumer behavioural data, companies can run powerful algorithms to process sensitive information about us, directly profiling our deepest desires, no matter how private the information, including our watching, buying, and eating preferences, and this epidemic doesn't stop with probabilistic predictions, as simulated models can coercively tell us what to do without relying on the intricacies of human consciousness.</p><p>Digital twinning conscious entities would inevitably leave human reasoning to machines and the ultimate loss of our God-given right to "<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/free-will">free will</a>."</p><p>But Free Will will prevail.</p><p>Luckily, there is an inherent flaw in the logic of profiling using big data. Although relatively simple to explain, exposing this weakness brings awareness of the risks we face in the current digital economy and gives rise to an alternative solution to digitally twinning civilians.</p><p>Even with tech companies collecting an enormous amount of data about us, there remains an unquenchable thirst for them to collect more and more personal data to fuel their algorithms. This frenzy for data is easy to explain.</p><p>So, imagine a scenario where you purchase an appliance, for example. Shortly after buying the product, you'll often receive targeted ads from a different store for a similar product at a lower price. So why do digital companies rely on this type of ad campaign? Despite having access to massive data sets and analytical tooling to generate "digital twins," the business model is flawed. If common sense prevailed, declaring that you've already bought the desired appliance should deter any marketing algorithms from sending you targeted ads for similar products after the purchase event. So, why do companies engage in this type of business model? The simple answer is “cost."&nbsp;</p><p>Correctly identifying helpful information in a database to enable a simple decision process is a complex and largely unsolved problem. With more and more data required for companies to maintain a competitive edge, marketing analytics resort to brute-force correlations, pressing for a tsunami of data that fuels the digital economy, leading to the societal consequences we see today.</p><p>At Human Colossus, we think differently and advocate for a Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) where the integrity of data objects and processes and the authenticity of recorded events in associated key event logs provide the cryptographic assurance and data quality necessary for accurate analytics and improved business insights (see Blog post from November 2022 - https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/accuratedata1). A way of visualising this difference is via the Economics of Correlators.&nbsp;</p> The Economics of Correlators <p>In September 2021, the Human Colossus Foundation hosted a webinar titled "Core public utility technologies for a <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">Next Generation Internet</a>." In the context of systems with weak privacy, Dr. Sam Smith presented the concept of the economics of correlators (see Vimeo <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">recording @19m20sec</a>). The correlator is an entity that tries to gather data about you and correlate it with specific behaviour to create a prediction. This correlation is the basis of digital transformation in the advertising industry. In less than a generation, the sector's primary focus evolved from "know-your-customer" to "know-your-data-and-correlate," with collected consumer data enabling companies to propose their "best" offers and products to consumers based on company-controlled algorithms. Unfortunately, the previous example of the purchased appliance demonstrates that this only works as intended occasionally due to the limitations of simple economics where accurate correlation has a cost.</p><p>Gathering real-time data with proper context and accuracy is an ongoing data curation problem for humans today, with technological and economic barriers. This article will ignore governance barriers (e.g., privacy), focusing purely on technology and economics. Today's network architecture may allow sufficient data flow for simple IoT devices or physical objects by measuring a few standardised data points. However, it cannot cope with the nuanced complexity of interactions involving humans in an even more complex ecosystem. Monitoring all that at scale is a challenging technological task with a cost. Therefore the economic constraints of extracting real-time data outweigh the benefits payoff for those companies.</p><p>The economics of the correlators describes a relationship between correlation costs and value from which we can identify the domains in which there is an extractable value in correlation. As we can see in the diagram below, the correlation costs need to be lower than the correlation value, so extracting the value from the data would be profitable. By understanding the dynamics of these curves, one can control the economics around the data, influencing the behaviour of the data market.</p>

  <p>The example we provided above indicates that commercially, the most valuable pieces of information are near "Now." So the services can adapt to your current needs. But, of course, it only helps if you get a proposition of the product you have yet to buy. But as we can see on the diagram, the cost of extraction grows significantly as soon as it approaches "Now." It, therefore, reduces the domain of value extraction from correlated data. As a result, this correlation cost translates into a limit of accuracy for the algorithms attempting to predict individual behaviour.</p> The limits of correlation <p>This limit is good news when considered from a higher societal perspective. Collecting data in real-time is particularly challenging and, in many cases, leads to total surveillance of a person and their community. Whether we like it or not, information is generated by us directly or captured through our interactions on social platforms, online buying behaviour, and via our friends and family through shared personal photos on social media, a personal phone number shared through a specific instant messaging app, etc. Based on collected data, companies can make robust predictions, such as inferring a social profile of a not yet-born child based on the information their mother posts on a social platform, the country in which they are living, areas, parents' background, and more.</p><p>The success of the current digital economy is primarily due to the advertising model mentioned above, with systemic flaws for everyone to observe, where user-generated data aggregated by organisations fuel machine learning algorithms that model behavioural patterns to predict our desires and shape our opinions, enslaving consumers to corporate-driven incentives, a surveillance system.</p><p>In Shoshana Zuboffin's book "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism," the author describes "Capitalism" as "a profit-making incentive that arose as advertising companies, led by Google's AdWords, saw the possibilities of using personal data to target consumers more precisely.", an observation indicating that the current label "Digital Twins" is a misnomer. Perhaps "Digital Puppets" would be more appropriate! However, as digital twins are a reality, what can be done to reverse the trend of our current surveillance society? The wake-up call highlighted above shows that, although de facto, digitally twinning human beings is a bad idea due to known privacy risks.</p> Actualising digital twins in the natural world <p>So, the digital twinning of material objects and processes can provide enough data for humans to understand how to react to and control devices to operate in a particular manner. However, if we were to apply the same principle to living beings, we would have to digitalise the differentiating factors that separate humans from machines, the essential characteristics of living beings, namely, the concepts of "Free Will" and "Sovereign Reason" introduced at the beginning of this article. In addition, we can also highlight the economic dimension, where the human instinct for financial success is the modern equivalent of survival.</p><p>Like any software tool, digital twins can assist both good and bad practices. However, influenced and determined by the community, "Good" and "Bad" are contextual. The trickier question is how to ensure that developing the right digital twinning technology will maximise the "good" and minimise the "bad." In particular, can we provide access to real-time data that makes economic sense without losing control or compromising privacy?&nbsp;</p><p>And our answer is, "Yes, we can!" (and we are working on it.)</p> Step 1: Acting on the economy of correlators as the agent of change <p>As we learned in the "The Economics of Correlators" section, we can manipulate how data reaches the market, influencing the costs of the correlation or the correlation value so that value extraction can happen in desired conditions through de-correlation techniques developed for privacy preservation purposes, for example. The cost of value extraction for near real-time data correlation is high for market actors but quasi-nil for the data source. Therefore, we could change assumptions about who in that situation is a correlator and drive the correlation costs to the minimum for the system. If the user collects the data themselves, costs drop dramatically since they already have devices able to collect data in real-time, with the user deciding what data they generate, record, and share. We not only make it affordable because of the scale (i.e., just one individual instead of millions), but we also change the control over the data.</p><p>Sharing for an explicit purpose will provide a high incentive for adoption and consent.</p><p>This topic becomes critically important in healthcare, where patient data is of high value to many stakeholders. Suppose a patient or an organisation trusted by the patient has complete control of shared data for a specific purpose, not inadvertently used for something else. This scenario is a game changer, facilitating dramatically improved access to purposeful data.</p> Step 2: Restore Sovereignty <p>Individuals must operate the proper tools in a secure environment to transform the end user into the correlator. With this prerequisite, they will perform such activities without worrying about being surveilled or losing sensitive information. For this to happen, individuals must regain confidence in their digital interactions.</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation continues to shape the requirements of a SELF Actioning System (SAS), a core technological piece for human-centric digital engagement in a new Dynamic Data Economy (DDE), in HCF’s SELF Actioning System (SAS) Working Group.</p><p>That concludes Part 1 of this two-part series. Part 2 will describe how a SELF actioning system provides a superior solution for embodying "digital self" to facilitate human-led data actions in the digital realm, where sovereign reason and consciousness reside with the system's owner (a "human"), not with a virtual representation of that person (a "machine").</p><p>Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Since we last <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Engine-Room-Oxfam-Biometrics-Review.pdf" title="looked into">looked into</a> the use of biometrics in the humanitarian sector five years ago in 2018,&nbsp; the technology has become increasingly embedded in humanitarian programming, with sensitive biometric information being collected from vulnerable individuals in an increasing array of contexts, from Bangladesh to Yemen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the momentum behind using biometric technology in humanitarian contexts has been part of a push toward increased efficiency and more accurate data within the sector. At the same time, however, evidence of harms has mounted, and concerns about risk have increased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From February 2022 to June 2023 The Engine Room, with support from OSF, took a renewed look at the risks and benefits of biometric collection in the humanitarian sector, examined some of the institutional policies that shape their use, and explored recent use cases.</p>



<p>Our findings point towards the need for a more holistic and responsible approach to the deployment of biometrics in the sector. You can read a snapshot of these findings later in this post, and download the full report below.&nbsp;If you’re new to biometrics or looking to gain more background understanding of what biometrics are and how they are used more generally, start with our accompanying Primer. </p>

<p>JOIN OUR UPCOMING COMMUNITY CALL<br><br>In order to share our learnings with civil society organisations, activists and funders, we’ll be holding a community call on 7 September, 2023.   <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUkcuyrqT4qHNA0JFjLaURUDH21ZaEnoo_4" title="">REGISTER HERE</a>: Thurs 7 September  at 10:00-11:00 EDT | 16:00-17:00 CEST | 19:30-20:30 IST.  <br> <br>Come along to hear more about our research findings, hear from other key voices in the discussion around biometric use in the humanitarian sector, and be part of a facilitated conversation on potential new approaches. Anyone with an interest in the topic is welcome – we’d love you to join us!&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



 A snapshot of our research findings 



<p>Against a backdrop of changing conditions, our research sought to map out differing approaches and understandings of biometric use within the humanitarian sector.&nbsp; From increased investment in biometric technology in the private sector and the still latent consideration of biometric information in data governance frameworks, to the manifestation of harm via non-consensual access to biometric data and the growing cyber targeting of humanitarian organisations, we found a sector in a key moment of flux.</p>



<p>Overall, in the last five years there has not been a cohesive change in how the humanitarian sector approaches the use of biometrics, and a growing divergence has emerged between organisations taking a more restrictive approach to biometric technologies, and those who are continuing to expand their use.&nbsp;</p>



 Some of the key learnings from our research include:&nbsp; 



 
 Risks and harms are not fully accounted for. Given the sensitivity of biometric data it is important for humanitarian organisations — with their commitment to doing no harm — to consider potential harms holistically. The majority of current assessments of biometric technologies, however, fail to properly address issues such as function creep.<br> 



 The need for more evidence of benefits remains. A fuller accounting of biometric technologies should also include a deeper investigation into the potential benefits of biometric technology. While there has been increased evidence of harms, a more complex understanding and costing of benefits in relation to harms has not emerged, and evidence of benefits alone remains limited.<br> 



 Organisational policies lack coherence across the sector, and many do not properly account for the specifics of biometric technologies. Policies offer a window into how organisations are approaching the use of biometrics in their work, we reviewed eight different organisational policies looking at accessibility, specificity, proportionality and implementation. In our research we saw a varied approach in the sector – only two organisations had biometric-specific policies; the remaining six did not.<br> 



 Policy implementation is patchy. Having the right policies is only one part of the puzzle — policy success also depends on proper implementation. However we found that a lack of resources and sustained support around policy implementation was resulting in operational challenges, with informal workarounds and disconnects between policies set by organisational headquarters and implementation in regional offices.&nbsp; 



 Technical literacy among key decision makers remains a challenge. In order to make informed decisions around the use of biometrics, staff need to be better equipped to understand and engage in nuanced discussions around the technology. Across our interviews we saw that most organisations were struggling with knowledge-building around biometrics, with both programme officers in regional offices and policymakers at headquarters making decisions about biometric technologies and data protection policy implementation without the proper knowledge to do so safely and responsibly.<br> 



 Donors continue to encourage the use of biometric systems without providing adequate funding for safety measures. Part of the impetus for the uptake of biometric technologies can be traced back to minority world donors. By stipulating funding requirements and encouraging investment and research in biometrics, these large and influential donors have introduced biometric systems into humanitarian operations without providing the investment and support to enable their responsible use.&nbsp; 
 



 What needs to change 



<p>Our research showed a clear need to develop a more coherent and responsible approach to the use of biometrics in the sector, and that in order for humanitarian organisations to uphold their commitment and responsibility to impacted communities it is vital that a shared standard is established in the sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We suggest five key steps towards a more responsible approach:</p>



 
 Continued interrogation of the necessity of biometrics&nbsp; 



 More nuanced policy design and implementation 



 Establishing community-centred standards of practice&nbsp; 



 Strengthening practices around Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) 



 More sophisticated, ecosystem-wide analysis of technologies used in the sector

 Trace Labs and BSI develop new solution for cross-border food transfers as UK adopts Electronic Trade Documents Bill <p>United Kingdom adopts the Electronic Trade Documents Bill as Trace Labs, core developers of OriginTrail open-source technology, and British Standards Institution (BSI), the business improvement and standards company established under Royal Charter, release a new solution developed for cross-border food transfers.</p><p>In an effort to streamline international trade and enhance efficiency, the United Kingdom has taken a significant step forward by adopting the Electronic Trade Documents Bill. On July 20, 2023, the <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3344">Electronic Trade Documents Bill (ETDB)</a> received Royal Assent, and is officially an act of law (now the Electronic Trade Documents Act), promising to transform the way international trade is conducted electronically. This pivotal legislation seeks to digitize trade documents, eliminating cumbersome paperwork and facilitating seamless cross-border transactions.</p><p>The Electronic Trade Documents Bill marks a milestone in the modernization of global trade practices. With this landmark legislation, the UK aims to harness the power of technology to revolutionize the way trade documents are processed, ensuring quicker turnaround times, reduced costs, and improved security.</p><p>This groundbreaking act holds immense potential for businesses engaged in international trade, as it replaces traditional paper-based documentation with secure electronic trade documents. Additionally, it enables the use of digital signatures and advanced encryption technology, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of trade documents.</p><p>Parallelly, in response to the growing demands of cross-border food transfers, Trace Labs, core developers of OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG for short), in collaboration with BSI, the business improvement and standards company established under Royal Charter, are pioneering an innovative solution that promises to revolutionize the industry. This new solution has been developed utilizing cutting-edge technology and industry expertise to address the complexities associated with international food transfers.</p><p>The solution is a direct result of the two-year “Trusted Bytes” project launched as part of The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund’s “Manufacturing Made Smarter Challenge”. To support the smoother flow of food products into and out of the UK, BSI used its broad experience to develop a standards-based operating model for the Trusted Bytes Data Trust framework. The model is designed to make it much easier for all parties to source and confirm information about products and ensure compliance, streamlining the processes for border-crossing.</p><p>As part of the project, BSI helped to build the framework by combining the benefits of traditional standards with emerging supply chain standards and innovative technologies such as OriginTrail DKG — the open source software developed by Trace Labs. This approach demonstrates how standards can be leveraged to support future technologies that promote data sharing, enabling users to verify information provenance across industry stakeholders, government agencies, and regulators for seamless and secure international trade. Prior work on data trust led by the University of Lincoln supported this activity.</p><p>BSI and Trace Labs also developed the advanced Trusted Trader framework, which showcases the future of trade compliance, assurance, and risk assessment, building on the globally recognized Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) scheme. The framework transforms supply chain data into discoverable, verifiable, and AI-ready Knowledge Assets. This enables UK customs to assess risk levels associated with incoming shipments in real-time from the departure right up until the arrival on UK soil, with the potential to make customs processes more focused and efficient. Technology enabled by SecureSystem Gmbh and Contained Technologies supported BSI and Trace Labs in showcasing this Trusted Trader demonstrator.</p><p>The project also focused on enabling a trusted data exchange to connect the supply chain with central government and other critical partners, enhancing cross border facilitation, compliance, and security. The framework, developed within Trusted Bytes, is reusable and can be deployed by government agencies globally to help infuse trust and transparency into their cross-border processes.</p><p>Jurij Skornik, Trace Labs’ General Manager: “With the King signing off on the Electronic Trade Documents Bill (ETDB), businesses can now utilize electronic trade documents, laying a robust foundation for improving trade sustainability, increasing trade value, and enabling AI-powered trade solutions. The criteria set out in the bill are perfectly aligned with the logic of OriginTrail Knowledge Assets that can provide discoverability, ownership, and verifiability to any trade document — all backed by blockchain.</p><p>Supported by Innovate UK, Trace Labs already worked with BSI, SecureSystem, and other partners on a solution to facilitate international trade in the UK, using OriginTrail Knowledge Assets and the same principles as set out in the bill. This solution turns paper trade documents such as CMR and Bill of Lading into Knowledge Assets on OriginTrail DKG, giving them ownership (transferability) and verifiability. This provides an easy and trusted way for UK customs to assess the risk of a shipment based on trusted and verifiable trade documents and data. It also sets a strong foundation for AI-powered search of trade data based on OriginTrail trusted knowledge infrastructure, which will be available soon.”</p><p>👇 More about Trace&nbsp;Labs👇</p><p><a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Trace Labs</a> is the core developer of <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> — the open source Decentralized Knowledge Graph.

 By Adrian Doerk  <p></p><p>Decentralized Identity is a rapidly evolving field. Its potential to transform the way digital identities are managed and protected has not gone unnoticed. The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) has been at the vanguard of this movement, working tirelessly to develop the technologies and standards necessary for its realisation. In Europe, the eIDAS regulation has set the stage for the creation of a European Digital Identity Wallet, a secure means for citizens to access online services throughout the EU. DIF and its members have been busy supporting this initiative through a range of activities, such as participating in large-scale pilots and developing concepts and prototypes for hardware binding and wallet attestation. In this blog post, we will explore the role of DIF in advancing the European Digital Identity Wallet and examine the various activities undertaken by its members in support of this crucial project.<br></p><p>Introduction to the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</p><p>DIF is a collaborative effort that brings together organisations, developers, and researchers from around the world. It seeks to promote the development and adoption of Decentralized Identity technologies, which have the potential to revolutionise the way we manage our digital selves. By working together, the members of DIF aim to create a future in which individuals have greater control over their personal data and are able to interact with others in a more secure and privacy-preserving manner.<br></p><p>In order to achieve this vision, DIF promotes the development of open standards and protocols. It also provides tools and resources that enable developers to build Decentralized Identity solutions. Since its inception, DIF has attracted a large and diverse membership, which includes both established industry players and innovative startups. This collaborative ecosystem is crucial to driving the adoption of Decentralized Identity technologies and ensuring their long-term success.<br></p><p>Understanding eIDAS, the European Digital Identity Wallet and the Large Scale Pilots</p><p>eIDAS, which stands for Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services, is an EU regulation that was first introduced in 2014. Its purpose is to establish a single framework for the secure and seamless provision of digital services across the European Union. One of the key components of eIDAS is the European Digital Identity Wallet, a software application enabling citizens and organisations the management of verifiable identity information and seamless access to online services.<br></p><p>The legislative process of the revised eIDAS regulation is accompanied by four large-scale pilots, which are being carried out across the EU and aim to provide policy makers with the necessary real world experience and feedback. These pilots serve as testbeds for the development and evaluation of the wallet's features, as well as its integration with online services. The results of these pilots will help inform the development of the wallet and ensure that it meets the needs of European citizens and businesses.<br></p><p>The Role of DIF and Its Members' Activities in Supporting the success of the European Digital Identity Wallet</p><p>DIF members have been actively involved in the design and development of &nbsp;identity solutions and digital identity wallets for years already. Many of them are now participating in the large-scale pilots, where they help to test and refine the wallet's features and functionality. <br></p><p>DIF members have been addressing key challenges in developing a secure European Digital Identity Wallet, including hardware binding and wallet attestation. They have been working on concepts and prototypes to securely bind the wallet to the user's device using techniques like secure hardware modules and cryptographic methods. Wallet attestation involves using cryptographic proofs to verify the authenticity and integrity of the wallet's contents, ensuring trustworthiness for service providers and relying parties. The secure wallet working group spearheaded by German Bundesdruckerei and wallet provider Lissi <a href="https://idunion.org/2023/05/09/konzepte-fuer-wallet-sicherheit-in-ssi/?lang=en&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">demonstrated a working prototype</a> within the scope of IDunion. This work could lay the foundation for the European Digital Identity Wallet and its users.<br></p><p>The Crucial Role of Relationships When Building Trust: A Case for DIDComm</p><p>Trust is a fundamental aspect of any identity system, and Decentralized Identity is no exception. In the context of the European Digital Identity Wallet, the ability to establish and maintain persistent relationships between individuals and organisations is essential for ensuring its success. DIDComm, a protocol developed by DIF, offers a potential solution to this challenge and could be an interesting addition to European Digital Identity Wallets.<br></p><p>DIDComm enables secure and privacy-preserving communication between parties that have been identified using decentralized identifiers (DIDs). This allows individuals and organisations to establish trusted relationships with persistent communication channels, which are persistent and enable organisations to push information to end-users instead of requiring a pull. DIDComm's use of end-to-end encryption and other security features ensures that these relationships remain secure and private, which is vital for preserving user trust and fostering a healthy digital identity ecosystem.<br></p><p>In addition to its potential role in the European Digital Identity Wallet, DIDComm has broad applicability across a range of industries and use cases. Its ability to facilitate secure and privacy-preserving communication makes it an ideal foundation for the development of a wide variety of Decentralized Identity solutions for citizens and organisations alike. <br></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The European Digital Identity Wallet represents an ambitious and transformative initiative that aims to provide a secure and seamless digital identity solution for citizens across the EU. The Decentralized Identity Foundation and its members have played an important role in supporting the development of digital identity wallets in general, contributing their expertise and resources to the advancement of this crucial global development. From participating in large-scale pilots to developing cutting-edge concepts and prototypes for hardware binding and wallet attestation, DIF members have demonstrated their commitment to the success of the European Digital Identity Wallet and the broader Decentralized Identity ecosystem. As we continue to explore the potential of Decentralized Identity technologies, the collaborations and innovations fostered by organisations like DIF will be essential for shaping a more secure and privacy-preserving future for digital identity management.<br><br></p><p>About the Author:</p><p>Adrian Doerk focuses on providing user-centric digital identity services with digital wallets, which ensure privacy and empowerment of the individual.

<p>ZKLadder is a venture studio building products that connect physical and digital environments. They empower creators and brands of all sizes to connect authentic physical objects with digital records, like NFT’s, using a self-sovereign design.</p><p>ZKLadder’s authenticity platform uses an innovative physical labeling solution based on unclonable three-dimensional identifiers and optical scanning technology. A unique 3D tag is adhered to a physical object and can be scanned and validated with the camera on any mobile device.</p><p>“The Ceramic data storage protocol is ideal for extending our core platform guarantees of self-sovereignty, open and permissionless access to data, and censorship resistance,” the ZKLadder team says. </p><blockquote>“Our labels last for decades, so it’s imperative that we leverage a sustainable protocol. You have to believe in the design, but moreover the people and their ability to evolve and thrive in Web3. This is why we selected Ceramic.”</blockquote> The Story of ZKLadder <p>ZKLadder is a seasoned Web3 engineering group that collaborates with mechanical engineering PHD’s and professors at Stony Brook University with deep experience and patented technology in consumer goods authentication. They have married a unique optical scanning and authentication technology with a scalable, trustless Web3 platform.</p><p>ZKLadder utilized ComposeDB on Ceramic to develop a solution that connects patented, tamper-resistant physical labels to NFT’s on any EVM compatible blockchain.</p><p>The tech offers a low cost way to prove the source authenticity of a physical thing using the camera on any phone. While it has wide applicability across many verticals such as merchandise, fashion and cannabis—ZKLadder has gone to market leveraging the real demand that exists today in generative art and photography markets.</p><p>Several well-known and successful artists have used the platform to create authentic physical prints linked to their NFT art collections. This system allows these creators to offer their collectors authentic, one-of-one prints of the NFT tokens they own.</p> The Challenge Before Ceramic <p>When initially designing their stack, one of the key decisions revolved around where and how to store the data necessary for ZKLadder apps, and consequently an end user’s mobile device to authenticate and identify a physical label through a scan.</p><p>Every physical label that gets linked to an NFT through the ZKLadder platform is accompanied by a digital &nbsp;'Certificate of Authenticity' (COA) that encodes the unique label data, describes the underlying physical object, and identifies its NFT counterpart.</p><p>“We could have chosen to store these COA’s in a centralized database for maximal control and convenience, but doing that would ultimately lead us down the path of a centralized (and fragmented) technology provider, and would severely limit our ability to pursue our roadmap of decentralization (open sourcing authentication stack, white labeling mobile app, establishing a DAO, etc.),” said the ZKLadder team.</p><p>Another alternative would have been to pursue an on-chain data storage strategy, which would ensure maximal data availability, but with their goal of eventually certifying hundreds and thousands of physical items across many verticals—it quickly became apparent that this would be cost prohibitive even on a Layer 2 or sidechain. Other challenges with on-chain storage included difficulty in updating the shape of data once it is deployed, and limits in indexing and query functionality.</p><p>“With Ceramic, and specifically ComposeDB, we found a solution that was flexible enough to store many types of data records (through straightforward model creation), and could do it at scale and at lower cost, without sacrificing on our goal of building an open and composable data set,” the ZKLadder team said.</p> Why ZKLadder Chose Ceramic &amp; ComposeDB <p>The ecosystem for application-scale decentralized data storage is in its early stages, according to the ZKLadder team.</p><p>“One major concern with many of Ceramic’s competitors was that they would not be production-ready for some time, with an even greater gap to reaching the kind of battle-tested performance guarantees that developers rely on,” they said.</p><blockquote>What excited us the most about Ceramic, besides all of the useful functionality being built on ComposeDB, was the maturity of the network, with many products and platforms appearing to utilize it in production and an active forum where problems and questions are addressed on a continuous basis.</blockquote><p>Seeing many builder groups utilizing Ceramic made ZKLadder’s team feel secure in following a trodden path. They also understand the power of network effects, and strongly believe that Ceramic will continue to grow and coalesce energy. </p><p>By joining the pool of apps building on ComposeDB, the team is opting into a world where collaborating with other builder groups is possible without having to worry about significant development overhead.</p> How ZKLadder Built With ComposeDB on Ceramic <p>ZKLadder relies on ComposeDB today, in production, to store a data set of 'Certificates of Authenticity' that their application uses to authenticate each physical label, and identify the underlying physical artwork and NFT that it is connected to.</p><p>To power this functionality, they primarily rely on two models:</p>  <a href="https://s3.xyz/streams/stream/kjzl6hvfrbw6ca5y7upkmpt2poqi4zpyt1x4jvjs2jdqzgblzh8go4urodcp4fu?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Label Model</a> - Stores data necessary for the authentication of each <a href="https://docs.iterati.art/core-concepts/inimitable-physical-labels?ref=blog.ceramic.network">unique physical label</a>, primarily the 'imageData' field that encodes each label’s unique combination of microbead colors and positions  <a href="https://s3.xyz/streams/stream/kjzl6hvfrbw6c7n1wzu7mx4xmcundh1r7t3sgsupkb5i10n0ykergeeavfc4wno?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Certificate Model</a> - Stores data necessary to link a label to an NFT, including the contract address and token ID, along with optional descriptions of the underlying physical object  <p>A typical interaction from an end user’s point of view (authenticating an item) would look like this:</p><p>An example of this flow in action can be found <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CsWQ1KNt-BE/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p><p>“Through our art focused POC platform, called Iterati, we have certified over 500 physical artworks from several artists active on <a href="https://www.artblocks.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Artblocks</a>, <a href="https://www.brightmoments.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Bright Moments</a>, and <a href="https://www.fxhash.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">FXHash</a>, and distributed them to hundreds of collectors and enthusiasts, all using ComposeDB behind the scenes,” the team says.</p><p>At the moment, ZKLadder is using ComposeDB simply as a data storage solution in order to create a more resilient and censorship-resistant platform, but they are extremely excited about their longer-term roadmap of decentralizing the toolkit, allowing anyone, anywhere to tag and certify any form of physical object and own the COA itself as is possible with Ceramic’s DID-based authentication scheme.</p><p>“We envision a world where hundreds of creators, brands, and builder groups are able to, in a self-sovereign way, attest to the authenticity of any object, and for a wide variety of applications to have the ability to validate this claim of authenticity and then determine if it came from a trustworthy DID,” the team says.</p> Get in Touch <p>Generative artists and photographers looking to transform their digital art into something unique, authentic and physical can check out their platform here: <a href="https://iterati.art/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">https://iterati.art</a></p><p>Or if you're just curious about the tech and want to learn more feel free to reach out to their team here: <a href="mailto:chris.tiu@zkladder.com">chris.tiu@zkladder.com</a></p>

		<p>Used by more than five hundred institutions around the globe, the CAUDIT Higher Education Reference Models (HERM) are a standard set of business and data architectures relevant to higher education. Institutions can use these resources as a touchstone to increase the value and efficiency of their operations and as a tool to engage key stakeholders. The first version of the HERM models was launched in 2016 and has since evolved after a collaboration between the Council of Australasian University Directors of Information Technology (CAUDIT), UCISA, EDUCAUSE, and European University Information Systems (EUNIS), which adopted and endorsed the global standard in 2021.</p>
<p>One of the HERM models, the Business Capability Model (BCM), is a comprehensive framework for planning and managing adaptive business capabilities in a highly dynamic world. Institutions can use this resource as a reference for business stakeholders, enterprise architects, and technology strategists to engage in informed discussions regarding business effectiveness, needs, and challenges. More specifically, the BCM serves as an anchor for assessing perspectives such as strategic importance, maturity, business operational pain points, capital investment, and organizational structure.</p>
<p>Creating a Common Language<br>
Along with using enterprise storytelling to engage effectively with stakeholders, referencing the HERM models allows institutions to foster a holistic understanding of their organization and gain valuable insight into how they can guide operational and strategic planning. This closer look helps stakeholders to invest in the capabilities that will deliver the most important business outcomes and connect these business objectives to the information and technology necessary to support them. “In the past, organizations didn’t have a common language that identified the capabilities that were required to manageably achieve their business outcomes,” explains Dan Miller, Associate Vice President, EdgeMarket. “Oftentimes, we would have to speak in the language of vendors, which apart from a few standard terms, was vastly different. Now, the promise of a business capabilities model out of the HERM provides a well-developed taxonomy and lexicon that institutions can use as a roadmap to help align their business needs and IT strategies and architectures.”</p>
<p>Adopting these models also supports the exchange of architectural knowledge and best practices throughout the higher education community. “As more members of the consortium map themselves to this framework, we create a common language within the community,” continues Miller. “This agreed upon body of terms and definitions helps accelerate our understanding of member needs, enhance the ability of each institution to prioritize their investments and support interoperability and collaboration between member organizations.”</p>
<p>Adopting the BCM<br>
Seeing the value of the BCM and how these practices could help member institutions succeed in managing their business capabilities, Edge is currently working on adopting this model and will help members of the consortium to understand its uses and benefits. Chris Markham, Edge’s Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer, added, “We encourage institutions to explore the BCM and we will be offering educational opportunities to learn more about applying these standards to create a customized roadmap. Edge plans to explore new and extended services and use this model to plan procurements and categorize and evaluate our solutions and vendors in EdgeMarket. I believe the sky’s the limit with what we can accomplish by creating a common language within the higher education community. Much like institutions are cataloging and managing their curriculums to support business goals and serve the needs of their students and faculty, the BCM can empower organizations to apply the same approach to business management. By using the BCM as a tool, institutions can more accurately identify the overarching needs of their organization and better strategize IT solutions that will bring their short- and long-term goals to fruition.”</p>

		<p>A leader in STEM education, research, and economic development, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) recently implemented a plan to upgrade their high performance computing (HPC) resources on campus. As part of this initiative, NJIT partnered with Databank to build this HPC environment at their data center in Piscataway, N.J. Driven by their continued growth in research initiatives, this new addition aims to improve the performance of NJIT’s research computing environment and capabilities. To deploy this HPC environment and have the capacity to utilize this resource, NJIT needed significant bandwidth, both in the number of circuits, the amount of bandwidth per circuit, and the ability for those services to be available one hundred percent of the time.</p>
<p>To fulfill this need for redundant services, NJIT looked to long-time partner, Edge, to provide an exceptional connectivity experience through their optical fiber network, EdgeNet. In the past, Edge has provided external services to NJIT, including connectivity to the Internet, peering infrastructure, and cloud services platform. With this recent expansion, Edge is helping operate internal network resources that the University depends on by building and operating an optical infrastructure that sits inside EdgeNet.</p>

		<p>Tapping into expertise and experience<br>
When first exploring the implementation of this new HPC cluster, NJIT knew these resources would require high bandwidth and highly available services to connect back to the main campus. At first, the University considered investing in the optical hardware, but discovered the operational expenses for the fiber leases, the ongoing hardware support, and staff augmentation and training to build and manage this kind of environment could be challenging and expensive. Plus, multiple circuits needed to be built and maintained over these two geographically diverse fiber paths, in addition to having team members monitor the service, troubleshoot issues, and dispatch the correct resources to restore services in the event of an outage.</p>
<p>With these requirements and responsibilities being native to Edge, NJIT could tap into the knowledge, resources, and support of the consortium and meet the needs of this new HPC environment without having to make their own capital investment in the hardware infrastructure. Working with Edge, NJIT was able to achieve the bandwidth they needed today, while also receiving an economically scalable platform for the future. Plus, by counting on Edge’s experienced network team who are well versed in operating these types of networks across the region, NJIT reduced their need to hire additional staff and train them on these new technologies and hardware platforms.</p>
<p>Meeting current and future bandwidth needs<br>
The majority of Edge’s core infrastructure is a shared service for all member institutions to utilize. For this project, NJIT had specific requirements for the fiber and hardware that would be deployed to support these services. By dedicating the platform to NJIT, the University will have the room to grow and can add bandwidth circuits to the platform without incurring additional expenses. Most importantly, since the service is exclusively dedicated to NJIT and the specific application, they will not have to worry about other members’ activities or common disruptions that can be seen on the consortium network. As one of just three R1 universities in New Jersey, adding these new HPC resources will help NJIT continue to pursue national and international recognition in research and expand their influence within the innovation ecosystem.</p>
<p>Through their customized solutions and services, Edge can help boost cost savings and operational efficiency to member institutions like NJIT.

		<p>For many years, Edge has partnered with member institutions to help them develop technology strategies and find solutions that will assist in advancing their missions. As the wave of digital transformation continued to grow and new opportunities arrived, organizations were tasked with finding ways to keep pace in a rapidly changing world. Unfortunately, without the right information or expertise, many institutions have faced challenges in developing a strategic and cost-effective plan that will allow them to digitally evolve. “Oftentimes, institutions may be facing a lack of communication between technology systems or a lack of visibility into both business processes and data,” says Christopher R. Markham, Executive Vice President &amp; Chief Revenue Officer, Edge. They may also have uncertainty around their spend in technology; are their technology investments best matched for their institution’s goals, size, and capabilities? Edge can help reveal valuable insight into their current technology ecosystem and assess digital transformation readiness, along with ensuring that an organization can optimize their return on investment as they continue to grow their technology program.”</p>
<p>Designed to provide a 360-degree view, the Enterprise 360 (E360) Assessment is a comprehensive review of all things technology, where the EdgePro team examines an institution’s current-state technology program and digital footprint and helps pinpoint where they can optimize technology investments in software, equipment, and staff. “The ‘E’ in E360 means everything, so Edge will look at an organization’s IT strategy, operations, governance, economic approach, data, cyber infrastructure, cybersecurity capacity, and their entire technology stack,” explains Markham. “We also spend two days onsite to meet with stakeholders and team members to gain a deeper understanding of the technology program. After the assessment is completed, Edge will provide a detailed report of the areas within the current technology and cyber infrastructure to focus on immediately and then a road map for digital transformation going forward.”</p>
<p>Conducting a Holistic Assessment<br>
The E360 Assessment begins with an investigation of the vision of the institution and the current information technology and enterprise architecture that is in place to support these goals. “Edge will look at all of the key information technology disciplines; what we call reference disciplines,” explains Markham. “This includes groups like applications, cybersecurity, educational technologies, and service management. We then look at the vision of the whole group and how they’re being informed by the enterprise architecture. We investigate the technologies and business processes that gather requirements from the overall institutional groups and look for opportunities and solutions that could improve these processes.”</p>
<p>“Next, we determine what a migration plan might look like, an IT governance model, and how we would implement a governance group,” continues Markham. “We also want to determine how an organization can establish a permanent change management function once this governance group is implemented—allowing the institution to continue to grow and change as their needs evolve.”</p>
<p>As part of the E360 Assessment, Edge will also explore educational technologies and the pedagogical framework that are in place to support the overall technology strategy. “We look at the current instructional design and methodologies and conduct a detailed analysis of existing cyber infrastructure, including wireless connectivity and cloud migration strategy,” shares Markham. “Our chief information officer will conduct a cybersecurity assessment to examine the NSIT framework, as well as the Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS). This integrity assessment of an organization’s routing looks at the kind of controls and best practices that are in place to reduce routing threats.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Cybersecurity Program Assessment</p>
<p>Included in the E360 Assessment is a cybersecurity program assessment conducted by Edge’s Virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) to evaluate the maturity of the organization’s security program, understand their current risk exposure, and identify ways they can reduce the risk of a data breach.</p>
<p>An organization will receive tailored, actionable recommendations to:<br>
Identify gaps&nbsp; •&nbsp; Improve overall security posture&nbsp; •&nbsp; Reduce risk&nbsp; •&nbsp; Mitigate the impact of security incidents</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Providing Actionable Items<br>
Throughout the six- to eight-week process, the E360 is a blended model of onsite visits and virtual meetings to connect with all functional areas of the college or university. Upon completion of the assessment, along with a final report outlining its findings, an institution will also receive a review of their business process models and the technology solutions and services that aim to support them. “In addition to an executive summary that evaluates all the domains, we provide a customized three-year roadmap for digital transformation,” says Markham. “Edge will also outline ways to measure the return on investment along the digital transformation journey. We show you how to measure if there is an increase in efficiency and productivity of labor units. For example, improving the time it takes to send files or data, or increasing uptime and reducing downtime of systems. The assessment also provides ways to improve workflow and reduce the cost of operation. We see if there are ways to reduce the cost through economies of scale and if there are duplicate systems that can be consolidated.”</p>
<p>“Increased efficiency, improved services, and reduction in cost of operation—these are the key components in a net gain from IT investment,” continues Markham. “E360 is designed to provide a better understanding of an institution’s frameworks and methodologies and how to achieve an optimal return on investment. If you seek the data to make informed decisions, if you wish to calculate your return on investment of your IT infrastructure and systems, and if want to align technology and the academic and administrative mission and vision of your organization, then the E360 Assessment can provide the insight and direction that you need.”</p>

		<p>Providing students and educators with reliable, exceptional IT help desk support is becoming increasingly important in the higher education community. Around five years ago, Fairleigh Dickinson University (FDU) set out to find a new help desk service provider for their students, faculty, and staff after their previous provider since 2002 was sold to a new company — leading to degraded service and a dramatic increase in cost. “We were facing a six-figure increase with zero flexibility and degraded service, and I had no time to implement a new system,” explains Neal Sturm, Vice President, and Chief Information Officer, FDU. “I immediately went to Dan Miller at Edge and asked for assistance in building an RFP. We were looking for a long-term relationship with a provider who could offer high-quality support to our students, faculty, and staff. Once we were down to two companies in the RFP process, one being BlackBeltHelp, Edge introduced me to BlackBeltHelp’s leadership team, which was very helpful in making an informed decision.”</p>
<p>BlackBeltHelp is the top AI-powered Contact-Center-as-a-Service provider for students, faculty, and staff in higher education, and is one of the providers offered through EdgeMarket, Edge’s technology, software, and services purchasing co-op. EdgeMarket enables participants to work directly with vendors and accelerate purchasing via a validated contract mechanism. “In looking for a partner who offers superior help desk support, Edge collaborated closely with our members and EdgeMarket participants to craft and award an RFP,” says Dan Miller, Associate Vice President, EdgeMarket. “BlackBeltHelp’s reputation for excellence in 24×7 service for a wide range of applications makes them an ideal partner for EdgeMarket participants looking to lighten the help desk support load on internal teams. Working with them will enable IT staff to focus more on strategic, value-add initiatives, and less on transactional tasks like help desk tickets.”</p>
<p>Offering Seamless Support<br>
In 2022, FDU awarded 24×7 &amp; Blackboard® Help Desk Support RFP to BlackBeltHelp where users can receive support at all hours of the day. The University will also leverage the Simplify Platform to assist users with features such as simplify advisor, chatbot, SMS nudging, and self-help. “We wanted to find a company where the people will provide the same level of support as our own team members,” says Sturm. “The end users need to see the help desk team as if they are your own, not an outsourced company. We achieved this with BlackBeltHelp. They are our Tier 1 Help Desk and IT support and can help with proprietary applications, password changes, or any technology-related issues our users might encounter.”</p>
<p>BlackBeltHelp currently serves over 200 higher education clients, including Cornell University, UCLA, Pasadena City College, and Community College of Baltimore County. Help desk services provided by the organization have historically reduced average time-to-answer to less than 60 seconds, while reducing operational costs by up to 40%. Once the launch date was determined, Sturm says the BlackBeltHelp’s implementation team met with him and his team every single week to monitor progress, gain institutional knowledge, and understand the procedures necessary to ensure a seamless support experience for FDU users.</p>

		<p>“BlackBeltHelp is not a software solution, it’s a people solution,” says Sturm. “In our case, we used their ticketing system which was Salesforce based, for the first year. We are now using our system which is TopDesk, a full ITSM, and that connects to their Salesforce through an application developed by their team which they call Simplify. We selected a model of six U.S.-based dedicated team members, plus international-based shared resources for overflow and evening hours. This service is their core competency and they take care of the hiring, training, and management of the staff.”</p>
<p>For institutions considering outsourcing Tier 1 Help Desk functions, Sturm recommends partnering with Edge and EdgeMarket. “Work with the Edge team to develop, release, and review a comprehensive RFP that includes all the functions and tools you would like to see in use. As part of your due diligence, I would also recommend talking to references directly to better understand how their solutions and services can support your team and overall organization.”</p>

		<p>As the current Vice President for the New Jersey Council of County Colleges (NJCCC) and the Executive Director of the New Jersey Community College Consortium for Workforce and Economic Development, Catherine Frugé Starghill, Esq. has a solid history in workforce development. As a leader of the statewide coalition of partners for the New Jersey Pathways to Career Opportunities initiative, she aims to help build a stronger economy in the region by aligning education to the needs of the workforce community. “I began my career in workforce development in 2012 at the NJ Department of Labor and that is where I developed a passion for these types of initiatives,” says Starghill. “I experienced many roles, including the Director of Workforce Development, Executive Director of Workforce Development, and then later, Deputy Commissioner of the Department.”</p>
<p>Recognizing that one of the largest workforce development training providers is community colleges, Starghill says her current position allows her to be more effective in driving initiatives forward. “By being entrenched with the community colleges in the region, we have been more successful in ensuring that workforce development and the academic side of community colleges work together to help more New Jersey residents have access to college credit that can lead to a credential or degree attainment opportunity. The New Jersey Pathways to Career Opportunities is dedicated to building a talent ecosystem and creating roadmaps that align curriculum across educational partners that help students and workers become lifelong learners.”</p>
<p>Pathways for the Future Workforce<br>
The New Jersey Pathways to Career Opportunities Initiative in partnership with the New Jersey Business and Industry Association (NJBIA) has been very successful and has accumulated over 1,200 industry and education partners. “The NJBIA ensured we had the voice of industry guiding us and helped us make informed decisions,” says Starghill. “During the pandemic, we saw enrollments in all post-secondary education institutions plummet and resources were substantially reduced. This situation created an environment where many institutions that might not have collaborated in the past were now open to connecting and working more closely together.”</p>
<p>Aimed at creating workforce development pathways for the future workforce, the New Jersey Pathways to Career Opportunities program focuses on four key industries that drive the state’s economy: Health Services; Technology and Innovation; Infrastructure and Energy; and Manufacturing and Supply Chain Management. “There are ten Centers of Workforce Innovation that are each focused on an occupational area,” explains Starghill. “Within each area, we develop pathways and training from high school to community college to four-year colleges and universities, including labor unions, community-based training providers, and workforce development boards. We ultimately want to create on-ramps to opportunity.”</p>

		<p>Aligning Curriculum and Workforce Skills<br>
The initiative celebrated its one-year anniversary in April 2023 with notable accomplishments. “Across the ten Centers of Workforce Innovation, we have twenty high schools and vocational technical schools; nine four-year colleges and universities; eight labor unions; and four community-based training providers and education associations that engage in smaller work groups to connect and enhance the 22 pathways,” says Starghill. “We have multiple pilot programs currently running, like high school career awareness and contextualized adult literacy training. There are also four-year universities, including Rowan University, that participate in our Centers of Workforce Innovation and are reviewing their curriculum and courses. Rowan is building a couple of bachelor’s degree programs in conjunction with community colleges to ensure all credits transfer to the major curriculum courses. This will help maximize transferability of community college credits for the students. We owe this to our New Jersey residents, so their investment and effort result in the maximum credit and degree attainment possible.”</p>
<p>Starghill says having multiple pathways is essential, especially since everyone’s life situation is different. “An individual’s education and training pathway is not linear. Life happens — you get married, have children, or have to take time off to care for a sick parent. We must create multiple on-ramps and off-ramps to make things easier for individuals to return to their education and training pathway.”</p>
<p>Empowering Community College Students<br>
As organizations like NJCCC and the New Jersey Community College Consortium for Workforce and Economic Development continue to better align community college courses to four-year colleges and universities, Starghill says they look to expand their network and make connections with partners like Edge and NJ Transfer to further support these pathways. “We need to better align community college courses to four-year colleges and universities. Through our ongoing&nbsp; meetings and discussions with education and workforce partners, we find many four-year institutions are surprised by how advanced community college students are in only two years. Typically, a student in community college spends the first year taking general education courses and then enters into their major during their second year. We’re seeing many students at the community colleges are actually more advanced by year two than their counterparts at a four-year university.”</p>
<p>“Our employer partners in technology and innovation, for example, are also amazed by this trend and have said during panels that they are changing their perspective to focus more on community college students,” continues Starghill. “Companies like Microsoft and Google have noted that rising juniors from four-year colleges and universities often have not had any IT courses yet, but many community college students are further along. We look forward to exploring more of these insights and finding ways to strengthen partnerships between the education and business community. We will continue to help our partners align curriculum with the future – forward skills and credentials that are in demand within New Jersey’s key industries.”</p>

<p><a href="https://us3r.co/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">US3R Network</a> is a revolutionary development platform and dApps ecosystem that empowers developers to build with composable data using Ceramic. It offers an integrated suite of toolkits including <a href="https://u3.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">US3R dApps Profile</a>, <a href="https://s3.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">US3R Data Explorer</a> and <a href="https://console.s3.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">US3R dApps Developer Console</a>—enabling developers to harness the power of Ceramic's dynamic and composable data layer for decentralized storage. By leveraging Ceramic, US3R Network enables the easy creation of applications with interoperable and composable data that lives on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).</p> The Story of US3R Network <p>The current state of the web is centralized and controlled by a few large companies. These companies have a monopoly on our data and our identities. They can use our data to track us, target us with ads, and even sell our data to third parties. The current state of the web is not interoperable because user data remains in silos, we’re unable to share our data and interact with each other across different platforms.</p><p>US3R leverages the network effect, a principle that the team says is often exploited by applications such as Google and Facebook through user accounts or logins. These Web2 applications harness the network effect to attract users and extract value from their interactions.</p><p>However, unlike these traditional models, US3R Network incorporates Web3 protocols, which offer users more control by virtue of their accounts being keypairs that the users themselves control. Despite the added control, Web3 protocols also necessitate a different infrastructure to support UI/UX at the protocol layer. This allows users to interact with the protocol via a universal third-party client, removing the reliance on the official dApps. The US3R Network fulfills this need for offchain data, taking inspiration from tools like Metamask and Etherscan.</p><p>US3R Network created U3, a platform-less utility tool designed specifically for managing self-sovereign data and applications. This opens up a new avenue of possibilities, allowing users to gain control over their data. Additionally, US3R Network offers S3, a development platform that enables developers to build dApps utilizing self-sovereign data. This combined suite of tools and platforms makes US3R Network an innovative solution for users and developers alike to gain control of their data and identities.</p><p>US3R Network is built on three core components:</p>  U3 is a decentralized identity wallet that allows users to store their data and credentials on the blockchain. U3 is interoperable with other blockchains, so users can take their data with them wherever they go. U3 is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the EIP-4337 standard for decentralized identities.  S3 is a decentralized data layer that makes it easy to share and manage data across different applications. S3 is built on Ceramic, a scalable and secure data storage platform.  3R is a decentralized social layer that allows users to connect with friends and colleagues across different social networks. 3R is built on ActivityPub, an open protocol for federated social networking. ActivityPub allows users to own their data and control how it is shared.  <p>US3R Network is still under development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the web. By giving users control of their data and identities, US3R Network can make the web more interoperable, and user-centric.</p> How US3R Network Built With Ceramic <p>“The scope of Web3 was primarily focused on DeFi, with little room for non-financial applications,” the US3R team says. “It was a limiting factor, hindering 99% of non-financial use cases from being developed. Ceramic, however, brings about a paradigm shift, enabling the development of applications that extend beyond finance.”</p><p>Before adopting Ceramic, US3R S3 faced the challenge of supporting interactive dApps with dynamic and structured data. Traditional blockchains and storage solutions like IPFS, Arweave, and BNB GreedField were either too slow or lacked support for structured and dynamic data. Recognizing the need for a more powerful data infrastructure, US3R Network sought a solution that would enable them to build decentralized applications without sacrificing interoperability.</p><p>The decision to partner with Ceramic was driven by the recognition of Ceramic's innovative approach to data storage and its strong alignment with US3R Network's goals, the team says. Ceramic's ability to support mutable data and composable data stood out as a game-changer for US3R Network's development ecosystem. By leveraging Ceramic's technology and toolkits, US3R Network could offer developers the flexibility and capabilities required to build purely decentralized and interoperable dApps.</p><p>Integrating Ceramic into their development platform and ecosystem S3, US3R Network unlocked a new realm of possibilities. The seamless integration of S3 Data Explorer, and S3 Developer Console empowered developers to interact with mutable data and leverage composable data structures. These features provided developers with the necessary tools to efficiently build interactive dApps with dynamic and structured data.</p><p>S3 Data Explorer is crucial for the interoperability and composability of decentralized data on Ceramic because it provides a way to understand the structure and semantics of data. This is essential for building applications that can use data from different sources and combine it in new ways. More specifically, S3 Data Explorer can be used to:</p><p>Discover data. Data and data model explorers can be used to discover data that is available on the Ceramic network. This can be helpful for developers who are looking for data to use in their applications.</p><p>Understand the structure of data. Data and data model explorers can be used to understand the structure of data. This can be helpful for developers who want to know how to use data in their applications.</p><p>Learn about the semantics of data. Data and data model explorers can be used to learn about the semantics of data. This can be helpful for developers who want to know what data means.</p><p>S3 Developer Console is another important building block created by US3R. A visual developer Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a game-changer when it comes to improving the developer experience. With the ability to visualize data models, developers can comprehend and manipulate data structures more intuitively, enhancing their understanding and productivity. An embedded GraphQL query playground offers an interactive platform to readily test and debug existing models, simplifying the development process. These combined features facilitate the creation of applications built on decentralized data.</p><p>By enabling a seamless and efficient developmental process, a visual IDE significantly encourages the growth of a dApp ecosystem, where users have full control over their data. This control not only fosters trust in the digital landscape but also opens up opportunities for innovative applications that respect user autonomy and privacy.</p> The Results <p>Integrating with Ceramic yields significant results for US3R Network. Here are two key success metrics that demonstrate the impact of Ceramic on their development ecosystem:</p> Increased Development Efficiency <p>Before Ceramic, developers within the US3R Network ecosystem faced challenges when working with dynamic and structured data. The integration of Ceramic's technology simplified the development process and improved efficiency. Developers are able to leverage Ceramic's data model marketplace, IDE for editing and deploying data models, and powerful querying capabilities, resulting in a substantial reduction in development time and effort. The streamlined workflow and comprehensive toolkits provided by Ceramic empower developers to focus on building innovative dApps.</p> Enhanced Interoperability <p>Interoperability is a critical aspect of decentralized applications, allowing users and applications to seamlessly interact and share data across different platforms. With Ceramic as a foundational layer, US3R Network achieves enhanced interoperability within its ecosystem. By leveraging Ceramic's dynamic and composable data layer, developers are able to create applications that seamlessly communicate and share data with other applications and protocols. This interoperability opens up new possibilities for collaborative and integrated user experiences, enabling the development of truly decentralized and interconnected applications. One such instance is <a href="https://cips.ceramic.network/CIPs/cip-142?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CIP-142</a>, an interoperable and composable data model for social links aggregators, co-authored by US3R and <a href="https://www.chainfeeds.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ChainFeeds</a>.</p> Join the Paradigm Shift! <p>Are you a developer or strategic partner looking to unlock the full potential of decentralized storage and data interoperability?

<p>Our Light Touch Support programme has been busy! In the second quarter of this year (April, May, June), we worked with 29 partners from 13 different countries. This post looks at some of the challenges organisations came to us with during this period, and what resources, tips and recommendations we offered them. (For further reading, you can find our reflections on the first quarter of 2023 <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/starting-data-journeys-staying-safe-on-comms-tools-support-trends-from-2023-so-far/" title="">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is our Light-Touch Support Programme?&nbsp;Our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">Light Touch Support</a> (LiTS) programme offers lightweight, no-fee support to organisations and individuals who come to us with questions about using data or technology in their social justice work. In each LiTS partnership, our goal is to help our partners clarify their vision and identify next steps, in order to move forward independently. Learn more <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">here</a>.</p>



<p>Our 29 LiTS partners we supported in the second quarter of 2023 were based in 13 different countries, including&nbsp;Argentina, Brazil, Congo (DRC), Costa Rica, Haiti, Kenya, Mexico, Uganda, United Kingdom, United States and Zambia. They ranged from established nonprofits to community based organisations and collectives, working on issues such as transparency and accountability, human rights, environmental justice and health.</p>



<p>At the beginning of June we also especially invited Black feminist organisers to reach out to our LiTS programme. Since we launched this call-out we have connected with organisations led by Black women in Brazil, the US and Costa Rica doing incredible work to advance racial justice in their countries (if you are interested, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/calling-all-black-feminist-organizations-for-no-fee-tech-and-data-support/" title="">learn more about this opportunity here</a>!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below are some of the challenges our LiTS partners have been grappling with. In the hopes that this post might be useful to groups facing similar issues, we’ve also included some of the tips and resources that we find can help in confronting these challenges.&nbsp;</p>



 1. Documentation and comms&nbsp; 



<p>Many of the organisations and collectives who joined LiTS via our proactive support offer to Black feminist organisations are doing work that is incredibly impactful, tending to urgent needs from their communities and defending Black women’s rights in their countries, and doing so with extremely limited funding.</p>



<p>The huge amount of work required, combined with pressing needs and limited resources, often means that these organisations don’t have enough time and resources to document the work they’re doing and to communicate it to their audiences in the way that they would like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve been working with these partners to collectively think of strategies to tackle this challenge by strengthening existing (and creating new!) tech and data processes for documenting their work. Here are some of the main tips/considerations we share with partners:</p>



 
 GET SPECIFIC: One good place to start can be thinking in more detail about what our partners&nbsp;want to keep track of (and why!). Depending on the work, the activities and milestones an organisation might want to document may vary. For instance, for some organisations it can be important to keep track of how many people attend events they’re hosting; for other groups, it can be relevant to know how many people are reading and/or sharing the resources they’re publishing online; others may want to keep a record of the ways people are using the services they offer. 
 
 Some questions that can help with this process include:&nbsp;
 
 What data is essential about the organisations’ work?&nbsp; 



 Years from now, when we’re telling the story of our work, what will we want to remember?&nbsp; 



 What do our funders and supporters ask about?&nbsp; 



 What is important for our community to know about us/our work?<br> 
 
 
 
 



 START SMALL &amp; KEEP THINGS ACCESSIBLE: Improving internal documentation isn’t something that happens overnight (and dedicating resources or people to documentation can also be difficult for under-resourced organisations). With our partners, we talk about the value of starting small, making it easy for team members to contribute, and building up a practice of documentation incrementally.
 
 There are some practical (and relatively simple) actions that can help teams get started, including:
 
 For some teams, it can be useful to have a dedicated space to informally keep track of the impact or results from their work! It can be a slack or mattermost channel, a specific group chat, or an online pad/document where the team documents comments they receive via email, at events or on social media, for example. At The Engine Room, for instance, we have our own channel on Mattermost where team members share #tinyvictories from our work! 



 Creating&nbsp;templates and/or surveys can make it easier for team members to document more about their work, for instance, by sharing short, concise surveys on Slack or Mattermost, or through forms in Google or in Nextcloud.<br> 
 
 
 
 



 INTERNAL RETROSPECTIVES: Not waiting too long to look back and document the work orgs have been doing can also be a good move! At The Engine Room, every six months our team members complete a short survey asking them to share the highlights of their semester, a practice that helps us with building our annual report at the end of each year. We also do project retrospectives whenever we wrap up a project, which help us look back at the work we did and make sure learnings and impact go into our records. Other practices teams can explore include things like hosting “retrospective meetings” periodically, where teams go over recent activities together, document impact generated and identify any learnings or opportunities they want to share with their audiences.&nbsp; 
 



 2. Bringing responsible data to research or advocacy efforts 



<p>We worked with quite a few partners working on different social justice issues who have identified significant gaps in data about the communities they were working with or about the issues they advocate for: from a lack of data about Black women’s experiences with the health system in certain Latin American countries to the non-existence of user friendly ways to find data about access to education in a Caribbean country.</p>



<p>One of the common challenges our partners have dealt with after deciding that they wanted to produce data themselves is not knowing how to start a research project or data collection project – and, relatedly, how to design a project responsibly. Here are some of our tips:</p>



 
 START BACKWARDS: An idea we often share is that before embarking on a research project or on a data collection initiative, it’s good for teams to collectively imagine and align on what they want the finished product to look like, and what outcomes they expect from it. This can lead to visualising the question they want answered or the data that would most support their work. Essentially, this is about getting specific about the issues organisations are working on and exploring how data can help them reach their goals.&nbsp; 



 START SMALL: Organisations – especially grassroots organisations or informal collectives – can start by collecting data on just one issue, or by answering just one question. This can help organisations to be agile and test out whether an issue or a finding is useful for their work, and it can also be responsible (the less data we collect, the less data we have to keep safe!).&nbsp; 



 THINK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES: Another important step is considering how the people organisations are working with might be impacted (positively and negatively) by data that is collected. This reflection can impact tool selection, methodology, and choices around how data is shared. We have tons of resources on <a href="http://responsibledata.io" title="">responsible data</a> to support organisations in this process: make sure to check our tips on <a href="https://www.im-portal.org/blogs/how-to-start-your-responsible-data-journey">how to start your </a><a href="https://www.im-portal.org/blogs/how-to-start-your-responsible-data-journey" title="">responsible</a><a href="https://www.im-portal.org/blogs/how-to-start-your-responsible-data-journey"> data journey</a> and our resource <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/#:~:text=The%20process%20of%20becoming%20RAD,a%20life%20cycle%20of%20usefulness." title="">Becoming RAD!</a>, for guidance on how to create a responsible process for retaining, archiving and deleting data. 
 



<p>For those interested in learning more, the <a href="https://the-engine-room.github.io/responsible-data-handbook/chapters/chapter-01-designing-a-project.html" title="">first chapter of the Responsible Data Handbook</a> goes deeper into the process of designing responsible projects – we highly recommend taking a look!</p>



 3. Ensuring digital resilience through practices based on care and security&nbsp; 



<p>Another big area of support this past quarter was <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-do-we-think-about-when-we-think-about-digital-resilience/" title="">digital resilience</a>! We worked with partners to support their ability as an organisation to protect themselves from – and respond to – digital security threats to ensure the wellbeing of its members/individuals, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to the ever-changing needs and contexts of the organisation and its members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During each of our LiTS partnerships, we develop a set of tailored recommendations to address the specific challenges our partners are facing. Here are some of the resources that we’ve been sharing with partners lately (and that other organisations may also be interested in!):</p>



 
 <a href="https://pratododia.org/" title="">Prato do dia</a>: an initiative from Transfeminist Digital Care Network inviting everyone to reflect on issues of digital care and providing alternatives for people to adopt healthier tech practices. Available in Portuguese, English and Spanish.&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://internews.org/blog/internews-lanza-curso-de-seguridad-digital-para-defensores-de-derechos-humanos-y-del-medio-ambiente/" title="">Internews’ new digital security course</a> for human rights and climate/environmental defenders in Spanish. 



 FRIDA Young Feminist Fund’s new <a href="https://youngfeministfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Young-Feminist-Leadership-Toolkit-English.pdf" title="">Young Feminist Leadership Toolkit</a> for organisers from West, East, Southern and Central Africa who are working for radical systemic change for LGBTQI+ people. It includes a chapter focused on digital security. 



 <a href="https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/cyberpeace-builders/" title="">CyberPeace Builders’</a> offer of <a href="https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/hcc-ngos/" title="">free digital security support</a> to humanitarian and development NGOs to prepare for, defend against and recover from cyberattacks.&nbsp;

<p>We are delighted to announce the joint publication of “<a href="https://openid.net/GAIN-in-2023">GAIN in 2023</a>” which is a collaboration between&nbsp; six organizations who continue to pursue the vision of interoperable high trust identity networks, as articulated in the “<a href="https://gainforum.org/GAINWhitePaper.pdf">GAIN Digital Trust</a>” paper, published in 2021 by 156 independent identity industry experts and stakeholders.</p>
<p>The paper explores all the ways in which the GAIN (Global Assured Identity Network) vision remains relevant in today’s fast-moving landscape – as well as the ways in which technology heightens the stakes. It then reviews the major areas of progress in the proofs-of-concept that are related to the GAIN collaboration:</p>
 
 The cross-border transfer of data that the GAIN Proof of Concept Community Group has achieved: they tested data and trust management protocols, including a demonstration that a government, a bank network and a mobile network can all share identity data across three separate countries.&nbsp; 
 The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation has also made meaningful progress on developing high-trust organizational identities and addressing use cases beyond financial services.&nbsp; 
 The Open Identity Exchange is architecting how trust can be exchanged across countries at the policy-level, and is working diligently through the mapping of trust frameworks in numerous jurisdictions within the Interoperability Working Group. 
 
<p><br>In addition to the OIDF, GLEIF and OIX contributions, we are also delighted to benefit from the thought leadership of the International Institute of Finance, the Cloud Signature Consortium, the Secure Identity Alliance. Together we have over 50 companies and numerous individuals helping to realize the GAIN vision.</p>
<p>We will share more on the final outcomes and recommendations at events throughout 2023-24 and look forward to further collaboration with the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about the technical work of GAIN or to sign the Participation Agreement to join the GAIN POC Community Group, click <a href="https://openid.net/cg/gain-poc/">here</a>. To learn more about trust framework mapping, join the Open Identity Exchange Interoperability Working Group <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/workgroups?action=view&amp;Workgroup=884">here</a>.&nbsp; Other non-profits are welcome to join the initiative by contacting <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a> for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenID Foundation</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate. Find out more at<a href="http://www.openid.net/"> openid.net</a>.</p>

 <br>By Jan Lindquist, Christoph L. Fabianek and Sebastian Haas<br> <p></p><p>Introduction</p><p>In the era of digital transformation, data has become the lifeblood of businesses, especially in the realm of supply chain management. The ability to share and exchange data seamlessly across different organisations and systems is crucial for operational efficiency, cost reduction, and customer satisfaction. This is where data agreements come into play. Data agreements are essentially contracts that define the terms and conditions for data sharing between different entities from a source to a third-party. They set the usage policies for data access, ensuring that all parties involved adhere to the agreed-upon rules and regulations.<br></p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) has established a task force referred to as the "<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/data-agreement?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Data Agreement</a>". This group is actively developing a specification that delineates the structure of data agreements. DIF's data agreements are rooted in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) principles, and incorporate the recording of consent notices. However, as this post will expound, such an arrangement can be effectively applied across a wide array of supply chain management domains, including but not limited to agriculture, energy, and transportation.</p><p>Domain Specific Data Agreements</p><p>To facilitate data sharing in a more structured and well defined way a vocabulary or ontology is needed. To achieve this a Domain Specific Data Agreements (D2A) is used. Such agreements allow organisations to communicate through an intermediary the allowed usage policies for data access within a specific domain. The intermediary has then all the information to match and validate the usage policy in order to create a Domain Specific Data Disclosure Agreement (D3A).<br></p><p>The following diagram shows a parallel example between domain-specific data agreements and privacy based data agreements. A further explanation of privacy based data agreements can be found in this “<a href="https://igrant.io/papers/iGrant.io_DataExchangeAgreements_v2.2.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Data Exchange Agreements</a>” white paper from iGrant.io.</p><p>Agreement VC</p><p>One of the key technologies enabling data agreements are Verifiable Credentials (VCs). VCs are digital representations of information that a verifier might require, such as the age or the citizenship of an individual. In the context of data agreements, a VC could be created to represent the agreement itself.

For instance, a manufacturer needs to share production data with a distributor, who in turn needs to share inventory data with a retailer. By leveraging DIDs, VCs, SOyA, and Domain Specific Data Agreements, this data exchange can be automated, secure, and efficient. It allows for better coordination, communication, and performance tracking across the supply chain, ultimately leading to improved efficiency, reduced costs, and increased customer satisfaction. The figure below shows the detailed data exchange between Organisation A and B.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In conclusion, data agreements are revolutionizing supply chain management by enabling secure, efficient, and automated data exchange. By leveraging technologies like DIDs, VCs, and SOyA, and implementing Domain Specific Data Agreements, organisations can reap the benefits of digital transformation in supply chain management. As we move forward, we can expect to see more innovative use cases and applications of these technologies in the realm of supply chain management.<br></p><p>This blog post was created in the course of the <a href="https://www.ownyourdata.eu/en/babelfish/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Babelfish project</a>.

<p>This excellent <a href="https://www.ieai.sot.tum.de/research-brief-on-protecting-and-realizing-human-rights-april-2023-out-now/">research brief</a> from the <a href="https://www.ieai.sot.tum.de/">Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence</a> (IEAI) focuses on a salient issue that we should all be concerned about: the integration of human rights into the AI ethic discourse. I believe that by adopting open standards, AI developers can ensure that their systems are built on principles that promote respect for human rights in developing and deploying AI systems.</p>



<p>Open standards can help to promote transparency by ensuring that the algorithms used in AI systems are open to scrutiny and review by independent experts. This can help identify and address any biases or discriminatory impacts the system may have.</p>



<p>In addition, open standards can also help promote accountability by providing clear guidelines and standards for AI’s ethical development and use. This can help to ensure that AI systems are designed and used in ways that are consistent with human rights principles.</p>



<p>Finally, open standards can help promote non-discrimination by ensuring that AI systems are consistent with international human rights standards, treating all individuals fairly and equitably, regardless of their race, gender, or other personal characteristics.</p>

<p>As we move into a future marked by unprecedented digital innovations, it’s natural to look towards Silicon Valley for the next big thing. Yet, sometimes it’s the simplest of ideas, from the most unexpected places, that can upset the established order. One such contender is Lions Gate Digital, a seemingly modest concept that could significantly disrupt the Silicon Valley tech giants.</p>



 The Power of Simplicity 



<p>Lions Gate Digital is a testament to the power of simplicity. While Silicon Valley giants invest in complex solutions and sophisticated technologies, Lions Gate Digital has taken a different approach, focusing on an easily understandable, yet powerfully effective concept. In a world growing weary of convoluted tech jargon and intricate systems, this simplicity offers a breath of fresh air.</p>



 User-Centric Approach 



<p>Lions Gate Digital also centers its approach around the user, ensuring its solution is not just simple, but also user-friendly and effective. Many tech giants have been criticized for becoming too detached from their user base, prioritizing technical advancements over user experience. This provides an opportunity for Lions Gate Digital to resonate with users, offering them solutions designed with their needs and experiences at the forefront.</p>



 The Advantage of Being Nimble 



<p>Large tech corporations are often compared to massive ships that take a long time to turn. They can be slow to react to changing market trends and customer needs due to their sheer size and bureaucracy. Conversely, smaller, more agile companies like Lions Gate Digital can adapt quickly to changes and pivot their strategy as necessary. This agility allows them to stay ahead of market trends and meet evolving consumer demands more effectively.</p>



 Leveraging Open Source 



<p>Silicon Valley giants have long capitalized on proprietary technology and platforms to maintain their market dominance. Lions Gate Digital, however, leverages the power of open source technology, allowing it to tap into a global community of developers and innovators. This approach not only speeds up innovation but also fosters a sense of community and collaboration that proprietary systems often lack.</p>



 Data Privacy and Security 



<p>In an era where data privacy and security have become significant concerns, the trust between companies and their users is more important than ever. Some Silicon Valley giants have faced criticism for their handling of user data, offering Lions Gate Digital an opportunity to differentiate itself. By prioritizing user privacy and security, Lions Gate Digital can build trust and loyalty among users, critical factors for success in today’s digital landscape.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>While it’s easy to assume that the next big digital innovation will come from a well-known Silicon Valley titan, it’s essential not to underestimate the power of simplicity, user-centric design, agility, open-source innovation, and a strong focus on data privacy. These are the factors that position Lions Gate Digital as a potential disruptor in the digital space, ready to challenge the dominance of established tech giants. Only time will tell whether this David can overcome the Goliath’s of Silicon Valley, but one thing is certain: the battle will be one to watch.</p>

<p>30-day public review ends August 17th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC are pleased to announce that OData Extension for Data Aggregation Version 4.0 is now available for public review and comment. This specification draft has been extensively revised since its previous publication in 2015.</p>



<p>This specification adds basic grouping and aggregation functionality (e.g. sum, min, and max) to the Open Data Protocol (OData) without changing any of the base principles of OData.</p>



<p>The documents and related files are available here:</p>

             <p>In the Netherlands, suppliers of medical devices and hospitals have joined together to try to standardise and automate the exchange of product information. A uniform dataset has been established in consultation with suppliers, healthcare institutions, and other stakeholders. It has been agreed that data on medical devices, including relevant certification documentation, will be shared through the Global Data Synchronisation Network (GDSN). Since February 2023, the dataset is fully integrated within the network and datamodel.</p>

  In the future, as evidenced by advancing industry standards (e.g., DIDs, 
VCs) and new regulations (e.g., eIDAS), nearly every road to individual 
commercial, civic, and personal engagement will invariably flow through 
mobile wallets. Do you know what it means to serve the connected individual

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>On 23 June the Australian government released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/criminal-justice/files/national-strategy-for-identity-resilience.pdf">National Strategy for Identity Resilience</a>&nbsp;which consists of ten principles to guide digital identity resilience, setting a precedent for how New Zealand’s own digital identity rules could be developed under the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Act. For example, it mentions a seamless Commonwealth, state and territory digital ID system, inclusive digital identification systems and, where appropriate and with an individual’s consent, Australian governments will use biometrics to make it harder for criminals to misuse identity credentials.</p>



<p>This Strategy also includes immediate, medium, and long term initiatives that aim to strengthen digital identification security arrangements across jurisdictions. These initiatives will be coordinated by the Department of Home Affairs, with close collaboration across the federal, state, and territory-levels of government. Compared to New Zealand, Australia’s extra legislative and regulatory layers of government mean that for such a plan and initiatives to be agreed to and in such a short timeframe, this is a positive sign of the importance for which the Australian government is signalling their priorities. These priorities we also see mirrored by the New Zealand government in the areas around identity, security and privacy which you will often hear talked about together frequently as they are interconnected when it comes to safe, reliable and secure interactions online.</p>



<p>I would recommend DINZ Members and friends have a read as we learn about what our neighbours across the ditch are doing as New Zealand’s own digital identity rules are developed. Tell DINZ what you think about it by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">info@digitalidentity.nz.</a></p>

<p>Many industry pros are increasingly channeling their inner&nbsp;Bill Gates in 2004&nbsp;and predicting the decline of the password. The PW prognosticating demonstrates some confidence in the IT world that a&nbsp;passwordless infrastructure&nbsp;is now sufficiently in place. “The most notable shift over the past couple of years has been that every major platform vendor is now supporting open standards for passwordless authentication that are in their flagship operating systems. So, this means for the first time that virtually every modern computing device has the capability to support passwordless authentication,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and chief marketing officer at FIDO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Passkeys promise a future without passwords, where we access our accounts as easily as we unlock our phones, with a much higher level of security. “It’s the closest to something that can be scaled to get rid of passwords that we’ve ever seen,” said Megan Shamas, senior director of marketing at industry association FIDO Alliance. A passkey is a digital authentication credential that is securely stored on your device. Instead of what Shamas called a “shared secret” method of passwords, passkeys are a unique key pair for every online service you use bound to the domain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce two significant developments to Ceramic that will improve efficiency and reliability of the network. These developments do not require any changes or upgrades to applications built on Ceramic.</p><p>We’ve introduced a new anchor status called REPLACED and the implementation of a more reliable method of communication between a Ceramic node and the anchoring service. Let's dive deeper into these exciting advancements.</p> REPLACED Status <p>Imagine a Ceramic user who creates a stream commit A, only to realize later that a more recent commit B supersedes it. Previously, the anchor request status for commit A would be marked as FAILED, causing unnecessary resource consumption on Ceramic nodes. However, with the introduction of the REPLACED status, we now have the ability to infer the status of commit A immediately after commit B's submission.</p><p>The new REPLACED status is not only more logically sound but also reduces the amount of resources Ceramic nodes need while waiting for a commit to anchor. This is a significant step toward optimizing the operation of the Ceramic network.</p> CAR Files for CAS Responses <p>An anchor commit acts as a reference to a previous commit in a Ceramic stream and an Ethereum transaction. In the past, when CAS (Ceramic Anchor Service) created an anchor, it relied heavily on IPFS to obtain the anchor commit and parts of a merkle tree. However, we recognized that this approach had its limitations.</p><p>To address this issue, CAS now responds with a CAR (Content Addressable aRchive) file instead of just sending the CID of an anchor commit. These CAR files contain the full anchor commit and all the necessary IPLD records in a single package. By eliminating the reliance on IPFS transport, we aim to eliminate any potential bottlenecks and enhance the overall reliability of the Ceramic network.</p><p>It is important to note that this particular feature has been rolled out in a fully backwards-compatible manner, ensuring that a Ceramic node upgrade is not mandatory. However, we strongly encourage all users to upgrade their Ceramic nodes to take advantage of the improved reliability offered by CAR files.</p> Conclusion <p>We are continuously working to optimize the performance and reliability of Ceramic. The introduction of the REPLACED status and the implementation of CAR files for Ceramic-CAS communication mark significant milestones in this journey. With these updates, we aim to enhance the efficiency of Ceramic nodes and provide a more reliable experience for our partners and their users.</p><p>Let us know your feedback on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">forum</a>! </p>

  What is the purpose of the four LSPs (EWC, DC4EU, Potential and Nobid)? The IDunion Comms Team has conducted an interview with Steffen Schwalm, msg, on this subject.
   
  
  
  
  
  

</div>
<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Four large scale pilots have been initiated under the EU’s Digital Europe research and innovation programme: The European Wallet Consortium (EWC), DC4EU, Potential and Nobid. Their aim is to test the EU DigitalWallet (EUDIW) and the other components in the eIDAS 2.0 ecosystem and pilot them in practical application across Europe. On this subject the IDunion communications team conducted an interview with Steffen Schwalm, Principal Consultant | Senior Manager Digital Identity &amp; Trust, msg.</p>



<p>What is the role of the Large Scale Pilots?</p>



<p>Their role can be illustrated quite well as a triangular structure: on one side of the triangle is the EU Commission, which is responsible for the regulation, and the eIDAS toolbox, which is used by the EU member states for establishing the technical framework of the EU digital wallet.</p>



<p>Below that we have the reference implementation for the European Wallet, and finally at the other end of the triangle we have the Large Scale Pilots (LSPs).</p>



<p>The idea behind this is to not just adopt regulations and standards where any malfunctions only become apparent during the implementation phase, but to combine regulations and technical specifications with immediate practical implementation.</p>



<p>This is precisely what the LSPs are all about: to provide direct feedback to all regulatory processes with concrete practical results, and to test all technical specifications in practical applications in order to find out what works and what does not. All this is happening in close cooperation with the EU Commission, the eIDAS toolbox and the reference implementation in order to create valid regulatory and technical foundations.</p>



<p>For example, issuing personal identification is not clearly described in the EU Architecture and Reference Framework <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">ARF</a>. Let us assume that there are five different opinions on this across four LSPs, so this is a clear indication to specify this more precisely.</p>



<p>So on the one hand we have a reference implementation that takes on specifications and explores their feasibility, and on the other hand we have the LSPs, which in turn examine the reference implementation in various use cases to check what practically works or needs to be adapted.</p>



<p>So it is much more than just establishing the rules and regulations plus a few technical standards, it is testing everything in time and creating practicality, thus avoiding any mistakes that were made with eIDAS 1.0.</p>



<p>Are all LSPs similar and do they have the same structure?</p>



<p>Yes, there is the basic rule for all of them that a LSP is always formally led by one or more EU member states. The companies are affiliated to them. </p>



<p>EWC is led by Sweden and Finland, DC4EU by Spain, Potential by France and Germany and for Nobid it is Norway and the Baltic States. The duration of all LSPs is two years – the start was on April 1, 2023.</p>



<p>Which of the four LSPs have the biggest opportunities?</p>



<p>All four LSPs have different focuses, so they are not directly comparable with each other. Also, I do not want to give an evaluation because our company msg is involved in the EWC.  In any case, Potential is very strongly focused on non-DLT and deals with a wide range of use cases, from bank account opening to e-prescription to e-government. DC4EU focuses on diploma and social security passport. Nobid focuses purely on non-DLT and payment. EWC’s activities are focusing on organisational ID, payment transactions and use cases in the area of travel, while taking a dual approach, i.e. non-DLT and DLT. </p>



<p>That said, no consortium is more important than the other, they rather need each other.</p>



<p>This brings us to our next question: to what extent do you think the Commission sees room for other DLT-based solutions besides <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home">EBSI</a>, such as Hyperledger-Indy or Aries.</p>



<p>This is a good question given the current situation, in light of the fact that the ARF is actually technology-agnostic. On the other hand, the EU is explicitly funding an EBSI project to develop Digital Wallet solutions based on the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure. Since each consortium has to establish interoperability with the other consortia in order to enable mutual cooperation as intended by the EU Commission – all of them definitely have to establish interoperability between DLT and legacy (non-DLT) solutions. The focus of DLT is certainly on EBSI, due to existing EU funding and goals. </p>



<p>What is the motivation of the multitude of companies involved within the four LSPs, because given the large number, the funding amount for each individual organisation is rather small.</p>



<p>Whoever is now participating in the LSPs, even if only as an associated partner, is directly involved in the development of the European digital identity for the next ten to fifteen years. And if eIDAS 2.0 remains as it is currently planned, it makes great sense for both the technology providers and the relying parties to participate. At the end of the day, all companies involved in critical infrastructure services will have to adopt this solution, as well as the whole banking and healthcare sector, as well as the GAFA. Which means a major part of the industry. All companies involved in the LSPs can help shape the technology from the beginning, steer it in the right direction and develop their own business models from it.</p>



<p>In what way is IDunion represented in the EWC consortium?</p>



<p>IDunion is indirectly involved in the <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/about-us/members/">EWC</a> through the participation of many consortium partners and associated partners.</p>



<p>Thank you very much for the interview, Steffen.</p>



<p> You’re very welcome!</p>



<p>The interview was conducted by Benjamin Burde and Kordula Kiefer-Kempf from esatus AG.</p>

  <p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought humanity to a critical juncture. The recent international conference, AI for Good, organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), underscored the situation's urgency. Our society stands at a tipping point where the potential of AI could either accelerate progress towards the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or drive us towards an uncertain societal future. The ITU secretary general and other senior speakers asked for a global call for action.</p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>Such a call for action also comes from other initiatives around the globe. Here are a few examples. Calls for European Health Data Space digitally connecting healthcare practitioners while protecting patients' rights, development of national digital Identities including biometrics, advancing precision medicine and the use of genomic data, strengthening Internet of Things (IoT) governance for more efficient supply chains and many others. All these examples share a common governance requirement: regulating algorithmic decision-making.</p><p>Prioritizing the development of governance models for the deployment of AI is our immediately actionable, best hope for developing an AI that serves as a force for good. The task is complex and far-reaching. Everyone must coherently feed policymakers pertinent information to establish the right governance framework.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the existing multi-stakeholder framework of the SDGs offers a stage to structure the flow of concerns and the experience gained from projects impacting society through digital tooling.</p><p>Data fuel AI. As a result, data is also a promising avenue of progress for governance. To do so, we need to reshape our approach to data. By reimagining our relationship with data and promoting responsible data usage, we can simplify the regulation of AI deployment, leading us towards a sustainable and inclusive society.</p><p>Rethinking our relation to data and building the tools to make it happen is part of the mission of the Human Colossus Foundation. We promote data-centric architecture for the common good. As our contribution to the calls for action, this blog post introduces a series of upcoming publications and activities that link data governance to technological architectures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> AI &amp; SDG <p>Will Artificial Intelligence accelerate United Nations Sustainable Developments Goals ?&nbsp;</p><p>The SDGs represent a comprehensive roadmap towards a better future, encompassing crucial areas such as poverty eradication, education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. However, the progress towards achieving these goals must catch up to projections as the 2030 deadline approaches.</p><p>AI has the potential to serve as a catalyst for progress, significantly accelerating our journey towards these goals. Yet, it also risks exacerbating existing disparities and creating a society where control over AI becomes a battle, benefitting only a few. A robust AI governance system can ensure the optimistic scenario's success.</p> The Imperative Role of Data <p>The existence of atoms weaves the very fabric of our physical reality. In the realm of information, data is the one thing AI algorithms hinge on. Brace yourself for an AI-driven data frenzy, with a mind-boggling year-on-year 56% surge in data production in 2020 alone. Brace even harder when you realise that we're sitting on a mind-blowing 64 zeta bytes of data, most of it unstructured. Unstructured data refers to data that does not have a specified format or organisation. This data is typically not easily searchable or categorised. So, get ready to dig deep into your organisation's resources to curate that data or brace for the havoc wreaked by poorly trained AI. The choice is yours, but the consequences are real.</p><p>Practitioners will appreciate the critical role of data in AI operations as they constantly search for more data. Unfortunately, we too often overlook data governance while it is the essential bedrock upon which policy maker can build a sound AI governance. Without data governance, information management systems fail to meet the data accuracy, accessibility, and security standards required to meet their end purpose: successful operations for better decision-making. Therefore, it is imperative to recognise the value of data governance before attempting to rule AI deployment.</p> Promoting Responsible Data Usage <p>AI, as a force for good, is about responsible data usage, a cornerstone of effective data governance. It entails ethical collection, storage, and data utilisation while prioritising privacy and security. Organisations can establish transparent and accountable data practices with robust data governance frameworks. Governance ensures that individuals' rights are respected while also addressing concerns around bias, discrimination, and the potential misuse of data. By fostering a culture of responsible data usage, we lay the foundation for a fair and just AI ecosystem.</p> Regulating AI Deployment <p>The intricate nature of AI that mixes data and algorithms poses challenges to effective regulation. However, we can simplify the regulatory approach by placing data governance at the forefront. By treating data as a first-class citizen, data governance aligns data usage with the values a community wants to protect through regulations and ethics. Then AI governance reduces to Machine governance. In other words, AI governance focuses on regulating AI deployment instead of AI development. In this view, AI governance is closer to AI solution certifications by defining domain-specific standards and assurance levels, for example. A data-centric approach enables policymakers and regulators to focus on data-related aspects, such as data quality, privacy protection, and accountability for algorithmic data transformation.</p><p>Streamlining the regulatory process through data governance has another subtle but essential consequence: decoupling the regulation of AI development from the regulation of AI deployment. Innovation is unstoppable. Thus regulating AI development is complex and will prove virtually impossible to enforce globally. Data governance does not stop AI development. It first structures and limits the data the AI system can ingest. Second, it constrains the algorithmic data transformation process that must respond to lawful purposes. The data governance approach to AI governance provides a granular framework that can meet domain-specific constraints and respect the underlying Human values embedded in responsible data governance.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, the data approach has the advantage of not exposing fundamental aspects of the regulation to the ever-changing technological landscape. Ruling data usage is to protect the core values of a community. The specific implementation risks are left to the certification of the deployment of solutions.&nbsp;</p> Responding to a Call for action as a first conclusion <p>The future of AI and its impact on society hinges on our ability to govern it effectively. While AI's potential to drive progress towards the SDGs is immense, responsible practices and regulations must guide the deployment of AI solutions.</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation firmly believes that by embracing data governance as the starting point, a foundation of trust, fairness, and accountability provides the bedrock for practical AI governance. Through responsible data usage, targeted regulations, and a commitment to inclusivity, we can harness the power of AI to reshape our world sustainably and inclusively.</p><p>Our beliefs are backed by actions developed through a data-centric architecture we promote as "Dynamic Data Economy". This architecture builds on the core concepts of distributed governance, decentralised semantics, and decentralised authentication.</p><p>Therefore, a contribution to the call for action within our reach is to expose the Dynamic Data Economy architecture through a stream of publications and events to promote an understanding of the relationship between data governance and technological developments.&nbsp;</p><p>The time for action is now, as the choices we make today will shape the trajectory of our society for years to come. </p><p>Thank You for your attention</p>

<p>Hitachi, IBM, JFrog, NEC, and Others Lead Collaborative Effort to Strengthen the Digital Identity Ecosystem</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 12 July 2023 – Members of OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, have formed the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=lvcsp">Lightweight Verifiable Credentials Schema and Process Technical Committee</a> (LVCSP TC). The TC will focus on developing a lightweight, scalable, and interoperable schema, based on the W3C Verifiable Credential (VC) standard, that enables individuals and organizations to easily and securely share their verified credentials across various domains.</p>



<p>Online digital identity is becoming increasingly important; having a reliable way of verifying online digital identity is essential for secure online interactions. However, the current verifiable credential landscape is fragmented and it’s difficult for VCs issued by different issuers to be verified by different verifiers. It will be crucial to standardize a verified credential schema in order to overcome interoperability issues and create a more effective, dependable, and secure digital identity ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This technology has the potential to revolutionize many industries, including finance, healthcare, and education, by enabling more efficient and secure processes for identity verification, credentialing, and access management,” said LVCSP TC co-chair, Spencer Yezo, of HYPR. “The interoperability of verifiable credentials across various platforms and systems promotes seamless integration and streamlines operations, fostering greater collaboration and trust between organizations.”</p>



<p>The target audience of the TC are technical experts, developers, industry leaders in the identity space, and anyone interested in building and implementing solutions that need VCs. Participation in the LVCSP TC is open to all through OASIS membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Support for the LVCSP TC</p>



<p>Hitachi<br>“At Hitachi, we believe authentic identity is the bedrock of trust, security, and commerce in the modern world. It is also one of the hardest technology problems to solve. Hitachi is joining OASIS members to sponsor verifiable authentication of digital transactions so commerce can be as secure online as it is in person. Good identity makes good commerce. The Lightweight Verifiable Credential Schema and Process program is a giant step in the right direction.”<br>– Charlie Hart, senior analyst, security solutions at Hitachi America, Ltd., Research and Development Division</p>



<p>NEC<br>“NEC is pleased to be part of the LVCSP TC and continues to drive LVCSP adoption with industry partnerships to benefit customers. NEC believes that the VC schema and process defined by the TC are crucial to improving the efficiency and usability of various businesses with VC. We are excited about the formation of LVCSP TC and support its efforts through its contributions to and promotion of this global standard.”<br>– Shinichi Fuchigami, General Manager, Cyber Security Strategy Department at NEC Corporation</p>

<p>The bottom line benefits of taking seven practical steps towards harms reduction</p>



 







 



 Summary 



<p>The recent <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/OvercomingHumanHarmChallenges_Whitepaper-V1.1-2023-05-04.pdf">‘Overcoming Human Harms in Digital Identity Ecosystems</a>’ white paper from Trust over IP’s Human Experience Working Group has deepened our understanding of what happens when trust breaks down on the internet. The paper lays out the moral case for a systemic framework for understanding and mitigating digital identity harms and explains the commercial benefits of enhanced trustworthiness:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Reduced reputational, compliance and fraud risks 



 Reduced human resource management and customer service costs 



 Increased revenues and investment — the ultimate value of trustworthiness 
 



<p>The companion ‘<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Practical-Steps-for-Overcoming-Human-Harm-Challenges-In-Digital-Identity-Ecosystems-V1.0-2023-05-24.pdf">Practical Steps</a>’ guide offers seven steps that business leaders and digital service providers can take starting now to unlock those bottom-line benefits.</p>



 



 Understanding, analysis, systemic framework 



<p>The new Trust over IP white paper, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/OvercomingHumanHarmChallenges_Whitepaper-V1.1-2023-05-04.pdf">Overcoming Human Harms in Digital Identity Ecosystems</a>, was published following a period of public review. The paper is in three parts:</p>



 
 A PESTLE[1] analysis of the human harms that can occur and their impact on real people and communities, including potential mitigations and exacerbations afforded by self-sovereign or decentralized identity solutions. 



 A simple systemic framework for understanding four types of human harm&nbsp; 



 Four harms mitigation strategies and examples of countermeasures 
 



<p>The paper’s human stories make a powerful moral case for addressing the very real human harms that arise (largely unintentionally), from the misuse, failure or appropriation of digital identity systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bottom line: businesses can derive significant commercial benefits by applying the mitigations outlined in the paper—including our guide to practical steps.</p>



 Reduced reputational, compliance and fraud risks 



<p>C-suite executives consistently rank reputational risk as their primary concern, because it accounts for 63% of a company’s market value[2]. A recent survey of 500 business leaders across all sectors, ranked employee and customer abuse as their highest reputational risk (72%)[3].</p>



<p>Societal impacts of online harms lead to higher taxes and increased regulation and compliance requirements such as the UK’s forthcoming Internet Safety Bill, the EU Digital Services Act, and the USA White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse (June 2022). Mindful of their own reputation, government regulators are increasingly using existing powers to impose hefty fines on companies that fail to take account of human vulnerabilities. For example, Meta was fined $435.6m by the EU Commission for violating GDPR by allowing teenagers to create public accounts that shared their digital identity[4]. This followed evidence provided by a whistleblower that Meta’s own internal research showed use of their platforms was damaging teenage girls’ mental health[5].</p>



<p>The rising incidence of identity theft and associated fraud also costs businesses and society dearly. The UK’s National Fraud Database, reports a 22% increase (2020-2021) in identity-related fraud[6], costing companies an average of £398,520 per annum[7]. An EU report found that 24% of fraud victims suffered financial losses (direct harms in the ToIP harms framework), while a whopping 79% suffered emotionally[8] (felt harms in the ToIP framework).</p>



 Reduced human resource management and customer service costs 



<p>Unhappy or harmed customers are of course more likely to call customer care or to use online reporting to abuse management teams. This not only increases the volume and complexity of calls to customer care, but it also impacts employee retention and emotional well-being[9]; one researcher noted that following interviews with commercial content moderators:</p>



<p>A significant number [get PTSD]. And many other employees develop long lasting mental health symptoms that stop short of full-blown PTSD, including depression, anxiety, and insomnia”.[10]&nbsp;</p>



<p>These factors increase business costs in multiple areas, including staff training and lost productivity.</p>



 Increased revenues and investment – the value of trustworthiness 



<p>Investors are starting to put their money into positive social and environmental impacts. The UK Treasure estimates that Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) assets under management (AUM) will be $33.9 trillion by 2026[11]. Deutsche Bank forecast that by 2030, 95% of AUM (€130 trillion) will be against an ESG mandate[12]. Consequently, ESG is a top boardroom priority, with 45% of companies reporting an ESG measure in executive pay, and 78% judging that ESG value contributes to company valuation and financial performance[13].</p>



<p>Consumers too are increasingly led by the values and ethics of brands; according to a recent PwC report, “Eight out of ten consumers said that they would pay up to 5% more for sustainably produced goods”[14]. This is led by GenZ consumers who are powerful influencers of other generations[15]. A recent Deloitte Analysis found that “trusted companies outperform their peers by up to 400%, directly correlating with the bottom line.”[16]&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, harm mitigation substantially adds to a company’s value. For digital identity technology providers, their customers, and the real humans who use those services, addressing human harms is both a moral and a business imperative.</p>



 Practical steps to unlock business value 



<p>In addition to the white paper, ToIP also introduced <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Practical-Steps-for-Overcoming-Human-Harm-Challenges-In-Digital-Identity-Ecosystems-V1.0-2023-05-24.pdf">seven practical steps for overcoming human harms in digital identity</a>. These are steps that businesses and online ecosystems can implement today:</p>



 
 Define the business case for harms in your ecosystem 



 Train your team in ethics 



 Recognise vulnerabilities 



 Promote human agency 



 Balance power between parties&nbsp; 



 Reinforce collective resiliency through cooperation 



 Continuously monitor ‘what could possibly go wrong?’ 
 



<p>Each step is accompanied by quick links to resources from the ToIP Foundation and beyond. The good news is that this is not rocket science—you will find that you are already using many of these tools, such as risk assessment—and you just need to apply them in new ways using a human harms lens.</p>

 Unlocking the Power of Identity and Communication: Our New Messaging Feature The Lissi ID-Wallet, which gets information from different contacts<p>We are proud to announce the release of our new messaging feature for the Lissi Agent and Wallet to transform the way organisations interact with their clients. In today’s world, communication and trust are critical, and secure communication plays a massive role in building that trust. With this in mind, we have developed a new messaging feature that unlocks the true potential of the combination of identity credentials and messaging. In this article, we will explore the benefits of messaging for organisations and their clients, the reasons behind the creation of the messaging feature, and an overview of the feature&nbsp;itself.</p>GIF of the user flow in the Lissi wallet including messaging. The Power of authenticated communication channels <p>In the digital age, we often encounter people and organisations online before meeting them in person, and establishing trust is paramount in forming these relationships. Authentication plays a crucial role in building that trust, as it helps confirm that the person or organisation you are communicating with is genuine. Our Lissi Wallet’s new messaging feature enables organisations to use authenticated communication channels to form trusted relationships with their&nbsp;clients.</p>A man checking his contacts and their last messages within the Lissi identity&nbsp;Wallet Benefits of a messaging feature for end-users and organisations <p>We believe there are several reasons to introduce a messaging feature in the Lissi Wallet app from the perspective of end-users:</p>  Enhanced trust and security: Once a user accepts an authenticated organisation as new contact in the Wallet the encrypted and private channel prevents phishing and&nbsp;spam.  Context: Messages provide valuable context about offered or requested credentials. Receiving a credential without knowing where to use it is quite&nbsp;useless.  Convenience: By seamlessly integrating messaging within the app, users can receive messages without switching between different platforms. This creates a more cohesive and efficient user experience.  Being informed: Be it an update to a product or service, a user account, order status or upcoming events. Users are always informed about the most important topics with a particular organisation.  No phone numbers or email address required: To receive messages from organisations, customers do not have to provide a telephone number or an email address, and if they no longer wish to receive messages, they can just delete the connection. It’s as easy as&nbsp;that!  <p>From an organisational perspective there are plenty of good reasons, but here are the most important ones:</p>  Trusted relationship: As an organisation you provide the necessary trust to your clients so they can be sure the message is authentic, secure and confidential.  Attention: Getting the attention of your target audience, by triggering a push notification on their phone greatly increases the likelihood a client will read your message and engage in your&nbsp;offer.  Conversion: A guided user flow ensures a high conversion rate by providing all the necessary information.  Customer loyalty: Retain your customers by strengthening your customer engagement and access to your services with a digital&nbsp;wallet.  Secure P2P-messages: Send confidential messages and documents to customers instead of providing these in your internal&nbsp;postbox.   Overview of the New Messaging Feature <p>The new messaging feature in the Lissi Wallet app is illustrated as a chat within the wallet. This chat also includes credential related activities such as credential offers or information requests.</p>A woman receiving credentials and information and from a Music Festival within her Lissi identity&nbsp;wallet.<p>The messaging feature in the Lissi Wallet app is currently limited to uni-directional communication. This means users can only receive messages, but not send them. While this sounds limiting at first, it ensures organisations can focus on providing value without being overwhelmed with individual customer requests.</p> Getting Started with the Messaging Feature <p>To make use of the messaging feature as an organisation you can follow these&nbsp;steps:</p>  Fill out our <a href="https://r82hs8os9o6.typeform.com/to/gvDYuzWg">contact form</a> in 1&nbsp;minute.

By utilising the messaging feature, organisations can build stronger relationships with their clients, ultimately enhancing trust and customer satisfaction.</p><p>Should you have a feature request from a user or organisational perspective for our new messaging feature you can fill out our <a href="https://r82hs8os9o6.typeform.com/to/dL0zlI1z">Lissi Wallet feedback form</a>.

 Fostering Transparency and Building a Cooperative Economy <p>Two weeks ago We Are Open Coop went to Amsterdam to join the<a href="https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/house"> MozFest House</a> at <a href="https://tolhuistuin.nl/">Tolhuistuin</a> in Amsterdam. For us this was not only another lovely opportunity to meet up but also to join the festival for some great sessions, conversations and free coffee <a href="https://mastodon.online/@dajb@social.coop/110581283835474894">that was actually not&nbsp;free</a>.</p><p>This year’s festival was all about trustworthy AI and the things that are connected to it. We joined some interesting sessions about AI ethics, chatted about <a href="https://ailiteracy.fyi">AI Literacy</a>, listened to panels about online power structures and spoke on a panel focusing on “Collaborating in the Digital Public Space”. We even sat underneath an old beautiful tree and talked about what transparency and bias means to us. Check out all of the official photos&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mozfest/albums/72177720309311088">here</a>.</p><p>We also ran a session called ‘Fostering Transparency and Building a Cooperative Economy’. We introduced the idea why we should build a cooperative economy and gave some co-op history background. Ever fans of participatory sessions, after a short introduction, we collected questions from the entire room. We took notes while people were talking and then broke into themed groups. We answered questions and had meaty conversations aboute governance, workflows and things to keep in mind when setting up a&nbsp;co-op.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vtFEECQruZNKDE5N5GF9lp1Vc2XzEQfs5ilp5zalrnU/edit#slide=id.g1e4263d6587_0_0">Here is a link to the&nbsp;slides</a>.</p><p>Want to go further?

<p>Government officials, policymakers, technologists, legal scholars, and human rights advocates are invited to offer feedback on a new white paper <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/OIDF-Whitepaper_Human-Centric-Digital-Identity_Draft.pdf">“Human-Centric Identity: a primer for government officials”</a>. This follows the publication of “<a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/05/Government-issued-Digital-Credentials-and-the-Privacy-Landscape-final.pdf">Government-issued Digital Credentials and the Privacy Landscape</a>” (Flanagan, 2023), which delved into challenges of creating a globally viable privacy-preserving Digital Identity landscape. This paper zooms out and takes a higher level view of the role of Digital Identity Systems in delivering on the role of government. In particular, it grounds that role in the international human rights agenda.</p>
<p>Part 1 explores the opportunities and risks inherent in Digital Identity technologies. The paper then moves into Part 2, which analyzes existing and emerging Digital Identity paradigms and identifies common trade-off decisions. Part 3 builds upon existing principles based literature – especially the recently published OECD Recommendations on the governance of Digital Identity – to navigate a path through these decisions. It recognizes that no one size fits all nations, that no technology or architecture is a panacea, and that&nbsp; multiple systems may co-exist even within borders. However, it argues that there are design practices and strategic approaches that will lead to Digital Identity Systems that sustain and promote human rights.</p>
<p>The paper results from many months of due diligence, starting with public listening sessions at Authenticate, the November 2022 OIDF workshop, and IIWs IIWXXXV-XXXVI, and many interviews with active people in this space. In particular, the editors would like to thank the contributors who challenged the paper to give voice to the challenges of vulnerable populations, including stateless people, migrant families, and those “edge cases” that just might be central to our humanity (to quote contributor, Henk Marsman).</p>
<p>Your feedback will help ensure this paper serves as a strong platform to inform further dialog with governments, civil society, and technologists. Further, the OpenID Foundation warmly invites other non-profits that support the contents of the whitepaper to consider co-branding prior to its release for Final publication in September. Contact&nbsp; director@oidf.org for more information.</p>
<p>The comment period will be open until 15 August 2023. You may submit your feedback to <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a>.

The title of this call is <a href="https://www.unesco.org/sites/default/files/medias/fichiers/2023/06/Definition-of-algorithm-data-literacy-UNESCO-call-for-contributions-en.pdf">Definition of Algorithm Literacy and Data Literacy</a>, with the focus very much on AI literacy&nbsp;skills:</p><blockquote>Based on the Beijing Consensus on AI and Education, there is the emergence of a set of AI literacy skills required for ethical and effective human–machine collaboration, without losing sight of the need for foundational skills such as literacy and numeracy. With the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies, it has become more urgent to define the basic sets of AI literacy skills needed by the understanding and use of AI. The basic values, knowledge, and understanding on how our data are being collected and used as well as how algorithms are being designed to manipulate the data and feed information to users of digital platforms — together with basic skills everyone needs to master of using daily AI tools, they can be summarized as data literacy and algorithm literacy. By defining algorithm literacy and data literacy, UNESCO aims to develop frameworks of AI competencies for teachers and students and to guide the empowerment of individuals in navigating around AI-rich environment, making informed decisions, and actively shaping its responsible and beneficial use.</blockquote><p>Doug, Ian, and Tom met a decade ago when collaborating with a global community on v0.1 to v1.5 of Mozilla’s <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/web-literacy/">Web Literacy Map</a>.

<p>After months of hard work by 22 contributors, more than 130 PRs, and 1000+ file changes, we are thrilled to announce that Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ) version 0.4.0 has been released! This update contains various feature additions, as well as improvements in terms of modularity. In this post, we will go over the most notable changes of this release and the possibilities they offer.</p>



 Replacing the Hyperledger Indy SDK 



<p>In previous versions of Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript, the framework was closely tied to the Hyperledger Indy SDK Rust library. In addition to communicating with the Indy ledger, this dependency was also used for operations specific to the Hyperledger AnonCreds credential format and secure storage. Because the framework relied on this dependency for storage, users of the framework were forced to include this dependency into their application bundles, even if they did not interact with the Indy ledger or use the AnonCreds credential format. This caused unnecessarily big package sizes, hindering usability.</p>



<p>To solve this, new AFJ modules were introduced, each taking over a part of the responsibility previously carried by the Indy&nbsp; Rust library. The benefit of splitting up the three uses (ledger communication, AnonCreds operation, and secure storage) into separate components is that developers don’t need to include more into their app bundles than absolutely necessary. These modules enable AFJ to use three separate Rust libraries:</p>



  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr">Hyperledger Indy VDR</a> – Used for communication with Indy ledgers;  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-askar">Hyperledger Aries Askar</a> – Used for secure storage;  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-rs">Hyperledger AnonCreds</a> – Used for handling the AnonCreds credential format.  



<p>The Indy SDK Rust is currently optional in AFJ and mostly used for (temporary) migration purposes. It has been separated from the core of the framework and was moved to its own separate module called @aries-framework/indy-sdk. Moving from using the Indy SDK Rust library to using the libraries mentioned above not only benefits package size but also enables more modular use of the framework.</p>



 Ledger-Agnostic Hyperledger AnonCreds 



<p>Another noteworthy enhancement in version 0.4.0 is that Hyperledger AnonCreds can now be used independently of any Indy-specific logic. This has been achieved through the addition of two new modules, anoncreds and anoncreds-rs, that are fully compliant with <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec">AnonCreds Specification 1.0</a>. As a result, developers can now employ the AnonCreds format in combination with other ledgers or verifiable data registries supported within Aries Framework JavaScript. This improvement allows for greater flexibility.</p>



<p>There are already some integrations under development. For example, <a href="https://github.com/roots-id/cardano-anoncreds/tree/main/reference-implementations/afj">Cardano</a> has created a reference implementation for using AnonCreds with its ledger, and <a href="https://2060.io/">2060.io</a> is working on a <a href="https://github.com/2060-io/aries-javascript-didweb-anoncreds">did:web module</a> for using AnonCreds.</p>



<p>Another result of this development is the cheqd module. By integrating the cheqd module, developers can read and write AnonCreds-related objects to the cheqd network. The module contains components such as a DID resolver, a DID registrar, and other needed operations. This integration underscores the ledger-agnostic nature of the framework, showcasing its potential to work across diverse ledger technologies.</p>



 OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance 



<p>The introduction of support for the OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI) protocol is a&nbsp; major step towards&nbsp; bridging ecosystems. The OpenID4VC protocol has been gaining popularity because of their simplicity and foundation in proven OAuth2 technology. Now, developers can&nbsp; issue and receive credentials using the OpenID4VC stack in their AFJ-based solutions. As we strive to enhance the framework’s compatibility and align with industry standards, we are also working on adding support for OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP) and Self-Issued OpenID Provider v2 (SIOPv2). These are currently in development and will be introduced in forthcoming releases. Supporting this stack makes Aries Framework JavaScript usable in a variety of decentralized identity ecosystems.</p>



 JWT Verifiable Credentials 



<p>Last, but not least, this new release has expanded its verifiable credentials support. Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript previously supported JSON-LD credentials. In version 0.4.0, AFJ has been updated to include support for JWT credentials as well. While the data model remains unchanged, the inclusion of JWT credentials enables developers to interact with others who use this popular format.</p>

 Birds like&nbsp;scones <p>Most of us often use aggressive comparisons in our speech without considering where they come from or what they really mean. We don’t actually mean the literal words we say; instead, we use a figure of speech — a metaphor. For example we say that a colleague has been “thrown under a bus” when we mean that they’ve been blamed for something to protect another person. It’s true that many of these expressions might be innocent and just a part of normal conversation. However, it’s important to remember that using harsh language can have an effect on others, especially trauma survivors.</p>CC-BY Laura Hilliger for&nbsp;WAO<p>In this post, we’ll explore the history of violent metaphors and the most common ones used today, as well as examine the potential consequences of their use. As we discuss in our <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/fife/">Feminism Is For Everybody, Especially Educators</a> course on our ‘<a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop">Learn with WAO</a>’ site&nbsp;, feminist habits of the head include: reflecting on the truth and nature of knowledge, understanding where things come from, as well as how they influence our interactions with&nbsp;others.</p><p>While it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when violent metaphors began to be used, we can safely say that many common violent metaphors come from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex">military-industrial complex</a>. As a result, we use particular metaphors and idioms in our communities that come from competitive business practices. Many of the things we say today, without thinking about it, also stem from moments in history where discrimination and inhumane practices were even more common. Lots of the phrases we use today have racist, ableist or other discriminating undertones that we have to reflect&nbsp;on.</p><p>The 2020 Black Lives Matter movement helped many tech companies realise some of the ways in which their terminology was problematic. The industry started to change some commonly used phrases once people were aware that they had origins in slavery and segregation. One example of this is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53050955">GitHub changing the name</a> of the default branch of all new code repositories from ‘master’ to&nbsp;‘main’.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>We’ve all heard the embarrassing use of “we’ll go to war [with our competitors]”, “fight for market share”, or “take no prisoners” in corporate television shows we pretend we’ve never watched. These metaphors literally evoke images of battle and conflict, and are intended to create a sense of urgency in the workplace. They are used on purpose in many industries, even while industry leaders complain about a lack of diversity.</p><p>These turns of phrase establish an environment of intimidation, and place workers in competition with their colleagues, customers or industry. Their use also reinforces hierarchies.</p><p>There are common violent metaphors prevalent in our communities. Have you used any of these&nbsp;lately?</p>  cutting edge — implies that a person, product or service is so innovative and effective that it can “slice through” the competition  kill two birds with one stone — suggests that by taking a single action, two objectives can be accomplished simultaneously  shooting fish in a barrel –suggests that something is very&nbsp;easy  cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>These are just a couple of examples, but there are many metaphors and idioms with violent undertones.</p><p>These metaphors may seem harmless, but their use can have negative consequences. It’s a way of using language to implicitly reinforce physical power. They can create an overly competitive and aggressive atmosphere in a community or workplace, where people are encouraged to see one another as adversaries rather than as peers. They can reinforce unhealthy power dynamics and perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes. They can even trigger post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>As if those potential consequences weren’t enough, this language can be extremely confusing for our community members who have English as a second language.</p><p>All of this can lead to a lack of cooperation and teamwork, which in turn can hinder the community’s practices, psychological safety and, ultimately, inclusivity. For some people, this kind of language causes stress which then affects their motivation, performance and/or productivity.</p> What to do about&nbsp;it cc-by Laura Hilliger for&nbsp;WAO<p>Language is really tricky, and it takes time to change the ingrained thought patterns that influence the way you speak! You may have grown up in a family that used casually racist (“<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/5483053/Judge-accused-of-using-racial-slur-against-gypsies.html">I’ve been gypped!</a>”) or sexist phrases (“<a href="https://emoaid.in/dont-cry-like-a-girl/">Don’t cry like a girl!</a>”). This sort of language, like violent metaphors, reinforce stereotypes and social phenomena that aren’t necessarily reflective of the world you want to live&nbsp;in.</p><p>It’s worth making an effort to self-reflect on the language that you use, especially when you are active community members.</p><p>Start small with awareness. If you use a phrase that might be a violent metaphor, reflect on that. Can you change the metaphor next time? Have a think about the violent metaphors you use, and let’s see if we can find better ways to say what we&nbsp;mean.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/non-violent-communication-in-communities-dde7b1bf9b8e">Non-violent Communication in Communities</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>The fundamental concept that “better data, not just larger data,” is essential for the practical application of AI is essential, as the quality of the data utilized for training models is essential to yielding reliable and accurate AI systems. To elaborate further on this point, here are the key points to consider:</p>



<p>Relevance: It is not the case that more data necessarily results in more relevant data. For an AI to learn efficiently, it must be provided with data immediately pertinent to its intended purpose. In this context, better data suggest data that accurately correlates to the challenges the AI will resolve.</p>



<p>Quality: The AI models are only as effective as the data used to train them. Poor-quality data can lead to erroneous models and bad outcomes. Thus, better data stands for clean and well-structured data that can offer a lucid and precise depiction of what the AI must learn.</p>



<p>Bias: Larger datasets may have prejudices which, if not identified and eliminated, can be taken on board and propagated by AI models. Better data is free of negative biases, or at least those biases have been acknowledged and mitigated.</p>



<p>Overfitting: Instructing an AI with a large dataset can result in overfitting, whereby the model gets overly familiar with the training data and performs poorly when presented with new data. Better data encompasses a reasonable measure of variety to assist the AI in generalizing correctly.</p>



<p>Efficiency: Processing substantial quantities of data needs ample computational resources and time, which may only sometimes be required or rewarding. Better data could indicate selecting a more reduced yet insightful subset of the data, accomplishing similar or even better outcomes quicker and at a more cost-effective cost.</p>



<p>Ethics and privacy: Obtaining and using more extensive data can regularly lead to ethical and privacy issues, primarily when dealing with individual data. Better data emphasizes the careful and ethical use of pertinent data, adhering to privacy rules and legal regulations.</p>



<p>Although more big data may enhance the performance of AI systems to a certain degree, the quality, applicability, and ethical use of the data are usually more critical for reaching successful AI deployments.</p>

<p>Transmute has been a member of DIF since 2018 and was a leading contributor to <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Sidetree</a>, a protocol that enables scalable Decentralized Identifier (DID) networks that can run on top of any existing storage or ledger system. Transmute’s open standards-based digital identity and credential technologies simplify regulatory and business processes. The company is currently focused on enabling digitisation of trade documentation and workflows for global imports and exports.<br></p><p>You’ve consistently highlighted the value of interoperability. Why is this so important to your business? <br></p><p>What really drew us to DIF was the agnosticism towards any specific technology stack and the focus on interoperability. For example, one of the things we’ve collaborated on is open source interoperability tests that support integration of DIDs and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) within existing infrastructure. You also see a lot of DIF community work on interoperability profiles. <br></p><p>A key moment for us was realizing we didn’t need a blockchain to use DIDs and VCs. We didn’t see demand for blockchain in the market, and you don’t need it to provide cryptographic proof that someone claimed something at a certain point in time. <br></p><p>As a result we shifted to focus heavily on W3C and IETF standards and doubled down on ensuring the Decentralized Identifier specification was adopted as an official web standard last year (Transmute’s Verifiable Data Platform offers users did:web and did:key methods out of the box). <br></p><p>The standards are what enables data to cross data silos and organizational boundaries. We can interoperate with anyone that implements standards-conformant DIDs and VCs. Alternatively, we can directly integrate with other parties across the supply chain, other claims sources like ERP systems for instance, where necessary (check out our <a href="https://guide.transmute.industries/verifiable-data-platform/platform-guide/adapter-marketplace?ref=blog.identity.foundation">VDP Adapter Marketplace</a>).<br></p><p>“Let’s solve the data problem by getting on the same [insert blockchain name or other infrastructure du jour]” has not worked. Everyone has made tremendous investments in some kind of system. The purpose of the standards is to insulate the industry from the tech stack. <br></p><p>The terminology used in trade documents was standardized many years ago. How does this affect your work at Transmute? <br></p><p>In addition to our work at DIF, we’re a leading contributor to the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">W3C supply chain traceability vocabulary</a> (a repository of VC schemas for specific trade categories). To ensure the data inside the VCs can be interpreted by all parties, including machines, we’ve gone to the current sources of trust for each product class and mode of transit that touch our customers. <br></p><p>As well as playing the roles of author and editor of several cornerstone specifications at the W3C, we’ve pioneered open standards-based semantic approaches with UN/CEFACT, the body that standardizes terms used in global trade and where Nis Jespersen, Transmute’s Solution Architect<a href="https://uncefact.unece.org/display/uncefactpublic/JSON-LD+Web+Vocabulary?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> leads the UN Linked Data Project</a>. In addition we collaborated with GS1, the kings of ubiquitous product identifiers and formats, having commercialized the literal barcode, to ensure we’re not reinventing definitions. We’ve taken into account many modes of perspective, from <a href="https://www.iata.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">IATA</a> to <a href="https://dcsa.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DCSA</a>.<br></p><p>You’ve previously spoken about the power of Linked Data. Please can you unpack that for us a little? &nbsp;<br></p><p>Transmute is focused on solving two big problems in global supply chains and cross-border trade. One is, where did the information flowing through our supply chain come from? The other is, what does it mean?<br></p><p>Supply chains still heavily depend on paper-based information flows. Each and every typical international shipment has a minimum of five documents issued, distributed and verified. What’s more, none of these trade documents or product identifiers are typically issued all at once — or even by the same party in the “chain.” "Digitization" so far has meant scanning and transcribing the piece of paper and emailing PDFs. <br></p><p>Transmute Verifiable Data Platform (VDP) uses Decentralized Identifiers to digitally “sign” trade documents for automatic and traceable persistence. DIDs mean you always know where a piece of data came from — who it came from — which solves the first problem.<br></p><p>Our product also leverages Linked Data (JSON-LD) to both codify the linkages across data types and documentation, and also to surface trends and relationships for interpretation or consideration. Making sure machines can read and understand your data is the first and most critical step towards unlocking actionable business insights that automatically tune with time. &nbsp;<br></p><p>This Linked Data aspect enables documents from multiple issuers to be automatically incorporated into a knowledge graph by matching URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) contained within the files.<br></p><p>Everyone in the ecosystem benefits. For example, knowledge graphs enable manufacturers to answer questions about costs and resilience, such as how many suppliers do we have in a certain country or region and what are the cost and delivery-time trends across certain types of suppliers, or where are the weakest “links” and strongest dependencies within our supply network? Customs authorities, like the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), on the other hand want to clear imported goods as efficiently as possible so they can focus on enforcement in problem areas. Incoming import credentials that are built with Linked Data allow them to more rapidly spot anomalies for further investigation. <br></p><p>One of the advantages of Verifiable Credentials in a commercial context is the ability to enable ecosystem collaboration while protecting participants’ confidentiality and Intellectual Property, for example via selective disclosure. How does this fit with the Knowledge Graph concept? &nbsp;<br>The kind of information that’s available on a product should depend on who you are, for example whether you’re CBP or the end buyer. Using Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials means our customers can provision access more granularly to different stakeholders. For example, if one party possesses ten documents, their knowledge graph will include the data from all ten documents, but if they only need to submit six of these to another party, say a regulator or an end customer, that party’s knowledge graph will only include data from these six documents. <br></p><p>Data minimization is a compelling commercial proposition that enables customers to only take liability for the data they need to perform the task at hand. <br></p><p>We have many of the same values as the Self Sovereign Identity community, but applied to businesses rather than individuals. What you get is a view of your information ecosystem that’s private to you. <br></p><p>How do verifiable data and Linked Data relate to AI and machine learning?</p><p>Everyone wants to use AI/ML on their data, but the quality of the output depends on the quality of the inputs. Having high-integrity data structured and connected to sufficient context to enable an AI or any other machine to interpret it is game-changing — we’re still discovering new uses of this data.<br><br><br></p>

<p>The manual nature of inventory management further compounded the challenge, leading to time-consuming and error-prone processes. Additionally, the fragmentation between departments and hospitals hindered the efficient sharing of medical resources.</p>

<p>To address these challenges, a specialised smartphone application was developed. This application leverages GS1 standards and smartphone camera capabilities to scan barcodes.</p>

<p>On Thursday, July 13, we’re hosting a video-conference AMA (Ask Me – us – Anything) about digital resilience! From 5-6pm CEST, members of our team will gather in a video conference to answer your questions about digital resilience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This AMA follows on from the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/come-to-our-ama-ask-me-anything-responsible-data-and-social-justice-edition/" title="">first one we held</a>, in June, which we tried out as a potential new format of support. The session went really well and&nbsp;was a great experience to be able to talk to a variety of social justice organisers from different countries about responsible data. So we’re excited to host another AMA – this time focused on digital resilience!</p>



<p>At The Engine Room, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-do-we-think-about-when-we-think-about-digital-resilience/" title="">we see digital resilience</a> as a set of practices that support the ability of an organisation to protect itself from, and respond to, digital security threats; to adopt infrastructures that respond to the ever-changing needs and contexts of the organisation and its members; and to ensure their wellbeing.</p>



<p>In this call, we’re inviting social justice organisers who want to learn more about digital resilience to come with your questions (or just sit in and listen to what others are asking!). Questions can be quite broad and could be things like:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 What are some of the ways I can make my organisation more digitally resilient? 



 What should we understand about our context in order to use tech tools in ways that protect us? 



 What can we do to keep people safer when we start using different tech tools? 



 Where can we find resources to learn more about digital resilience?&nbsp; 
 



 Join us 



<p>Our “Ask Us Anything” session is happening on Thursday, July 13, starting 5pm CEST. Our team members – experienced and committed activists, researchers and technologists – will be available to answer your questions!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Storing encrypted data that only certain users can access is an important and sometimes necessary feature for many Web3 applications. When it comes to ComposeDB on Ceramic, given that the underlying protocol entails an open and public network, any data streams can be accessed and read by any participating nodes.</p><p>In this tutorial, we will walk through one methodology you can use to encrypt data and decrypt data on ComposeDB. However, before we dive in, let’s first walk through some key concepts that will come into play.</p> What are DIDs? <p>DIDs are the W3C standard for Decentralized Identifiers. It specifies a general way of going from a string identifier, e.g. <code>did:key:z6Mki...</code>, to a DID document that contains public keys for signature verification and key exchange.</p><p>JOSE is a standard from <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">IETF</a> that stands for JSON Object Signing and Encryption, and that pretty much explains what it is. There are two main primitives in this standard: JWS (JSON Web Signatures) and JWE (JSON Web Encryption). Both of these formats allow for multiple participants: in JWS there can be one or multiple signatures over the payload, and in JWE there might be one or multiple recipients for the encrypted cleartext.</p> Building With Ceramic Libraries <p>Whether you need to authenticate users and create DID-based sessions, or you need to encrypt data to live on ComposeDB, we've created several libraries that can easily be accessed as node package dependencies. This tutorial will show you how to use these powerful tools directly.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/key-did-provider-ed25519?ref=blog.ceramic.network">key-did-provider-ed25519</a> offers a simple DID Provider that supports both signing and data encryption.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did?ref=blog.ceramic.network">js-did</a> is a library that allows developers to represent a user in the form of a DID. This is the main interface we're going to be looking at in this tutorial. It allows us to sign data with the currently authenticated user, encrypt data to any user (DID), and decrypt data with the currently authenticated user.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/StableLib/stablelib?ref=blog.ceramic.network">@stablelib/sha256</a> is a library that allows developers to encrypt data and is a subset of the larger <a href="https://github.com/StableLib/stablelib?ref=blog.ceramic.network">@stablelib</a> collection of encryption algorithms.</p> Setup your environment <p>This tutorial will walk you through how to set up encryption capabilities within an existing repository. However, if you’re looking to start from scratch, we recommend exploring our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/launching-create-ceramic-app/">Use Ceramic App</a> starter.</p> Dependencies   MetaMask or another Ethereum wallet  Ability to successfully run local Ceramic and ComposeDB Clients  Scaffolding to allow for local runtime composite deployments when starting your ComposeDB node   Generate Encryption Key <p>In your application, prompt your users to generate a special DID to be used when encrypting messages or accessing encrypted data on ComposeDB. In order to do so, you will first define a <code>userPrompt</code> variable that will be viewable to the user as the message shown in their wallet when signing the request, while also generating consistent entropy used by the hashing algorithm (resulting in the <code>seed</code> defined below).</p><p>The seed is a secret that will then be used to define a new DID class instance (using the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/key-did-provider-ed25519?ref=blog.ceramic.network">key-did-provider-ed25519</a> library). Finally, execute the <code>authenticate()</code> method on your new DID instance, returning the new DID to be saved as a session.</p> <code>import * as u8a from 'uint8arrays'
import { hash } from '@stablelib/sha256'
import { Ed25519Provider } from 'key-did-provider-ed25519'
import KeyResolver from 'key-did-resolver'
import { DID } from 'dids'

/*
this prompt can be customized to whatever message you want to display for the
user. As long as the same message is signed, it should generate the same entropy
*/

const userPrompt = "Give this app permission to read or write your private data";

const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
const entropy = await window.ethereum.request({
  method: 'personal_sign', 
  params: [u8a.toString(u8a.fromString(userPrompt), 'base16'), accounts[0],
],
});

const seed = hash(u8a.fromString(entropy.slice(2), "base16"));
const encryptionDid = new DID({
  resolver: KeyResolver.getResolver(),
  provider: new Ed25519Provider(seed),
});
await encryptionDid.authenticate();

console.log('encryptionDid', encryptionDid.id);
</code>  Encrypting and Decrypting Data <p>For the purpose of this tutorial, we’ll be using a simple direct message data composite. Our top-level model will only make use of two fields—a “recipient” (DID value type), and a “directMessage” (a stringified JWE).</p><p>For the purposes of this tutorial, our simple message model would read as follows:</p> <code>type EncryptedMessage @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A direct message encrypted data model") {
    recipient: DID!
    directMessage: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}
</code> <p>Make sure to compile and deploy your new composite on your Ceramic client, allowing you to mutate and query the models.</p> Encrypt &amp; Write <p>If we want to encrypt data that only the currently authenticated user can decrypt we can simply encrypt it directly with the <code>encryptionDid</code>. In order to avoid escaping the JSON after stringifying your resulting JWE (preventing the data from conforming to the String constraint), we can temporarily replace double quotes with backticks.</p><p>Use your composeClient instance to perform a mutation using the values generated from the encrypted message:</p> <code>
const cleartext = 'this is a secret message';
const jwe = await encryptionDid.createDagJWE(cleartext, [encryptionDid.id]);

//stringify your JWE object and replace escape characters
const stringified = JSON.stringify(jwe).replace(/"/g,"`");

const message = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
    mutation {
    createEncryptedMessage(
      input: {
        content: {
          recipient: "${encryptionDid.id}"
          directMessage: "${stringified}"
        }
      }
    ) {
      document {
        recipient{
          id
        }
        directMessage
      }
    }
  }
`)
</code>  Read &amp; Decrypt <p>Similarly, in order to allow only authenticated users to decrypt data, we can also allow access using their <code>encryptionDid</code>. The following example query obtains the first message and uses the authenticated user’s <code>encryptionDid</code> to decrypt the message:</p> <code>const query = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
      query{
        encryptedMessageIndex(first:1){
          edges{
            node{
              recipient{
                id
              }
              directMessage
            }
          }
        }
      }
      `);

const arr = query.data?.encryptedMessageIndex?.edges;

//Reverse-replacement of backticks for double-quotes prior to parsing
const string = arr[0].node.directMessage.replace(/`/g,'"');
const plaintext = await encryptionDid.decryptDagJWE(JSON.parse(string));
</code>  Multiple User Encryption <p>In certain situations, you may choose to grant multiple users access to encrypting and decrypting data on ComposeDB. In this situation, two components of your data composite might be comprised of one model for storing encryption keys for each user.</p> Store Encryption Keys <p>Let’s say your data model for storing encryption keys reads as follows:</p> <code>type PublicEncryptionDID @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A data model to store encryption DIDs for an application") {
    author: DID! @documentAccount
		publicEncryptionDID: DID!
}
</code> <p>And your simplified encrypted message model reads as follows:</p> <code>type EncryptedMessage @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "An encrypted message data model") {
    message: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
    recipients: [DID] @list(maxLength: 200)
}

</code> <p>Hopping back to our application, as we authenticate users, we can store their corresponding encryption keys:</p> <code>//the method below creates a session for your user and returns their DID.id
const auth = await encryptionDid.authenticate();

const storeEncryptionKey = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
    mutation {
      createPublicEncryptionDID(
        input: {
          content: {
            publicEncryptionDID:  "${auth}"
          }
        }
      ) {
        document {
          author{
            id
          }
          publicEncryptionDID  {
            id
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);
</code>  Writing Group-Encrypted Data <p>Let’s say you’ve gated a segment of your audience based on their <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/advanced/standards/accounts/pkh-did/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">PKH DID CeramicAccount</a> (explained below). This section is intended to show how to encrypt data that multiple users can decrypt.</p><p>Since anyone within the Ceramic network can write to any stream, you can filter based on which CeramicAccount authored each model instance. In our example below, we’ve displayed filtering by the <code>did:pkh</code>. This type of DID account allows interoperability between blockchain accounts and DIDs. Each time you are prompting your users to author mutations using an Ethereum wallet, the corresponding native Ceramic account is the PKH DID.</p><p>For the full specification, please reference the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">PKH DID Method specification</a>.</p><p>The example below shows how to create an encrypted message only two separate users can decrypt:</p> <code>//Query first user based on PKH DID
const query1 = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
    query {
      node(id: "did:pkh...") {
        ... on CeramicAccount {
          id
          publicEncryptionDidList(first: 1) {
            edges {
              node {
                publicEncryptionDID{
                  id
                }
              }
            }
          }
        } 
      }
    }
  `);

//Query second user based on PKH DID
const query2 = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
    query {
      node(id: "did:pkh...") {
        ... on CeramicAccount {
          id
          publicEncryptionDidList(first: 1) {
            edges {
              node {
                publicEncryptionDID{
                  id
                }

const results = [...query1.data?.node?.publicEncryptionDidList?.edges,
				 ...query2.data?.node?.publicEncryptionDidList?.edges];

results.forEach(el =&gt; {
  users.push(el.node.publicEncryptionDID.id);
})

const cleartext = 'this is a shared secret message';
const jwe = await encryptionDid.createDagJWE(cleartext, users);

//stringify your JWE object and replace escape characters
const stringified = JSON.stringify(jwe).replace(/"/g,"`");
const encryptedGroupMessage = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
  mutation {
    createEncryptedMessage(
      input: {
        content: {
          message: "${stringified}"
          recipients: 
            ["${users[0]}", "${users[1]}"]
        }
      }
    ) {
      document {
        message
      }
    }
  }
`);
</code>  Decoding Group-Encrypted Data <p>Regardless of how many encryption keys representing individual users are involved in generating a JWE, a single holder of just one of those encryption keys will still be able to decrypt the corresponding message in a similar fashion:</p> <code>const query = await composeClient.executeQuery(`
    query{
      encryptedMessageIndex(first:1){
        edges{
          node{
            message
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);

const arr = query.data?.encryptedMessageIndex?.edges;

//Reverse-replacement of backticks for double-quotes prior to parsing
const string = arr[0].node.message.replace(/`/g,'"');
const plaintext = await encryptionDid.decryptDagJWE(JSON.parse(string));
</code> <p>That’s it for this tutorial! Hope you enjoyed exploring one encryption methodology you can use, both when encrypting data on behalf of your users, as well as segmenting your application’s user base and allowing only those partitions the ability to decrypt relevant data.</p><p>If you want to get started with ComposeDB on Ceramic and don’t know where to start, dive into the <a href="https://composedb.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Developer Docs</a>, or walk through a detailed <a href="https://dev.to/fllstck/decentralized-databases-composedb-49m3?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tutorial</a> that features end-to-end steps using an article publishing platform as the example use case.</p>

      <p>Under our analysis of trust and the digital world, we define different types of trust relationships and find out the factors that are needed to ensure a fully representative model.Next, to meet the challenges of digital trust modelling, comprehensive trust model evaluation criteria areproposed, and potential securities and privacy issues of trust modelling are analyzed. Finally, we provide awide-ranging analysis of different methodologies, mathematical theories, and how they can be applied totrust modelling</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Trust frameworks are not a new concept. They are commonly used outside of the world of digital identities, to govern a variety of multi-party systems where participants desire the ability to engage in a common type of transaction with anyone of the other participants, and to do so in a consistent and predictable manner. In such cases, they are proven to work and scale. Common examples include credit card systems, electronic payment systems and the internet domain name registration system, which all rely on a set of interdependent specifications, rules, and agreements. This set of specifications, rules and agreements is referred to by various names, such as “operating regulations,” “scheme rules,” or “operating policies.” In the world of identity systems they are commonly referred to as a “trust framework.”</p>

      <p>The concept behind a Trust Registry is that a Wallet needs to know which decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to “trust” as a source of truth. At many levels, this “trust” translates to “authority” – knowing that somebody, centralized or decentralized, is responsible for maintaining a list of trusted DIDs.</p>

         First, machine-readable governance simplifies how decentralized identity works: The user software handles the rules for information flows and authentication, which are established and published by the entities with authority for governing the use case. 
         Second, this architecture makes these rules transparent. 
         Third, and critically, it enables these rules to function offline through caching, which, when you think about it, is an essential feature in any digital identity verification system; trust can’t be dependent on a Wi-Fi signal.

      <p>We can trace the history of digital wallets with a Capability-Maturity Model (CMM) from paper and magnetic stripes to chip and mobiles. The fundamentally important trend over the decades has been to use smart technology to prove the properties of the data carried in the wallet. Today’s smart phone wallets prove the origin of each credential, possession by its rightful owner, the manufacturer and history of the wallet, and other metadata.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>If an identity is tied to a single persistent private key, then loss or compromise of the private key will mean total loss of the identity. Since key compromise and/or loss do happen there needs to be a way to recover from this in order to have a persistent digital identity. <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/shared_terminology_for_digital_identity_systems.md">See here for definitions used</a>.</p>

      <p>If the user of the identity suspects that a key is or may be compromised the user can rotate their key by submitting a new key to the system, signed by the old key. After this the old key can be revoked.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The biggest disadvantage of non-custodial wallets is their inaccessibility when you lose or forget the password. Since you are the sole custodian, there is a huge responsibility on you to always remember the password of your wallet.

  Top Greek yogurt brand sees GS1 GDSN as a key part of their digital transformation
 
 
     

 
             For almost a century now, Greek dairy manufacturer FAGE Greece S.A. has been producing yogurt and other dairy products. Today, this pioneering company is recognised globally for the quality of their products. 
     

 
              Market-leading yogurt company FAGE (pronounced: “FA-YEH!”) was one of the first businesses in Greece to join HellaSync, the GDSN-Certified Data Pool provided by GS1 Association Greece. 

<p>FAGE sees GS1 GDSN as a key part of their digital transformation. Using the Network has allowed them to deliver product data to their customers in just 20% of the time that they needed before. The company has also seen their internal operations and processes become faster and smoother. And GDSN has already allowed FAGE to penetrate new customers in Europe, as their product listings already met the high-quality digitised expectations of these customers. Going forward, FAGE intends to start adding to their GDSN listings information about packaging recyclability and sustainability.</p>

<p>Business Situation</p>



<p>Intuit is the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for more than 100 million consumers and businesses around the world using TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks and Mailchimp. The company’s long- held commitment to Design for Delight principles has been a key ingredient of its success in fueling innovation across its products, services and customer touchpoints to create bold new AI and data-driven personalized experiences at scale.</p>



<p>To execute on a user-centric focus, Intuit’s customer authentication products team, led by Rakan Khalid, Intuit Group Product Manager, Identity, justifies and prioritizes development of new authentication capabilities based on user research, security trends and technology advancements in the industry. This has led to an overarching strategy that emphasizes secure and convenient authentication experiences on its platform.</p>



<p>Intuit saw the potential of the FIDO (Fast ID Online) Alliance early on and began a multi-year FIDO journey in 2018 to reduce customer friction and enhance security, at lower operating costs.</p>



<p>Business Challenges</p>



<p>Intuit set out to address several challenges when evolving its customer authentication strategy to serve a growing customer base across a diverse set of product offerings and user personas:</p>



 
 Customers experienced friction when logging on, which negatively impacted key business metrics. 
 



 
 Sign-in times (time to successful sign-in) were getting longer, and calls into customer care for account sign-in-related issues were increasing. 



 Product teams were challenged to balance ease-of-use and convenience for users with appropriate levels of security. 
 



<p>Business Objectives</p>



<p>The team set out to achieve the following business objectives for customer authentication across Intuit’s product portfolio:</p>



<p>Results and Benefits</p>



 
 Deliver a delightful and seamless customer authentication experience that “just works” across multiple devices. 



 Push the envelope on customer authentication technology to further enhance the security posture of Intuit. 



 Build a resilient, scalable, durable customer authentication capability for its current and future business needs. 
 
 



  
 


<p></p> <p>OVERVIEW</p>“As an early adopter of FIDO, we’ve seen<br>significant business benefits and are completely on board with continuing to leverage the latest FIDO innovations with our partner, Nok Nok.”<br> <br>Rakan Khalid, Intuit Group Product Manager, Identity<br><br>Intuit was able to reduce customer friction, resulting in authentication success rates of 95% to 97% and 70% faster sign-in speeds. <p></p>


 
 


 


 
 


 


 
 


 


 
 


 


 
  
 



<p>FIDO Authentication Deployment – Measured Steps</p>



<p>Intuit implemented a FIDO-based customer authentication solution in line with the FIDO Alliance’s founding members’ goals. FIDO protocols are based on an asymmetric cryptographic authentication framework designed to enhance security, provide a better user experience (compared to traditional passwords) and reduce cost and complexity.</p>



<p>Although FIDO is an open standard, the expertise required to code and deploy a scalable FIDO solution for millions of consumer and small business customers led Intuit to license a FIDO authentication platform.</p>



<p>Intuit selected the Nok NokTM S3 Authentication Suite (S3 Suite) for its advanced FIDO features and capabilities; optional on-prem deployment model; and speed, scale, and resilience, which was validated by Nok Nok enterprise customers.</p>



<p>Intuit’s authentication team placed a high priority on working with a FIDO leader with deep and relevant experience in customer authentication and therefore well-equipped to keep pace with industry progress with this fast- evolving technology.</p>



<p>Build vs. Buy: Intuit recognized that the company would benefit from the expertise of a vendor with experience working with other major companies on its authentication journey, and enjoy access to innovative product enhancements along the way.</p>



<p>Progressive Deployment: Intuit opted to deploy Nok Nok’s customer authentication solution across multiple apps in a controlled and measurable manner:</p>



 
 Intuit’s authentication team initially tested Nok Nok’s FIDO passwordless customer authentication on the mobile iOS version of an Intuit product with a small customer base. 
 



 
 Over the next few months, the team rolled out Nok Nok’s FIDO passwordless solution on mobile iOS and Android platforms for a broader customer base on multiple Intuit products. 
 



 
 The team added FIDO as an option to Intuit’s passwordless customer onboarding flow, which improved onboarding conversion rates and reduced subsequent sign-in times. 



 Over the last 5 years, Intuit has grown its total FIDO registrations to over 77 million. 
 



<p>Authentication Solution Delivers on Business Objectives </p>



<p>Intuit has been able to achieve all of its business objectives, while simultaneously addressing new use cases for a growing customer base:</p>



 
 Delightful Customer Sign-in – FIDO-based multi-factor authentication (MFA) for customer sign-in dramatically improves and simplifies the user sign-in experience because it’s completed in a single user step. This reduces the need for a multi-step authentication process (e.g., password, texting one-time passcodes). Using FIDO, Intuit users are presented with a seamless, passwordless flow using device-based platform authenticators, such as biometrics with which they’re already comfortable. 
 



<p>Today, more than 85% of all customer authentications on Intuit’s mobile apps are now done using FIDO</p>



 
 Enhanced Customer Security – When FIDO authentication is used, it eliminates the passing of passwords and one-time tokens between apps and services, which can reduce the risk of interception attacks. 



 Global Scale – Since Nok Nok’s S3 platform is trusted by some of the largest banks, telcos and fintech brands across five continents and has been proven to scale across demanding customer environments, it’s given Intuit the confidence that it will continue to scale with the company’s future growth to match uptime and authentication speeds. 
 



<p>Business Results</p>



<p>By deploying a passwordless solution for customer authentication, Intuit was able to reduce customer friction, thereby reducing operating expenses. Users who adopted the FIDO passwordless authentication option experienced authentication success rates of 95% to 97% when compared to a baseline of 80% for legacy multi-factor authentication and 70% faster sign-in speeds over non-FIDO sign-ins.</p>



<p>Looking Ahead</p>



<p>Over the past several years, Intuit has experienced the power of FIDO customer authentication for its consumer and small business customers, and validated its benefits with its product, technology, security, user experience and customer care teams. Looking ahead, the company intends to explore multi-device passkey technology as the next frontier on its authentication journey.</p>

 Scope 
<p>This whitepaper is focused on the privacy implications surrounding government-issued digital credentials. In particular, we look at the digital credentials issued by government authorities and intended as a technology that helps enable efficient, privacy-preserving services to people and businesses. Similarly, we consider where legislation and regulation define the individual’s expectation for privacy and establish some of the requirements for the technology. The scope here is global, with a particular focus specifically on digital credentials issued by liberal democratic governments which tend to have more stringent privacy laws and higher expectations of their residents to have their privacy expectations met. The paper does not cover privately issued identity credentials, what governments need to do to provide services to users that do not have government-issued identity credentials, or the needs of centralized governments with less focus on privacy.</p>

    <blockquote>
       
         Self-sovereign identity could save time and money on bureaucratic processes (form filling and validation) by automating business decisions. 
         Business decisions require governance to ensure the data used for making them qualifies (is valid) for that purpose, and continuously remains compliant with laws, regulations, and company policies (which regularly change). 
         Companies could share this governance burden by supporting communities that support the provisioning of SSI-related assurances for their specific purposes. 
         Such (focused) assurance communities could be supported by tools like credential catalogs and accreditation credentials. We hope this paper inspires SSI proponents to develop not only real SSI infrastructure, but also assurance mechanisms for exchanging qualified data.

      <p>Clarify modifiers. A phrase like “diplex matched antennas” is ambiguous. Does “matched” modify “diplex” or “antennas”? The domain is unfamiliar to me, but I suspected it should be “diplex-matched” and a web search confirmed that hunch.</p>

      <p>Omit needless words.&nbsp;The idea of faster workflow appears in the original first paragraph as “new efficiencies aimed at streamlining antenna design workflows and shortening design cycles.” That’s a long, complicated, yet vague way of saying “enables designers to work faster.”</p>

<p>The Findynet Cooperative is soliciting answers to a request for information (RFI) from SSI solution vendors. Our goal is to build a list of candidate solutions to be used in our pilots and later in our production network.</p>
 Scope of the RFI 
<p>To support organizations participating in the pilots, we will create a list of SSI solutions and their vendors. Of course, participating organizations can choose their own solutions, as long as they are interoperable with the protocols and formats selected for the pilot.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting organizations participating in the Findynet pilots, we will use the data collected to evaluate the potential future provision of SSI services as part of our own service portfolio.</p>
<p>We are interested in solutions that enable organizations to:</p>
 
 hold and present Verifiable Credentials issued to them 
 issue Verifiable Credentials to other parties and 
 verify Verifiable Credentials presented to them by other parties. 
 
<p>Some vendors refer to these as “all-in-one SSI solutions.”</p>
 Background and previous work 
<p>We have already worked with TNO to <a href="https://findyfi.github.io/wallet-overview/">add more SSI solution providers</a> to their <a href="https://tno-ssi-lab.github.io/wallet-overview/">Wallet Overview</a>. This list is well suited for technical comparison of solutions. Next, we want to learn about the advanced features, APIs, support, business models, etc. of the SSI solutions.</p>
 Findynet pilots 
<p>The Findynet Cooperative together with its members and other stakeholders, is launching a series of projects to test and pilot Self-sovereign identity (SSI) and Verifiable Credentials. We will run the pilots during 2023 and 2024, aiming to be ready for production in early 2025.</p>
<p>In some pilots, we may require compatibility with our current test network (<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>). In some pilots, there may be a requirement to be <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">EUDI ARF</a> compatible. In yet another pilot, we may require <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Conformant+wallets">EBSI compliant</a> technology. We are not looking for one solution to be used on all pilots (although that is a very welcome option), but rather a list of solutions to choose from based on each pilot’s requirements.</p>
<p>Our pilots are not directly linked to the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-wallet-implementation">EUDI Large Scale Pilots</a>. Findynet is an associated partner in the <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EUDI Wallet Consortium</a>, and there may be some synergies between some Findynet pilots and the EUDI Large Scale Pilots.</p>
 How to participate 
<p>You can answer to the RFI by filling in the <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/NE7V50bx6f">online RFI form</a>. You can also send additional information to an email address included in the form. The deadline for submission is August 6th, 2023.</p>
<p>For more information, please contact:<br>Samuel Rinnetmäki, CTO, Findynet Cooperative, tel. +358 40 534 4332, <a href="mailto:samuel.rinnetmaki@findy.fi">samuel.rinnetmaki@findy.fi</a></p>

<p>Tackling climate change will take innovation and collaboration on a global scale. Open source blockchain technologies are particularly valuable at uniting parties to collect, validate and innovate with climate data. There is a growing range of applications that are leveraging distributed ledger and related technologies, including green finance, sustainability reporting, climate accounting and supply chain traceability.</p>



<p>As part of our spotlight on #HyperledgerClimate, we’ve compiled a sampling of production deployments and solutions built using Hyperledger technologies that are leading the way towards a more sustainable future:</p>



<p>4AIR’s Comprehensive Blockchain-based Registry for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)</p>



<p>Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a type of biofuel with a lower carbon footprint than conventional jet fuel. With mandates to use SAF on the horizon, companies need a way to collect and verify key information related to their use of SAF. 4AIR teamed with IntellectEU to build a blockchain-based registry that includes all necessary SAF details, regulatory eligibility, and ownership information. The main stakeholders within the 4AIR platform are fuel producers, fuel distributors, fuel sellers, airlines and operators.</p>



<p>Developers used a private-instance of <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> supported by IntellectEU’s<a href="https://catalyst.intellecteu.com/"> Catalyst Blockchain Manager</a> to build the platform. 4AIR’s resulting SAF Registry allows registering, transferring, retiring and tracking of tokenized aviation fuel batches across the platform. Tokens are used to represent the emission reduction claim from one metric ton of SAF. Once created by fuel producers, these digital tokens can be transferred to fuel distributors and fuel consumers, before then being burned/retired when a claim has been finalized.

<p>Botanical Water Technologies&nbsp;</p>



<p>Botanical Water Technologies (BWT) from Australia is leveraging <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> to tackle severe water shortages that are affecting populations around the world. BWT found a way to recover the water usually wasted making alcohol, juice, ketchup, and sugar. The process involves capturing, purifying and creating sustainable drinking water with technology housed in shipping containers and connected up to existing systems that process fruit, vegetables, or sugar cane. BWT teamed with Fujitsu to develop a blockchain-based marketplace for buyers and sellers of this plant-sourced water, opening the door to the sale and donation of this water or of “water impact credits” (WICs) to help fulfill corporate water stewardship goals.

<p>Circulor</p>



<p>Tracking the flow of materials through their lifecycle, including extraction, production and into second life and recycling, is a cornerstone of sustainable and responsible manufacturing. <a href="https://www.circulor.com/">Circulor</a> has united whole industry segments onto a <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a>-powered platform that is introducing critical traceability to automotive, construction, extraction and plastic recycling. Drawing on its work with electric vehicle OEMs and supply chain participants to manage the lifecycle of the materials required to manufacture EV batteries, Circulor was named as one of 11 consortium members and the lead technology implementer for Germany’s<a href="https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2022/04/20220425-parliamentary-state-secretary-kellner-batteries-in-the-eu-must-be-as-sustainable-as-possible.html"> Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action</a> (BMWK) “Battery Pass” project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust</p>



<p>Initiated by the Government of British Columbia, Canada, in partnership with TELUS, <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/energy-mines-digital-trust-pilot/">Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust</a> provides digital trust solutions for the natural resource sector, empowering companies to prove their sustainability practices. To compete in a global market that prioritizes sustainably sourced products, mining companies must be able to prove where their products originated and how they were produced. The Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust project leverages tamper-proof digital credentials, issued in real time, as a new approach to sustainability reporting, and empowering mining companies to share verified data that can be trusted. The Government of British Columbia developed Traction, a tool based on<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy"> Hyperledger Indy</a> and<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries"> Hyperledger Aries</a>, to send and receive digital credentials.</p>



<p>Participating mining companies will be issued two digital credentials:&nbsp;</p>



  Mines Act Permit – A credential issued by the Government of British Columbia that regulates all mining activity in the province. Using this credential, mining companies can confirm the legality of their operations to a multitude of recipients.  <a href="https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/">Towards Sustainable Mining</a> (TSM) report – A voluntary benchmarking standard governed by the<a href="https://mining.ca/"> Mining Association of Canada</a>, a private-sector industry association, that recognizes environmental, social, and governance performance, enabling mining companies to differentiate themselves in global markets.  



<p>Equipped with the Mines Act Permit and TSM report, a mining company can easily prove that they are operating legally, and their sustainability claims are backed by audited data.

 Unravelling the Nuances of Online&nbsp;Spaces <p>Online communities often spill out across multiple digital spaces. While there is usually a central hub towards which newbies are pointed, conversations can be found all over the place. These discussions could manifest themselves as hashtags, subreddit discussions, or even impromptu group chats at&nbsp;events.</p><p>Lately, we’ve been involved in a few conversations where we had to clarify the three primary modes of online community interaction: chat apps, social networks, and forums. We’ve realised that organisations sometimes expect these interactions to occur all in location. Although technically feasible, it’s not always the optimal solution.</p>Scroll down to the bottom of this post for this text in a more accessible format Chat apps: swift and personalised interactions <p>Chat applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, or professional platforms like Slack, Mattermost, and Microsoft Teams, lend a personal touch to digital conversations. Their strength lies in instant, small group and private chats. Real-time notifications ensure you won’t miss critical updates, but these platforms may falter when it comes to large-scale discussions. Older threads and crucial information can be difficult to find, and the lack of anonymity could deter some&nbsp;users.</p> Forums: structured, lasting discussions <p>Forum platforms like Discourse, phpBB, and Flarum offer a way to host structured discussions that are easily referenced. They welcome everyone in the community to participate and the content enjoys a longer lifespan. However, forums are not real-time, so responses may take time. They can feel more formal and less personal, and moderation could be a challenge for larger&nbsp;forums.</p> Social networks: broad reach and rich&nbsp;content <p>Social networks such as Twitter, Mastodon, and Instagram provide a plethora of engagement opportunities and ways of reaching new community members. Hashtags and trending topics enhance content discoverability. However, the visibility of content, unless privacy settings are managed effectively, can raise concerns. Controlling content spread can be tricky and public posts can sometimes attract unwanted negativity.</p><p>Our recommendation is not to silo these platforms but to be strategic in how to use&nbsp;them.</p><p>Define your community’s ‘home’: Is it a chat app for real-time interaction amongst a smaller group? Is it a forum to ensure structured, easily referenceable discussions? Or is it a Twitter hashtag for broader engagement?</p><p>Remember, overlaps are inevitable. For instance, Discourse, a forum software, has a real-time chat option, but it isn’t a ‘chat app’. There’s a platform called Hylo which we’ve tested with one client that feels like a social network but has the underlying structure of a forum. It’s essential to recognise your community’s primary hub, even if conversations overflow into other digital&nbsp;spaces.</p><p>To sum it up, each online space — whether it’s a chat app, a forum, or a social network — has its own benefits and drawbacks. It’s important to think about what you want from these spaces and use them in a way that works best for your community. A good way to start thinking about that is to use our <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop/">Architecture of Participation</a> approach.</p><p>We’re curious to hear your thoughts. Have you figured out where your community feels most at home online? How do you handle conversations that take place in different online&nbsp;spaces?</p><p>The following is the text from the image which accompanies this&nbsp;post.</p> Chat Apps  Positives   Swift interaction: Allows for instant replies and prompt issue resolution.  Personal touch: Conversations often involve one-to-one or small group&nbsp;chats.  Effective notifications: Real-time alerts ensure messages aren’t easily&nbsp;missed.   Negatives   Not for large groups: The format doesn’t favour large-scale discussions or broad information dissemination.  Organisational challenge: Without appropriate management, old conversations or key information can be hard to&nbsp;locate.  Lack of anonymity: Users typically can’t hide their identity, which may not suit everyone.   Forums  Positives   Structured discussions: Forums allow for easy categorisation and referencing of&nbsp;threads.  Open participation: Everyone in the community can contribute.  Longevity: Content in forums remains accessible and can be referenced over&nbsp;time.   Negatives   Delayed responses: Forums aren’t real-time, so responses can take a&nbsp;while.  Formality: The structured nature of forums can make them seem less personal.  Moderation effort: Large forums can require significant resources for proper moderation.   Social Networks  Positives   Broad reach: Social networks allow content to be shared with a vast number of&nbsp;people.  Rich content: They support diverse types of content — text, images, videos,&nbsp;etc.  Discoverability: The use of hashtags and trending topics make content easily&nbsp;found.   Negatives   Privacy concerns: Unless privacy settings are carefully managed, content can be seen by&nbsp;anyone.  Control issues: Resharing posts can make information management tricky.  Unwanted negativity: Public posts can attract undesirable comments or trolling.   <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-good-the-bad-and-the-social-a7b7639165bd">The Good, The Bad, and the Social</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Decentralization is a commonly misunderstood concept. For example, it is sometimes said that the reason cryptonetwork advocates favor decentralization is to resist government censorship, or because of libertarian political views. These are not the main reasons decentralization is important.

    <blockquote>
      <p>It is common to&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@jaygraber/decentralized-social-networks-e5a7a2603f53">hear people say that “decentralized” describes what a distributed system is</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@jaygraber/decentralized-social-networks-e5a7a2603f53">not</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@jaygraber/decentralized-social-networks-e5a7a2603f53">instead of what it is</a>. However, when using the word “decentralized” they typically mean something more than just the organization of the network. To them it implies a partitioning of the services, governance, and overall power structure to prevent any one entity, or user, from controlling others in the system. It then follows that a fully decentralized system — among many other things — atomizes the power structure to the smallest possible unit and distributes it out to the edges where it is under direct user control.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Our analysis shows that this group of technical identity standards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documents that have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to the questionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunity passports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of ‘cryptography theater’ in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to allay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization. Deployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity’ in use-cases like immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identity totalitarianism.</p>

            <p>When the SSI community refers to an ‘identity layer’, its subject is actually a set of algorithms and services designed to ensure the frictionless transmission of incorruptible messages between multiple parties. This involves some clever mathematics and neat code that will undoubtedly prove of some value in the world with appropriate tight constraints, and it will certainly impact the operation of various conceptualisations of identity, but this is not human identity per se, or the digitalization of human identity. Far from it, as we shall see.

    <blockquote>
      <p>The International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/glossary/">defines four classes of privacy</a>:</p>
       
         Bodily Privacy—The protection of a person’s physical being and any invasion thereof. This includes practices like genetic testing, drug testing, or body cavity searches. 
         Communications Privacy—The protection of the means of correspondence, including postal mail, telephone conversations, electronic mail, and other forms of communication. 
         Information Privacy—The claim of individuals, groups, or organizations to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others. 
         Territorial Privacy—Placing limitations on the ability of others to intrude into an individual’s environment. Environment can be more than just the home, including workplaces, vehicles, and public spaces. Intrusions of territorial privacy can include video surveillance or ID checks.

    <blockquote>
      <p>Underlying this conversation is the concept of privacy. Is it a fundamental right? What does it mean? Who gets to decide which conveniences are worth the tradeoffs they require? Are the protections for personal data offered by policy and law sufficient, or should technical and security protections be required? Are some systems simply too high-risk to implement regardless of perceived benefits? To answer those questions, it’s important to understand the technologies at work – biometrics such as fingerprints and facial recognition offer greater reliability, security and certainty, but raise fears of “permanent” breach if the personal data is compromised. These systems offer accessibility at scale that can be updated throughout a lifetime in a way that password-based accounts cannot equal. But fair access to all, protections of personal data, and most importantly, legal, policy, and technical protections against discrimination and abuse are critical to ensuring these and related technologies are not simply used to restrict personal freedom, or target groups and other populations. Brenda covers how these and other aspects of the modern concept of “digital identity” are being approached in different ways, and what some of the benefits and risks are for the future.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>But also, the general populations’ computer skills must be taken into account when designing the solution, along with legal considerations of whether individuals should be allowed to sell sensitive data, such as health data to third parties. If it is legal to monetize personal data, users can be tempted to share personal data in a way that might harm them later e.g. sharing health data and later being denied an insurance. Monetization might also create a gap in the society and the world, having rich people prioritize protecting their privacy while less fortunate citizens might feel like they have no other option than selling their data. Thoughts about the monetization of data need to be considered in a legal context as it has been done with the donation of blood, when creating a self-sovereign identity solution. Furthermore, safeguard measures must be made against discrimination like only providing identity for a selected few, and to ensure that everyone have equal access to creating a trustworthy digital identity.</p>

      <p>Credential Marketplace is quite high up the SSI stack but we want to start this discussion.</p>
       
         What is Credential Marketplace? 
         We have a Trust Triangle of Issuer-Holder-Verifier. This does not need any centralized entity except schema hosting. 
         However, we want to solve the problem of discovery of Issuers and Verifiers. 
         Example: I’m traveling to a new country. I need to get what healthcare VCs are needed to go there, in an automated way. 
         How can we solve this without relaying on a centralized registry of Verifier requirements and Issuer capabilities? 
         How it works 
         In order to discover issuers / vc types, there should be a registration step where issuers/verifiers actively OR passively provide metadata about their capabilities. 
         Credential Data — can contain some filters or constraints on the data from within the VC. E.g. As a Verifier, I only accept passport VC from only certain governments: only German nationals. 
         VC Metadata 
         Issuer Metadata 
         Reputation mechanism for credential issuers 
         Marketplace can also implement value transfer: paying for issuance by the verifier, for example. Even if they are part of different SSI ecosystems. This is optional but can help incentivize different participants.

<p>This white paper describes the need for a more secure and convenient solution for authentication. Passwords have long been the standard for authentication, but the risks inherent to passwords reduce their efficacy as an authentication mechanism. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions have been on market for some time, but their widespread adoption has been slow due to various barriers. Passkeys are an authentication solution that reduces the adoption barriers of traditional MFA mechanisms, while offering improved security, ease of use, and scalability over passwords and classic MFA solutions. Passkeys utilize on-device biometrics or PINs for authentication and provide a seamless user experience. This white paper outlines the benefits of passkeys, the user experience, and adoption considerations for enterprises.</p>

<p>Half-day virtual Authenticate Summit to educate on how passkeys can fit into a variety of enterprise environments</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., June 27, 2023 – <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> are a gamechanger for signing to online services and apps, providing phishing-resistant security and easy user experience far superior to passwords and other phishable forms of authentication. Enterprises globally are interested in passkeys but may be wondering: how do I start? And “what type of passkey is right for my environment?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance addresses these questions in a new series of papers providing considerations for leveraging passkeys across different enterprise use cases. The series was developed by the FIDO Alliance’s Enterprise Deployment Working Group (EDWG) and can be found at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The papers in the series are:</p>



 
 FIDO Deploying Passkeys in the Enterprise – Introduction 



 Replacing Password-Only Authentication with Passkeys in the Enterprise 



 FIDO Authentication for Moderate Assurance Use Cases&nbsp; 



 High Assurance Enterprise FIDO Authentication&nbsp; 
 



<p>A fifth paper in the series, “Displacing Password + SMS OTP Authentication with Passkeys,” is expected to publish later this summer.</p>



<p>“Passkeys are a new concept to many enterprise organizations, in terms of both terminology and FIDO authentication capabilities,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “These papers demystify synced and device-bound passkeys and provide the decision points for how to leverage them across a variety of use cases, whether they are using passwords alone, legacy MFA or FIDO-based solutions today. These papers provide a great foundation for anyone looking to understand how passkeys can increase their organization’s security posture, meet legal and regulatory requirements and decrease support and other costs associated with authentication.”&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



 Corporate overview and challenge 



<p>As the “CASE” trend is gaining ground in the automotive industry, Toyota Motor Corporation, a leader and evolving company in the industry, is changing its model from a “car company” to a “mobility company”. In the area of “C: Connected,” Toyota is working to realize its vision of “Mobility for All – Freedom and Enjoyment of Mobility for All People,” and is developing a number of new services, including a “digital key” that allows the use of smartphones as keys, as well as a website and smartphone applications, for a wide range of users.</p>



<p>The “TOYOTA/LEXUS common ID” (“common ID”), a customer authentication service for safe and comfortable use of various services provided by Toyota, plays an important role in the provision of a series of services. The 5 million TOYOTA common IDs are linked to about 40 different services, and the multiple smartphone applications provided to customers required the input of IDs/passwords for each application.</p>



 FIDO 2 deployment 



<p>Toyota Motor Corporation has decided to deploy FIDO authentication as an optional authentication function for the “Common ID,” the major advantage of which is that by registering FIDO authentication credentials in advance, users will no longer need to go through the process of entering their ID/password each time they use each smartphone application.</p>



<p>Prior to deploying FIDO authentication, Toyota Motor Corporation had been using one-time password authentication and backup code authentication as a means of multi-factor authentication for common IDs. The main reason for choosing FIDO as one of the new options for multi-factor authentication this time was the consideration of the robust security and usability of FIDO authentication. By utilizing FIDO, which is a multi-factor authentication that involves possession using biometrics on the smartphone used in everyday life, a high level of security was ensured, and it also contributed to an improved user experience.</p>



<p>NRI Secure Technologies, Inc. (NRI Secure), which manages common IDs, has an authentication infrastructure called “Uni-ID Libra” that is compliant with FIDO authentication, and we requested their cooperation for implementation.</p>



<p>Until the introduction of FIDO authentication for iOS and Android devices, the differences in behavior depending on the OS (whether or not Discoverable Credential (formerly known as Resident Key) is supported, explicit user interaction during key registration is required for Safari for iOS, etc.) The issue was the impact on the UX.In the end, we were able to absorb the differences in UX by modifying the authentication web screen, and this led to a solution.</p>



<p>With this implementation, Toyota Motor Corporation has also focused on the importance of designing the life cycle of FIDO authenticators together. In providing services, it is necessary to prepare not only for authentication, but also for registration, device switching, and account recovery in case of loss. If other companies that provide services to consumers consider FIDO authentication, they should have a method that can maintain security strength when switching devices or recovering accounts.</p>
 



  
 


 



 



<p>OVERVIEW<br>Toyota Motor Corporation, headquartered in Toyota City, Japan, is Japan’s largest automobile manufacturer.<br><br>C (Connected): <br>IoT for automobiles<br><br>A (Autonomous): <br>Automated driving<br><br>S (Shared &amp; Services): <br>From ownership to sharing<br><br>E (Electric): <br>Electric vehicles</p>



 



<blockquote>
 “With the expansion of the connected strategy, the number of operations that can be carried out on smartphone applications and websites has been increasing. While convenient, they can also lead to accidents if misused, so more security measures are required. We believe that FIDO authentication will contribute as one piece to continue providing convenient and safe mobility services to our customers.”

These are major issues requiring strong and widely adopted open standards in today’s fast-paced and interconnected business environment.</p>



<p>Supply Chain Integrity: Maintaining the integrity of the supply chain is a challenge for many organizations as it involves ensuring that all stakeholders in the supply chain act ethically and responsibly. This includes ensuring that suppliers adhere to labor laws, environmental regulations, and ethical business practices.</p>



<p>Risk Management: Supply chain risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential risks in the supply chain. This can include risks related to suppliers, logistics, and regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Operational Intelligence: Supply chain operational intelligence refers to the use of data and analytics to improve decision-making and enhance supply chain performance. This requires organizations to have access to real-time data, advanced analytics capabilities, and the ability to quickly respond to changes in the supply chain.</p>



<p>Supply Chain Security: Supply chain security is a critical challenge for organizations as it involves protecting the flow of goods, information, and resources from theft, damage, and other security threats. This requires organizations to implement robust security measures and to have contingency plans in place to respond to security incidents.</p>



<p>Overall, addressing these challenges requires organizations to have a strong understanding of their supply chain, as well as the ability to monitor and respond to changes in real-time. This can be achieved through open standards and with the support of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things.</p>

<p>In what it called the “beginning of the end of the password,” Google last month began&nbsp;rolling out its own passkeys, an effort that could help agencies go passwordless and embrace a “zero trust” approach with layers of authentication required. Google’s move could create a “positive snowball effect” away from passwords, said Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance, which works to develop open authentication standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The emergence of verifiable credentials (VCs), has paved the way for secure and reliable digital identification and authentication. Today, we stand witness to a significant milestone as verifiable credentials have reached a level of maturity that enables their practical application in various real-world use cases. In New Zealand, the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) Bill passed earlier this year, setting the legal basis, and rightly creating an open accreditation scheme for service providers to proliferate the use of VCs and digital identity more broadly in our everyday lives. What an exciting time to be in digital identity in New Zealand! The on-the-ground mahi and fun starts now.</p>



<p>I’m of the opinion that the conditions are ripe for enterprises to forge ahead with real world applications and we’re already seeing some great success especially from our DINZ members. As part of this newsletter I thought I’d use this opportunity to highlight some great Kiwi trailblazers paving the way for digital identity proliferation, and give them a platform to shine.</p>



<p>MyMahi –&nbsp;Bringing inclusion to our young rangatahi</p>



<p><a href="https://mymahi.com/">MyMahi&nbsp;</a>a Palmerston North based company epitomises listening to their customers, starting out as an NCEA credit counter in 2014, and very quickly solving and iterating on their learner users challenges, becoming a learning pathway and journey platform. Building on their learner’s feedback, MyMahi has developed a verified digital student ID, breaking down barriers in inclusion for our youngest Kiwis. Most recently putting out a petition to parliament urging financial institutions to recognise verified digital identities helping bank our youngest New Zealanders. MyMahi creates equity and inclusion for our future generations through digital identity.</p>



<p>JNCTN – Keeping lives safe through trusted health &amp; safety record keeping</p>



<p><a href="https://jnctn.nz/">JNCTN</a>&nbsp;a Petone based company is blazing the trail in real world use of Verifiable Credentials, solving a pertinent problem of workforce health &amp; safety record keeping assurance. Pen and paper methods of verifying health and safety records in high risk industries have been prolific, and pose existential risks to both workforce and employer.&nbsp;JNCTN’s credential management system allows for high assurance capture of workforce training and compliance records, assuring every worker that enters a high risk worksite not only the evidence of training, but the assurance that they have the practical training to respond. JNCTN saves lives through verifiable credentials.</p>



<p>These are just two wonderful DINZ members taking a lead in the world of digital identity, and from my personal interactions with organisations both large and small, 2023 will be a breakout year for digital identity, so watch this space and Kia Kaha!</p>

<p>Innovative technology that brings sustainability data from the physical world into a trusted digital environment is essential to global climate action. Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust provides digital trust solutions for the natural resource sector, empowering companies to prove their sustainability practices. Today, EMDT is moving from the research and development phase into production – making the process of sustainability reporting with digital credentials a reality for the mining sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EMDT was initiated by the Government of British Columbia, Canada, in partnership with TELUS to explore the use of digital trust technology for the natural resource sector. Throughout the project’s pilot phase, EMDT earned international recognition for the unique application of digital credentials for organizational identities using Hyperledger technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CHALLENGES IN SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING&nbsp;</p>



<p>To compete in a global market that prioritizes sustainably sourced products, mining companies must be able to prove where their products originated and how they were produced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current process for proving sustainability claims is inefficient due to:&nbsp;</p>



  Diverse regulatory models  Varied reporting standards  A lack of interoperable digital tools  



<p>EMDT’s pilot use cases demonstrate that digital credentials offer a solution to these challenges, driving a new approach to sustainability reporting, and empowering mining companies to share verified data that can be trusted.</p>



<p>Tamper-proof and verified in real time, a digital credential enables anyone viewing it&nbsp; to determine who the issuer is, that the credential is valid, and that it has not been revoked – regardless of where or to whom it is shared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MOVING TO PRODUCTION</p>



<p>As EMDT’s mining sector use case moves into production, mining companies, regulators, and governing bodies will experience the benefits of digital trust technology first-hand.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Participating mining companies will be issued two digital credentials:&nbsp;</p>



  Mines Act Permit – A credential issued by the Government of British Columbia that regulates all mining activity in the province. Using this credential, mining companies can confirm the legality of their operations to a multitude of recipients.  <a href="https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/">Towards Sustainable Mining</a> (TSM) report – A voluntary benchmarking standard governed by the <a href="https://mining.ca/">Mining Association of Canada</a>, a private-sector industry association, that recognizes environmental, social, and governance performance, enabling mining companies to differentiate themselves in global markets.&nbsp;  



<p>Currently, mining companies are forced to share data through insecure channels, such as email, and customize data to meet specific requests. Buyers, auditors, and regulators must take companies at their word that the data is accurate. These challenges have resulted in a lack of trust in reported data, especially in complex international supply chains.</p>



<p>Equipped with the Mines Act Permit and TSM report, a mining company, such as <a href="https://cumtn.com/">Copper Mountain Mining Corporation</a>, can easily prove that they are operating legally, and their sustainability claims are backed by audited data. Since digital credentials can be shared with multiple audiences with just a few clicks, Copper Mountain can immediately share this information internationally, increasing efficiency, transparency, and trust as they participate in&nbsp;</p>



 

 



<p>COLLABORATIVE ACTION: INTEROPERABLE TECHNOLOGY</p>



<p>Interoperable technology is essential to EMDT’s expansion. During the pilot phase, EMDT developed a tool called Traction, based on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a>. Hyperledger Aries maximizes Traction’s interoperability with the technology solutions that exist globally. Traction will be utilized by the Government of British Columbia to send and receive digital credentials, including the Mines Act Permit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EMDT has built a network of technology partners offering wallet solutions that enhance information exchange even further. Any wallets built on Hyperledger Aries can seamlessly exchange digital credentials. Technology providers such as <a href="https://northernblock.io/">Northern Block</a>, whose enterprise wallet is also built using Hyperledger Aries, demonstrate how both private and public sector solutions integrate to maximize impact for end users. EMDT’s participants can leverage any interoperable tool of their choice, while maintaining security and efficiency in credential exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GOING GLOBAL: SCALING TO INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAINS&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust project will produce increasing value for participants as it grows in scale and scope. To facilitate this, EMDT is leading joint activities with the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (<a href="https://unece.org/trade/uncefact">UN/CEFACT</a>) through the <a href="https://uncefact.unece.org/display/uncefactpublic/Critical+Minerals+Traceability+and+Sustainability">Critical Minerals Traceability &amp; Sustainability project</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through this work, EMDT and UN/CEFACT will leverage the findings of EMDT’s use cases to showcase the value of digital trust technology. This collective action will build upon the UN/CEFACT’s capacity to develop and deliver digital standards and best practices for sustainable supply chains. A focus on interoperable open-source technology can help to overcome barriers to adoption and encourage global participation and collaboration in line with UN/CEFACT’s guidelines for successful traceability initiatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CONCLUSION</p>



<p>As EMDT’s ecosystem of participants grows, so do opportunities to digitize verifiable data from across various operations, streamline business processes, and collaborate towards climate action goals.&nbsp;EMDT demonstrates how digitalization has the potential to improve the international exchange of critical data while prioritizing privacy and data security for suppliers and operators.

<p>We just finished the pilot of our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/applications-are-open-learn-how-to-bring-a-responsible-data-approach-to-your-work-with-our-cohort-learning-programme/" title="">new cohort learning programme</a>, designed to equip social justice leaders with the knowledge and tools needed for implementing responsible data! Back in April, my colleague Bárbara wrote about <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/updates-from-our-responsible-data-cohort-learning-programme/" title="">the first half of the programme</a> and in this blog post, I’m sharing updates and learnings as we wrap up this pilot.</p>



 Getting practical&nbsp; 



<p>Our hope for this programme was for participants to not just understand why practising Responsible Data is important, but also to get a sense of what RD actually looks like in their day-to-day work. With this in mind, in the last two weeks of the programme we shifted to more practical applications of responsible data in participants’ work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the fourth session we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">became ‘RAD’</a> and covered how to map an organisation’s data and set up&nbsp;practices for data retention, archival and deletion (RAD). Participants walked away with templates and processes that they can continue to iterate on with their teams and incorporate into their own organisational processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the fifth session we talked about how participants can begin to think about their data and RD practices at the systems level,&nbsp;using assessment frameworks to determine where they were at currently, developing plans for next steps, and determining progress made. We also took some time to talk about how participants will incorporate these new learnings into tech tool selection.&nbsp;</p>



 Where we are: a few takeaways from the second half of the programme 



<p>During the course, I was able to chat with some of the participants individually, through one-on-one calls. Originally, the purpose of these calls was to provide additional Responsible Data guidance outside of class time for those that were interested. However, these calls also opened my eyes to the amazing work already being done by our participants. More about this in our next blog post!</p>



 Making everyday tweaks to how teams work with data, and celebrating “tiny victories”, can be powerful moves toward establishing a sustainable RD approach &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>For some participants,&nbsp;their next step will be to get their team and peer organisations more involved and to get buy-in for moves towards more robust RD practices. For these organisations, sharing the importance of RD and implementing small, immediate actions that will give the organisation ‘tiny wins’ may provide the momentum for the organisation to continue to move forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, while thinking through their RAD plan in Module 4 – which asked participants to think about the what, who, how and why of their data processes – one organisation mentioned that simply acknowledging and looking at the potential unintended consequences of working with data was in itself an invaluable process and extremely eye-opening.&nbsp;</p>



 Not a checklist: seeing responsible data as an ongoing practice 



<p>As part of the final module, we asked participants to plan out the data journey they intended to take after completing the course. Participants planned out their short-, mid-, and long term goals, but more importantly also acknowledged that their participation in this programme was just a part of the journey, and that there was still much work to be done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One organisation planned to speak to their funders in order to make sure they were aligned when it came to data collection and sharing. By remaining cognizant of the fact that adopting responsible data practices is a continuous learning process, and by prioritising daily practice over achieving a final ‘endpoint’, organisations can continue to make progress.</p>



 Taking one step at a time and getting ready to dive deeper&nbsp; 



<p>I found that although many organisations have already begun practising responsible data (RD) in some capacity, they often lack clear guidance and resources to take their efforts to the next level. For example, while preparing RAD plans together in Module 4 we learned that many of our participants had already developed guidelines around the data they collect, but could benefit from more information on securing and deleting it. In Module 5, we dived further into what implementing these changes might look like when it comes to the platforms participants are using, or could be using, in their day to day work.</p>



 What’s next?&nbsp; 



<p>In the coming weeks you can expect to hear from us on how we put this programme together, as well as our learnings from the experience. We’ll also go into the factors that went into the selection of the topic and participants, as well as considerations around the technologies used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Energy Web will leverage Polkadot’s interoperable multichain technology to bring decarbonization to&nbsp;Web3 <p>LONDON, ZUG, June 20, 2023 — <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web</a>, the world’s largest ecosystem of companies using open source, decentralized technologies to accelerate the energy transition, is coming to <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a>, the next-generation blockchain network powering the movement for a better web. The move will allow Energy Web to create the framework for a new technology, Energy Web X, helping its partners — which include major players like Shell, Vodafone, Volkswagen, and RMI — accelerate their decarbonization strategies.</p><p>Having developed digital solutions with dozens of major energy companies and nonprofit organizations from more than 25 countries, Energy Web is focused on two key areas. One is to help electric utilities digitize and integrate distributed energy resources to the grid; the second is about bringing deep levels of transparency and verifiability to emerging green product supply chains — including 24/7 matched renewable electricity, sustainable aviation fuel, and sustainably produced&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><blockquote>Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web, said: “Energy Web and our global enterprise partners are collectively on a mission to make clean energy an integral and widely-accessible part of the global electricity system. To achieve this important goal, we decided to search for a blockchain platform that offers real enterprise-grade security and seamless upgradeability to ensure a safe and future-proof environment. Polkadot excels on both of these fronts with its shared security model and best-in-class core technology. We couldn’t be more excited to build out the energy transition vertical on Polkadot. Energy Web X will be based on worker node networks. Each of these is a decentralized group of computers jointly executing sensitive business processes that involve or impact multiple companies. Enterprises will be able to deploy thousands of independent worker nodes, coordinate them in cohesive networks, and allow the public to verify the results of their&nbsp;work.”</blockquote><blockquote>Björn Wagner, CEO of Parity Technologies, a leading contributor to the Polkadot network, said: “The energy transition vertical is a perfect use case to take advantage of the the benefits of blockchain technology, and it’s a space where Polkadot is well positioned to be a market leader. We’re especially pleased to see Polkadot bring competitive advantages to initiatives and enterprises making a positive environmental and social impact. In choosing to build a custom Polkadot parachain, Energy Web will get the performance and security its industry partners require, as well as faster time to market and access to Polkadot’s best-in-class interoperability. I’m excited to partner with the Energy Web team to accelerate the transition to clean&nbsp;energy.”</blockquote><p>Energy Web is launching a bid for a parachain slot on Polkadot with the joint aim of building a thriving ecosystem focused on the global energy transition. Further details about Energy Web X’s plans will follow at <a href="https://polkadot.network/ecosystem/events/decoded-2023/">Polkadot Decoded</a>, the network’s flagship summit, to be held in Copenhagen, June 28–29. Ana Trbovich, vice chair of the Energy Web Foundation, will also appear on a regulatory panel at the&nbsp;event.</p><p>This announcement follows hot on the heels of others involving big names from diverse sectors like music, gaming and accounting joining the Polkadot ecosystem. The Energy Web X parachain will join the many other projects that are already building on the Polkadot Relay Chain. By the end of Q1, a total of 42 parachains had joined Polkadot, representing sectors such as DeFi, privacy, social media, sustainability, NFTs, gaming, and the metaverse. Many of these parachains are platforms in themselves, collectively hosting hundreds of Web3 applications.</p><p>Parachains help projects expand at scale by leveraging each other’s strengths to unlock new use cases, and enjoy the shared security advantages provided by Polkadot.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers.

<p>We recently interviewed Otto Mora, Business Development Lead in the Americas for PolygonID and discovered more about their platform and vision. The full interview can also be viewed on <a href="https://youtu.be/U7ObwVh5DAc?ref=blog.identity.foundation">YouTube</a></p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Thanks for joining us today Otto. Really glad to have you here today representing Polygon ID. Before we get further into the details of Polygon ID and what you guys are up to, I'd like to hear a little bit about yourself. Can you give our audience a little bit of an introduction of who you are and how you came to the decentralized identity space?</p><p>OTTO MORA: Yeah, Absolutely. I'm originally from San Jose, Costa Rica. My original exposure to decentralized identity, and I guess SSI was in early 2016 at a ConsenSys Conference in New York, where I remember Christopher Allen was first talking about identity 2020, and you know, bringing in the concept of SSI. It just became clear to me that solving identity on blockchain, specifically blockchain ecosystems was a hugely important thing that would really help out blockchain adoption.</p><p>So, I first became conscious of that back then. &nbsp;It kind of stayed in the back of my mind and I followed various decentralized identity projects such as uPort. &nbsp;I think I applied like seven times to work at uPort, but it didn't come through. I did eventually get into web3 full time around 2018. &nbsp;I was working at EY leading a team of developers, and I kind of got engaged with the community in Costa Rica and I was a founding member of the Costa Rican Blockchain Association.</p><p>We did the first Ethereum Hackathon and all that kind of eventually led into getting into Polygon. That original knowledge around identity and some of the things we did at EY helped me get into PolygonID and leveraging ZK (zero-knowledge) technology for identity.</p><p>That's a little bit about my story and yeah, I really feel fortunate to be in this space and it's been super interesting.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Yeah, great and I know I spoke to you a few weeks ago, and I asked you a little bit of the story of Polygon ID, but you didn't tell me the whole story. So I've been waiting for this moment to hear it, because it really is interesting, some of the background. Can you give us a little bit on that?</p><p>OTTO MORA: Yeah, absolutely. &nbsp;You know, back then it was called Hermez Identity and it’s actually quite fascinating. All three founders, Jordi Baylina, Anthony Martin and David Schwartz are all from Barcelona, Catalonia Spain. As you know there's some tensions between the regions in Spain and the central government, and Catalonia is no exception. Catalonia back then was heavily into this independence referendum that they were trying to do, and tried to make it kind of a demonstrable referendum to convince people that there was a chance to be independent.</p><p>They started playing with the idea of an online referendum using blockchain technology. So that's when the identity project was born. How do we do identity on top of a blockchain system to be able to do this voting that they wanted to do? All of that kind of came to “You know what? The blockchain actually doesn't scale quite well, the transactions per second are not that great.” That led them to founding another initiative, in addition to the Iden3 initiative which was called Hermez.</p><p>Both initiatives kind of matured over time, and eventually Polygon was looking to acquire companies. Polygon actually got started a little bit earlier than them. They got started around 2017 or so and they had been looking at scaling blockchains, they had looked at the original proof of stake blockchain. They were now looking for the next iteration of that. What's the next scaling solution that they can bring to the market? Then they kind of stumbled upon the Hermes project at a conference in Paris. Eventually they agreed to acquire Hermez and bring them into Polygon.</p><p>Then both of those things came together. So both the Hermez project, which is like the zkEVM scaling project that was there, as well as the Iden3 project, which is also kind of an a project that Polygon decided to just embrace and then build Polygon ID using all of the Iden3 technology that was really developed by Jordi and the team in Catalonia.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: That's so fascinating. That's why I really love hearing the stories of these various companies because a lot of times it's not a linear path. There was a problem they were trying to solve, and it led into a new enterprise. So that's really fascinating. One thing that I'm curious to hear, if I were someone coming to Polygon ID and I wanted to use your services, what would be my journey into the Polygon ID ecosystem?</p><p>[Link to video on youtube:<a href="https://youtu.be/U7ObwVh5DAc?t=332&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation"> https://youtu.be/U7ObwVh5DAc?t=332</a>]</p><p>OTTO MORA: &nbsp; There's various items that we have. I'll just share my screen to kind of show you a little bit of a walkthrough of what that looks like, and a little bit of the features of our DID method. The polygon ID protocol is a protocol that aims to keep user’s privacy. We have a DID method and our DID method has various features such as key rotation, it allows you to do a private revocation, it allows you to manage profiles so users can have multiple profiles that they can expose. If you're interacting with a verifier, you can choose which profile to use and independent of that, you can use any of the credentials that were issued to you. It also has CKQuery language which allows verifiers to ask questions about the profiles, and then present those credentials and generate proofs to respond to the questions from the verifier.</p><p>We have a couple of methods to issue credentials, one that is kind of gas-less, and another one that enables on-chain, which is the MTP Method. (Merkle Tree Proof) It also uses Baby JubJub keys for optimized generation of ZK proofs in mobile devices. And then an interesting thing for anybody looking to use our DID method is that It's EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible, the DID method could be used in any kind of EVM chain, and it's also fully open source under an MIT Apache license. The heart of the protocol is really that you have a verifiable credential, the credential will say, a few attributes about your identity. Maybe it'll have information about your date of birth. Maybe it'll have information about your country of citizenship, it could have information about your credit score. Then you'll interact with the verifier, the verifier will ask a set of questions around that set of credentials that you have in your wallet and then in order to answer those questions, you'll be generating a zero-knowledge proof directly from your device be it your mobile phone or be it your browser that you're using to interact with the blockchain at that point.</p><p>So you generate those proofs, and then in doing so, you present those proofs to the verifier. They can check the validity of those proofs. They can check that the data is correct. What you've done now at this point is that you reveal just enough information to answer the questions from the verifier instead of the whole credential data. So this is the famous thing in centralized identity. &nbsp;Show me that you're over 18 without telling me where you live, what's your full name and where you were born? All these things are just not revealed, but just the specific answers to the question that is being asked by the verifier. This is the heart of the protocol, this is kind of the innovation that we bring.</p><p>If it's okay with you, I can show you a brief video of what that looks like and kind of just a more practical use case.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Sure that'd be great.</p><p>OTTO MORA: Let me just jump into that. This is just a quick sample demo of what this looks like. [Link to demo: https://youtu.be/U7ObwVh5DAc?t=516] This is just showing you our polygon ID application. It's a sample application. We are enabling multiple wallet providers to integrate with us.</p><p>At this point this is just the wallet creation process. You’re creating your wallet. You're getting it set up for the first time. You have no credentials inside of your wallet. You're now going to go to a website that's going to issue you credentials. So the first step is connecting your wallet. You're connecting your wallet to get the basic authentication. &nbsp;Now that the authentication has been done, now your wallet is connected.</p><p>At this point, you may be asked to show some credential data. Maybe if it's a university, if you passed a test, maybe some other thing. Whatever set of data is required by the issuer in order to be able to offer you the claim. It could be an identity verification process, it could be any sort of thing. Eventually the verification is successful, and then you're offered a set of claims. So now you continue to add claims. You can see that QR code there that has the claims that you are now able to scan with your device.</p><p>You're seeing that now a set of claims are being offered, one is a proof of personhood. Another claim is showing you as a member of a DAO. Another claim is your date of birth and then another claim is your country of residence. These claims are just like a set of credentials or cards that are stored in your wallet at this point and the claims get added.</p><p>Now you can go into the wallet app and you can see these purple cards in there. These various credentials that were issued to you and the data that's inside of them. So now you have those credentials and now we're going to actually make use of the credentials. Now is that process of interacting with the verifier being asked the question and then satisfying that. So now we're going to go into this sample DAO interface, which is Grail. We're going to connect our wallet just like we did the last time.</p><p>Now we're going into voting for a proposal. So for voting for the proposal, here's a kind of proposal that we want to vote on, but before we can vote we have to prove our eligibility to vote. In order to vote we're now being asked, prove to me that you're a member of this DAO. So from the various credentials that we have, we're now going to use one of them, and we're going to answer the question, are you a member of this DAO? Yes or no. That is kind of what's going to trigger now, this cryptographic proof generation in which now you can generate the proof to answer your question from the verifier. Once the proof is generated, you can now vote.</p><p>Now you've successfully voted on the DAO. So that's just kind of illustrating a little bit of that process of, you have a credential that's issued to you, you go to a verifier, and you would get asked a bunch of questions about your credentials to generate some proofs on your device. Then you've successfully revealed data about your credentials without revealing the full credential. So that’s the main kind of innovation that we bring. That’s a little bit of the flow of what that looks like.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Okay, and this can be used in various contexts as well, such as credentials for workplace, credentials for education? Could also be applied in those cases as well?</p><p>OTTO MORA: Our intention is that you could go with the number of verifiers and reveal data about yourself. Prove to me that you're a graduate of a computer science degree, yes or no. That kind of question. Or prove to me that your credit score is between 500 and 600 and that makes you eligible for a loan or something like that.</p><p>Then we have other more elaborate ones. Maybe you're at a traffic stop and you're interacting with a cop, and you use your phone with an NFT and you quickly answer yes or no to a bunch of questions such as; is your car’s kind of insurance up to date? Do you have the proper registration? Is your license not expired? You're able to answer all those questions very quickly, generating a proof without revealing more data than what's required.</p><p>So yeah, it's use cases like that where we envision this being used. Both web3 and web2 use cases. Within web3 we think DAOs, these online cooperatives, would benefit a lot from this. Defi protocols as well, looking to do some KYC, things like that. But there's also web2 use cases. We’re starting with web3 that's our initial focus area, but we want to go further than that, if possible.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Can you share a little bit about your business model? I know people are always curious about that. How are you going to market at this point?</p><p>OTTO MORA: It's fully open source. We don't really charge for Polygon ID. At this point we see it more as a complement to the Polygon ecosystem. We're not intending to directly monetize the identity protocol, but it's more just a reason for people to build on top of the Polygon blockchain. We get additional incentives and revenue by more people using our blockchain, we get more fees, and that helps everybody in the ecosystem. So that's a little bit of why this is being released fully open source, and as a benefit to the community at Polygon.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: I know you have been involved in our community over the past few months. Polygon ID joined as a DIF member earlier this year, and you've been involved in some of the various work groups. Can you share a little bit about what are some of the work items that you followed and integrated into some of the work at Polygon ID?</p><p>OTTO MORA: We have various items from the DIF that we are already integrated with or are intending to do integration with or engagement. So one of them is the DIF Universal Resolver, [https://dev.uniresolver.io/] which we've already implemented and I know Marcus was nice enough to review it for us, so very thankful for that. We are intending to support the well known DID configuration. It's in our roadmap along with creating more trust in the ecosystem of who are the issuers, trust registries and things of that nature. We're also looking to get some support for Credential Manifest. [<a href="https://identity.foundation/credential-manifest/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://identity.foundation/credential-manifest/</a>] It's this thing called output descriptors that provide guidance for wallets on how to display the credential cards, what logo to use, what color to use when displaying. That was brought to our attention by Thierry from the AltMe wallet. We’re open to input on the product and adopting these standards is important to us where we see it makes sense.</p><p>Then from the last Internet Identity Workshop I saw this work around the standard wallet container that's being led by Sam Curren. That's also something that's of interest to us. We do have a growing ecosystem of wallets, and we ideally would want them to follow standards and bring data vaults and things of that nature.</p><p>So that's something that we're also looking to engage with. We're open to more, and it's all about building together in the community with the folks at DIF so we're looking forward to contributing.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Then my little side plug is to anyone who's viewing, you can get involved in these work items at DIF. We are an open-source community, and we also have membership options, so you can join and get involved in that. [<a href="https://identity.foundation./join?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://Identity.foundation/join</a>}</p><p>The other thing I wanted to ask is in terms of the vision of Polygon ID. Where do you guys see things going in the next 5-10 years? How do you see some of the work that you're doing, impacting the economy and the way we do things?</p><p>OTTO MORA: Absolutely, I think for us it's solving at least in the more immediate term the need for identity verification in the web3 space, solving identity for DAOs, solving identity for Defi protocols and getting more adoption from the various wallet providers. I think that the issue perhaps now is, people don't really care so much about privacy or keeping their data private as much. I think over time that'll change. So I think maybe we're a little bit early with this whole ZK Technology, that some people are happy to show their full credentials and be done with it, they'll say they'll have nothing to hide.</p><p>But I think over time privacy will become more and more relevant, and we see this as one tool that will get people to care about it and be able to implement privacy.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: If there are any companies out there who are interested in working with Polygon ID, should they get in touch with you? What would be the easiest way for them to do that?</p><p>OTTO MORA: They can get in touch with me, also on Twitter as well my handle is @ottomorac [<a href="https://twitter.com/ottomorac?s=20&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://twitter.com/ottomorac?s=20</a>] Also we have a Discord channel on the Polygon site that you can access. [https://discord.gg/0xpolygon]</p><p>If you want to get in touch with our Business Development team for Polygon ID, you can do so as well from the Polygon website. [https://polygon.technology/contact-us] You go to Polygon ID, and then there's a contact form there.</p><p>If you have specific questions, or if you want to engage with us because you have a project, or you have a wallet, and you would like to talk to us, that's another way to engage with us.</p><p>Then, finally we're also open to code contributions. It's fully open source, so if somebody has a unique feature they would like to contribute to us, we're definitely open to that. We can do a pull request on Github as well if you have something you want to contribute.</p><p>LIMARI NAVARRETE: Sounds great, and for our viewers I'll make sure to have all those links in the notes on our Youtube Channel as well. It was great having you today Otto and hearing more about Polygon ID and your journey as well, and I'll &nbsp;also encourage our listeners if you get a chance, go to our website<a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> https://identity.foundation</a> as well to join and become a member.</p><p>Thank you so much once again Otto and if anyone else joins in the community you can you'll be able to see Otto there as well.</p><p>OTTO MORA: Awesome. Thank you.</p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., June 16, 2023 –&nbsp; The <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3574062-1&amp;h=1964299261&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fidoalliance.org%2F&amp;a=FIDO+Alliance">FIDO Alliance</a> announced today that two of its specifications, FIDO UAF 1.2 and CTAP 2.1, are recognized as international standards by the <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Pages/default.aspx">International Telecommunication Union’s Telecommunication Standardization Sector</a> (ITU-T). This milestone establishes these standards as official ITU standards (ITU-T Recommendations) for the global infrastructure of information and communication technologies (ICT).</p>



<p>ITU-T is the standardization arm of ITU, the United Nations specialized agency for ICT. The FIDO Alliance specifications were approved as official ITU-T Recommendations by ITU members including national administrations and the world’s front-running ICT companies. The new ITU-T Recommendations are under the responsibility of ITU’s standardization expert group for security, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=h2uksEW6vztNCZspihTRhrVWtNNbUo0tPRk0YHzGEM-yo7JS7O56YYzuluDXWTsE3QwhOCS2ujB3BqL8I8vjsBzZ5vQ-g61N2X2Q1NGRFbXag2fPyu3zqKwgvAwlSC-XUuE96CPNujODt2rdmRRpyg==">ITU-T Study Group 17</a>.</p>



<p>“The FIDO Alliance is improving online authentication through open standards based on public key cryptography that make authentication stronger and easier to use than passwords or one-time passcodes. One of the ways that we fulfill this mission is by submitting our mature technical specifications to internationally recognized standards groups like ITU-T for formal standardization,” said David Turner, senior director of standards development at the FIDO Alliance. “This recognition from ITU-T illustrates the maturity of FIDO authentication technology and complements our web standardization work with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).”</p>



<p>“Predecessors of these FIDO UAF and CTAP specifications were first adopted as ITU standards in 2018. ITU-T Study Group 17 will continue to strengthen its collaboration with the FIDO Alliance. These two FIDO Alliance specifications, adopted as ITU standards recently, are being widely used in various industries such as the financial sector to provide strong online authentication based on public key cryptography and various user verification methods,” said Heung Youl Youm, Chairman of ITU-T Study Group 17. “These new ITU standards will provide a concrete basis for the two FIDO specifications to be adopted across the 193 ITU Member States.”</p>



<p>“Our working group within ITU-T Study Group 17 was pleased to be able to collaborate with the FIDO Alliance to promote the standardization of state-of-the-art security technologies,” said Abbie Barbir, Rapporteur for ITU-T’s working group on ‘Identity management and telebiometrics architecture and mechanisms’ (<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0vqmC84tYiwa2gXDiKhL_u0vrU7nmpak1cKMTTXa_gJl3VNJ7a-DU_yOSxi1IQTcZLP6bu27UY2s_UyrK5LVEvLN95Xl4vCtp9kwMjN_gUdRC29joDmh--9rjLN0BsVA">Q10/17</a>). “This work will help address and solve the security limitations of passwords and move the world closer to passwordless solutions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The specifications that are now ITU-T Recommendations are:</p>



 
 FIDO UAF 1.2 (Recommendation ITU-T <a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-x/recommendation.asp?lang=en&amp;parent=T-REC-X.1277.2">X.1277.2</a>). A mobile standard providing authentication without passwords by using biometrics and other modalities to authenticate users to their local device. 



 CTAP 2.1 (Recommendation ITU-T <a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-x/recommendation.asp?lang=en&amp;parent=T-REC-X.1278.2">X.1278.2</a>). Part of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2 specifications</a> along with the W3C Web Authentication standard,&nbsp; allows the use of external authenticators (FIDO Security Keys, mobile devices) for authentication on FIDO2-enabled browsers and operating systems over USB, NFC, or BLE for a passwordless, second-factor or multi-factor authentication experience.

<p>As we navigate the fallout of the global health crisis, governments worldwide have proposed solutions to ensure public health safety and restore normality. Among these, health passports stand out as a prominent tool in managing the pandemic. The planned Government-Issued Health Passport and the German Gesundheitpass are significant examples of this development. However, while these initiatives might seem beneficial, they raise considerable ethical, privacy, and equality concerns. In contrast, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) presents an alternative that could provide a more democratic, secure, and equitable solution.</p>


 
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/lionsgate.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/health-passport.jpg?ssl=1"></a> 


<p>Government-Issued Health Passport and the Gesundheitpass, although different in name, serve a similar purpose. They aim to document and certify an individual’s health status concerning COVID-19. However, the data collection, storage, and usage that these systems demand pose significant challenges.</p>



<p>A Government-Issued Health Passport system could potentially place immense power and sensitive data into the hands of governmental authorities. This data, beyond the control of the individual, could be susceptible to misuse, raising valid concerns about privacy and surveillance. This implementation may inadvertently result in an invasive surveillance system under the disguise of public health safety.</p>



<p>Similarly, the German Gesundheitpass, despite being well-intentioned, does not escape these privacy concerns. The scale of data collection and potential for tracking that it allows can also give rise to a surveillance state. Furthermore, being digital, it assumes an even level of digital literacy and access, which is far from reality, particularly for the elderly and socio-economically disadvantaged populations.</p>



<p>Moreover, both systems can lead to a divide between those who can access vaccines or tests, and thus the passport, and those who cannot. Consequently, this can result in a bifurcated society, where the passport holders enjoy more freedoms than those without.</p>



<p>The alternative solution to these issues lies in the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). SSI provides individuals with control over their personal data, offering a secure, democratic, and inclusive system for verifying health status. It upholds the principles of privacy and equity, presenting a significant advantage over the Government-Issued Health Passport and Gesundheitpass.</p>



<p>SSI operates on the principle of decentralized identities, with users retaining control over their personal data. In the context of health passports, an SSI-based system would allow individuals to prove their health status without revealing more information than necessary. The possibility of surveillance diminishes significantly, as the underlying health data remains private.</p>



<p>Moreover, SSI’s approach can help bridge the digital divide. It doesn’t require extensive digital literacy and can be adapted to various interfaces, making it accessible to a wider population. This inclusive solution respects the privacy and autonomy of all individuals, reducing systemic biases and discrimination risks.</p>



<p>The technology underpinning SSI, typically blockchain, provides a secure, tamper-proof system for verifying identities and claims. It enhances trust in the system, even in the absence of a central authority.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while the Government-Issued Health Passport and Gesundheitpass may seem to offer a solution to managing the pandemic, they carry the risk of increasing surveillance, perpetuating inequality, and undermining privacy. In contrast, SSI offers a promising alternative, putting the control of personal data back into the hands of individuals. This approach respects individual autonomy, promotes equality, and ensures privacy – a far cry from the inherent concerns of the health passports. As we navigate these complexities, we must prioritize solutions that uphold both public health and personal freedoms. SSI is a promising step in this direction.</p>

<p>Why PNC Opted for FIDO</p>



<p>Security is of critical importance to PNC and its customers. PNC’s approach to provide digital services is founded on a strong commitment to privacy protection to those who use its services. Multi-factor authentication is a key component to protecting customer identities and data, and FIDO’s standard helped provide a roadmap to implementation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, PNC has been able to provide customers authentication options that are easy to use but still afford consistency in terms of protection. This translates into high-quality identity assurance to verify and validate that the right customer is enrolled and minimize the risk of impersonation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We needed to find a way to create a user-friendly mechanism to improve customer security without creating a burdensome process that required so many steps that it dissuaded customers from enrolling or engaging,” said Susan Koski, Chief Information Security Officer at PNC.</p>



<p>Benefits Realized</p>



<p>By using FIDO standards, PNC has been able to manage the authentication experience in such a way that it leverages the security features of a customer’s device, applying industry best practices for designing this identity protection mechanism.&nbsp;Ultimately, FIDO standards have been a core component to PNC’s cybersecurity strategy to minimize the risk of authorized access to customer credentials.</p>



<p>“We continue to identify ways to improve security for our customers, ultimately reducing the reliance on passwords and other phishable credentials from our ecosystem is a critical aspect to protecting our customers” Koski said.</p>

<p>The OASIS Board of Directors are integral to the organization's success. Read our Q&amp;A to gain a better sense of who they are and why they serve the OASIS community.</p> 


<p>Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bretjordan/">Bret Jordan</a>, an accomplished executive with 30 years of experience in the field of cybersecurity. Jordan has successfully led various global enterprises, startups, academic institutions and nonprofits. At OASIS Open, he has made significant contributions as a co-chair, editor, and advocate for numerous standards, including STIX, TAXII, CACAO, and OpenC2. In recognition of his expertise and the impact he’s had in his field, Jordan was honored as an OASIS Distinguished Contributor in 2020. Read more in our Q&amp;A:</p>



<p>Can you tell us about your current role?<br>I currently work as Chief Security Strategist at <a href="https://www.afero.io/">Afero</a>, a technology company building a secure by design or born secure IoT platform as a service (PaaS). We provide an enterprise grade, end-to-end secure solution for consumer IoT products. My role is to work on strategy, long-term horizon scanning, and those parts of the product that deal with end-to-end security.&nbsp;<br><br>What kinds of things is your company working on?&nbsp;<br>Afero was the first to build a comprehensive and managed IoT platform upon a foundation of Enterprise-grade PKI. Security is a “red thread” woven through and connecting every layer of the platform — it’s not just a feature, it is an intrinsic quality. We have made substantial advancements in this field, evident by our impressive portfolio of approximately 100 patents which serve as undeniable evidence of our continuous commitment to innovation.</p>



<p>There are several things that make us unique, one of which is our patented onboarding solution that does not require Bluetooth pairing. You simply scan the QR code for the product, turn it on, and it is done. This means, in most cases, devices are online and working in seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Afero’s customers is The Home Depot. Afero has built the secure IoT platform for all of their private label brands: EcoSmart, Defiant, Hampton Bay, etc. The program and ecosystem is called Hubspace, and that is also the name of the app. We provide an enterprise grade end-to-end secure solution for their IoT products all the way down to constrained light bulbs. Because of the Afero solution, The Home Depot has experienced a significantly lower customer call volume and product return rate for their Hubspace products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One simple but meaningful use case for smart and connected bulbs is that you can easily change the color temperature of the bulbs to make them all match or have them automatically turn on or off with the rising or setting of the sun. With Hubspace these pain points are removed. Ten years ago, this would’ve been viewed as a premium service or something that only tech enthusiasts would have utilized. Five years ago, if you wanted a smart and connected light bulb you would have had to pay a significant premium. Today, this functionality is available to everyone. You can even control these products directly from your phone or a voice assistant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we have seen is that the average user just wants to plug in their smart devices and have them just work. They do not want to try and cobble together a bunch of random products and technologies; they want a simple to use ecosystem. Afero has addressed this problem and these pain points and invented technology to solve it.</p>



<p>What can you tell us about your new podcast?&nbsp;<br>We’ve recently launched a podcast called <a href="https://www.afero.io/html/home/smartereverything.html">Smarter Everything</a>. The premise is to talk about the transition to a smarter and more connected world as we begin to bring more connectedness into our daily lives. I like to refer to it as the hyperconnected edge that we’re moving to. It’s where things are going, and there’s a lot that needs to happen before we can get there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the industry moves down this path and consumers deploy these technologies and products, there are many things that need to be considered to ensure that end users are protected, and their privacy is maintained. The widespread availability and minimal additional expense of IoT products has made the smart and connected world available to everyone; we’ve reached the point where people are eager to buy these products and we want consumers to be informed about not only the benefits they provide, but how they can utilize them in a more secure and productive way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did you get involved with OASIS?<br>My journey into international standards started many years before I joined OASIS, back in the late 1990s/early 2000s with the 802.1X protocol and its various EAP methods. Then in the mid 2010s I started working on the Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) and Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) work when it was still at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I subsequently joined OASIS when DHS moved the STIX and TAXII work there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once STIX and TAXII were at OASIS I became heavily involved. I ended up chairing a lot of the STIX and TAXII work for about eight years. I also served as an editor of the documents and helped coordinate and orchestrate the comments and feedback that came in from the group. The STIX and TAXII community at OASIS was incredibly active with around 350 members at one point. I also worked on the Open Command and Control (OpenC2) when it was a National Security Agency (NSA) project and continued working on it when it was first brought to OASIS. These three projects really got me involved in OASIS. I have since gone on to co-start the Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) for Cyber Security work.</p>



<p>What inspired you to join the OASIS Board?&nbsp;<br>After working on STIX and TAXII, I knew that I wanted to enhance my contributions and better serve the OASIS community. My goal was to foster stronger connections between the board and the membership. My intention was to enable members to gain deeper insights into ongoing activities and enable them to provide valuable feedback to help drive change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once I joined the OASIS Board Process Committee, I helped facilitate not only my changes, but changes from everybody else. I wanted to address the issues that members cared about. As chair of the Process Committee, I have instigated a transition to an open model using GitHub for our document creation and tracking. This way, OASIS members can submit issues or even do pull requests. We’re really trying to connect the board back to the membership because ultimately the OASIS membership is the foundation of the organization.</p>



<p>How do you see your background and experience complementing the current board?&nbsp;<br>My background has been in cybersecurity; I have been working in this space for about 30 years on the academic side and the enterprise side. I understand how to run very large projects and programs – things that take months, quarters, or years to complete. My day-to-day experiences span from the operational side to the management side and to the research side, which adds a unique combination for the work we do here at OASIS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everybody has their own little bit of expertise that they bring to the board and it’s all incredibly important and valuable. I think my expertise stands out because I’ve had the opportunity to work closely with other standards development organizations (SDOs) and standards setting organizations (SSOs), gaining valuable insights into their problem-solving approaches, and learning what works and does not work at scale for standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is it about the OASIS community that you’re passionate about?&nbsp;<br>I like OASIS because it’s a true community with a sense of purpose and an organizational structure that lets groups get work done. Not every SDO or SSO is like that; a lot of them have controlling autocracies where a couple of individuals tend to drive the conversation and stomp out ideas they do not personally like. OASIS doesn’t tend to feel like that. Most of the groups here at OASIS are very true to the form of traditional standards that are driven by consensus. Meaning, it’s not unanimity, and not everybody gets a pony. The rules and processes at OASIS are much more conducive to getting people around the table and getting actual work done. OASIS processes are not heavy handed and do not lend themselves to having one person control everything; there is no benevolent dictator for life in a TC at OASIS. Also, at OASIS, there is a process and a plan for what it takes to actually get something done, and members understand this. They also understand the amount of work and effort that is needed to bring a standard to completion. In other SDOs and SSOs this can be vague and up to the whims of certain individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why do you think companies and organizations bring their projects to OASIS?&nbsp;<br>OASIS provides a mechanism for organizations to get like-minded people together and get work done in a meaningful way. Other SDOs have antiquated mechanisms that either prevent success, are designed to stall success, or enable a very small group of individuals to control the destiny of what gets started and ultimately worked on. OASIS is a bit more nimble. It is not perfect, but in a lot of ways it is better than many SDOs. The benefit of bringing work to OASIS is you get the great governance and IPR protections that come along with going through an official SDO, and OASIS makes it easy. If I have an idea and there are enough people interested and willing to support it, we can join forces and start working on it, it is that simple. Try doing that in another SDO or SSO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What do you think about the work being done at OASIS?&nbsp;<br>There’s a lot of great projects that people know about, but do not realize they come from OASIS. Things like SAML, XACML (the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language), STIX and TAXII, CACAO (the cybersecurity playbook or the Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations), and OpenC2. All of these things are focused around solving real world problems in operational cybersecurity – and they all came out of OASIS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can you share some examples of the impact of your work?<br>STIX, TAXII, and CACAO are the biggest projects that I’ve contributed to here at OASIS. But I have done work in the IEEE, IETF, and ITU-T. I have also written an RFC (RFC 8785) about JSON canonicalization, which enables digital signing of JSON data. I am also currently working on a contribution to the X series documents (e.g., X.500, X.509) at the ITU-T for the actual signing of JSON data. This is desperately needed as most of the data that’s transmitted today over the internet or through browsers is JSON based and there is currently no good way to digitally sign it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early on in my career I was involved in another noteworthy project. I worked on an 802.1X supplicant, the actual client piece of an 802.1X session, and we built the first widescale 802.1X roaming network which became the foundation for the idea of what is now called Eduroam. We wrote a white paper at the University of Utah about it, and the creators of Eduroam read our white paper and basically made a bigger version. We had this idea and called it out in our white paper. We talked about it in the context of Universities being able to crosslink authentication and do local authorization but remote authentication at the university of your choice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you have any role models that helped you in your career?&nbsp;<br>There have been a few people over the years. I started my career in academia, designing, running, and building very large networks on high performance academic grid systems. I’ve also worked in startups and large enterprises. The three people that have inspired me the most and helped me early on in my career were two of my supervisors and one co-worker. One was Hugh Thompson, former CTO at Blue Coat and Symantec, and current chair of the RSA Conference. The second person was Joe Levy. I worked for Joe when he was CTO at Solera Networks and then at Blue Coat. Both helped me see a bigger picture early on in my career and really encouraged me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was working at the University of Utah in the College of Engineering, I remember having a discussion with a network engineer named Joe Breen at the Center for High Performance Computing. In that discussion, Breen figuratively opened a door just enough to let me see that there was not just another room on the other side of the door, there was a whole other world that existed. Joe opened my mind to the idea that this space is so much bigger and so much more involved than what I had previously conceived; the computer and cybersecurity spaces are so vast and so deep. Since that time I have become obsessed with learning new things. If I was independently wealthy, my dream would be to go to MIT and just do every degree program they offer, starting at A and working my way to Z.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What trends or changes do you see in the industry that are most exciting to you? How can OASIS prepare itself for what you think may be coming our way?&nbsp;<br>About eight years ago, I gave a talk at the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) meeting in San Diego. Hugh Thompson and I spoke, and I talked about the security of banks being ultimately derived down to the security of a light bulb. I knew this stuff was coming, but I did not yet fully grasp how pervasive it was going to be. Then in 2019, I went to the ITU World CTO Conference in Budapest to talk to all the CTOs of the various telcos about my view and vision for this hyperconnected 5g enabled edge. I had been working on this theory for quite some time, for about four years before I gave that talk in 2019. We are now starting to see that actually come to fruition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what excites me the most is this hyperconnected environment that we’re going to get to, where every computer and device will be interconnected, talking to each other, and making decisions in cyber relevant time. Everything will need to work together seamlessly. There is a lot of infrastructure, technology, and standards that need to be created to make sure this actually works. There are a lot of pieces on the cybersecurity side that we need to make sure stay secure. But there are also the actual communication paths and pieces that make it all work. We are going to get to this point where things need to communicate in a very different way than what has been done before. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Typically, we have a one-to-one relationship with technology. For example, you have one computer and one phone. But in this hyper connected world, when you start thinking of all of the sensors and all of the physical devices, you will have orders of magnitude more devices per person. A normal home equipped with IoT products may easily have 50-100 devices. Look around your home, by the time you add up all of your existing e-readers, computers, smart speakers, and all the other things that are internet connected it is very common to have 30+ devices and you have not even started deploying IoT. That excites me because it is going to fundamentally change the way we have to design, secure, and interact with our environment. Even in my office, where it’s just one person, there are probably 15-20 connected devices. We need to make sure all of that works seamlessly and is end-to-end secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, everything that we have been doing in cybersecurity for the past while does not work all of the time. We have known this for a while, but we still just keep bolting on technology and putting oxygen on the fire. We’ve been utilizing the same model of security since I started doing this work back in 1993. Month after month, quarter after quarter, year after year, organizations keep getting compromised and breached, so we know the model is somewhat broken. What we need to do is step back, go to standards, and look at how we could redo this from the ground up to make this world a better and more secure place. Standards play a huge role and I see OASIS being able to do a lot of great things in this space, especially in coordination with other premier SDOs. I find all this very exciting.</p>



<p>What are some of your career accomplishments that really stand out to you?&nbsp;<br>Being part of the STIX and TAXII community really stands out to me because that was just such a monumental amount of work. There were weeks where the editorial group, John Winder, and Rich Piazza from MITRE, and I were resolving more than 500 comments and suggestions each week for weeks on end. It was normal for us to have 15-20 hours a week spent on working calls trying to address the number of contributions that were coming in. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s some valuable advice that you’ve received in your career?&nbsp;<br>Kindness goes a long way. I also think it’s important to have an open mind and not to jump to conclusions. Try to understand that, for the most part, everyone is doing the best they can with what they’ve been given. It’s important to understand another person’s perspective and their point of view before you jump into a rash decision. If you step back, listen, and try to understand an issue, you’re going to learn more than you ever realized. The more engagement you have and the more people you talk to, the more you can learn about the areas that you don’t know about. It is then up to you to actually go and do some research and try to understand things a bit better. But it is key to be a little kinder and a little more patient.</p>



<p>What’s a fun fact about you?<br>I love to cook. I approach cooking in a very scientific way and much to the chagrin of my family, I will make things over and over until my family says that I have deemed it perfected. I then document it and then I move on to something else. They keep asking me when I am going to make this or that again, and lately the question has been “when are you going to make that cheesecake again?” I also keep a logbook for cooking to keep track of when I made a specific dish, the results, and what I liked or didn’t like for the next time I make it. I also weigh all my ingredients and I view my recipes as replication steps, not just a simple recipe, because recipes have a lot of vagueness (a pinch of this and a pinch of that).&nbsp;</p>

This tool simplifies the process of running Ceramic nodes locally. Moreover, it incorporates a straightforward Web3 social application that developers can utilize to interact with ComposeDB on Ceramic, or even leverage it as a foundation for their unique projects. This tutorial will guide you through using Wheel and the embedded example Web3 social application, enabling you to engage with ComposeDB on Ceramic in a matter of minutes.</p><p>By adhering to this guide, you will accomplish the following:</p>  Configure your development environment  Run a local Ceramic node  Operate a fully functional example dApp on your local machine  Understand the subsequent steps to continue building on Ceramic  <p>Let’s get started!</p> Requirements <p>For this tutorial, ensure you have the following tools and resources installed on your system:</p>  A code editor that suits your preferences (for example, VSCode)  A web browser that you're comfortable with (we'll be using Chrome for this guide)  <a href="https://nodejs.org/en?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Node.js v16</a> or a newer version  <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">jq</a>  <p>After you've installed the necessary dependencies and prepped your development tools as outlined above, you can dive into setting up your work environment with Wheel.</p> Configure your working environment <p>When it comes to building applications using ComposeDB, it's essential for every developer to run their own node. This step ensures your node can connect to the Ceramic Anchor Service to generate commits on a blockchain, thereby enabling seamless data composability between applications.</p><p>First, let’s create our project folder where we will keep all the files and directories used for this tutorial. Open your terminal and run the following commands:</p> <code>mkdir ceramic-getting-started
cd ceramic-getting-started
</code> <p>The most straightforward path to configure and run a Ceramic node is through Wheel—a user-friendly CLI tool. Wheel not only allows developers to run Ceramic nodes locally, but it also walks you through the entire configuration process with a clear, easy-to-understand prompt. </p><p>Note, for more visual walkthrough, check out this video which illustrates all of the setup steps written below:</p><p>To download the Wheel on your local machine, run the command below. This command will download the Wheel in your working directory:</p> <code>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ceramicstudio/wheel/main/wheel.sh | bash
</code> <p>Once downloaded, start the Wheel by running the following command:</p> <code>./wheel
</code> <p>Executing this command will kick-start the environment configuration prompt. Here, you'll have the ability to select which Ceramic-specific dependencies you'd prefer to install, and how you'd like your Ceramic node to be configured.</p><p>If you're brand new to ComposeDB on Ceramic, we suggest you begin with the default setup. This configuration is lightweight and easy to manage.</p><blockquote>📌 The default configuration will run your Ceramic node in-memory, meaning it won't connect to the Ceramic Anchor Service or create commits on a blockchain. Therefore, your app data will only be saved locally on your machine. The indexed data will be housed in a straightforward and lightweight SQLite database, requiring no additional configurations on your part. This setup serves as an excellent launchpad to start engaging with ComposeDB on Ceramic and to experiment with its features.</blockquote><p>Simply follow the prompt and confirm the following default configurations by hitting <code>return</code> key on your keyboard:</p>  Project Type: <code>InMemory</code>  Project Name: <code>ceramic-test-app</code>  Project Path: <code>default</code>  Include Ceramic?: <code>Y</code>  Include ComposeDB?: <code>Y</code>  Include ComposeDB Sample Application?: <code>Y</code>  Admin DID Configuration: <code>Generate DID and Private Key</code>  File to save DID private key to?: <code>default</code>  Wheel config file location: <code>default</code>  Configure Ceramic?: <code>Defaults: Use default configuration based on network</code>  <p>At this point, the Wheel will start the process of installing dependencies. Once complete, you'll be prompted with the question, <code>Would you like Ceramic started as a daemon? (Y/n).</code> Choose option <code>Y</code>. This action will fire up your local Ceramic node and construct an example app for you to experiment with. You'll know everything is up and running smoothly if you see the following output in your terminal:</p> <code>Application demo is available at 
Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app. To run the demo application:

cd /Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app
npm run nextDev
</code> <p>Keep this terminal running and now let’s dive into the example Web3 social application!</p> Example Web3 social application <p>The example Web3 social app, a simple example of decentralized Twitter, is a creation of the 3Box Labs team. It's designed to offer developers a glimpse into how applications work with ComposeDB on Ceramic, and serves as an example of how to implement the basic core functionality using Ceramic tools.</p><p>The application comes packed with the following features:</p>  Sign-in using DID Key or your Metamask wallet  User profile creation  Post creation  The ability to follow other users  Access to the posts of those you follow on an 'Explore' page  <p>So, you may ask, how do you launch this application? At the end of the previous section, we noted the output you should expect to see in your terminal if everything is operating smoothly:</p> <code>Application demo is available at 
/Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app. To run the demo application:

cd /Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app
npm run nextDev
</code> <p>Follow the provided instructions to navigate to the example app directory and start the application:</p> <code>cd /Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app
</code>  <code>npm run nextDev
</code> <p>The output of this command will look similar to the one shown below.</p> <code>&gt; demo@0.1.0 nextDev
&gt; next dev

ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: &lt;http://localhost:3000&gt;
</code> <p>Copy the provided url <code>http://localhost:3000</code> and open it in your browser. This will launch the example application in your browser for you to interact with.</p> Interacting with the application <p>Once you open the URL that your application is running on, you should be greeted with the following user interface:</p><p>At this point ,you can start interacting with the application by choosing your authentication method. You can choose from the following options:</p>  Key DID—an authentication method using <code>did:key</code> method  Ethereum DID PKH—an authentication method that uses an Ethereum wallet (e.g. Metamask)  <p>Choose the authentication method that you prefer and start interacting with the application:</p>  Click on Profile tab and create your profile:  <p>2. After creating your profile, head to Home tab and create your first post:</p><p>3. Head to Explore tab and check out currently existing posts. You should see your own post posted there:</p><p>If other users started using your application, you would be able to see their posts in the Explore section as well. This would also give you an option to follow other users. You can simulate this behavior by logging out and signing up for the application using a different authentication method.</p> Explore what’s under the hood <p>One of the best things about this example application is that you can see everything under the hood, including all of the implementation, data models, and frontend components.</p><p>Remember the path that was provided to you by Wheel? You can find all of the application files there:</p> <code>Application demo is available at 
/Users/user/ceramic-getting-started/wheel/ceramic-test-app/ceramic-test-app-app
</code> <p>Once you navigate to the project directory you should see the following files:</p><p>When you navigate to the <code>composites</code> directory, you'll discover all the data models utilized by this application defined using the GraphQL schema definition language. The application comes with four data models:</p>  <code>basicProfile.graphql</code> - This data model offers a GraphQL implementation of a fundamental user profile data model  <code>post.graphql</code> - This data model provides a GraphQL implementation of a user post. It also delineates a relation to the <code>basicProfile</code> model  <code>postsProfile.graphql</code> - This data model establishes a relation between the <code>basicProfile</code> model and the <code>post</code> model  <code>following.graphql</code> - This data model outlines a schema for preserving the data of the users being followed. Notably, this model also defines a relation to the <code>basicProfile</code> model, enabling user profile data retrieval  <p>Make sure to open these files to explore how data models are defined and how they tie to the details you see on the frontend. For example, if you open <code>basicProfile.grapqh</code> you’ll probably recognize the fields like <code>name</code>, <code>username</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>gender</code> and <code>emoji</code> you set when creating your profile:</p> <code>type BasicProfile @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "A basic Profile") {
  name: String! @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 100)
  username: String! @string(minLength: 5, maxLength: 255)
  description: String @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 100)
  gender: String @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 100)
  emoji: String @string(minLength: 1, maxLength: 2)
}
</code> <p>In addition to data models, you can explore the the <code>pages</code> directory that contains the implementation of pages you see when you interact with the application. There you can see some examples of how <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides/data-interactions/queries?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Grapqhl queries</a> are used to retrieve and display the information you see. For example, if you open the <code>explore.ts</code> file, you will see an example query that is used to extract the data that is displayed once your open the <code>Explore</code> page on your app:</p> <code>query {
        postsIndex (last:300) {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              body
              created
              profile {
                id
                name
                username 
                emoji
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
</code>  Interact with the data using Graphiql server <p>As you engage with the example Web3 social app, you're creating user data that's stored on the Ceramic network (this depends on the project-type you selected when setting up your Ceramic node). You can smoothly interact with this data using a straightforward <code>Graphiql</code> server and crafting GraphQL queries. Here’s how you can accomplish this:</p>  Open a new terminal and generate a runtime representation of your composite:   <code>npx composedb composite:compile src/__generated__/merged.json src/__generated__/runtime-composite.json
</code> <p>2. &nbsp;Start the <code>Graphiql</code> server:</p> <code>npx composedb graphql:server --ceramic-url=http://localhost:7007 --graphiql src/__generated__/runtime-composite.json --port=5005</code> <p>You will know that the server is successfully up and running if you see the following output in your terminal:</p> <code>GraphQL server is listening on &lt;http://localhost:5005/grapqhl&gt;
</code> <p>3. &nbsp;Copy the provided URL and open it in your browser. This should open a Graphiql interface. This interface has 3 core parts:</p>  Top left terminal for writing the GraphQL queries  Bottom left section for providing variables and headers for your queries  Section on the right for displaying the query output  <p>4. Run the following query to get the first 2 records of the user profile stored:</p> <code>query{
 basicProfileIndex(first: 2) {
   edges {
     node {
       name,
       description
     }
   }
 }
}
</code> <p>The output of this query looks as follows:</p> Next steps <p>The integration of Wheel and the example Web3 app aims to provide developers with an easy starting point. It simplifies the process of running Ceramic nodes and offers a tangible application to experiment with. If you've followed this tutorial, here are some promising next steps to continue your journey as a Ceramic developer:</p>  Dive into the <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB documentation</a> to familiarize yourself more with the technical concepts discussed in this tutorial  Interact with the data by constructing more advanced GraphQL queries, or even update an existing record by executing a <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/guides/data-interactions/mutations?ref=blog.ceramic.network">mutation</a>  Launch the example app on <code>clay-testnet</code> which will connect your node to Ceramic Anchor Service and create commits on a blockchain. You can achieve this by selecting the <code>clay-testnet</code> project type when following the Wheel prompt  Improve the application—introduce a new feature or use it as a foundation for your own unique project. Here are some ideas for you to consider:    Add a feature to "like" a post.  Create more sophisticated queries to filter the posts displayed on the "Explore" page  Introduce a feature to comment on a post  <p>We're eager to see what you'll create!

<p>Oamo, a decentralized data broker, aims to revolutionize the data economy by allowing users to own and monetize the value of their data. It replaces the outdated cost-per-click model, compensating users directly for their attention. This creates a fair and transparent data economy aligned with the trend of zero-party data. The platform enables users to share their on-chain and off-chain data anonymously with trusted companies in exchange for exclusive token rewards and promotions. </p><p>Data privacy is a growing concern for individuals, organizations, and governments around the world. Scandals, such as those involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, have highlighted the need for greater data privacy protections. Data brokers, who make billions of dollars by collecting and selling user data without their consent, are facing increasing scrutiny and regulation. Oamo aims to address these challenges by giving users control over their data and empowering them to monetize it.</p><p>As more of the world’s economy moves on chain, organizations need a better understanding of their target audience across Web2 and Web3 to reach consumers directly. Oamo foresees a new paradigm where companies build consensual relationships with their audience, with users willingly sharing behavioral information and accepting offers.</p><p>Ceramic and <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB</a> are at the heart of Oamo’s architecture—as they gear up for their launch later this year, users will be able to build their Oamo Profile (a Ceramic DID), connect their wallets across chains and social profiles, and generate credentials based on their on-chain and off-chain behaviors. These credentials can be shared anonymously with trusted companies for rewards, opening up the potential for personalized offers.</p> User-Centric Design: Oamo's Use of ComposeDB on Ceramic for Data Ownership and Control <p>One of the significant challenges that Oamo faced in its mission was ensuring data privacy and user control. The founders wanted to create a data economy where users truly own their data in a private manner and share behaviors with selected companies without revealing any personally identifiable information. One key challenge was designing a data-sharing platform that allowed users to connect multiple wallets and social profiles to a single profile, while still maintaining ownership and privacy. Oamo also aimed to enable companies to send personalized offers without revealing personal information. These challenges required a robust and secure solution that could handle decentralized data storage, encryption, and messaging capabilities.</p><p>ComposeDB on Ceramic became the backbone of Oamo's architecture. Users create their Oamo Profiles as Ceramic DIDs and generate verified credentials that align with their on-chain and off-chain behaviors. User credentials are then stored in ComposeDB and encrypted with Lit Protocol, ensuring users have complete control over their data. This solution allows companies to send personalized offers to users without revealing personal information, ensuring user anonymity while reaching the target audience trustlessly.</p><blockquote>"Ceramic accelerated our product development process exponentially by providing a robust ecosystem of tools that covered all our design goals. We believe it’s the only solution that could power true private ownership of data spanning across Web2 and Web3," - Yannick Folla, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Oamo</blockquote><p>Oamo's founders had been following Ceramic's journey from the early days of SelfID to Ceramic's current all-in-one package of DIDs, verified credentials, multi-chain support, decentralized data storage, and encryption support via Lit Protocol—this array of tools and capabilities perfectly aligned with Oamo's core design goals.</p> Building a Secure Data Economy With Ceramic and Lit Protocol <p>In Oamo's architecture, when a user generates a DID, the data saved in that stream is in plain text and publicly accessible. Given the sensitive nature of user data, it's crucial to encrypt this data and set permissions to restrict access. To achieve this, a user creates a salt and generates a DID using that salt. Then, the backend creates the requisite dataset and sends it to the user for encryption using Lit and storage in Ceramic. During the encryption process, the user sets permissions so that only the Oamo smart contract has decryption rights. </p><blockquote>"Through our research, we saw Ceramic as the only viable solution that would package DIDs, verified credentials, multi-chain support, decentralized data storage, and encryption support via Lit Protocol. It’s an all-in-one solution that ticks all the core design goals at Oamo."</blockquote><p>This approach ensures user data privacy and gives users control over where their data is stored. Ceramic's unique capabilities, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), verified credentials, multi-chain support, messaging capabilities with ComposeDB, decentralized data storage, and Lit Protocol encryption, made it the clear choice for Oamo.</p> Get Involved <p>If you're interested in participating in the new data economy, where you truly own your data and its value, <a href="https://spearmint.xyz/p/oamo-beta-waitlist?ref=blog.ceramic.network">join Oamo's allowlist</a> today and prepare for the upcoming launch!</p>

 The Social Power of Open Recognition Badges Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>These days, it’s rare to come across a completely blank face when talking to people about <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a>. That’s because recently we’ve seen mass adoption, meaning that hundreds of millions of badges are now being earned every year. After 12 years, we’re no longer in the world of ‘potential’ use: badges are now helping people get&nbsp;hired.</p><p>However, as important as ‘getting hired’ is, it’s possible to go beyond badges as microcredentials for hiring. To use Douglas Rushkoff’s phrase, we can use badges to help ‘find the&nbsp;others’.</p><p>Who are these ‘others,’ you may ask? They’re the individuals who share our aspirations, interests, and intentions. They’re those with whom we align not only in our professional competencies but in the philosophies and values that drive us. Through this lens, badges become common symbols, connecting us over shared priorities and paving the way for deeper collaborations.</p><p>So, in this post, we’re going to explain how WAO is going through the process of identifying areas to create badges for <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a> in a bid to ‘find the others’. We hope that by reading this you might be inspired to do likewise for your organisation, group, or&nbsp;network!</p><p>We envisage this being a five step&nbsp;process:</p>  Identify priority&nbsp;areas  Badge the priorities  Find the&nbsp;overlaps  Create badge&nbsp;imagery  Find the&nbsp;others  <p>In this post, we’ll cover steps one to three. Once we’re further along our journey, we’ll check back in with a Part 2 which will cover steps four and&nbsp;five!</p> Step 1: Identify priority&nbsp;areas <p>In a previous post entitled <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/practical-utopias-and-rewilding-work-27c148d95b16">Practical utopias and rewilding work</a>, we showed the result of some work we’d done during a recent monthly co-op day. We outlined five thematic areas we see as ‘priorities’ for our&nbsp;work.</p><p>The result was the diagram above. But how did we come up with these&nbsp;areas?</p><p>While planning for our co-op day, we came across two prioritisation approaches that generated excellent results: <a href="https://medium.com/the-ready/even-overs-the-prioritization-tool-that-brings-your-strategy-to-life-e4f28f2949ac">Even-over statements</a> and the <a href="https://www.ns-businesshub.com/business/yancey-strickler-bentoism/">Bento box model</a>. Let’s have a look at what they generated.</p> Bento box&nbsp;model <p>We began with the Bento box model from Yancey Stricker’s book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/591594/this-could-be-our-future-by-yancey-strickler/#">This Could Be Our Future: a Manifesto for a More Generous World</a>. It’s a simple activity to run either using paper, or in our case, online using <a href="https://whimsical.com">Whimsical</a>. We adapted it very slightly to use the key question: What do you want to work on and&nbsp;how?</p><p>The Bento box model is a simple 2x2 grid which asks about wants and needs, for you and the organisation, both now and in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Here’s how we approached this activity:</p>  Asked everyone to work on their own grid by themselves and begin with NOW ME and then move on to FUTURE&nbsp;ME  Ran a round of feedback, including how easy/hard we found it. People shared their screens during this&nbsp;bit  Moved onto NOW US and FUTURE US again doing this individually  Ran a round of feedback and&nbsp;sharing  <p>After some (timeboxed) discussion, we started talking about how to collate the similarities between what we want/need. We decided upon a Venn diagram, and came up with some labels for the circles which changed multiple times as we discussed and moved virtual sticky notes&nbsp;around!</p><p>The idea wasn’t to get to perfection, but to be in ‘exploration mode’. We moved onto our next activity.</p> Even-over statements <p>It’s easy to define yourself and your organisation in opposition to something else. For example, as a co-op, we often define ourselves as a counterpoint to capitalist, shareholder-driven oligarchies. But that’s not a statement of what you’re in favour&nbsp;of.</p><p>Instead of pitting two things against one another, the even-over approach asks you to prioritise between two good things. So we used an <a href="https://etherpad.org/">etherpad</a>, each chose a colour, and wrote down some ideas. You can see what we originally came up with&nbsp;below:</p><p>We then did the following:</p>  Read through all of the statements  Marked the ones we had questions about with a&nbsp;?  Ran a round of questions to highlight statements we thought were confusing/unclear  Read through all of the statements again  Gave everyone five votes to mark the statements we agreed with most (with a&nbsp;+1)  Discussed all the statements had more than two&nbsp;votes  Decided on the statements to take forward, making them&nbsp;bold  <p>Just as with the Bento box activity, we knew this wasn’t ‘finished’ but rather an exploration. We let it percolate after the co-op day for a&nbsp;while.</p><p>Eventually, after some more discussion a week or so later, we made a page on our wiki: <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/misc/even-overs">Our principles even-over everything else</a>. Again, with it being on our wiki, it’s always subject to revision!</p> Step 2: Badge the Priorities <p>It was in our second time revisiting these statements that we ended up coming up with our priority&nbsp;areas:</p>  Sustainable Work  Open Recognition  Open Working  Climate Action  Worker Ownership  <p>It’s relatively straightforward to badge these, especially if you use an AI tool such as ChatGPT and describe what you want to&nbsp;achieve.</p><p>As a result, we came up with a name, description, and criteria for each priority area. Ideally, each of these would have smaller, more granular badges underneath them, but we can get to those&nbsp;later.</p> 🔁 Sustainable Work&nbsp;Advocate   Description: This badge is awarded to individuals who demonstrate a commitment to promoting sustainable work practices in their organisation or community.  Criteria: To earn this badge, individuals must submit evidence of their efforts to promote sustainable work practices. This could include initiatives such as promoting fair labour practices.   👍 Open Recognition Champion   Description: This badge is awarded to individuals who actively recognise and uplift the skills, knowledge, and competencies of others in a transparent and accessible way.  Criteria: To earn this badge, individuals must submit examples of how they have recognised others’ skills and competencies. This could include testimonials, endorsements, or digital badges they have issued to&nbsp;others.   💬 Open Working Proponent   Description: This badge is awarded to individuals who demonstrate a commitment to open, transparent, and collaborative working practices.  Criteria: To earn this badge, individuals must submit evidence of their commitment to open working. This could include examples of their contributions to open-source projects, or initiatives they have led to promote transparency and collaboration in their workplace.   🌱 Climate Action Enthusiast   Description: This badge is awarded to individuals who actively contribute to climate action initiatives, whether in their workplace, community, or personal&nbsp;life.  Criteria: To earn this badge, individuals must submit evidence of their contributions to climate action. This could include initiatives they have led to reduce carbon emissions, or involvement in campaigns or organisations focused on climate change mitigation.   ✊ Worker Ownership Advocate   Description: This badge is awarded to individuals who support and promote worker ownership and democratic decision-making in the workplace.  Criteria: To earn this badge, individuals must submit evidence of their efforts to promote worker ownership. This could include involvement in worker-owned cooperatives, or initiatives to promote democratic decision-making in their workplace.  <p>Reading through these badges representing our priority areas, it’s evident that there’s a lot of overlap. So instead of leaving it there, and because we want to ‘find the others’ working at the intersection between our priority areas, we decided to go further….</p> Step 3: Find the&nbsp;Overlaps Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/web-like-existence/">Visual&nbsp;Thinkery</a><p>It’s easy to find people who are working on Climate Action. It’s easy to find people who are working on Open Working. But who’s working openly on climate stuff? The same goes for the overlaps between all five of our priority&nbsp;areas.</p><p>With five different priority areas, there are 10 possible unique overlaps:</p>  Sustainable Work / Climate&nbsp;Action  Sustainable Work / Open&nbsp;Working  Sustainable Work / Open Recognition  Sustainable Work / Worker Ownership  Climate Action / Open&nbsp;Working  Climate Action / Open Recognition  Climate Action / Worker Ownership  Open Working / Open Recognition  Open Working / Worker Ownership  Open Recognition / Worker Ownership  <p>We’ve used descriptive names below so that you can see the overlaps. However, in practice we’re likely to use more whimsical names. Why? Because it’s more interesting and fun! Again, AI assistants can be really useful for sparking your imagination around&nbsp;this.</p> 1. Sustainable Recognition Badge   Description: Issued to individuals or organisations that promote and champion sustainable working practices in their work and in&nbsp;others.

Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>As shown in the image above, the Open Badges standard has additional metadata that we could consider adding. For example, there may be a standard or framework we could align with such as the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a>. Also, it could be that we want to add evidence, or even make the badge&nbsp;expire.</p> Next steps <p>As mentioned in the introduction, we’re still working on this, but in the spirit of working openly wanted to share where we’ve got to so far. Next up will be badge design and then issuing our badges to people and organisations we come across who are working at the intersections and overlaps we want to&nbsp;target.</p><p>We’d love your feedback, especially if you try this approach yourself, so please do let us know in the comments, or on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@weareopencoop">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/weareopencoop">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/we-are-open-coop">LinkedIn</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/finding-the-others-1f43b48ceff1">Finding the Others</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Seamless Integration, Simplified Management: Enabling Rapid and Secure Deployment of Validator Nodes <p>ZUG, Switzerland — 13 June 2023, Energy Web, an independent non-profit that develops open-source software to accelerate the global energy transition, is pleased to announce a strategic partnership with <a href="https://www.zeeve.io/">Zeeve</a>, a leading Web3 infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platform provider, to integrate the <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/ew-dos-technology-components-2023/trust-layer-energy-web-chain">Energy Web Chain</a> (EWC) with Zeeve’s enterprise-grade infrastructure stack.</p><p>Through this collaboration Zeeve is expanding the benefits of its automation platform to offer Energy Web member companies a managed, secure, and scalable service for running validator nodes on the Energy Web Chain as well as Energy Web’s testnet Volta. Zeeve’s IaaS solution is a significant step forward for companies seeking to develop solutions on and participate in the Energy Web Chain, as it enables companies to deploy validator nodes with a few clicks, or build complex energy solutions using Zeeve’s no-code web3 infrastructure.</p><blockquote>“We are immensely excited to offer this integration with Energy Web Chain, paving the way for businesses to seamlessly leverage the Energy Web Ecosystem.” said co-founder and CEO of Zeeve <a href="mailto:ravi@zeeve.io">Dr Ravi Chamria</a>, “In a sector where specific challenges demand nuanced understanding for impactful technology integration, Energy Web’s singular focus on the energy sector stands as a model. Zeeve takes pride in contributing the full power of its tech stack, offering easy onboarding, access to both the testnet and mainnet, one-click bootstrapping of validator nodes, all within a compliant framework ensuring security and data privacy.”</blockquote><p>The Zeeve IaaS offering presents two distinct options: Managed Service and BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) for both the main EWC and Volta test network. With Managed Service, Zeeve will run EWC nodes in their own dedicated infrastructure on behalf of member organizations, ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and security. Alternatively, BYOC empowers member companies to connect their preferred cloud provider’s API keys within the Zeeve system, enabling them to deploy nodes to their own cloud environment, including AWS, Google, Digital Ocean, and Tencent. Additional features for both options include the ability to perform automatic updates, real-time analytics and monitoring for node health, management of payout addresses and block rewards, and customizable alerts. By eliminating the operational complexities associated with deploying and maintaining validator nodes, companies can more efficiently contribute to the decentralized governance and operation of the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.</p><blockquote>“The collaboration between Energy Web and Zeeve marks an important milestone in the evolution of validator infrastructure for our enterprise member community,” said Jesse Morris, Chief Executive Officer at Energy Web. “Infrastructure-as-a-service streamlines the process of participating as a validator, allowing companies to focus on their core business while helping maintain the integrity and security of the network.”</blockquote><p>Beyond the direct collaboration, both Energy Web and Zeeve are proud members of the Hyperledger Foundation, a global collaborative effort to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. This shared association within the Hyperledger community positions the partnership to gain enhanced visibility and foster further innovation within the decentralized technology ecosystem.</p><blockquote>“Energy Web is a wonderful example showcasing how web3 can bring transparency, and trust to a complex industry like Energy and bring tangible impact.” said co-founder and CTO of Zeeve <a href="mailto:ghan@zeeve.io">Ghan Vashishtha</a>. “Zeeve further enriches this experience by offering an unified dashboard for detailed monitoring of cloud resources, node performance, and blockchain-level parameters for EWC, with proactive alerts and notifications. By choosing to build with Zeeve, enterprises are bypassing several layers of infrastructure management, accelerating their time to production.”</blockquote><p>For more information about Zeeve’s IaaS platform or to explore partnership opportunities, please visit <a href="https://www.zeeve.io/">https://www.zeeve.io/</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>By<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylegrobinson/"> Kyle Robinson</a>, Senior Strategic Advisor, <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/energy-mines-digital-trust-pilot/">B.C. Government – Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>With various enriching sessions held by multiple ToIP members,<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/about/about-oss/"> Open Source Summit North America 2023</a> was a great opportunity for ToIP to engage with the open source community, exchange knowledge, and gain insights around the latest trends and developments in the open source world.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Hosted by the<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/"> Linux Foundation</a>, OSS North America 2023 brought together over 300 speakers and attendees across 15 micro-conferences, including CloudOpen, ContainerCon, and OpenJS World, among others. OSS allows open source developers and community leaders to come together and address the most important technologies, topics, and issues in open source today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the top attended sessions included talks on containers, the evolution of open source through design, and how quantum machine learning. A common theme shared across all events was the value of diversity and inclusion in the open source community, as demonstrated by the Diversity Empowerment Summit and the Emerging OS Forum, which focused on underrepresented groups and emerging technologies, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working in the digital trust space with the B.C. Government has continued to show me how dedicated B.C. is to open source solutions on their path toward innovative and easy-to-access digital services. John Jordan, Executive Director of Digital Identity and Trust, set the tone for B.C.’s presence at OSS with a keynote on how the government’s open innovation approach is allowing B.C. to take public service delivery to the next level. His keynote earned on-stage recognition as ‘the greatest government open source success story in the world’ from Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of the Linux Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other contributions from ToIP included a session by Steering Committee Member Wenjing Chu, Senior Director of Technology of Futurewei Technologies, Inc., highlighting OpenWallet and the strategic role an open digital wallet will play in many aspects of Metaverse services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Highlight sessions from ToIP members include:&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhd9vwQjGjQ">Keynote: Open to Innovation – John Jordan, Executive Director, BC Digital Trust Service</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>John took the stage at OSS to show how the B.C. Government’s open innovation approach is allowing B.C. to fast-track their tech projects and provide user-centric services for the digital economy. In his keynote, he highlights the value of close alignment with the tech industry to enable the provision of accessible and innovative government services. The key: utilizing an open-by-default innovation approach to modernizing teams, policies, procurement, and tools, allowing governments to harness the latest tech to create and deliver user-centric service solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Presenter&nbsp;</p>



 
 Wenjing Chu, Senior Director of Technology Strategy, Futurewei Technologies, Inc.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Wenjing is a strong advocate and founding member of the new LFEU OpenWallet Foundation with a mission to drive global adoption of open, interoperable, safe and privacy protecting digital wallet technologies. In this talk, Wenjing gave an overview of the new OpenWallet Foundation and its mission, highlight the strategic role an open digital wallet will play in many aspects of Metaverse services, and explore the opportunities it will help bring for consumers, creators, developers, and businesses in the Metaverse.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4EdHLjo-S4">Panel Discussion: Digital Trust and Sustainable Mining: Securing Global ESG Reporting</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Presenters&nbsp;</p>



 
 Aaron Unger, Director of Product Development, Digital Identity and Trust Program, Ministry of Citizens’ Services, Government of British Columbia&nbsp; 



 Kyle Robinson, Senior Strategic Advisor – Digital Trust Ecosystems, Briartech Consulting Inc.&nbsp; 



 Japjeet Khroud, Senior Sustainability Specialist, Copper Mountain Mining Corporation&nbsp; 
 



<p>I had the pleasure of joining Aaron Unger and Japjeet Khroud on stage to talk about the Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust project (EMDT) and our work in coordinating a digital trust ecosystem in the natural resource sector. Using digital credentials, EMDT enables companies to share environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data with just a few clicks. The conversation explored how EMDT is creating new tools that empower more secure and efficient voluntary sustainability reporting in the mining sector, enabling companies to prove their sustainable practices and better compete in global markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pteDNKEJUkM">Presentation: BC Wallet App – Powered by Hyperledger Bifold</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Presenters&nbsp;</p>



 
 Clecio Varjao, Product Manager, Government of British Columbia&nbsp; 



 Akiff Manji, Software Developer, Petri Dish Development&nbsp; 
 



<p>The<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native"> Hyperledger Aries Bifold</a> is an open source, community-driven mobile wallet for the digital credential ecosystem and serves as the foundation of the BC Wallet. In this session Clecio Varjao and Akiff Manji explored the overview of the architecture and the wallet’s key features. Their presentation showcased how the Province of British Columbia used Aries Bifold as a framework to build BC Wallet, and how others can leverage it to create their own wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhID5fuFpL8">Presentation: Online Identity with Verifiable Credentials and ZKPs Using High School Math</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Presenter&nbsp;</p>



 
 Stephen Curran, Open Source Community Lead and Senior Architect, Government of British Columbia&nbsp; 
 



<p>Privacy-preserving digital credentials built on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can be game changers for digital identity and trust as they enable online trust without tracking. In fact, ZKPs allow entities to prove something is true to another party without conveying any additional information. For instance, a person can prove they are over the age of 19 without revealing the date of birth. In this session, Stephen provided an overview of the AnonCreds project, a high school math level introduction into the magic of ZKPs, and how they enable privacy-preserving online identity solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journey goes on&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, the response we received in sharing the B.C. Government’s work on digital trust alongside contributions from other ToIP members from our home province is a testament to the power of open innovation and the impact it can have on public service delivery. As a resident of British Columbia, I am proud to see our home province recognized on a global stage for their leadership and innovation in open source.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This month we kicked off our collaboration with Education as a Vaccine (<a href="https://www.evanigeria.org/" title="">EVA</a>), a Nigeria-based organisation working on improving the health and development of children and young people in the country. Through our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="">Matchbox Programme</a>, we will provide intensive support to EVA Nigeria for a period of six to eight months.&nbsp;</p>



 Get to know EVA Nigeria: Improving the health and development of children and young people 



<p>EVA is a young-women-led and youth-focused organisation that envisions a Nigeria where children, adolescents and young people reach their full potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EVA believes that adolescents and young people, especially young women and girls, should be provided with the skills, resources and opportunities to lead on matters affecting their lives. To this end, they work in partnership with children, adolescent girls and young people to advance their rights to health and protection from all forms of violence by strengthening capacities, providing direct services and influencing policies for improved quality of life.</p>



<p>EVA’s work focuses on young people’s and women’s rights, addressing their sexual and reproductive health and well-being as well as gender-based violence, other human rights violations, and discrimination they face. The organisation’s work ensures the legal, policy and sociocultural environment enables and supports the enjoyment of their sexual and reproductive health and rights, and their rights to freedom from violence.</p>



<p>Since its founding, EVA Nigeria has successfully contributed to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Reaching over 41 million individuals (offline and online), of which over 3 million are children or young people reached in person. 



 Trained over 4,000 individuals in providing services. 



 Strengthening the capabilities of 10,000 individuals and 98 groups, including those most marginalised and excluded, to participate in and give input into law and policy-making processes that uphold the human rights of children and young people.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Learn more about their work on <a href="https://www.evanigeria.org/" title="">their website</a> and social media channels (they’re on <a href="https://twitter.com/EVA_Nigeria" title="">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/education-as-a-vaccine/" title="">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eva_nigeria/" title="">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJi5-L-klmJbiMnIYeGpQMg" title="">Youtube</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/evanigeria/" title="">Facebook</a>).</p>



 Working together on effective and responsible data management&nbsp; 



<p>Throughout Matchbox, The Engine Room and EVA Nigeria will work together to assess the organisation’s current practices for data collection, analysis, storing and sharing. This will culminate in strengthening EVA Nigeria’s capacity to work with data in more responsible and effective ways.</p>

<p>This May brought us two of the oldest and largest digital identity conferences: the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity Conference</a> in Berlin and <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a> in Las Vegas. Both were attended by ToIP Executive Director Judith Fleenor and a full contingent of ToIP members. In this post we’ll summarize our key observations and takeaways from each.</p>



 European Identity Conference, May 9-12, Berlin 



<p>EIC is the largest digital identity event of the year in Europe, running for four days every April or May for the last 16 years. Hosted by German-based analyst firm Kuppinger Cole, last year it moved from Munich to Berlin to give it even more room. This year had over 1,000 attendees and several dozen exhibitors.</p>



<p>While EIC has always had a major focus on conventional Identity and Access Management (IAM), Privileged Access Management (PAM), and Enterprise Cybersecurity, it was also the first conference to host a session on SSI and decentralized identity back in 2016. The following years that grew into an dedicated all-day track on SSI curated by Andy Tobin, formerly GM Europe for Evernym and now for Gen.</p>



<p>This year Andy and other ToIP attendees were amazed to see that half the conference was now focused on decentralized identity: digital wallets, credentials, exchange platforms, orchestration engines, and governance solutions. In retrospect this makes sense given the worldwide attention on the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">European Digital Identity Wallets initiative</a> (EUDIW). However even the KuppingerCole analysts were surprised by the level of interest. On Wednesday, the entire mainstage presentation track was devoted to Decentralized and Verifiable Credentials, and on Friday (the last day of the conference and usually the slowest day) the EU Digital Identity Wallet track curated by Andy was standing-room-only.</p>



<p>Equally encouraging was the level of interest in the OpenWallet Foundation (OWF). The conference opened on Tuesday with a half-day OWF deep-dive—seven sessions with over 40 panelists, including Andy, Judith, André Kudra (esatus), Dan Bachenheimer (Accenture), and Drummond Reed (Gen). These sessions covered the OWF mission, code contributions (including two SD-JWT libraries), technology (including OpenID for Verifiable Issuance, OpenID Verifiable Presentation, and ISO 18013-X mDL), and verifiable credential use cases in travel, finance, and government.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Judith facilitated the ToIP panel on<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.kuppingercole.com_sessions_5293_2&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=eIGjsITfXP_y-DLLX0uEHXJvU8nOHrUK8IrwNKOtkVU&amp;r=lkG7i97OmZFU0gIh3HpvAZd0UWN8W2EqVHo8fBfdWqr3likaTHZ12akxKlASQZz8&amp;m=4KH2D5qw2714mmH8RAyew31ySxL7Bg_u9_5cUHb00jJGwH5fhMRZ_Uk1ok0IDV9S&amp;s=tz0ndaLaAQYCR9ywwcuZs17y5EMr5tEgktXhdwJB9UM&amp;e="> Defining the Protocol for Internet-Scale Digital Trust</a> (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKZeXYDIgiI">YouTube video of panel recording</a>) with Andre, Daniel, Drummond, and Christoph Schneider (GLEIF) as panelists. At the start of the session the audience was polled if they were familiar with the topic of a trust spanning layer and the response was near 0%. After the panel explained how and why we were building such a layer and what this layer would do for interoperable digital trust (see the graphic we used below), we polled the audience a second time to ask if they felt a trust spanning protocol was valuable. This time the response was 100% affirmative.</p>







<p>On Thursday Judith delivered a well-received keynote presentation Decentralized Identity – Why is it all the Rage? The video is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhv5-xbcmkw">here</a>. But the ultimate highlight of the conference were the two ToIP members honored with the prestigious European Identity Conference Awards:</p>



 
 <a href="https://monokee.com/en/homepage/">Monokee</a> won the award in “Enterprise IAM” category for their work with Italian manufacturer Gibus, where Monokee implemented a secure, compliant, modern and future-proof single sign-on solution in a business-to-business environment with an estimated 5000 users. KuppingerCole noted that Monokee’s solution integrated a significant number of identity providers and in a highly regulated environment. 



 <a href="https://www.gleif.org/">Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a> (GLEIF) took home the award for “Future Technologies &amp; Standards” for their suite of organizational identity services leveraging the new verifiable LEI (vLEI) model of digital identity, offering a standard for organizational identities, a trustworthy governance structure for assigning these, and a secure and reliable way of verifying the end-to-end identity of an organization. 
 



 Identiverse, May 30-June 2, Las Vegas 



<p>Identiverse is to North America what EIC is to Europe—in fact even larger. Last year the conference was sold by Ping Identity to <a href="https://www.cyberriskalliance.com/">CyberRisk Alliance</a>, a business intelligence company serving the high-growth cybersecurity industry. This year CyberRisk Alliance moved the conference to the sprawling Aria Resort hotel in Las Vegas, ensuring plenty of room for over 2500 attendees and 125 exhibitors.</p>



<p>As always, the conference opened with a riveting talk from Ping CEO Andre Durand. This year it began with Andre coming on stage and sitting down as we listened to his pre-recorded voiceover narrative to a powerful three-minute slideshow about how generative AI was now about to impersonate almost anyone almost anywhere. It ended with this warning:</p>







<p>At which point Andre stood up and announced that every single bit of the voiceover narrative and slide show we had just watched—including his voice, the script, the slides, and all the images—had been generated by AI.</p>



<p>In keeping with that theme, the dominant topics at Identiverse were tilted towards the cybersecurity side of digital identity. <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">FIDO passkeys</a> were a particularly strong focus, featuring in at least a dozen of the 175+ sessions.</p>



<p>However decentralized identity and trust was far from absent. A number of sessions and exhibitors covered various facets of digital wallets and verifiable credentials. However, the difference between the North American and European perspectives on decentralized identity and trust infrastructure was palpable. For example, while the Wednesday keynote presentation from Alex Simons of Microsoft included their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-verified-id">Entra Verified ID</a> decentralized identity platform, it was just one of four major topics he covered. And the talk given by Jeremy Grant, coordinator of the Washington D.C.-based <a href="https://www.betteridentity.org/">Better Identity Coalition</a>, was titled, “The Four Horsemen of the SSI Apocalypse” (Jeremy assured several ToIP members that it was “constructive criticism”).</p>



<p>Thankfully, that skeptical view of decentralized identity was contrasted with a Thursday keynote session featuring the OpenWallet Foundation. Led by OWF Executive Director Daniel Goldscheider, that session helped paint a strong picture of the progress of digital wallets and credentials, leaving the impression that the EU is leading the world in digital wallet infrastructure much as the EU GDPR regulations have led the world in privacy.</p>



<p>To the ToIP members attending, this Identiverse was a clarion call that we need to advance our work on all aspects of the ToIP stack as quickly as possible and be prepared to shine a brighter light on it in the next season of digital identity conferences.</p>

<p>Conference to feature expert-driven content on replacing passwords with passkeys; early bird discounts available through August 18</p>



<p>CARLSBAD, Calif., June 6, 2023&nbsp; —&nbsp; The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> is pleased to announce registration is now open for <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/">Authenticate</a>, the only industry conference dedicated to all aspects of user authentication – including a focus on passkeys and related FIDO-based solutions. Authenticate will be held October 16-18, 2023 at the Omni La Costa Resort &amp; Spa in Carlsbad, CA, just north of San Diego – with virtual attendance options also available.</p>



<p>To register, visit <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/authenticate-2023/">https://authenticatecon.com/event/authenticate-2023/</a>. Early bird registration discounts are available through August 18.</p>



<p>Aimed at CISOs, security strategists, enterprise architects, and product and business leaders, this is the fourth consecutive year that the FIDO Alliance is hosting the public conference. The annual event is specifically designed to share education, tools, and best practices for modern authentication across web, enterprise, and government applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Passkeys are the hottest topic in digital identity and authentication as the world accelerates its efforts to put passwords in the rear-view mirror,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of FIDO Alliance. “Authenticate has rapidly established itself as a must-attend event for those interested in learning about how to apply passkeys and other cutting-edge authentication solutions to their business. Between the dozens of sessions and countless networking opportunities, Authenticate attendees will come away from this year’s conference with actionable insights to help accelerate their companies’ transition to a password-free future.”</p>



<p>Last year’s conference sold out for in-person attendance, welcoming over 950 total attendees in Seattle and remotely. The event featured more than 100 sessions with highly engaging content, plus a sold-out exhibit area with 30 industry-leading exhibitors and sponsors.</p>



<p>Authenticate 2023 will build upon this strong foundation and feature detailed case studies, technical tutorials, expert panels, and hands-on lab sessions aimed at helping educate attendees on business drivers, technical considerations, and overall best practices for deploying modern authentication systems. The full 2023 agenda will be published later this month. Attendees benefit again from a dynamic expo hall and engaging networking opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sponsorship Opportunities at Authenticate 2023&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authenticate 2023 is accepting applications for sponsorship, offering a wide range of opportunities to provide broader brand exposure, lead-generation capabilities, and a variety of other benefits for both on-site and remote attendees. To learn more about sponsorship opportunities, please <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Authenticate_Prospectus_2023.pdf">view the prospectus</a>.</p>

<p>Adopting new tech tools is exciting and can benefit an organisation’s work. But there are also many <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/in-the-humanitarian-sectors-search-for-efficiency-are-we-falling-short/" title="">reasons to proceed with caution</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One tool in particular that we’ve seen <a href="https://www.unocha.org/sites/unocha/files/OCHA%20Technology%20Report.pdf" title="">growing uptake of is the chatbot,</a> especially in the humanitarian sector. So far, however, there has been limited research exploring risks, harms and opportunities related to their use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year we kicked off a project examining chatbot use in humanitarian work, with support from the IFRC and UNHCR. We looked into the types of chatbots used by humanitarian and civil society organisations across various contexts in more than 10 countries, including Ukraine, Ecuador, Kazakhstan and Libya. In this post, we share some of the key learnings for humanitarian organisations that emerged from our research –&nbsp;keep an eye out for the full report soon!&nbsp;</p>



 1. Problem first, solution second, tech third 



<p>At The Engine Room, we generally find that new tech tools are best approached in the following order: problem first, solution second, tech third.</p>



<p>In our research, we found that sometimes organisations wanted to use a chatbot for the sake of using a chatbot (i.e. a “solution-first” approach), and not because it was necessarily the best fit for addressing the problem they needed to solve – for example, addressing specific community needs or making up for gaps in staff capacity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This could lead to the chatbot being unsuccessful: In cases we encountered, community needs were sometimes better addressed through other means, such as hiring more staff to conduct site visits or answer queries, while the chatbots saw low usage or poor user feedback, or just didn’t answer the questions that people were actually coming to it with (in one case, for example, a Covid misinformation bot was used by people to try and access food aid).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of solving staff capacity issues, chatbots could sometimes instead create unforeseen double work. In some cases, for example, staff ended up having to manually transfer data from the chatbot into excel spreadsheets, or scan chatbot interactions to answer unaddressed questions.</p>



 2. Centring contextual considerations 



<p>Our research found that contextual considerations tend to play a key role in whether a chatbot helps an organisation achieve its goals or not. For example, a chatbot might not be a viable option in situations where smartphone saturation is low or where people share SIM cards. Likewise, some of our interviewees mentioned that younger community members are more likely to use a chatbot integrated into a platform they use regularly, like Telegram or Whatsapp, whereas older members of the community might prefer in-person interactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other factors to take into account included things like tech literacy, access to devices and the internet, and accessibility.</p>



 3. Checking operational &amp; user expectations&nbsp; 



<p>A key research finding was the need to adjust expectations of what humanitarian practitioners want a chatbot to do, versus what the chatbots they are considering using can actually do. This means adjusting monetary and staffing expectations, as well as critically thinking about <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/chatbots-humanitarian-field-concepts-uses-shortfalls" title="">the type of chatbot</a>&nbsp;(e.g. simple, FAQ or button based bots, mid-range bots, or AI-driven bots) that would be useful, if it is determined that a chatbot could be a useful tool in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to managing operational considerations, our research found that managing user expectations is essential in order to mitigate frustrating user experiences. For humanitarian organisations using chatbots, this means being transparent and upfront to affected communities about what their chatbot can do, and what it can’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, our research saw that many people desired a level of personalisation from chatbots that most chatbots currently deployed by humanitarian organisations cannot provide. This can result in a frustrating situation when users are sent on error loops, are repeatedly shown a predetermined script or can only ask questions rather than make comments. This frustration is worsened if it is not made clear that users are interacting with a bot and not a human.&nbsp;</p>



 4. Weaving in responsible data&nbsp; 



<p>Throughout this project we set out to understand what responsible data means when it comes to the use of chatbots in humanitarian contexts. Responsible data considerations that came up in our interviews and desk research touched on ongoing discussions around organisational data policies, GDPR compliance, and data sharing practices and agreements between humanitarian organisations, governments and corporations (among others).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though <a href="https://responsibledata.io/2018/01/24/rd-101-responsible-data-principles/" title="">responsible data is not a prescriptive practice</a>, the following questions could be a starting point for those considering deploying chatbots in humanitarian contexts:&nbsp;</p>



 
 What data is collected and how is it stored (and for how long)? Is this data shared?&nbsp; 



 How is consent achieved? Are there viable alternatives for impacted communities to access services without using the chatbot?&nbsp; 



 What data protection agreements are in place? Are risk assessments being conducted?&nbsp; 



 What platforms are the chatbots hosted on? What are the privacy policies of these companies (e.g., Meta, WhatsApp, Telegram, Viber, etc)?&nbsp; 



 What is the <a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/report/2509/humanitarian-metadata-problem-doing-no-harm-digital-era" title="">metadata</a> used for improving the function of the chatbot? How is this data minimised and deleted?&nbsp; 



 What <a href="https://www.unicef.org/documents/safer-chatbots-implementation-guide#:~:text=The%20Safer%20Chatbots%20project%20intends,such%20as%20refugees%20and%20migrants" title="">safeguards</a> are in place (e.g.<a href="https://blog.chayn.co/trauma-informed-design-understanding-trauma-and-healing-f289d281495c" title=""> trauma informed design</a>)?&nbsp; 
 



 5. Centring the needs and priorities of affected populations is essential 



<p>A recurring theme in our research was the question of what role automation plays in a humanitarian context, and the need to <a href="https://datasociety.net/library/repairing-innovation/" title="">maintain human interaction</a> even with the adoption of automated tools like chatbots.</p>



<p>Another issue that arose in the research was the lack of participatory, user-centred design practices that are inclusive of language and cultural contextualisation. Oftentimes, the people making tech like chatbots are not from the communities users are from, including language communities (if using machine learning). Further, chatbots can be deployed on populations before being adequately tested (or soliciting feedback) by the people who will need to rely on the tech to receive necessary services or information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Situations where chatbots are linguistically and culturally incompatible or make it difficult to access services (due to tech illiteracy, device access, error loops, etc) can potentially be avoided by considering if a chatbot is the right fit in the first place, given the specific needs and contexts of each situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our analysis surfaced a common tension – from our research, effective chatbots require time and resources to set up, but both of these tend to be in short supply when working in emergencies. This tension could benefit from additional research specifically focused on emergency situations.&nbsp;</p>

 Generative AI: What should governments in Latin America&nbsp;do? <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/elisabeth-sylvan">Elisabeth Sylvan</a> and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/armando-guio-espanol">Armando Guio&nbsp;Español</a></p><p><a href="https://www.caf.com/es/conocimiento/visiones/2023/05/inteligencia-artificial-que-deben-hacer-los-gobiernos-de-america-latina/">Para leer en español, haga clic&nbsp;aquí.</a></p><p>Given ongoing concerns and discussions in Latin America about both labor and digital literacy, fear about how new generative AI tools will impact the region is both understandable and reasonable. Latin America’s <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/research/global-reports/weso/trends2022/lang--en/index.htm">unemployment rate is high</a>, seven percent on average. The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1787/e6e864fb-en">OECD has determined</a> that more than 25% of jobs in Latin America may be at risk of replacement from automation, one of the highest rates in the world. El Tiempo, a popular newspaper in Colombia, recently created a special edition with which people can <a href="https://www.eltiempo.com/tecnosfera/la-inteligencia-artificial-podria-remplazar-algunas-profesiones-749326">self-assess the risk</a> of their employment being replaced&nbsp;soon.</p><p>In October 2023, Latin American governments will reunite in Santiago de Chile to discuss regional measures regarding AI ethics and governance, including the emerging regulatory landscape for the deployment of generative AI systems and tools. This meeting will be organized by UNESCO and the <a href="https://www.caf.com/en/about-caf/who-we-are/">Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF)</a>, a Latin-America-based development bank, as a regional initiative to determine the future of AI governance in the region and to foster collaboration among different countries and organizations. The outcomes of this meeting will be highly relevant not just to policymakers charged with generating and enforcing emerging technology governance for countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and the Dominican Republic, but also to all those invested in jurisdictions and regulations that apply to the future of work, education, and regional cooperation in the Global&nbsp;South.</p><p>Any Latin American civic response will need to be proportional to the real risks to the region and not be reactive to hype and fear. Staunch measures, such as banning innovation entirely, will restrict the region’s ability to impact how new AI tools are designed and deployed. On the other hand, inaction may deepen existing problems, weakening competitiveness and wasting precious time in response to fast-moving technological innovations.</p><p>We propose six specific measures that can help governments and decision-makers in Latin America to develop a clear roadmap for navigating this complex environment:</p> 1. Continue with ongoing AI policy implementation while increasing public participation therein <p>All countries have an opportunity to share information about and increase public participation in AI policy implementation, regardless of where they are in their process. Countries that have designed AI national strategies and those that are considering updating their AI national strategies can increase stakeholder involvement. When people are included, they may be more likely to view their governments as responsive. Inclusive practices will have the added benefit of educating the public about both generative AI and policy decisions.</p> 2. Identify and share the benefits of generative AI to the public&nbsp;good <p>In Latin America, the narrative about generative AI has been, on average, negative, typically focusing on how tools will replace humans. Governments can work towards a more balanced dialogue by thoughtfully weighing the benefits against the risks and highlighting benefits to the public in an even-handed and fair manner. Generative AI provides governments with a real opportunity to improve the public services they offer through digital government and digital transformation programs. For example, generative AI tools could help to reduce agency response times and increase information access.</p> 3. Define societal guardrails <p>While the benefits of generative AI are great, so are the risks. Together, we need to define how new tools will be used and how to handle issues such as plagiarism and falsehoods. Countries will need to consider how they will address risks against other fundamental rights. Ethical discussions must be a priority and different models must be piloted to determine how basic principles may be secured. The US’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf">Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a> provides a good reference on how public entities can operationalize the principles that promote the responsible use of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Governments in Latin America should also promote ethical principles in the private sector. Companies and AI entrepreneurs who are developing or using AI tools must engage with governments on ethical design. In parallel, AI tools need to be vetted. Governments can explore how to effectively incentivize companies, such as <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/7/4157">ethical certifications for AI applications</a> and how to develop oversight mechanisms at all stages of design and deployment. Stakeholders, especially consumers and civil society, need to be actively engaged in discussions about ethical concerns and encouraged to demand ethical behavior. Thus, governments need to promote the participation of both the private and public sectors while consumer groups should have an active role in providing actions for consumers to&nbsp;take.</p> 4. Accelerate regulatory experimentation and develop a first draft of AI legislation for the&nbsp;region <p>Before enacting extensive regulations, Latin American countries can test controlled regulatory approaches. Ambitious policy prototyping projects will allow experimentation with innovative regulatory proposals before they are adopted by governments. Regulatory sandboxes and policy prototyping initiatives, for example, will help countries to measure the impact of proposals. Regulatory sandboxes are legal spaces, often temporary, in which companies aren’t subjected to all regulations. These approaches allow all stakeholders to test different models while simultaneously examining how our legal, technical, and social systems will&nbsp;respond.</p><p>A key next step is to develop the first draft of generative AI system regulation that will support sandboxes and other prototyping. Just as Europe published a <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/publications/white-paper-artificial-intelligence-european-approach-excellence-and-trust_en">white paper on AI regulation</a>, so should Latin-American countries begin to formalize their regulatory approaches. Though Latin American countries can examine existing models of legislation from elsewhere in the world, their legislation should suit the needs of the region. Countries in the region may wish, for example, to center human rights issues more than technical ones (as the US’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights has done) and on procedure rather than content. Using existing international and regional principles of human rights, governments can test procedures and actions that would implement those principles in AI&nbsp;systems.</p> 5. Increase AI skills across populations, especially among women and&nbsp;children <p>One growing concern for those considering education and learning ecosystems in Latin America is whether people will have the skills to thrive in a world redefined by generative AI. People have the right to understand generative AI’s influence on their choices, behaviors, and actions and to gain and apply AI-related skills. Government should prioritize educational initiatives not only to support employment but also to support people to think critically about the responsible use of generative AI. The good news is that even though generative AI is new, governments have available existing educational resources. For instance, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/finland-one-percent-ai-artificial-intelligence-courses-learning-training/">Finland’s ‘1 percent’ demonstrates</a> that education can both prepare people for employment and reduce their fears. Colombia’s platform, <a href="https://aprendeia.org/">Aprendeia.Org</a>, created through a <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2022-08/bkc-scholars-helped-guide-colombias-ai-policy-implementation-part-countrys-ai-expert">recent AI expert mission</a>, is a set of free Latin American educational resources that anyone can use. And Youth and Media’s <a href="https://dcrp.berkman.harvard.edu/">evolving collection of AI tools</a> empowers teachers and learners across geographies and communities. All three approaches can be adapted throughout Latin&nbsp;America.</p><p>Though all people have a right to meaningfully engage with generative AI, not all people are positioned well to do so. Significant digital divides persist. <a href="https://www.iadb.org/en/news/latin-america-and-caribbean-need-reduce-gender-gap-digital-transformation">Women in Latin America</a> have less access to technology training and have fewer technology-related jobs than men. Unless governmental efforts address these pipeline concerns, women will not be able to contribute to the ethical implementation of generative AI as much as their male counterparts. Also, educational programs need to be developed for young people, both in and outside of school since their lives will be impacted by generative AI over the long&nbsp;term.</p> 6. Make strategic alliances; collaborate rather than&nbsp;compete <p>Governments in the region do not need to work alone. For example, if countries share the outcomes of their regulation experiments, AI literacy programs, and community engagement approaches, they can learn from one another what will succeed within the region. This collaboration can help countries to avoid repeating one another’s mistakes, saving precious time and resources. And if the region were to build shared data infrastructure for exchanging knowledge, together, Latin America overall would be more globally competitive. Such an infrastructure will facilitate efficient collaboration and strengthen the regulatory, educational, and job development initiatives in the region as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Governments can also work with external organizations, including the region’s many academic institutions, as well as international organizations that contribute to Latin American development. The exchange of ideas and experiences across countries and institutions will have a synergistic effect on understanding and possibilities. Government can work to generate effective spaces that facilitate alliances and set achievable regular goalposts for incremental outputs.</p><p>Now is the time to consider an AI Alliance in Latin America, bringing governments and other organizations to develop a shared&nbsp;agenda.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/generative-ai-what-should-governments-in-latin-america-do-9ca8a1f73051">Generative AI: What should governments in Latin-America do?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Cybercrime is an enormous problem in today’s world and continues to grow at an exponential rate. In fact, according to Cybersecurity Ventures, the cost of cybercrime is predicted to hit $8 trillion in 2023 and will grow to a whopping $10.5 trillion by 2025.</p>



<p>One of the main enablers for the escalation in cybercrime is the over-reliance on passwords. According to the FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance, passwords are the root cause of more than 80% of data breaches. This is because passwords can easily be phished, intercepted in transit, and uncovered via a variety of attacks. Further, users are often overburdened with remembering passwords across, on average, 90 different online accounts. It’s no surprise then that 51% of people re-use non-complex passwords across multiple accounts. As a result, weak or re-used passwords are effortlessly accessed by criminals. So, rather than execute complex hacks, threat actors simply log in to accounts to execute cybercrimes. The good news is, there is a better way: passwordless authentication, also known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axiad.com/axiad-cloud/phishing-resistant-authentication/">phishing-resistant Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</a>.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;Jonathan Van der Merwe, group lead product manager at&nbsp;Entersekt, one of the biggest stumbling blocks toward a passwordless future is the technological and behavioral hesitations that come with it. Van der Merwe suggests that moving away from static passwords toward one-time passwords (OTPs), in-app authentication and fast identity online (FIDO) is the way forward. “Moving on to newer technologies like FIDO, which allows for federated authentication ID within the application that you’re using to authenticate yourself, is effectively using the application using your device, whether that’s a laptop, a PC, or a mobile device,” he told PYMNTS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the dark web, cybercriminals have developed markets where passwords are bought and sold. Ransomware attacks are often performed using stolen passwords,&nbsp;Axios&nbsp;reports.&nbsp;Passkeys are generally considered more secure than passwords because hackers would need both the user’s information and the information from the company. If 1Password’s beta testing is successful, its current business model will fade into obscurity, and modern-day passwords will be a relic of a past, less secure age.</p>

<p>At the 2023 Identiverse conference, the nonprofit standards organization FIDO Alliance unveiled its new user experience guidelines for passkeys, which are generated and stored securely on users’ devices after those individuals register for a web application or service via their biometric data or a PIN. Among the various benefits: Users do not have to remember any credentials, nor are they prone to losing them via phishing scams. Moreover, passkeys can be synched across multiple user devices without having to re-enroll each time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of FinClusive?</p>



<p>FinClusive is a global Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS) infrastructure provider that enables increased financial engagement by facilitating traditional banking’s connectivity with emerging technology networks, existing and alternative payment rails and financial services providers.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Identity supports FinClusive’s goal to empower its clients to confidently demonstrate compliance with global banking standards, while expanding their services and engagement to businesses, communities and alternative technologies that have been traditionally underserved or unwelcomed within in the global financial system.</p>
 



  
<a href="https://www.finclusive.com"></a> 


<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>FinClusive does this primarily by providing strong identity assurance tools, coupled with a global, full-stack, financial crimes compliance/anti-money laundering (FCC/AML)—CaaS, which provides a Compliance-Enabled Credentialing Environment (CECE ™) through its Gateway services, which seamlessly embeds digitally verifiable compliance credentials into both the customer onboarding and transacting processes.</p>

<p>Canada is a trusted member of the G7 and global financial network with its strong banking, insurance and securities sectors. Canada’s strong dedication to information security, privacy and fighting financial crime principles needs to be translated into interoperable international standards and practices to ensure that these principles are supported in technology evolution and future networks. Canada needs to be at the table for online evolution and actively participate for it to succeed.</p>

                     <p>At <a href="https://traent.com/">Tr</a><a href="https://traent.com/">aent</a>, we develop hybrid blockchain technologies to bring real-time and data-intensive applications on blockchain while preserving the confidentiality and auditability of data. Traent has developed a Web3 ecosystem for sustainable and transparent enterprises, that offers an end-to-end solution to easily store, process, and share data visually on blockchain.</p>
<p>The research conducted by Traent has focused on overcoming the challenges and limitations that prevented the widespread adoption of blockchain technology by enterprises. Traent’s research efforts have yielded significant innovations, leading to the filing of eight patent applications as of March through May 2022 (currently pending). In this post, we will explore how Traent technology can enable the implementation of a complete Blockchain Product Passport of a vehicle and its battery.</p>
   Hybrid blockchains   <p>Before discussing the Blockchain Product Passports, it’s important to gain a better understanding of the key components of Traent’s ecosystem and the main difference with more traditional approaches:</p>
 
 A Hybrid Blockchain Infrastructure, able to create and manage billions of blockchains. This ensures scalability and enables us to handle billions of interactions securely and efficiently. 
 Traent Era, a collaboration platform on blockchain, suitable for real-time and data-intensive interactions. Our platform facilitates seamless communication and collaboration among users, allowing them to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology in their daily activities. 
 Our Portable Ledgers offer advanced flexibility for segregating confidential data. Thanks to our granular data disclosure feature, users have the freedom to select and share information from their blockchains, without compromising the auditability. After selecting the data, the user is able to share the ledger in different ways, through a dedicated App, or even with instant messaging services like WhatsApp. 
 Traent Viewer, a web app that allows the visualization of selected verifiable data, making blockchain content easily accessible to any audience, from auditors to end consumers. 
 
                     Blockchain Product Passport in the Automotive Industry   <p>The European Union is currently moving forward with the implementation of Digital Product Passports as part of the <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en">Sustainable Product Regulation proposal</a>, which was adopted by the European Commission in March 2022.</p>
<p>Under this regulation, companies selling products in the EU market will be obligated to provide a digital product passport for both the product itself and its individual components. This requirement aims to enhance transparency and sustainability throughout products’ lifecycles.</p>
<p>The Blockchain Vehicle Passport changes completely the way information related to ownership, car maintenance, and components is managed and accessed. The Traent Viewer allows users to effortlessly view and interact with the digital passport, providing a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle’s usage and specifications. This enhanced visibility empowers customers with trustworthy information about the vehicle’s history, enabling informed decision-making and promoting the resale value of the vehicle.</p>
                    <p>You can access a live demo of our product passport by scanning the QR code or visiting https://bit.ly/3yAqqPE with your phone.</p>
<p>The Battery Passport showcases a seamless integration between real-time data from IoT devices and interactive applications stored on the portable blockchain. The sensors periodically transmit data related to the battery’s performance and condition, facilitating proactive maintenance planning and giving a new meaning to what we know today as battery end-of-life. Now, the used battery can be securely sold and reused in a different environment, where it can be utilized to its fullest.</p>
<p>To offer a more practical understanding of the entire process, we prepared a video demo that showcases how data is collected from the car, stored on blockchain, and then visualized by the end user in the Vehicle Passport.</p>
<p>In a real-world scenario, data is directly ingested using Era APIs. However, for the purpose of this demo, we are leveraging the Traent Era user interface and its features to better explain some key concepts.</p>
<p>As shown in the audit log, car data is integrated using Traent Streams. This feature allows for real-time continuous ingestion of data, stored on blockchain every 50-100 milliseconds. When considering the battery passport, we have the option to reduce the data rate in order to conserve storage space. However, in situations such as car telemetry, it becomes crucial to maintain higher data rates. Therefore, we empower customers to make informed decisions by providing sensible defaults that suit their specific needs.</p>
<p>Because all data is stored on a portable ledger, a car owner can decide to share with a buyer information about the number of recharging sessions while excluding sensitive data like the location of the charging stations used. During the sale of the car, the product passport can be shared and ownership transferred through a simple app.</p>
<p>Lastly, data from the portable ledger is shown in a tailor-made, interactive application based on the Traent Viewer technology. This provides a gateway to an array of functionalities: from live insights into the battery’s usage history and health to quick access to car functionalities.</p>
           Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.           <p>The most attentive readers will have noticed that during the video data was selected from two blockchains. One blockchain concerns engine data and the other blockchain concerns battery data. This technique enables us to add blockchain to the product passport, allowing us to add data and services to the passport and making the solution scalable and future-proof.</p>
   Traent and MOBI   <p>At the beginning of 2023, we proudly joined MOBI, a prestigious community that shares our core values of sustainability, data verifiability, and privacy. We are honored and excited to work with some of the most renowned and well-respected companies in the automotive sector.</p>
<p>Being a part of MOBI allows us to actively contribute to the establishment of <a href="https://dlt.mobi/standards/">industry standards</a> and the development of a robust <a href="https://dlt.mobi/web3-infrastructure/">Web3 digital infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p>We appreciate the hands-on and pragmatic approach of <a href="https://dlt.mobi/community/">MOBI’s members</a> and hope with this article that we have contributed to making blockchain mobility closer to the user and easier to implement.</p>
   Conclusion   <p>Traent hybrid blockchain solution can offer a wide array of benefits to the automotive industry. We’ve shown how we create a complete battery and vehicle passport using Traent Hybrid Blockchain. Here are some important takeaways:</p>
 
 Deploying our complete blockchain solution is a streamlined process that takes less than a day. Unlike traditional implementations that may take months, our integrated approach ensures a fast turnaround time, saving you valuable resources and accelerating time-to-market. 
 Thanks to our granular data disclosure, you have the flexibility to choose which data to share and which to keep strictly confidential, without compromising the auditability of data. 
 Our apps are as easy as Web 2.0, but they are Web3. By leveraging the power of IoT and blockchain technology, in conjunction with a human-centric approach, our no-code ecosystem facilitates seamless collaboration among individuals, organizations, and connected devices. 
 Thanks to our hybrid architecture, Traent’s ecosystem enables the auditing of disclosed data even to people outside the network. Anyone with a simple web browser can verify the authenticity and integrity of information, overcoming the main limitations of private blockchains like Hyperledger.

<p>DNA can be used for more than just biology and genetics, but also for applications in fields such as information storage, object marking and traceability.</p>
<p>The extraordinary information density of DNA that can be used for storing data is particularly useful given the explosion of digital data.</p>
<p>Starting from a basic understanding of DNA and its components, let’s take a look at how digital files can be encoded in DNA using the correspondences between A, C, T, and G bases. The processes for writing and reading DNA still have some limitations particularly in synthesizing long strands of DNA, but the revolutionary potential is there.</p>
 DNA: Memory resisting the passage of time. 
<p>The oldest DNA in the world is 2 million years old. Found in sediments in Greenland, it revealed hundreds of plant species and mastodons which populated Greenland at a time when it was still covered with forest.</p>
<p>This discovery follows on from the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svante_P%c3%a4%c3%a4bo">Svante Pääbo</a>, an interpreter of ancient DNA and winner of the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/#:~:text=The%20Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine%202022%20was%20awarded,extinct%20hominins%20and%20human%20evolution.%E2%80%9D">2022 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine</a>, for his research work on evolutionary genetics and particularly sequencing the Neanderthal nuclear genome. DNA is infinitely small, yet extremely revealing and durable, with possible use beyond palaeontology, biology, genetics and human health.</p>
<p>Researchers in synthetic biology exploit the ability to read, edit and write DNA for products such as vaccines and drug delivery devices or genome engineering to generate organisms with specific properties. But applications for cryptography, information storage, object marking, and traceability are fast-moving innovation areas.</p>
 DNA structure. 
<p>DNA is made up of four nucleobases (or bases), A, C, T, G, which are connected as base pairs A-T and G-C. Oligonucleotides are short single or double-stranded DNA sequences that can be synthesized in single or double-stranded molecules. Plasmids are small circular DNA fragments found in bacterial and yeast cells that can be synthesized in the lab.</p>
<p></p>
 DNA alphabets. 
<p>When DNA is read in the cells, it produces proteins for the functioning and reproduction of living beings. Over 3 billion years of evolution, the cellular machinery has developed spellcheckers, word removers and copy-and-paste mechanisms for DNA. Today, synthetic biology allows the same thing to be done and any digital file can be encoded in the form of DNA: &nbsp;text, image, film, PDF, Excel, ZIP …</p>
<p>To convert data from binary format (with 0 and 1) to DNA format (with A, C, T and G bases), the two main options are :</p>




<p>1 bit/base : &nbsp;00 = A , &nbsp;01 = C , &nbsp;10 = T , &nbsp;11 = G</p>
<p>2bits/base : &nbsp;0 = A or C , 1 = T or G</p>




<p>Using the above codes, the word “hello” is converted in the corresponding DNA sequences :</p>
 DNA says “hello”

<p>Writing (or synthetizing) DNA is like telegraphy, where the transmitter made holes in a ribbon to code characters. Writing DNA involves attaching the letters A, C, T, G to each other, through base-to-base addition.</p>
<p>The length of synthesized DNA strands is limited, with oligonucleotide lengths of more than 200 bases (i.e. 200 ACTG bases) representing the current limit of “industrial” production.</p>
<p>Reading technologies are evolving very quickly and allow DNA sequences to be read base by base. One of the most recent techniques uses so called “nanopores”: The oligonucleotides pass through holes. When a base passes through, an electric current is measured. The current is specific to each base, which makes it possible to detect the sequence of the oligonucleotides … and therefore the text. As each fragment has an identifier, the original data can be reassembled in the right order. This technique has the potential to greatly speed up the process of DNA sequencing, making it faster and cheaper than current methods which are still time consuming and expensive.</p>
<p></p>
 DNA for the dataverse. 
<p>Data storage is a massively expanding domain, with an estimated 75 zettabytes (ZB) (75 1021 bytes) of data to be stored in 2023, 95% of which will never be read again.</p>
<p>It is estimated that in 2030 nearly 300 ZB of data will be stored and that in 2040 one thousandth of the earth’s surface will be used for data centres – 10% of the surface of Switzerland! – to store all these data…</p>
<p>It would take more than 100 million years to download such data with a fibre with a speed of 100 megabits per second, and a serious energy bill!</p>
<p>Data centres alone consume almost 150 TWh per year (150 1012 Wh per year), which equals to 2% of the world’s electricity consumption.</p>
<p>Storing data in DNA is a promising solution since it has an extraordinary information density. All the world’s digital data (i.e. hundreds of ZB) would weigh between 50 and 100 grams of DNA, roughly the weight of a Swiss chocolate bar.</p>
<p></p>
 DNA for storage and tracing. 
<p>Resistant under specific conditions, DNA remains a fragile molecule, sensitive to high temperatures, humidity, chemical compounds and ultraviolet radiation. To maintain its integrity, it must be protected from these aggressive agents. One way to do this is to encapsulate it for instance in silica microbeads before use. Thus protected, the DNA can be stored or inserted into objects for later reading.</p>
<p>Objects could therefore carry their own immutable memory. A DNA of Things (DoT) for everything and for ever.</p>
<p>However, for DNA to be used as storage, it not only has to be easily written and read, but also easily searchable or indexable in a molecular filing system. This is still at research level, but it has been proven that silica particles used to encapsulate data encoded DNA sequences can also be barcoded or tagged for standard Boolean search. This would complete the absolute potential of DNA as a data carrier other than for biology, but for information storage and traceability.</p>
<p>As with any promising technological development, the issues of privacy and security must be considered so that DNA encoded information does not get misused by unauthorised parties. This calls for a multidisciplinary approach to creating and using synthetic DNA. Just like paleogenomics ermerged as a new discipline following Pääbo’s research, new fields of research and new applications for gene synthesis are already on the way, powered by the need for cost and energy efficient, forever accessible data storage solutions.</p>

<p>A pesar de que las mujeres negras están al frente de algunos de los movimientos por la justicia social más importantes de nuestro tiempo, liderando iniciativas extraordinarias con compromiso y creatividad, la mayoría de las veces lo hacen con <a href="https://www.fundblackfeminists.org/" title="">financiamientos limitados</a>.</p>



<p>Reconociendo esto, estamos ofreciendo apoyo gratuito en las áreas de tecnología y datos para las organizaciones feministas negras. Sigue leyendo para saber cómo tu organización puede ser una organización aliada.</p>


 
 


 El estado de la financiación de las organizaciones feministas negras: ¿qué tiene que ver con la tecnología? 



<p>Hace unas semanas, Foundation for a Just Society y Wellspring Philanthropic Fund publicaron un informe sobre cómo la <a href="https://blackfeministlac.org/es/" title="">filantropía ha pasado por alto a los movimientos feministas negros en América Latina y el Caribe</a>. Un equipo de investigadoras feministas negras analizó el activismo en 17 países y concluyó que las iniciativas lideradas por mujeres negras en la región tienen un acceso extremadamente limitado al financiamiento y la mayoría depende de sus propios recursos para realizar su trabajo.</p>



<p>Estos resultados confirman <a href="https://www.hrfn.org/resources/the-dire-state-of-funding-for-black-feminist-movements-and-what-donors-can-do-about-it/" title="">investigaciones anteriores</a> del <a href="https://blackfeministfund.org/our-movement-partners/" title="">Black Feminist Fund</a> que mostraban que sólo entre el 0,1% y el 0,35% de las subvenciones de fundaciones concedidas en todo el mundo se destinaban a movimientos de niñas, mujeres y personas trans negras y que sólo el 5% de los financiamientos para derechos humanos se destina a organizaciones dirigidas por niñas, mujeres y personas trans negras.</p>



<p>En un contexto en el que el 81% de las organizaciones feministas negras no disponen de dinero suficiente para alcanzar sus objetivos, y – como vemos en <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-research-community-call-intersectional-approaches-to-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/" title="">nuestra propia investigación</a> – la falta de acceso a financiación y redes fiables dificulta que las organizaciones de justicia social prioricen el <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/social-justice-digital-rights-during-covid-19-barriers-to-collaboration/" title="">fortalecimiento de su uso de la tecnología y los datos</a>, queremos reafirmar nuestra oferta de apoyo a las organizaciones, colectivos o grupos liderados por mujeres negras que trabajan por la justicia social.</p>



<p>En The Engine Room, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TER-Strategy-July-2022-update.pdf" title="">nuestra visión</a> es que los movimientos por la justicia social utilicen la tecnología y los datos de forma segura, responsable y estratégica, mitigando activamente las vulnerabilidades creadas por los sistemas digitales. Esto incluye cosas como apoyar a las organizaciones que están repensando su uso de la tecnología y los datos, iniciando proyectos tecnológicos responsables y sostenibles, o mejorando su resiliencia digital, todo lo cual, aunque importante, puede llevar bastante tiempo (¡y recursos!).</p>



<p>Si formas parte de una institución dirigida por mujeres negras y te gustaría contar con nuestro apoyo en el uso de la tecnología y los datos para tu trabajo y organización, ¡nos encantaría colaborar contigo!</p>



 Cómo puedes trabajar con nosotros 



<p>En The Engine Room, trabajamos con grupos cuyo trabajo aborda los desequilibrios de poder, la injusticia y los abusos de derechos, y les ayudamos a utilizar la tecnología y los datos de forma que se ajusten a sus necesidades, políticas y principios.</p>



<p>Somos una organización sin fines de lucro con un equipo distribuido globalmente, compuesto por activistas, investigadores y tecnólogos experimentados y comprometidos (muchos de los cuales están ubicados o tienen una experiencia significativa de trabajo en América Latina). Desde 2011, hemos trabajado con más de 700 organizaciones de varios tamaños y de diferentes partes del mundo para fortalecer sus estrategias de tecnología y datos.</p>



<p>Ofrecemos dos tipos de apoyo gratuito: <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">Light Touch Support</a> (LiTS) e <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="">Intensive Support</a> (Matchbox), y para otros proyectos intensivos, ofrecemos servicios de apoyo pagos según una escala variable. Adaptamos nuestro apoyo a las necesidades de cada organización asociada, y nuestro trabajo puede incluir cosas como:</p>



 
 

 



 
<p>Documentar tu trabajo y crear tu archivo digital: “El Internet tiene mucha memoria, pero de alguna manera parece que no puede recordar que las mujeres negras fueron las creadoras de las cosas”. Esta cita de Antoinette Luna Myers en <a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479865109/misogynoir-transformed/">Misogynoir Transformed</a> es un recordatorio de la cantidad de trabajo, logros y conocimientos creados por las mujeres negras que a menudo se ignoran o no se registran (¡incluyendo el trabajo que <a href="https://www.meredithdclark.com/archivingblacktwitter">dio forma al internet que tenemos hoy</a>!). Podemos trabajar con tu organización en el proceso de documentar digitalmente su trabajo y compartirlo con tu público.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Fortalecer redes y conectar activistas de forma segura: En <a href="https://blackfeministlac.org/research/">Resourcing Black Feminist Organizing</a>, las feministas negras indicaron que establecer conexiones internacionales es una prioridad particular para poder construir movimientos autónomos en América Latina y el Caribe. Podemos apoyar a tu organización a encontrar las mejores herramientas digitales para conectarse con otros activistas y organizadores.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Datos responsables: Si hay información que no está disponible en tu contexto, y que sería crucial para tu trabajo y/o para las personas con las que trabajas, podemos apoyarte en la creación de un plan para la recolección y gestión responsable de estos datos. También podemos trabajar juntas para establecer un proceso responsable y ágil de conservación, archivo y eliminación de los datos que utilizas en tu trabajo diario.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Cuidado digital y resiliencia: Podemos trabajar juntas para fortalecer la capacidad de tu organización para protegerte de las amenazas a la seguridad digital (y responder a ellas), cuidar del bienestar de tu equipo y adoptar una infraestructura que responda a tus necesidades y contexto.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Diseño y ejecución de proyectos: Podemos apoyarte a diseñar proyectos que sean realistas, sostenibles y que logren el impacto buscado para abordar la complejidad de los desafíos de tu contexto, incorporando datos y tecnología.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Fortalecimiento de la intuición técnica: Podemos trabajar con tu equipo para fortalecer tu intuición técnica, tu aptitud para navegar por los matices del trabajo con tecnología y amplificar tu capacidad para equilibrar las oportunidades y los retos que la tecnología conlleva.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/calling-all-black-feminist-organizations-for-no-fee-tech-and-data-support/" title="English">English</a> | <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/convocatoria-para-organizaciones-feministas-negras-apoyo-gratuito-en-tecnologia-e-informacion-digital/" title="Español">Español</a></p>



<p>Embora as mulheres negras estejam na vanguarda de alguns dos movimentos de justiça social mais importantes de nosso tempo, liderando iniciativas extraordinárias com comprometimento e criatividade, na maioria das vezes elas o fazem com <a href="https://www.fundblackfeminists.org/" title="">recursos limitados</a>.</p>



<p>Reconhecendo isso, estamos oferecendo apoio gratuito nas áreas de tecnologia e dados para organizações feministas negras. Continue lendo para saber como sua organização pode ser nossa parceira!</p>


 
 


 O estado do financiamento para organizações feministas negras: o que a tecnologia tem a ver com isso? 



<p>Algumas semanas atrás, a Foundation for a Just Society e o Wellspring Philanthropic Fund publicaram um relatório sobre como a <a href="https://blackfeministlac.org/pt-br/" title="">filantropia tem negligenciado os movimentos feministas negros</a> na América Latina e no Caribe. Uma equipe de pesquisadoras feministas negras olhou para o ativismo em 17 países e concluiu que as iniciativas lideradas por mulheres negras na região têm acesso extremamente limitado a financiamento e a maioria depende de recursos próprios para viabilizar seu trabalho.</p>



<p>Estes resultados confirmam <a href="https://www.hrfn.org/resources/the-dire-state-of-funding-for-black-feminist-movements-and-what-donors-can-do-about-it/" title="">pesquisas anteriores</a> feitas pelo <a href="https://blackfeministfund.org/our-movement-partners/" title="">Black Feminist Fund</a>, mostrando que apenas 0,1% a 0,35% das doações de fundações feitas a nível global foram destinadas a movimentos de meninas, mulheres e pessoas trans negras e que apenas 5% do financiamento para direitos humanos foi direcionado a organizações lideradas por meninas, mulheres e pessoas trans negras.</p>



<p>Em um contexto em que 81% das organizações feministas negras <a href="https://www.fundblackfeminists.org/" title="">não têm dinheiro suficiente</a> para atingir seus objetivos e – como vemos em <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-research-community-call-intersectional-approaches-to-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/" title="">nossa própria pesquisa</a> – a falta de acesso a financiamento e redes confiáveis dificulta que as organizações de justiça social priorizem o <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/social-justice-digital-rights-during-covid-19-barriers-to-collaboration/" title="">fortalecimento de seu uso de tecnologia e dados</a>, queremos reiterar nossa oferta de apoio a organizações, coletivos ou grupos liderados por mulheres negras que trabalham pela justiça social.</p>



<p>Na The Engine Room, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TER-Strategy-July-2022-update.pdf" title="">nossa visão</a> é que os movimentos de justiça social usem tecnologia e dados de forma segura, responsável e estratégica, mitigando ativamente as vulnerabilidades criadas pelos sistemas digitais. Isso inclui coisas como apoiar as organizações parceiras que estejam repensando como elas têm usado tecnologia e dados, interessadas em embarcar em projetos de tecnologia de forma responsável e sustentável, ou dispostas a melhorar sua resiliência digital. E essas coisas, embora importantes, podem levar um pouco de tempo (e recursos!).</p>



<p>Se você faz parte de uma instituição liderada por mulheres negras e gostaria de nosso apoio no uso de tecnologia e dados para seu trabalho e organização, adoraríamos colaborar com você!</p>



 Como você pode trabalhar com a gente 



<p>Na The Engine Room, fazemos parceria com grupos cujo trabalho enfrenta desequilíbrios de poder, injustiça e abusos de direitos e os apoiamos no uso de tecnologia e dados de maneiras que atendam às necessidades, políticas e princípios.</p>



<p>Somos uma organização sem fins lucrativos com uma equipe global distribuída de ativistas, pesquisadoras, tecnólogas(os) experientes e comprometidos (muitos dos quais estão baseados ou têm experiência significativa de trabalho na América Latina). Desde 2011, trabalhamos com mais de 700 organizações de todos os tamanhos, de diferentes partes do mundo, para fortalecer suas estratégias de tecnologia e dados.</p>



<p>Oferecemos dois tipos de apoio gratuito: Apoio Leve (<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">Light Touch Support</a>) e Apoio Intensivo (<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="">Matchbox)</a>, e para outros projetos intensivos, também oferecemos serviços de apoio pagos de acordo com uma escala variável. Personalizamos nosso suporte para atender às necessidades de cada organização parceira, e nosso trabalho pode incluir coisas como:</p>



 
 

 



 
<p>Documentando seu trabalho e construindo seu arquivo digital: “A Internet tem muita memória, mas de alguma forma parece que não consegue lembrar que as mulheres negras foram as criadoras das coisas.” Esta citação de Antoinette Luna Myers em <a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479865109/misogynoir-transformed/">Misogynoir Transformed</a> é um lembrete de quanto do trabalho, conquistas e conhecimentos criados por mulheres negras muitas vezes são ignorados ou não registrados (incluindo o trabalho que <a href="https://www.meredithdclark.com/archivingblacktwitter">deu forma à Internet que temos hoje</a>!). Podemos apoiar sua organização no processo de documentar digitalmente seu trabalho e compartilhar com seu público.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Fortalecimento de redes e conexão entre ativistas de maneira segura: Em <a href="https://blackfeministlac.org/research/">Resourcing Black Feminist Organizing</a>, feministas negras indicaram que estabelecer conexões internacionais é uma prioridade específica, para que possam construir movimentos autônomos na América Latina e no Caribe. Podemos ajudar a sua organização a encontrar as melhores ferramentas digitais para se conectar com outras ativistas e organizadores.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Dados responsáveis: Se no seu contexto, faltam dados que seriam cruciais para o seu trabalho e para as pessoas com quem você trabalha, podemos apoiá-la na criação de um plano para a coleta e gestão responsável destes dados! Também podemos trabalhar juntas para estabelecer um processo responsável e simplificado de retenção, arquivamento e exclusão de dados que você usa no seu dia-a-dia.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Cuidados digitais e resiliência: Podemos trabalhar juntas para apoiar a capacidade da sua organização de se proteger de (e responder a) ameaças de segurança digital, garantir o bem-estar de sua equipe e adotar infraestruturas que respondam às suas necessidades e ao seu contexto.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Criação e implementação de projetos: Podemos apoiá-la na concepção de projetos realistas, sustentáveis e impactantes para enfrentar desafios complexos em seu contexto, incorporando dados e tecnologia em seu trabalho.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Fortalecimento da intuição técnica: Podemos trabalhar com sua equipe para fortalecer sua intuição técnica, sua aptidão para navegar pelas nuances do trabalho com tecnologia e ampliar a capacidade de equilibrar as oportunidades e desafios que a tecnologia traz.</p>

<p>Though Black women are at the forefront of some of the most important social justice movements of our time, leading extraordinary initiatives with commitment and creativity, most of the time they are doing so with <a href="https://www.fundblackfeminists.org/" title="">limited funding</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing this, we are extending a targeted offer of free tech and data support to Black feminist organizers. Read on to learn how you can partner with us!</p>







 The funding realities of Black feminist organizing: what’s tech got to do with it? 



<p>A few weeks ago, Foundation for a Just Society and Wellspring Philanthropic Fund published a report on how <a href="https://blackfeministlac.org/" title="">philanthropy has overlooked Black feminist movements in Latin America and the Caribbean</a>. A team of Black feminist researchers looked into activism in 17 countries and concluded that Black women-led initiatives in the region have extremely limited access to funding and most rely on self-generated resources to enable their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These findings echo <a href="https://www.hrfn.org/resources/the-dire-state-of-funding-for-black-feminist-movements-and-what-donors-can-do-about-it/" title="">previous research</a> done by the <a href="https://blackfeministfund.org/our-movement-partners/" title="">Black Feminist Fund</a>, showing that a mere 0.1% – 0.35% of foundation giving globally went to Black women, girls and trans movements/initiatives and that only 5% of human rights funding went to organizations led by Black women, girls and trans people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a context where 81% of Black feminist organizations <a href="https://www.fundblackfeminists.org/" title="">do not have enough money</a> to meet their goals and – as we see in <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-research-community-call-intersectional-approaches-to-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/" title="">our own research</a> – a lack of access to funding and trusted networks makes it difficult for social justice organizations to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/social-justice-digital-rights-during-covid-19-barriers-to-collaboration/" title="">prioritize strengthening their use of tech and data</a>, we want to reiterate our offer of support to Black women-led organizations, collectives or groups working towards social justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At The Engine Room, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TER-Strategy-July-2022-update.pdf" title="">our vision</a> is for social justice movements to use technology and data in safe, responsible and strategic ways, while actively mitigating the vulnerabilities created by digital systems. This includes things like supporting organizations’ rethinking their use of tech and data, embarking on responsible, sustainable tech-heavy projects, or improving their digital resilience – all of which, though important, can take quite a bit of time (and resources!).</p>



<p>If you’re a part of a Black women-led institution and would like our support with using tech and data for your work and organizing, we would love to collaborate with you!&nbsp;</p>



 How you can partner with us 



<p>At The Engine Room, we partner with groups whose work confronts power imbalances, injustice and rights abuses and support them in using tech and data in ways that meet the needs, politics and principles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are a non-profit organization with a distributed global team of experienced and committed activists, researchers, technologists and community organizers (many of whom are based in or have significant experience working in Latin America). Since 2011, we have worked with more than 700 organizations of all sizes, from different corners of the globe, to strengthen their tech and data strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We offer two types of no-fee support partnership: <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">Light Touch Support</a> (LiTS) and <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" title="">Intensive Support</a> (Matchbox) and for other in-depth projects, we offer sliding-scale based paid support. We personalize our support to serve the needs of each partner, and our work can include things like:</p>



 
 

 



 
<p>Documenting your work and building your digital archive: “The Internet has a lot of memory, but somehow it can’t seem to remember that Black women were the creators of things.” &nbsp;This quote from Antoinette Luna Myers in <a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479865109/misogynoir-transformed/">Misogynoir Transformed</a> is a reminder of how much of the work, achievements and knowledge created by Black women often go ignored or unregistered (including the work that went into <a href="https://www.meredithdclark.com/archivingblacktwitter">shaping the Internet we have today</a>!). We can support your organization with creating tech/data processes for digitally documenting your work.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Community building and connecting with fellow organizers in safe ways. In <a href="https://blackfeministlac.org/research/">Resourcing Black Feminist Organizing</a>, Black feminists named cross-border organizing as a particular priority, so they can build autonomous movements across Latin America and the Caribbean. We can support you in finding the best tools to connect with fellow activists and organizers.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Responsible Data: If there is data missing in your context that would be crucial to your work and the people you’re working with, we can support you in coming up with a plan for collecting and managing it responsibly! We can also work together to establish a responsible and streamlined process for retaining, archiving and deleting data you use.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Digital care and digital resilience: We can work together to support your organization’s ability to protect yourself from – and respond to – digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of your team, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to your needs and contexts.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Project design and implementation: We can support you in designing realistic, sustainable and impactful projects to address complex challenges in your context, while incorporating data and technology into your work.</p>
 
 



 
 

 



 
<p>Strengthening technical intuition: We can work with your team to strengthen your technical intuition, aptitude for navigating the nuances of working with tech, and ability to balance the opportunities and challenges tech brings.</p>
 
 



<p></p>



<p>If you are part of a Black feminist organization in Latin America and the Caribbean or beyond, and are interested in working with us, <a href="https://calendly.com/the-engine-room/introductions?back=1&amp;month=2023-05" title="">schedule a call</a> or write to us at hello[at]theengineroom.org.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The term ‘Digital Transformation’ has been echoing in the boardrooms of businesses, big and small, for the past decade. Despite its prevalence, its meaning and implications are often misunderstood or oversimplified. In essence, digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, fundamentally changing how you operate and deliver value to customers. This comprehensive guide aims to demystify what digital transformation entails, its benefits, and how to successfully implement it in your business.</p>



 Understanding Digital Transformation 



<p>Digital transformation is not merely about updating your IT infrastructure or adopting the latest tools; it’s about creating new—or modifying existing—business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements. It is an ongoing process of change, driven by the evolving digital landscape and the need for businesses to remain competitive and relevant.</p>



<p>Digital transformation can encompass a wide range of activities, from automating manual processes, leveraging data analytics for decision-making, embracing cloud computing, to adopting emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT).</p>



 The Benefits of Digital Transformation 



<p>1. Improved Efficiency: Through automation and streamlined processes, businesses can reduce operational costs and increase productivity.</p>



<p>2. Enhanced Customer Experience: By leveraging data analytics and digital tools, businesses can provide personalized experiences, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>



<p>3. Increased Agility: Digital transformation allows businesses to respond quickly to changes in the market or customer behavior.</p>



<p>4. Improved Decision Making: With the help of big data and advanced analytics, businesses can make informed decisions.</p>



<p>5. Innovation and Competitive Advantage: By embracing digital transformation, businesses can innovate their products, services, and processes, gaining a competitive edge.</p>



 Implementing Digital Transformation 



<p>Implementing digital transformation is a complex process that requires a strategic approach. Here are some steps to guide you:</p>



<p>1. Define Your Strategy: The first step is to define your digital transformation strategy. What are your business goals? How can digital technologies help you achieve these goals?</p>



<p>2. Assess Your Current State: Understand your current digital maturity. Evaluate your existing technology, processes, and skills.</p>



<p>3. Identify the Gaps: Based on your strategy and current state, identify the gaps that need to be addressed.</p>



<p>4. Prioritize Initiatives: Prioritize your digital transformation initiatives based on their impact on your business goals and the resources required.</p>



<p>5. Implement the Change: Start implementing the changes. This could involve adopting new technologies, training your staff, changing your business processes, etc.</p>



<p>6. Monitor and Adjust: Digital transformation is an ongoing process. Monitor your progress, measure the results, and adjust your approach as needed.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Digital transformation is a necessary evolution for businesses to stay competitive in the digital era.

<p>LAS VEGAS, Nev., May 31, 2023 – The <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3574062-1&amp;h=1964299261&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fidoalliance.org%2F&amp;a=FIDO+Alliance">FIDO Alliance</a> today released new user experience (UX) guidelines to help accelerate deployment and adoption of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance UX Guidelines for Passkey Creation and Sign-ins aim to help online service providers design a better, more consistent user experience when signing in with passkeys. The guidelines are available at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/ux-guidelines/">https://fidoalliance.org/ux-guidelines/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on FIDO standards, passkeys are a replacement for passwords that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices. While far easier and more secure than passwords and legacy forms of 2FA, the research performed for these guidelines found that passkey sign-ins present a distinct user journey that service providers need to consider before providing passkey support. The FIDO Alliance UX Guidelines provide evidence-based best practices for key steps in the user journey for passkey creation and sign-in.</p>



<p>“As companies around the world accelerate their move toward passwordless authentication based on FIDO standards, the topic of user experience has risen to the forefront,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “Passkeys uniquely can provide a phishing-resistant sign-in as well as a superior user experience which can drive top-line growth by enabling more seamless access to online services and engendering stronger brand affinity. We encourage online service providers to use these guidelines in their journey to rolling out passkeys to ensure a consistent, thoughtful, and simple user experience for their users.”</p>



<p>Passkeys are supported in the vast majority of consumer devices: Apple and Google have readied their operating systems for service providers to enable sign-ins with passkeys that sync across devices; Windows 10 and 11 have long supported device-bound passkeys in Windows Hello – and passkeys from iOS or Android devices can also be used to sign into sites in Chrome or Edge on Windows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many leading service providers including Google, PayPal, Yahoo! Japan, NTT DOCOMO, CVS Health, Shopify, Hyatt, Instacart, Robinhood, Mercari and Kayak are providing their customers with passkey sign-ins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When it comes to providing passkeys to consumers, technical implementation is only one piece of the puzzle,” said Kevin Goldman, chair of the FIDO Alliance UX Working Group and Chief Experience Officer at Trusona. “Simply put, the UX is a critical component in helping consumers adopt passkeys as a password replacement. These guidelines are a carefully researched set of best practices that will help online service providers design a better, more consistent user experience when signing in with passkeys and ultimately maximize adoption.”</p>



<p>The guidelines were created by the FIDO Alliance UX Working Group in partnership with usability research firm Blink UX – with added underwriting support from 1Password, Google, Trusona and US Bank. This group collectively conducted formal research of FIDO user journeys and actively engaged with FIDO Alliance stakeholders to establish these UX best practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learn more about the FIDO UX Guidelines for Passkeys at Identiverse 2023</p>



<p>Attending Identiverse? Learn more about the guidelines today, May 31, during the session <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/session/1361549/">“Optimizing UX for Passkeys”</a> at 2:00 pm PDT.</p>

 Trusted AI with OriginTrail: Join the fight against misinformation and participate in 1 million TRAC grants launched by Trace&nbsp;Labs <p>OriginTrail’s trusted knowledge foundation was launched in 2018 to improve trust and transparency in global supply chains. Similarly, OriginTrail’s new knowledge-based AI framework now aims to instill trust in AI solutions. Trace Labs — OriginTrail core developers are announcing a 1,000,000 TRAC token grant program for contributors to help advance ChatDKG — the open source framework for trusted AI to help fight misinformation.</p> AI Challenges: Navigating the Pitfalls to Unlock its Potential <p>According to Goldman Sachs Chief Information Officer, Marco Argenti, “the impact of advances in generative artificial intelligence on society could be comparable to the printing press” and with over 91% of top businesses currently investing in AI (NewVantage, 2022), those opportunities might be seized at a very rapid pace. However, with the internet already flooded with misinformation, AI is likely to amplify the&nbsp;problem.</p><p>One of the major challenges with generative AI models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, is the occurrence of hallucinations or errors in AI-generated outputs. These errors could lead to incorrect decisions and actions, which could have severe consequences for individuals and society. Ensuring information provenance in AI systems is also essential, as without it, bias, misinformation, and propaganda may&nbsp;arise.</p><p>Furthermore, it is essential to address the implementation of proper data governance approaches. In fact, some AI solutions have already been banned in the EU due to data governance issues (e.g., Italy’s ban on ChatGPT). This highlights the urgent need for precise data access management and equitable business models based on data ownership to ensure sustainable AI solutions.</p><p>Finally, AI’s value is currently being held back by the difficulty of finding and accessing data and knowledge that is locked in legacy systems and not being used as a contributing corpus of knowledge for AI-based solutions. Addressing these challenges will ensure the safe and effective implementation of AI and its benefits to&nbsp;society.</p> Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) — trusted knowledge foundation <p>OriginTrail leads the development for decentralization of knowledge by enabling its discoverability, verifiability and information provenance. Its core technology, the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), has already proven valuable by facilitating trusted knowledge sharing in international trade for companies like Walmart and Home Depot, ensuring safety of rail travel in Switzerland and increasing transparency of healthcare supply chains for donated medicine.</p><p>The DKG is an open source network that brings together two technologies — blockchains and knowledge graphs. It creates a trusted knowledge foundation which is particularly useful for AI solutions as it makes it easy to search the DKG for the right knowledge, verify its provenance and interact with&nbsp;it.</p> ChatDKG — an open framework for trusted AI based on OriginTrail DKG <p>To accelerate the use of OriginTrail’s DKG with AI solutions, OriginTrail introduces ChatDKG — a framework for efficiently searching, accessing and utilizing trusted knowledge with AI tools. The ChatDKG framework is designed as an open community project exploring its diverse possible applications.</p><p>Supporting this effort, Trace Labs, the core developers of OriginTrail, are making a 1,000,000 TRAC grant pool available for contributors creating components connecting OriginTrail DKG with existing AI&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Join OriginTrail <a href="https://discord.gg/RYVx7t3sdU">Discord channel</a> to keep track of the grant program details as they become available over the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by organizing trusted AI — grade knowledge assets. It leverages the open source Decentralized Knowledge Graph that connects the physical world (art, healthcare, fashion, education, supply chains,&nbsp;…) and the digital world (blockchain, smart contracts, Metaverse &amp; NFTs,&nbsp;…) in a single connected reality driving transparency and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Advanced knowledge graph technology currently powers trillion-dollar companies like Google and Facebook. By reshaping it for Web3, the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph provides a crucial fabric to link, verify, and value data on both physical and digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p><p>👇 More about Trace&nbsp;Labs👇</p><p>Trace Labs is the core developer of <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> — the open source Decentralized Knowledge Graph.

 Surveillance capitalism is a term that is increasingly becoming relevant in today’s digital age. Coined by Harvard Professor Shoshana Zuboff in her 2019 book, “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,” the term refers to the commodification of personal data by tech companies. Essentially, it’s a business model where companies collect, analyze, and sell user data to advertisers for profit.

<p>Surveillance capitalism is a term that is increasingly becoming relevant in today’s digital age. Coined by Harvard Professor Shoshana Zuboff in her 2019 book, “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,” the term refers to the commodification of personal data by tech companies. Essentially, it’s a business model where companies collect, analyze, and sell user data to advertisers for profit.</p>



 The Genesis of Surveillance Capitalism 



<p>The rise of the internet in the late 20th century brought about a new age of technology and connectivity. As we welcomed the digital age, tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, began offering their platforms for free. Users happily engaged with these services, seemingly receiving something for nothing. However, this exchange was far from one-sided.</p>



<p>These companies developed a business model where the product was not the platform itself, but the data it collected. Every click, every like, every share became an integral part of a massive data-gathering mechanism. This data is then analyzed, packaged, and sold to advertisers who use it to target consumers with an accuracy that traditional advertising methods could never achieve.</p>



 The Implications and Concerns 



<p>Surveillance capitalism raises various ethical and privacy concerns. Central to these is the lack of transparency and user consent. Most users are unaware of the extent of the data collected and how it’s used. The user agreements are often complex and difficult to understand, leading to uninformed consent.</p>



<p>Moreover, users have limited control over their data. Once collected, it can be sold, shared, or leaked without their knowledge. This poses significant security risks and potential misuse of personal information.</p>



<p>Surveillance capitalism also fosters a power imbalance. The companies with the most data become the most powerful, creating monopolies and limiting competition. They can shape user experiences and behaviors through personalized content, reinforcing existing beliefs and preferences, and potentially manipulating user behavior.</p>



 The Future of Surveillance Capitalism 



<p>As the digital landscape evolves, so does surveillance capitalism. With the growth of the Internet of Things (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_city">IoT</a>), data collection extends beyond smartphones and laptops to smart speakers, wearable tech, and other connected devices. This means even more personal data is being captured, from our voices to our heart rates.</p>



<p>Addressing the challenges posed by surveillance capitalism requires a multi-faceted approach. Legal and regulatory measures, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, are one step in ensuring greater transparency and user control over data. More such regulations need to be instituted globally.</p>



<p>Technological solutions, such as privacy-enhancing technologies, can also play a role. These include end-to-end encryption, anonymization tools, and decentralized data architectures that limit data control by a single entity.</p>



<p>Finally, there needs to be a societal shift in understanding the value of privacy. Users need to be aware of their digital footprint and the implications of sharing personal data online.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Surveillance capitalism is an inherent aspect of our digital lives. While it has facilitated personalized experiences and connectivity, it has also paved the way for unprecedented levels of data commodification. As we navigate this digital age, striking a balance between the benefits of personalization and the preservation of privacy is crucial. To do so, we must foster an ecosystem of regulatory compliance, technological innovation, and informed digital citizenship.</p>

 Five miners onboard from&nbsp;launch <p>Zug, Switzerland, 24 May 2023 — Energy Web, an independent non-profit that develops open-source software for clean energy solutions, today announced the launch of<a href="http://www.gp4btc.org"> Green Proofs for Bitcoin</a> (GP4BTC), a<br>first-of-its kind initiative to establish an independent, standardized energy measurement system for the Bitcoin mining industry.</p><p>GP4BTC will provide transparency into the decarbonization efforts of Bitcoin miners and hosting companies, supporting the industry on its journey to net-zero. As part of the solution, certifications will be issued to Bitcoin miners based on their clean energy use and contributions to grid stability via demand response. By delivering verifiable metrics that are consistent across companies and geographies, GP4BTC will provide recognition and reputational benefit for companies mining sustainably, as well as improved access to institutional finance and other returns on their investments into sustainability practices.</p><blockquote>Speaking on the launch of the certification initiative, Amy Westervelt, Senior Delivery Lead and head of the GP4BTC initiative at Energy Web, said “Today Bitcoin is scrutinized for its electricity consumption and associated climate impact. While leading miners are pursuing strategies to reduce their carbon footprints, the industry lacks a unifying definition of sustainable mining, as well as a shared framework for assessing and verifying miners’ sustainability practices. Green Proofs for Bitcoin seeks to provide&nbsp;this.”</blockquote><p>Launched with five certified miners, the GP4BTC certification platform and registry assesses miners via a Clean Energy Score and a Grid Impact Score, each of which are calculated based on operational information<br>including location and energy consumption data. Together, these scores reflect miners’ procurement of renewable electricity, siting operations in regions with low grid carbon intensity, and their contributions to grid stability through demand flexibility. Developed in partnership with over 35 miners, NGOs, grid operators, and other energy and crypto market<br>participants, this approach to scoring is aligned with best practices for sustainability leadership in other industries, and to approaches to corporate ESG reporting in the financial sector and&nbsp;beyond.</p><blockquote>“Until now, efforts to standardize clean energy procurement practices and drive collective action across the Bitcoin mining sector have been siloed and inconsistent,” added Westervelt. “While other electricity-intensive<br>industries have benefited from custom decarbonization roadmaps, Bitcoin has largely been ignored, creating a negative feedback loop where climate-conscious miners are left to forge their own paths. Our goal is to create a virtuous cycle where clean mining is easier to define, pursue, and monetize — so that it eventually becomes the status&nbsp;quo.”</blockquote><p>For miners, GP4BTC offers a solution for miners to provide evidence of clean energy practices. Using Energy Web’s privacy-first Green Proofs technology, miners retain full ownership and control of their data. For<br>Bitcoin users and institutions, GP4BTC provides a one-stop-shop for discovering and validating miners’ sustainability credentials so they can make data-driven decisions regarding commercial strategy and policy.<br>At launch, certified miners and data centers include Argo Blockchain, Cowa, DMG Blockchain Solutions, Hive Blockchain Technologies, and Gryphon Digital&nbsp;Mining.</p><blockquote>DMG’s CEO, Sheldon Bennett, commented,“We are pleased to be included among the initial Green Proofs for Bitcoin miner participants. We believe Energy Web’s launch of Green Proofs for Bitcoin represents a real<br>first step towards recognizing a broad swath of industry participants for powering their data center equipment utilizing primarily carbon neutral energy sources.”</blockquote><blockquote>“This initiative will settle the basis for long term sustainability within the Bitcoin mining industry. We are proud to contribute to the growth of the ecosystem and to have the ability to certify our commitment towards sustainability,” said Fiorenzo Manganiello, co-founder of&nbsp;Cowa.</blockquote><blockquote>“Decarbonization represents one of the main priorities for the sector, and by providing standardized and verifiable metrics, as well as acknowledging best practices with certifications, initiatives such as Energy<br>Web’s Green Proofs for Bitcoin serve a fundamental role in driving industry standards. At Argo, sustainable mining has been at the core of our business model and growth strategy ever since our foundation. We are<br>proud of our GP4BTC certification, and we look forward to contributing to the impact and success of this exciting initiative.” said Seif El-Bakly, Interim CEO at Argo Blockchain.</blockquote><blockquote>President and CEO of Hive Blockchain Technologies Aydin Kilic commented, “In our commitment to be green energy focused — which has been our mandate since HIVE went public back in 2017 as the first<br>publicly traded crypto miner — we are glad to see the industry embracing this strategy, and advocates like Energy Web helping to validate and certify the renewable aspects of crypto miners. This makes our industry<br>stronger. We hope that the public, along with policy makers and utility companies, realize that a large contingent of crypto miners are utilizing renewable energy.”</blockquote><blockquote>Gryphon Digital Mining’s CEO, Rob Chang, urges the Bitcoin mining industry to start providing concrete evidence of sustainable mining practices. “We need to move past pandering press releases and start offering tangible, coordinated, third-party certifications that confirm clean energy use,” Chang emphasized. “We believe in GP4BTC’s mission and proudly announce that Gryphon is one of the first recipients of its<br>certification. As Bitcoin mining continues to grow, it is critical to prioritize sustainable practices and hold the industry accountable for its impact on the environment.”</blockquote><p>Energy Web is keen to work with any Bitcoin miner or other party interested in using Green Proofs for Bitcoin. Miners and data centers can learn more about the solution and apply for certification directly at <a href="http://gp4btc.org">www.GP4BTC.org</a> or by contacting gp4btc@energyweb.org.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

 Exploring the Future of Work and&nbsp;Learning Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Imagine a world where everyone has an equitable opportunity to showcase their skills and be recognised for them, regardless of whether or not they have a formal degree. A world where gatekeepers no longer control the keys, where learning and skills development are a natural part of life, and where recognition of these skills is open and transparent. This is the realm of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>, a realm we would describe as a ‘practical utopia’.</p><p>In this utopia, universities and other institutions still play a role, but they are no longer the sole arbiters of who is ‘skilled’ and who is not. They are nodes in a broad ecosystem of learning and recognition that includes employers, co-ops, communities, and self-directed learners. The power of recognition has been democratically distributed, with every individual having an active stake in&nbsp;it.</p><p>Learning, in this world, has been ‘rewilded’. It happens everywhere, all the time, fuelled by curiosity and the desire to improve rather than the mechanical necessity of earning a degree. Workplaces are transformed into vibrant learning hubs, with employees being recognised for the skills they develop on the job. Communities are engaged in recognising the skills and contributions of their members, fostering a culture of mutual support and lifelong learning.</p> The Limits of Microcredentialing <p>There’s been a <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2023/5/educause-and-wcet-quickpoll-results-current-trends-in-microcredential-design-and-delivery">huge growth in interest</a> around microcredentialing in the last few years as an approach offering distinct, focused qualifications. It’s great for ‘brands’. It’s certainly useful to start reimagining what’s possible, especially when coupled with national <a href="https://credentialasyougo.org/">incremental credentialing initiatives</a>. However, the trend aligns with the neoliberal view of education as another ‘marketplace’. Students, due to high fees and a need for job security, increasingly resemble customers. Those who can’t pay are crowded&nbsp;out.</p><p>Microcredentials are usually based upon a standard known as <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a>. The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">original dream</a> for this standard was to solve the problem that lifelong learning happens everywhere, and but isn’t always recognised. Microcredentials tend to solve a subset of this, on students getting a ‘return on investment’ for their tuition fees by securing decent employment upon graduation. Inevitably, this has led universities to form partnerships with employers and incorporate microcredentials into their educational offerings.</p><p>Helping people into employment is an important thing to do. Microcredentials are indeed integral elements of the emerging new learning ecosystem, providing a flexible means for individuals to demonstrate their competencies. But they are not the only pieces in play. In our practical utopia, recognition is diverse and multifaceted, taking various forms from community awards, peer recognition, to self-assessment and reflection.</p><p>What happens if, instead of dividing the boxes of credentials into ever-smaller boxes of microcredentials, we… get rid of most of the boxes altogether?</p>Image CC BY&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> Open Recognition is a Better&nbsp;Lens <p>Open Recognition offers an alternative that could potentially disrupt the educational status quo. It’s an approach that facilitates recognition of lifelong learning and development, extending opportunities beyond the confines of traditional education.</p><p>“Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.” (<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">definition</a>)</p><p>In recent years, our understanding of diversity has expanded significantly. We recognise and celebrate differences in ethnicity, neurodiversity, gender, as well as abilities and experiences. This broadened conception of diversity has enriched our communities and workplaces, leading to greater inclusivity and understanding. It’s high time we applied this expansive view of diversity to the recognition of learning and&nbsp;work.</p><p>We need to acknowledge the myriad ways in which people learn and the diverse skills they bring to their work. A person’s value should not be measured solely by their degrees or formal qualifications, but also by their unique abilities, experiences, and contributions. Open Recognition invites us to embrace this diversity, allowing everyone’s learning journey to be seen, appreciated, and valued. This is a key step towards a more equitable and inclusive society, where everyone has the opportunity to&nbsp;thrive.</p><p>When we apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrad_of_media_effects">McLuhan’s tetrads</a> to Open Recognition, we gain insightful perspectives into its potential societal and educational impacts. This approach looks at what is enhanced, retrieved, obsolesced, and reversed due to an innovation.</p>  Enhances: Open Recognition enhances the visibility and accessibility of skills and achievements. It amplifies the ability of individuals to showcase their talents and competences in a way that’s verifiable and portable across different platforms and communities.  Retrieves: Open Recognition retrieves the concept of peer-to-peer validation and communal acknowledgement of skills and achievements, similar to how guilds or apprenticeships operated in the past. It also revives the importance of informal and experiential learning, as these forms of learning can now be recognised and valued alongside formal education.  Obsolesces: Open Recognition could potentially render obsolete traditional, centralised systems of recognition and accreditation. For example, it might diminish the importance of formal degrees or certificates issued by educational institutions, as people can now receive recognition from various sources and in various&nbsp;forms.  Reverses: If pushed to its limits, Open Recognition might flip into a situation where traditional forms of accreditation are disregarded or devalued. If the recognition landscape becomes fragmented or chaotic, the value and reliability of recognition could be diluted. It might become more challenging to discern the validity and worth of various forms of recognition, and this would likely make it difficult to ensure that people have the necessary skills for particular job&nbsp;roles.  <p>The transition to Open Recognition carries profound implications for individuals and society. It eliminates barriers to entry for many jobs, fostering a more diverse and inclusive workforce. It encourages individuals to follow their passions and interests, rather than being herded into a narrow set of ‘approved’ careers. It acknowledges that learning is a lifelong endeavour, recognising that everyone has valuable skills and knowledge to contribute. While there are certainly some challenges that come with such a recognition utopia, the ultimate goal is a world in which people contribute to society in ways that are both meaningful and&nbsp;healthy.</p><p>It’s important to note that we are not against microcredentials. WAO hasn’t created the Keep Badges Weird community and evolved it into <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-everybody-time-for-a-bigger-tent-41dbdb4babbe?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------">Open Recognition is for Everybody</a> merely so that we can critique institutions. Our members are products of these institutions, with multiple degrees to prove it. We’ve worked with many institutions since our founding seven years ago, and we see value in alternative credentialing.</p><p>Instead, we are advocating for a society where institutions form just one part of a broader, more diverse ecosystem. We support the idea that young people should be able to access the workforce and secure decent jobs without being entirely dependent on traditional educational institutions. Not everybody has the same access to the institutions that shape our society, which is why society isn’t shaped in a way that benefits all of us. We need to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/practical-utopias-and-rewilding-work-27c148d95b16?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">rewild work</a> and learning to give more people the ability to participate in&nbsp;society.</p>Image CC BY&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> Conclusion <p>Open Recognition requires a substantial shift in mindset, a transition from viewing education as a commodity to be consumed, to understanding it as a process to be engaged with. It demands us to challenge the status quo, to question the authority of gatekeepers, and to establish new, open systems of recognition.</p><p>The rewards of this transition, however, are immense. A world where everyone’s skills and knowledge are recognised and valued is a world of greater equality, opportunity, and fulfilment. It’s a world where work and learning are inextricably intertwined, a world where we are all simultaneously teachers and learners, and a world where the journey of discovery is unending. This is the world we envisage with Open Recognition, and it’s a world worth striving&nbsp;for.</p><p>Why not join a community discussing these ideas?

 How Bitcoin Mining Can Apply Lessons From Other Industries to Promote Clean Energy and Align with a Net-Zero&nbsp;Future <p>In the early 2000’s a new digital system emerged that promised to revolutionize the way people interacted online. Though it started small, over the subsequent decade it was adopted by millions of people in nearly every country on Earth. As its popularity soared, so too did its value. But there was a hidden cost lurking beneath the surface: to enable its growth, it had to consume ever greater amounts of electricity. Between 2011 and 2021, its annual electricity consumption increased by 3500%. Today it consumes <a href="https://sustainability.fb.com/2021-sustainability-report/">over 9,400 GWh</a> each year — roughly the same amount as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption">small country like Costa&nbsp;Rica</a>.</p><p>Of course, this is the story of Facebook. But it’s also largely the story of Google (<a href="https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/google-2022-environmental-report.pdf">18,287 GWh</a> in 2021, on par with Iceland), and Amazon (<a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2021-sustainability-report.pdf">30,880 GWh in 2021</a>, on par with Serbia), and yes, Bitcoin. Fundamentally, all four do the same thing: convert electricity into bits of information. Indeed, whether it’s posts, search results, cloud services, or cryptocurrency, this is the core business model for the technology sector as a whole. Yet when it comes to energy use, Bitcoin attracts disproportionate scrutiny.</p><p>In recent months especially, the discourse surrounding Bitcoin’s energy consumption has reached a fever pitch, and mining has been singled out with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/05/02/cost-of-cryptomining-dame-tax/">punitive taxes</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html?searchResultPosition=1">hand-wringing analysis</a>, and even <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/07/new-york-cryptocurrency-mining-ban-00072564">outright regulatory bans</a>.</p><p>Why is there so much focus on the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining relative to that of mainstream technology firms?</p><p>The answer boils down to two factors: a philosophical argument over the social value of crypto, and a practical lack of transparency into the energy management practices of the mining sector. Too often the focus is on the former, but addressing the latter in a credible way is the key to overcoming the current hysteria.</p><p>Unfortunately the rancorous debate over the energy and climate impacts of Bitcoin is full of hyperbole and finger-pointing.</p><p>On the one hand are those who believe Bitcoin (and crypto more generally) has no social value, and therefore any and all electricity consumption is “bad” (even <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/podcasts/catalyst-with-shayle-kann/the-great-bitcoin-energy-debate">well-researched, nuanced analysis</a> seemingly reflects this implicit assumption). A less extreme but common view is that because some Bitcoin mining operations demonstrably consume fossil-derived electricity, Bitcoin mining as a whole is an illegitimate end-use; even some degree of consumption of clean energy is not enough to justify its existence.</p><p>On the other side are Bitcoin proponents, many of whom make <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/this-earth-day-analysts-say-bitcoin-mining-is-naturally-gravitating-to-green-energy">exaggerated or overly-simplistic claims about Bitcoin’s role as a clean energy solution</a>, or deflect legitimate questions by highlighting the energy intensity of other industries and the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-uses-56-times-less-energy-than-classical-system/">traditional financial system</a>.</p><p>Extending one’s worldview of crypto to either excoriate or glorify Bitcoin’s energy consumption is not productive. When it comes to real-world impact, attempts to shame or regulate Bitcoin out of existence are just as ineffective as defensive posturing and whataboutism. The reality is that Bitcoin <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci">does in fact consume a significant amount of electricity</a>, and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eager-to-work-bitcoin-switch-to-proof-of-stake-remains-unlikely">likely will for the foreseeable future</a>. Like any energy-intensive industry it has the potential to hinder or advance the clean energy transition, depending on where, when, and how it is&nbsp;mined.</p><p>Asking whether the carbon footprint of Bitcoin — or other industries — is justified is the wrong question. A better way forward is to ask how Bitcoin can follow the trajectory of other established industries to become an active partner in the energy transition. In other words: What are the concrete actions that Bitcoin miners can take to promote clean energy and decarbonization?</p><p>Over the last twenty years, <a href="https://rmi.org/the-power-of-agreement/">voluntary purchasing of clean energy by large corporate buyers was a catalyst that drove deployment and economies of scale for renewable electricity</a>. Lessons learned and best practices are now socialized through <a href="https://cebuyers.org/">established industry groups</a> that provide decarbonization playbooks, procurement tools, and sustainability reporting mechanisms; as a result, it’s easy for companies to demonstrate climate leadership even if they consume significant amounts of electricity.</p><p>Unfortunately, no such thing exists for the Bitcoin community. Because Bitcoin lacks a shared framework to measure and recognize sustainability commitments and practices by miners, mining companies are left to fend for themselves and the industry cannot respond to criticisms about its climate impacts in a meaningful, data-driven way. What’s needed is an initiative to standardize clean energy procurement practices and drive collective action across the Bitcoin mining sector. That’s why we started Green Proofs for Bitcoin (GP4BTC).</p><p>GP4BTC is a solution to bring consistent metrics and much-needed transparency into the climate impacts of Bitcoin mining so industry stakeholders can make better decisions to align with a net-zero future. The GP4BTC certification spotlights climate-conscious miners who contribute to grid decarbonization through purchasing renewable energy, strategically locating mining operations in low-carbon grids, and participating in demand flexibility programs. Developed in partnership with over 35 miners, NGOs, governments, grid operators, and other energy and crypto market participants, GP4BTC criteria align (and will evolve) with best practices for sustainability leadership in other industries.</p><p>By showcasing miners operating sustainably, we aim to create a virtuous cycle where clean mining is easier to define, pursue, and monetize. Ultimately, our goal is to make sustainable Bitcoin mining ubiquitous and to make the Bitcoin industry an active supporter of the clean energy transition.</p><p>The notion that continued growth and adoption of Bitcoin automatically spells climate disaster is popular but false. Climate-conscious miners with sophisticated energy management strategies exist. Decarbonizing Bitcoin doesn’t require bans, taxes, or Proof-of Stake. By rolling up our sleeves and committing to transparency, we can scale these strategies, make carbon-free mining the new normal, and truly make Bitcoin a leader in the energy transition.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/less-talk-more-action-a-productive-approach-to-decarbonizing-bitcoin-9f48aa9bf6b6">Less talk, more action: A productive approach to decarbonizing Bitcoin</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As we grapple with the global health crisis, several nations have implemented health passports, digital documents showing an individual’s health status. While they may seem like a practical solution to ensuring public health safety, these passports are not without concerns. In fact, they raise numerous ethical, legal, and privacy issues. Critics argue that such passports are inherently sinister, contributing to surveillance states and perpetuating inequality. An alternative solution, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), could address these concerns, providing a more democratic, secure, and efficient system for verifying individuals’ health status.</p>



<p>Firstly, it’s crucial to delve into the darker side of government-issued health passports. Their design inherently grants governments unprecedented access to personal health information. The collected data could be used for purposes beyond pandemic control, making them a potent tool for surveillance. In an era where privacy is becoming increasingly scarce, the question arises – should we further enable governments with such profound access to personal information?</p>



<p>Moreover, these health passports can exacerbate social inequalities. Access to vaccines or tests is not universally equal; many communities, especially in developing countries, lack these resources. Hence, a health passport system could perpetuate global inequality, creating a world divided into health ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’.</p>



<p>This inequality is also significant within nations. Marginalized communities often have reduced access to healthcare and, consequently, could face limitations in obtaining these health passports. It potentially bars them from engaging fully in society, further entrenching systemic inequities.</p>







<p>These inherent issues within health passports call for an alternative solution, and SSI can be the answer. SSI, or Self-Sovereign Identity, provides individuals with control over their personal data. It offers a digital identity that the person owns and controls, rather than a <a href="https://liberal.ca/our-platform/proof-of-vaccination/">third-party entity</a> or government.</p>



<p>With SSI, a person can prove their health status without revealing more information than necessary. For example, instead of showing a detailed health passport with sensitive health information, a person could provide a verifiable claim like, “I am vaccinated,” or “I have tested negative.” The underlying health data remains private, reducing the risks of misuse or surveillance.</p>



<p>Furthermore, SSI is a more inclusive solution. By decentralizing identity management, it can empower marginalized communities who often lack official documents or are distrustful of government systems. It offers an identity system that respects privacy and autonomy, reducing the risk of systemic bias and discrimination.</p>



<p>On the technical front, SSI is built upon blockchain technology, providing a secure, tamper-proof system for verifying identities and claims. This technological backbone ensures that SSI can be trusted, even in the absence of centralized authority.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while government-issued health passports might seem like an appealing solution for managing public health during crises, they can contribute to surveillance states and perpetuate inequality. We must consider these sinister aspects before embracing such a system. Instead, alternatives like SSI provide a more secure, democratic, and inclusive solution. SSI puts personal data back in the hands of individuals and offers a nuanced and privacy-preserving way to prove health status. As we navigate these complex issues, it is clear that we need solutions that prioritize both public health and personal freedoms. Self-Sovereign Identity is a promising step in that direction.</p>

 New toolkit provides the underlying digital infrastructure for Australia’s Project EDGE and enables utilities, aggregators, and digital solution providers to harness the full potential of distributed energy resources <p>Zug, Switzerland, 18 May 2023 — Energy Web, an independent non-profit that develops open-source software to accelerate the global energy transition, today open sourced the <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/solutions-2023/data-exchange/use-cases-and-reference-implementations/digital-spine-for-electricity-markets">Energy Web Digital Spine toolkit</a>, the software powering Australia’s Project EDGE distributed energy resource (DER) marketplace.</p><p>This toolkit was developed to help electric utilities and DER aggregators configure and deploy Digital Spines — digital infrastructure that makes it secure, efficient, and simple for distributed energy resources to be fully integrated into local and regional electricity markets — on electric grids around the world. As described by the <a href="https://es.catapult.org.uk/news/energy-digitalisation-taskforce-publishes-recommendations-for-a-digitalised-net-zero-energy-system/">United Kingdoms’ Energy Digitalization Taskforce recent report on digitizing the grid</a>, Digital Spines have been identified as a powerful tool to “Facilitate efficient system operation, improve access to new markets, and support development of new services for a smart and flexible energy&nbsp;system.”</p><p>Over the past year the Digital Spine toolkit has been operating in a production environment to support <a href="https://aemo.com.au/en/initiatives/major-programs/nem-distributed-energy-resources-der-program/der-demonstrations/project-edge">Project EDGE</a>, an initiative focused on demonstrating the value that DERs can deliver to both wholesale energy markets and distribution networks. The Digital Spine powering Project EDGE enables DERs, via aggregators, to sell services (such as capacity and voltage support) to distribution utilities while simultaneously participating in the wholesale energy market. Bids and offers between DERs and utilities are constrained by <a href="https://utilityanalytics.com/2021/11/dynamic-operating-envelopes-can-enable-ders-in-wholesale-market-without-endangering-grid-reliability/">operating envelopes</a> — 5 minute voltage, frequency, and power limits DERs must follow to connect to and interact with the&nbsp;grid.</p><p>The Digital Spine toolkit currently offers <a href="https://github.com/energywebfoundation/ddhub-client-gateway">a self-hosted integration gateway</a> as well as cloud-based integration for electric utilities and DER aggregators on <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-US/marketplace/apps/energywebdevhubgmbh1670375546257.ewf-data-exchange-client-gateway?ocid=GTMRewards_WhatsNewBlog_ewf-data-exchange-client-gateway_032323">Microsoft’s Azure marketplace</a>, and is compatible with a variety of communications protocols including IEEE 2030.5 utility server implementations. Energy Web plans to integrate the Digital Spine toolkit with more cloud marketplaces and release additional configurations to enable secure gateway devices and/or individual DERs, such as smart inverters, to directly integrate with Digital Spines. The Digital Spine toolkit is also designed to help electric utilities construct and launch new solutions focused on digital twinning of distribution networks, advanced distribution planning, demand forecasting, and optimizing DER dispatch.</p><blockquote>“If we want to decarbonize the grid, we have to grow a Digital Spine,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web. “Utilities today simply do not have the tools needed to fully harness grid flexibility from DERs — flexibility that grid operators will need in order to accommodate more electric load, more solar, and more wind. Digital Spines give utilities that capability.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Open source Digital Spines will make it easier for innovative companies to deploy advanced applications on top, “ said Audrey Zibelman, former CEO of AEMO and long-time advocate for the value DERs can bring to the grid. “If we can get companies who deliver DER optimization, forecasting, and other digital solutions to utilities around the world to embrace a consistent, open source template for Digital Spines, it will go a long way towards accelerating digitization — and by extension decarbonization — of the&nbsp;grid.”</blockquote><p>The Digital Spine toolkit has five key components:</p>  A data and message exchange module that enables grid operators to configure and deploy a centralized transport layer in order for market participants to securely exchange messages and datasets (ranging from real-time telemetry to bulk file uploads).

<p>In this episode, we brought on two guests: Kevin Capatch, the Director of Process Engineering for Geisinger, which is a regional health provider out of Pennsylvania that services roughly 3 million people across 45 different counties in Pennsylvania, and Vicky Lyle, she's the Vice President of Industry Relations for Owens and Minor. They both discuss medical recalls, the current process, and where we are going in the future.&nbsp;</p> <p>Today, we're making great strides into automation for these recalls, but we still have a lot more to do and we need everyone involved. Please join us as Kevin and Vicky dive into the challenges the healthcare industry faces in managing recalls for medical devices and how automation and data standards like Unique Device Identification (UDI) can address these issues.&nbsp;</p> <p>Key takeaways:</p>     <p>The Internet is a powerful tool for collaboration and problem-solving, with significant untapped potential. There is a clear affinity for the Internet, citing its ability to connect people from different backgrounds and enable collaborative problem-solving. We are only starting to scratch the surface of what is possible with this technology, but there is still much to be discovered and leveraged in the years to come.</p>     <p>Automation and UDI hold promise for improved recall management. Despite the challenges of recall management in healthcare, there are several promising advancements in the field. Automation has increased in recent years, improving efficiency in the recall management process. The implementation of UDIs (Unique Device Identifiers) has likewise shown promise, as they can help to quickly locate products during a recall and provide more specific information beyond a catalog number.</p>     <p>Enriching medical records with specific product information can lead to more detailed analytics. There are a variety of potential benefits of enriching medical records with specific product information, such as catalog numbers and lot numbers. This data can provide medical professionals with more detailed analytics on patient outcomes and device performance, leading to better research opportunities and ultimately, better patient care.</p>     <p> </p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1 US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guests:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-capatch-0b44b47/">Follow Kevin Capatch on LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vicky-lyle-60bb673/">Follow Vicky&nbsp;Lyle on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">John Perry Barlow</a> was a man of many titles—a lyricist, poet, essayist, cyberactivist, and, most importantly, a pioneering advocate for digital rights and freedom. His contributions to the realms of online privacy and open source have laid the groundwork for much of today’s Internet landscape. His vision of the Internet as a sphere of liberty, unbounded by the restrictions of the physical world, has shaped the discourse around digital rights and freedoms in ways that resonate even today.</p>



<p>Born on October 3, 1947, in Sublette County, Wyoming, Barlow’s early life was rooted in rural conservatism, a stark contrast to his later cyberlibertarian ideals. From writing lyrics for the Grateful Dead to co-founding the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Barlow’s eclectic life path has consistently underscored a deep commitment to freedom—in music, in speech, and in the digital realm.</p>



<p>In the early 1990s, as the Internet began to permeate everyday life, Barlow recognized its transformative potential—and the potential dangers. His first significant move into digital rights advocacy was his co-founding of the EFF in 1990 with digital rights activists Mitch Kapor and John Gilmore. The EFF was born out of a recognition that the burgeoning digital realm was ripe for abuse—by both governments and corporations. Barlow’s vision for the EFF was to ensure that the Internet remained a space for freedom of expression and privacy, fundamental rights he believed should extend to the digital world.</p>



<p>One of Barlow’s most noteworthy contributions is his 1996 manifesto, “<a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a>,” which became a seminal text in cyberlibertarian thought. In it, Barlow argued for the Internet as an inherently free space, unregulated by the governments of the physical world. He wrote, “We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.”</p>



<p>Barlow’s advocacy for online privacy was deeply intertwined with his support for open source. He believed that the tools of the digital realm should be accessible to all, not locked away behind proprietary barriers. Barlow saw open-source software as a democratizing force, allowing users to understand, modify, and control the technology they use, thereby enhancing both their privacy and their freedom.</p>

<p>Through the EFF, Barlow contributed to major court cases that set the precedent for digital rights. He fought against restrictive legislation like the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which sought to impose stringent censorship regulations on the Internet. His belief in the power of open-source software led him to support the development of cryptographic tools like Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), which provides users with the means to protect their digital communications from unwanted surveillance.</p>



<p>Barlow’s untimely passing in 2018 did not halt the impact of his life’s work. His concepts of online freedom and privacy continue to underpin debates on digital rights and shape the evolving landscape of the Internet. His recognition of the Internet as a new frontier of human interaction, requiring unique norms and protections, remains as pertinent today as it was three decades ago.</p>



<p>Despite criticisms and challenges, Barlow’s steadfast belief in the emancipatory potential of the Internet continues to inspire new generations of digital rights activists. His dedication to online privacy and open source is a testament to his vision of the Internet as a realm of freedom, where creativity and innovation can flourish unhindered.</p>



<p>In conclusion, John Perry Barlow’s legacy lies in his profound contribution to the discourse on online privacy and the open-source movement. His tireless efforts and unwavering commitment to digital freedom have etched his name into the annals</p>



<p>In conclusion, John Perry Barlow’s legacy lies in his profound contribution to the discourse on online privacy and the open-source movement. His tireless efforts and unwavering commitment to digital freedom have etched his name into the annals of cyberlibertarianism. His vision, outlined in foundational texts and legal battles, has helped shape the Internet as a domain of free expression, privacy, and community participation. </p>



<p>As we navigate the digital frontier, Barlow’s principles remain our guiding compass, reminding us that the Internet should be a space of liberty, creativity, and open collaboration. His foresight and advocacy continue to challenge us, urging us to uphold and expand digital rights and freedoms for all Internet users. Barlow’s life and work embody a powerful message: that the digital realm is a new frontier of human potential, and it is our collective responsibility to ensure it remains open, free, and respectful of our privacy.</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>Trust is a fundamental component of human relationships. There are many ways to define trust, often depending on whether the relationship is personal or professional. One definition which resonates with me comes from leading expert on trust in the modern world, Rachel Botsman, who said ‘trust is a confident relationship with the unknown’. It means trust is key to giving people the confidence to try new things, from new technology to systems and processes. Earning trust is continuous, not a one-time thing.</p>



<p><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final-1.pdf">Recent DINZ research</a>&nbsp;reveals that New Zealanders are nervous about digital ID and feel they do not have sufficient understanding of these services to truly assess the impact on their privacy, legal rights and freedoms. It’s within this trust gap that digital ID service providers and legislators may find an opportunity to build trust into digital systems, which would then bridge the gap that enables people to move into the unknown with confidence.</p>



<p>Ethics and inclusion are the foundations of building that trust bridge in a digital environment, as they can create a virtuous cycle in which user trust leads to increased adoption and usage. These two principles should be at the heart of all phases of digital ID development, including governance and accountability frameworks, design, and implementation. Ethical considerations like privacy, security and informed consent can enable the creation of transparent and accountable systems that respect the rights of all users and build trust. Inclusion ensures that these services are accessible to all regardless of their background, abilities or circumstances.</p>



<p>In my capacity as&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">DINZ Executive Councillor</a>&nbsp;and Co-Chair of its&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/inclusive-and-ethical-uses-of-digital-identity/">Inclusive and Ethical Use of Digital Identity (IEUDI) working group</a>&nbsp;I’d like to encourage those interested in our work to join and participate. We’re currently exploring strategies to shine the light on ethics and inclusion and ensure they are a key consideration of any digital identity legislation.</p>

   📢 Announcements at DIF  
<p>IIW XXXVI<br>
DIF members and friends gathered at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California  for the 36th Internet Identity Workshop. IIW attracts an international audience and has a history of incubating important identity standards including OAuth and OpenID Connect. In the words of event co-founder and DIF Steering Committee member Kaliya Young, “The event continues to be the biggest tent for collaboration and ideation across the various user-centric identity spheres and communities. The open culture of DIF and its commitment to integrations with today’s identity technologies thrive in this environment, and many key DIF collaborations have begun or successfully recruited new participants at IIW.”</p>
<p>Our new Executive Director, Clare Nelson, provided an update on the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF):</p>
<p></p>
<p>Limari Navarrete, DIF’s Senior Director of Community Engagement and Stephen Curran from the British Columbia Government’s Digital Trust Team gave a presentation on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) 101:</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIF members and friends of DIF led sessions including:</p>
 
 ABC’s of Writing DIDs with Universal Registrar (and how it’s different from Universal Resolver) (Ankur Banerjee of cheqd and Markus Sabadello of Danube Tech): 
 
<p></p>
 
 Advanced Topics in DID Resolution (Ankur Banerjee and Markus Sabadello) 
 Interoperable Trust Registries with DID-Linked Resources (DRLs) (Alex Tweeddale of cheqd and Andor Kesselman of Benri.io) 
 30 days from Web5: A preview of the stack and Developer Preview release next month (Daniel Buchner and Gabe Cohen of TBD) 
 Using HUMOR (ha ha ha) and Visual Communication To Gain TRUST (Chance McGee and Zack Jones from Trinsic). 
 
<p>Notes from these and other proceedings will be published on the IIW website shortly. In the meantime here's a few post-event reflections from DIF members:</p>
<p>“I saw three major themes: Trust Registries/Trust Establishment, AI (and how decentralized identity may help us sort things out) and Government (many representatives in attendance and leading sessions)” Mike Ebert</p>
<p>“Some of the topics I found most interesting: SD-JWT - not necessarily related to any work item, but was a great topic and super informative session. Advanced Topics in DID Resolution - might want to reach out to Markus / Ankur for a synopsis, but as you might guess it covered some aspects of DID Resolution other than simply getting a DID Document (e.g. querying the historic state of a DID). Fun with DIDComm Protocols - I led this session where we brainstormed what some fun DIDComm protocols could look like. I hope to discuss this in one of the upcoming DIDComm User Group calls, but some of my favorite ideas were: Transform - a protocol for transforming DIDComm messages (e.g. from one language to another, or from text to audio); Shout - a lightweight social feed based on DIDComm; Chess - we're gonna make Chess over DIDComm happen!” Nick Reynolds</p>
<p>At this IIW we were fortunate to be joined by Chance McGee who brought a unique look at humor, visual representation and storytelling to the SSI space:</p>

<p>DIF recently announced the formation of the new DIF Korea Special Interest Group (SIG).</p><p>We invited group Chair Park Kyoung-Chul, CEO of K4-Security.inc, to share some insights into the decentralized identity landscape in South Korea, and the purpose for forming the DIF Korea SIG. </p><p>How advanced is the adoption of Decentralized Identity in South Korea?</p><p>Blockchain and blockchain applications in Korea have been continuously underway since 2018, and PoCs for 5 to 8 blockchain applications (including decentralized identity) are in progress every year through KISA under the Ministry of Science and ICT. &nbsp;However, we are still at the proof of concept of decentralized identity, and national standards for decentralized identity for specific applications (e.g. driver's license) are being made.</p><p>Does the government support decentralized identity in South Korea?</p><p>In Korea, technical verification and small-scale business verification of decentralized identity are continuously progressing. However, there is a lack of standardized technology application, and we are in the process of preparing a government-level control tower. The Yoon Seok-yeol government has announced and is carrying out a national task called "Digital Platform Government". The core technical issues are materializing in the direction of a decentralized identity ecosystem, and additional research funds and related business funds plans are being established.</p><p>What do you want to achieve through the Korea SIG?</p><p>We understand that DIF creates specifications, profiles, and reference implementations which are incorporated into standards at standards development organizations including the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p><p>Domestic research on decentralized identity will be discussed at Korea SIG, and technical standardization will be carried out through the Korean standardization organization TTA (Telecommunications Technology Association) and DIF.</p><p>In addition, DIF's technical standards are consulted with NIA, KISA, and BOK through Korea SIG so that they can be applied to the establishment of a Korean-style decentralized identity ecosystem, and ultimately loaded into NIA's e-government standard framework, so we want to contribute to expanding the business to supply e-government standard framework to underdeveloped countries through the UN.</p><p>What types of organizations are you looking forward to participating in the Korea SIG?</p><p>We are trying to involve all the institutions (universities, research institutes, enterprises, and government departments/regulatory institutions) included in the 5-year blockchain project of the Ministry of Science and ICT.</p><p>In particular, efforts will be made to involve the National Information Society Agency (NIA), Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency (KISA), Bank of Korea (BOK), and Korea Minting &amp; Security Printing Corporation (KOMSCO). NIA is carrying out "Digital Platform Government" project, "e-government standard framework" and "u-City" project, KISA is promoting "MyData" project, BOK is in charge of Korea CBDC, and KOMSCO is in charge of Digital Identity project.</p><p>In addition, ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunication Research Institute), &nbsp;which researches decentralized identity together, will participate as a research institute to verify decentralized identity technology.</p>

<p>We are proud to announce the launch of the <a href="https://findy.fi/en/findynet-test-network/">Findynet Test Network</a> – the first milestone in our roadmap to build a national trust network of verified data. Digital credentials are the cornerstone of future trust-based business, and the Findynet Test Network is the perfect place to explore and familiarise yourself with their potential future business opportunities.</p>
 
 An excellent development platform for digital wallets and proofs 
<p>The newly announced Test Network provides a flexible and secure platform for the development and testing of digital wallet use cases. Digital wallet service providers can use it not only to develop wallet implementations, but also to test the interoperability of different wallets without the efffort and time of setting up and maintaining a trust registry.</p>
 Focus on simplicity, security and scalability of technologies and services 
<p>The Findynet Test Network is based on open source Hyperledger Indy technology, which supports the issuance, management, sharing and verification of digital credentials. The use of the test network, maintained by Findynet, is facilitated by a web-based wallet management portal. To ensure performance and fault tolerance, the Test Network operates in a Microsoft Azure environment, providing a secure and reliable cloud service.</p>
 Welcome to the pioneer ecosystem! 
<p>Your organisation does not need to be a member of the Findynet Cooperative to use the Test Network. Instead, we welcome users from other organisations, even outside the cooperative, to join the Test Network. Joining the Findynet Test Network offers a unique opportunity to develop, test and productise new services using digital wallets as part of a pioneering ecosystem.</p>
<p>Learn more about the service here or contact our team directly (info@findy.fi) and we will take you on a fast-paced journey into the world of digital wallets!</p>

<p>There was never a question that it would take years to transition the world away from passwords. The digital authentication technology, though deeply flawed, is pervasive and inveterate. Over the last five years, though, the secure-authentication industry association known as the FIDO Alliance has been making real progress promoting “passkeys,” a password-less alternative for signing into applications and websites.</p>

<p>Safety and security have long been at the heart of&nbsp;identity and access management, and indeed the trends report states that “indications are that there will be a renewed focus on access control, entitlements, and permissioning over the next few years.” In keeping with the trend of the death of passwords equaling better authentication, the Identiverse report also celebrates the deployment of&nbsp;passkeys, the Apple-Google-Microsoft system that lets you log into websites with a smartphone instead of a password. We ourselves have had some trouble using passkeys — and the report hints at “the successes and learnings of early deployments” — but there’s no denying that passkeys will be a major step toward a&nbsp;passwordless future.</p>

<p>About 57 percent of US consumers expressed interest in using passkeys to replace passwords, according to new survey data from the FIDO Alliance. According to FIDO Executive Director and CMO Andrew Shikiar, that points to rapidly growing excitement, given that only 39 percent of survey respondents said they were familiar with the passkey concept in a FIDO survey released last October. Passkeys essentially store complex passcodes for a user’s various online accounts on their mobile device, locking them behind a PIN or biometric scan. Google recently launched passkey support for its own Account login process, garnering considerable media attention in the process.</p>

<p>Passkeys are intended to be more secure and easier to use than passwords. Instead of typing in a password (or letting a password manager do it) and verifying with a multi-factor authentication method, passkeys only require a trusted device and either biometric or PIN verification. Part of why passkeys seem likely to replace passwords is that they’re designed by a consortium called the FIDO Alliance and championed by Apple, Google, and Microsoft. These three companies have already baked support for passkeys into their browsers and ecosystems, which means that for the first time, there’s a viable alternative to passwords. That said, passkeys have yet to see widespread adoption.</p>

 WAO expertise and focus now and into the&nbsp;future <p>On May 1st, 2023 We Are Open Cooperative turned seven years old. Like no seven year old ever, we used our birthday to reflect on who we are, what we want, where we’re going and all the other existential questions that a collective of ethical thinkers and makers might&nbsp;expect.</p><p>In our conversation, we realised that we often explain what we do in opposition to something else.</p>  Cooperative, worker-owned democracies in opposition to capitalist, shareholder-driven oligarchies.  Sustainability in opposition to grind&nbsp;culture.  Recognition in opposition to credentialing.  Community engagement in opposition to consumer marketing.  Climate consciousness in opposition to consumption and value signalling.  <p>We don’t want to set ourselves in opposition all the time, but would rather define ourselves by our own terms. We have thus identified some areas of focus for We Are Open. These areas both explain our expertise and our vision for the&nbsp;world.</p> Sustainable work <p>One of the areas we believe it’s important to advocate for has to do with the future of work. Whether it’s helping organisations like the <a href="https://weall.org/">Wellbeing Economy Alliance</a> integrate community well-being into their digital strategy or advising <a href="https://localgovdrupal.org/">LocalGov Drupal</a> on the governance and form of a new entity, WAO works to ensure that organisational growth is paired with healthy cultural initiatives and ecologically conscious advice. We know that a healthy culture surrounding an organisation or community is absolutely essential to having impact, and we work with ethical organisations that care about the kind of impact they&nbsp;have.</p><p>What do we mean by sustainable work?</p>  Our work practices promote environmental, social, and economic sustainability  We pay attention to the resources we use and we promote fair labour practices.  We aim to balance the needs of collaborators, organisations we work with, and the environment to create long-term viability and well-being.  <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/org-strategy/">Learn how to create a sustainable organisational strategy that takes culture into&nbsp;account.</a></p> Open Recognition <p>WAO is well-known for our work around Open Recognition, partially in thanks to a lovely and productive partnership with <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>. Did you know that we believe in recognising others even without badges? We build recognition into all our work because we know that recognising the talents, skills and behaviours of others helps people feel motivated, appreciated and supported. What a better world we’d live in if positive, constructive feedback were a normal part of&nbsp;society.</p><p>What do we mean by Open Recognition?</p>  We recognise the skills, knowledge, talents, behaviours and competencies of our collaborators and networks through transparent and accessible means.  We challenge traditional forms of recognition to promote inclusivity and&nbsp;equity.  We use digital technologies and verifiable credentials such as Open Badges, with the goal of empowering individuals and promoting lifelong learning.  <p><a href="https://badges.community">Join the global conversation around Open Recognition.</a></p> Open Working <p>Working openly underpins so much of what we believe in. The clue’s in the name of our co-op! We believe in the five principles of open organisations — transparency, community, adaptability, inclusivity and collaboration. We have always worked to spread the benefits and culture of openness, and we offer everything from introductory to the most in-depth, contextual advice on this topic. Open working has given each of us the ability and opportunity to ‘jump over our own shadows’ and help others jump over&nbsp;theirs.</p><p>What do we mean by Open&nbsp;Working?</p>  We use collaborative approaches to working that involve sharing openly-licensed knowledge, resources, and results to create&nbsp;impact.  We use and recommend Open Source software and transparency in development processes to promote collaboration and innovation.  We prioritise communication, transparency, and collaboration between coworkers and between levels of management.  <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/open-course/">What we talk about when we talk about&nbsp;open.</a></p> Climate Action <p>We see ourselves as part of nature not the rulers of it and acknowledge that there is a climate emergency. We are conscious of the lost lessons and spirit of the indigenous and strive for climate justice, both individually and through the work that we do. We take steps to reduce our own and other human beings’ impact on the planet. We prioritise climate focused organisations and campaigns whenever possible because our service to our planet has been historically, well, a disservice.</p><p>What do we mean by climate&nbsp;action?</p>  We support organisations making efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change&nbsp;impacts.  We work to ensure that climate action groups are working in ways that promote diversity and inclusion, and we are committed to working together for the greater&nbsp;good.  We find creative ways to address the climate crisis using the skills and talents that are part of our&nbsp;DNA.  <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/">Listen to the Tao of WAO for more on how climate action underpins our&nbsp;work.</a></p> Worker Ownership <p>We promote democratic workplaces, values and behaviours to empower people and support a collective movement to change the status quo. In our seventh year, we remain enthusiastic and confident that worker-owned cooperatives and the co-op economy can have a positive impact on all of our lives. Working together towards a better future was always on our&nbsp;mind.</p><p>What do we mean by worker ownership?</p>  We’re a cooperative, and our members have ownership and agency in terms of the current running and future direction WAO.  We promote democratic decision-making and empower people to have a greater say in the direction of their organisation.  We adhere to <a href="https://ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles">the seven principles</a> set forth by the International Cooperative Alliance which list everything from cooperation among co-ops to concern for community  <p><a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Cooperative</a></p> It’s all about the&nbsp;overlaps <p>We work in these five areas with thoughtful, ethical organisations and partnerships that help us clear a space in the forest of modern noise. The most interesting work for us happens in the overlaps. While we do projects focused in one area, we are always keen to bring our values and understandings of other areas to the foreground.</p><p>While we are happy to work on climate campaigns, we will likely recommend working on them openly with the communities those campaigns will impact. While we’re happy to advise leadership on sustainable work practices, we’re even happier to start recognising people in the organisation for their contributions!</p><p>Does this sound like a good fit for you and your work?

<p>Maybe history will defeat itself.</p>
<p>Remember FreePC? It was a thing, briefly, at the end of the last millennium, right before Y2K pooped the biggest excuse for a party in a thousand years. <a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/02/a-free-pc-gimme/">This may help</a>. The idea was to put ads in the corner of your PC’s screen. The market gave it zero stars, and it failed.</p>
<p>And now comes <a href="https://www.freetelly.com/">Telly</a>, hawking free TVs with ads in a corner, and a promise to “optimize your ad experience.” As if anybody wants an ad experience other than no advertising at all.</p>
<p>Negative demand for advertising has been well advertised by both ad blocking (<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the biggest boycott in human history</a>) and ad-free&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5tObaoAimbLiA7vtj3f7RS">“prestige” TV</a>, (or SVOD, for subscription video on demand). With those we gladly pay—a lot— not to see advertising. (See numbers <a href="https://www.kantar.com/inspiration/technology/us-streaming-market-growth-continues-despite-changes-in-the-industry">here</a>.)</p>
<p>But the advertising business (in the mines of which I toiled for too much of my adult life) has always smoked its own exhaust and excels best at getting high with generous funders. (Yeah, some advertising works, but on the whole people still hate it on the receiving end.)</p>
<p>The fun will come when our own personal AI bots, working for our own asses, do battle with the robot Nazgûls of marketing — and win, because we’re on the Demand side of the marketplace, and we’ll do a better job of knowing what we want and don’t want to buy than marketing’s surveillant AI robots can guess at. Supply will survive, of course. But markets will defeat marketing by taking out the middle creep.</p>
<p>The end state will be one <a href="http://cluetrain.com">Cluetrain</a> forecast in 1999,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/intention-economy">Linux Journal named in 2006</a>, the VRM community started <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work">working on</a> that same year, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge-ebook/dp/B007UPDH5S">The Intention Economy</a> detailed in 2012. The only thing all of them missed was how customer intentions might be helped by personal AI.</p>
<p>Personal. Not personalized.</p>
<p>Markets will become new and better dances between Demand and Supply, simply because Demand will have better ways to take the lead, and not just follow all the time. Simple as that.</p>

 A Brief History of zk-SNARKs 



 zk-SNARKs, an acronym for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, are a form of cryptographic proof that allows one party to prove to another that they know the value of a specific piece of information, without revealing the information itself or requiring any interaction between the prover and the verifier.

 A Brief History of zk-SNARKs 



<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zk-snarks-practical-applications/">zk-SNARKs</a>, an acronym for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, are a form of cryptographic proof that allows one party to prove to another that they know the value of a specific piece of information, without revealing the information itself or requiring any interaction between the prover and the verifier.</p>



<p>The roots of zk-SNARKs can be traced back to the early 1980s when the concept of zero-knowledge proofs was first introduced by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff. This revolutionary concept proposed the idea of proving knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself.</p>



<p>In the ensuing years, researchers worked to improve the efficiency and practicality of zero-knowledge proofs, leading to the development of non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs in the 1990s, a variant which did not require back-and-forth communication between the prover and the verifier.</p>



<p>The term “zk-SNARKs” itself was introduced in a 2012 paper by Nir Bitansky, Ran Canetti, Alessandro Chiesa, and Eran Tromer. This marked a major milestone in the development of practical zero-knowledge proofs, making them significantly more efficient and thus more suitable for use in <a href="https://lionsgate.io/main/">real-world applications</a>.</p>



 zk-SNARKs and Cryptocurrencies 



<p>The introduction of zk-SNARKs has had a profound impact on the world of cryptocurrencies. The most notable implementation of zk-SNARKs in cryptocurrency is in Zcash, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that was launched in 2016.</p>



<p>Zcash uses zk-SNARKs to provide enhanced privacy to its users. With zk-SNARKs, Zcash transactions can remain fully encrypted while still being verified as valid under the network’s consensus rules. This is a significant departure from Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies, where transaction details are transparent and visible to all network participants.</p>



<p>In addition to Zcash, several other cryptocurrencies have integrated zk-SNARKs into their protocol to improve privacy, efficiency, and scalability. Ethereum, for instance, has incorporated zk-SNARKs into its protocol to enhance transaction privacy and improve scalability. zk-SNARKs are used in Ethereum’s Layer 2 scaling solutions, like zk-Rollups, which bundle multiple transactions into a single proof that can be verified quickly.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Horizen (formerly known as ZenCash) also uses zk-SNARKs to enable private transactions. Similarly, Coda Protocol (now Mina Protocol), uses zk-SNARKs to keep the blockchain size constant, ensuring high scalability.</p>



<p>While it’s difficult to give an exact number of cryptocurrencies using zk-SNARKs, as of 2023, it’s estimated that dozens of projects use some form of zero-knowledge proofs, with many specifically choosing zk-SNARKs due to their efficiency and non-interactivity.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>zk-SNARKs represent a powerful tool in the realm of digital privacy and have already seen significant adoption within the cryptocurrency sector. As privacy and scalability continue to be pressing issues in the blockchain space, it’s likely that zk-SNARKs and related technologies will only grow in importance. Despite the technical complexity, the promise of efficient, non-interactive proofs of knowledge that maintain user privacy is a compelling proposition for many in the digital world.</p>

<p>In today’s interconnected world, the concept of digital identity is becoming increasingly significant. One revolutionary approach that is gaining traction is Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs), a cornerstone of decentralised identity technology. In this context, we’re going to focus on one key aspect of DIDs – DID Delegation.</p>
 What are Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)? 
<p>To understand DID Delegation, we first need to grasp the concept of DIDs. DIDs are globally unique identifiers that are created, read, updated, and deactivated by their owner without requiring a central registry or authority. They are typically associated with a set of cryptographic keys, allowing the owner to prove control over the DID.</p>
 What is DID Delegation? 
<p>DID Delegation is a concept that allows the owner of a DID to delegate certain rights or capabilities to another entity. This delegation is done in a cryptographically secure and verifiable manner. It’s like handing over a digital power of attorney, where the delegator assigns some of their authority to another party, known as the delegatee. In the W3C DID Core Specification DID Delegation is described as:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <code>capabilityDelegation</code> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verification-relationship">verification relationship</a> is used to specify a mechanism that might be used by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects">DID subject</a> to delegate a cryptographic capability to another party, such as delegating the authority to access a specific HTTP API to a subordinate.</p></blockquote>
 Why is DID Delegation Important? 
<p>DID Delegation is crucial for several reasons:</p>
 
 Flexibility: Delegation allows DID owners to flexibly manage their digital identities. They can delegate specific tasks to other parties without giving up total control. 
 Scalability: DID owners can delegate responsibilities to multiple parties, making it easier to manage larger systems and networks. 
 Security: Delegation maintains security by ensuring only authorised parties can perform specific tasks. The delegator can also revoke access if necessary, maintaining control over their digital identity. 
 Privacy: DID Delegation can help enhance privacy by enabling the delegator to limit the information shared with the delegatee to only what is necessary to perform the delegated task. 
 
 How Does DID Delegation Work? 
<p>DID Delegation for did:oyd involves a few key steps and are described below using the <a href="https://github.com/OwnYourData/oydid/tree/main/cli">command line utility <code>oydid</code></a>:</p>
 
 Creating a Delegation Record: The delegatee creates a delegation proof using their private key and publishes it in the DID Log. This entry in the log record includes the public key and explicitly states the rights or capabilities to be delegated.
 oydid delegate --doc-enc z6M... did:oyd:zQm... 
<p>Note: the response of the command is the log reference (hash value) of the newly created records</p> 
 Confirming the Delegation Proof: While the first step only publishes a delegation record (that can be done by anyone) the DID owner needs in the next step to confirm / sign the delegation record for inclusion
 echo '["log-reference"]' | oydid confirm did:oyd:zQm... 
<p>Note: the input is an array of log-references to be included&nbsp;</p> 
 Using the Delegation: The delegatee can now act on behalf of the delegator within the bounds of the delegated rights. When a delegatee performs an action, he/she provides the delegation proof, which can be verified using the delegator’s public key. To retrieve all currently active public keys you can use the following command:
 oydid pubkeys did:oyd:zQm... 
<p>Examples for the use of delegation in the did:oyd method infrastructure are retrieving Verifiable Credentials from the online wallet or updating a DID Document itself.</p> 
 
<p>Here is an example DID Document with delegation information (for <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:oyd:zQmRTHTMPvbaEuvSDfsZZhWkMdaJNS2Zzy73sg3g4BzJo95"><code>did:oyd:zQmRTHTMPvbaEuvSDfsZZhWkMdaJNS2Zzy73sg3g4BzJo95</code></a>):</p>

 Findings Along the Way 
<p>Implementing delegation for the did:oyd method provided some insights and learnings that might also be relevant for other DID methods:</p>
<p>Describing Capabilities</p>
<p>While the W3C DID Core Spec has dedicated Verification Methods for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#capability-invocation">Capability Invocation</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#capability-delegation">Capability Delegation</a>, I could actually not find a way to describe a capability itself. In the did:oyd method there is the possibility to delegate the capability associated with the document-key (to be used e.g. when establishing a secure communication channel with DIDComm) and for the revocation-key (necessary to publish an update of the DID Document). In addition it would make sense to have dedicated cryptographic material in a DID Document associated with service endpoints and consequently allow delegation for accessing a service.</p>
<p>This might be addressed in upcoming versions of the DID Specification to allow a more explicit referencing of capabilities.</p>
<p>Available Capability Delegation in Other DID Methods</p>
<p>When searching for Capability Delegation in other DID methods I found surprisingly litte information. Reading the specifications in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">DID Method Registry</a> actually made me aware that the use of Verification Methods is not part of the typical DID Method Specification and I assume that those are interpreted quite differently in the various implementations. Which brings us to the final finding:</p>
<p>DID Rotation</p>
<p>Migration between different DID methods is hard – at least I’m struggling for a while now to implement such a functionality for did:oyd. And with implementing more functionalities like Capability Delegation it becomes even harder since it would require to research and develop peculiarities for each other DID method. This might be an area that the upcoming <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/">DID Resolution Specification</a>&nbsp;could address.</p>
<p>For now I made the design decision for did:oyd that any capability delegation needs to be explicitly renewed upon updating a DID Document, i.e., the default behaviour when publishing a new DID Document is to automatically disable any previous delegations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, DID Delegation is an essential component of decentralised identity systems, providing flexibility, scalability, security, and privacy. This blog posts described how DID Delegation works for the <a href="https://ownyourdata.github.io/oydid/">did:oyd method</a> and explained the various mechanisms involved in the process.</p>

<p>Author: Mélissa M’Raidi-Kechichian. Additional contributions made by members of DIACC’s Outreach Expert Committee.</p>


 
 
 
<p>Digital identity aims to make our life easier, avoid long waiting lines to prove who we are, and access online spaces in a secure way while safeguarding our personal data. It also enables organizations to establish their online identity and protect users against online threats. Falling under the umbrella of the broad tech ecosystem, digital identity is evolving along with the responsible tech movement, itself growing and already impacting Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance, as seen in the principles of the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and the EU AI ACT. According to the US based think tank dedicated to grow the responsible tech ecosystem <a href="https://alltechishuman.org/what-is-responsible-technology">All Tech Is Human</a>, responsible tech is ensuring that technology is aligned with the public interest, concerned with reducing the harms of technology, and promotes diversity in its space. The responsible tech movement may not be a framework but rather a school of thoughts, it brought many practitioners to wonder about the question of responsible tech practices regarding users’ data privacy.</p>
 



  
  
 
 


<p>Along these lines, a growing number of citizens (i.e., users), became aware of how precious and sensitive their personal data is, how it is being used, for better (easier and faster access to bureaucracy) and for worse (the centralization of individual identifiers in insecure and opaque systems, data shared without consent with data brokers, or fuelling Weapons of Math Destruction*, for instance), especially thanks to the work of scholars and data activists. The latest shed light on the social implications of AI in a vulgarized and accessible way. Scholars and activists explained the risks of technology and lack of regulations over personal data in plain English and by using relatable use cases, through <a href="https://alltechishuman.org/all-tech-is-human-blog/responsible-tech-documentaries">documentaries</a> and workshops.<br><br>The concept of “good” digital identity aligns with DIACC’s mission to provide the framework to develop a robust, secure, scalable, and privacy enhancing digital identification and authentication ecosystem for Canadians, but is yet to be defined and standardized by this industry. Building on Kim Cameron’s digital identity work legacy, better known as the <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">Laws of Identity</a>, this blog aims to explore the possibilities and meanings behind the concept of “good digital identity”.</p>


 
 
  
  



 
<p>“Good” is an adjective that seems to carry a subjective meaning depending on the point of view of a practitioner (or user, for that matter). Since the term has not yet been defined and standardized by the digital identity industry, we are interpreting the word good as a digital identity practice that is beneficial for most and does not harm or disadvantage any users. Before getting into the principles of good digital identity, let’s note that “consent” is a recurring term in this blog piece. In this case, consent refers to the clear and informed decision of a user to permit access to their data to a third party. This consent should not be transferred from one third party to another without the knowledge and consent of a user.</p>
 
 
 


<p>Principles. </p>



<p>The first principle of good digital identity is privacy, and gathers the first 3 laws of Kim Cameron on identity. Users should have control and consent over how their data is being used, and minimize data sharing to the minimum required to access a service depending on the context of use.</p>



<p>Interoperability, which echoes law 5 of Kim Cameron, should be a core component of good digital identity. Users should be able to choose between different providers of digital identity solutions, and these distinct entities should be able to trust each other in a common framework.</p>



<p>Digital identity should have a social and collective benefit rather than a solely individual benefit. Therefore, digital identity must be inclusive and serve traditionally marginalized communities that have been excoded** rather than encoded in digital “solutions” in the past. That means moving consciously and with care rather than moving fast and breaking things, until or alongside a legal framework that guarantees protection of users’ rights, integrity, and privacy.</p>



<p>Digital identity should be optional, as an alternative to traditional identity verification, until the widespread use of digital identity is proven efficient, safe, and secure for every user so that our traditional identity verification process gradually falls into disuse on its own. It is important to recognize that a number of people are worried about digital identity, what it means for them, and what it implies. In some cases, it is due to personal experiences as minorities (in the Canadian context, an example would be Indigenous communities specifically, who have a record of having been the victim of crimes committed by public entities), in others it is due to disinformation and unfounded narratives, or even lack of accessible public resources about digital identity. One might argue that it would be an avoidable financial cost if the traditional methods had a sunset date, rather than to invest in maintaining both processes. However, users should be left with a choice regarding digital identity.</p>



<p>Digital identity should be understood by any user, regardless of their background, in order for them to make informed decisions and consent, meaning that resources to understand digital identity and how it impacts a user must be available in plain English and use relatable use cases as examples. Explainability not only empowers users, it also gives less space for speculations that feed disinformation.</p>



<p>Fairness and trust should be the red line guiding good digital identity. Fairness and trust come from acknowledging and fixing mistakes. To do so, good digital identity should have a mechanism that bridges the gap between users and providers in order for users to share feedback and adapt its practices when needed and avoid ongoing unnecessary harm that have historically correlated with the implementation of a new technology.</p>



<p>Good digital identity should promote transparent data processes, storing, and use. Transparency allows for greater accountability and therefore also aligns with fairness and trust.</p>



<p>Scalability was previously formulated by Kim Cameron in his seventh law of identity. Good digital identity should allow users to share only the desired and necessary parts of their identity, and therefore be scalable across contexts and needs, i.e., following data minimization principles.</p>



<p>Regularly auditing digital identity solutions should be part of good digital identity practices. These audits should be comprehensive but also meaningful and relevant for the users.</p>



<p>Take Aways</p>



<p>In this blog, we explored what the concept of good digital identity could mean, following principles that would lead to a practice that is beneficial for most and does not harm or disadvantage any user. However, the concept of good digital identity should be collectively defined by practitioners in the field in order to standardize and adopt a definition. Beyond actionable principles, good digital identity should also promote a culture where a diversity of voices participates, and where users’ consent, choice, and control over their personal data prevails.<br><br>Definitions</p>



 
 * Weapons of Math Destruction is a term coined by data scientist Cathy O’Neil in her book “Weapons of Math Destruction: how Big Data increases inequality and threatens democracy”. The term describes mathematical models (algorithms) that attempt to quantify human traits and characteristics and have an opaque data sourcing and processing that, as a consequence, leave big scale damages on one or several communities. 



 ** Excoded is a term coined by Dr. Joy Buolamwini, MIT, in her work conducted at <a href="https://www.ajl.org/about">The Algorithmic Justice League</a> that she founded, that refers to the minorities excluded from the data that composes the code of models powering technologies. The excoded are usually the most negatively impacted from said technologies.

 Implementing Safe on dedicated Energy Web infrastructure simplifies the process of creating, configuring, and managing smart contract accounts on the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain <p>Over the last several years, <a href="https://docs.safe.global/">Safe</a> has emerged as the leading open-source tool for generating and interacting with customizable smart contract accounts on Ethereum-based blockchains. Within the Energy Web ecosystem, Safe has been primarily used to create multi-signature wallets and build custom transaction workflows. <br>Up until recently Safe was available as-a-Service under the global Safe web application (which is integrated with over a dozen blockchains). To simplify adoption for our members, Energy Web has been working behind the scenes to configure and deploy a separate version with default integration to the Energy Web Chain and Volta test networks. Today we’re pleased to announce that Energy Web Safe is now available at <a href="https://gnosis-safe.energyweb.org/welcome">https://gnosis-safe.energyweb.org/welcome</a>.</p><p>For users with existing Safe account(s), there are no impacts to account configuration or functionality.

<p><a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/x/kp7QB">Cardea</a>, a complete open-source verifiable credential ecosystem for sharing health information in a way that preserves patient privacy, has been accepted as a <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/participate/labs">Hyperledger Lab</a>.</p>



<p>Cardea emerged from a project to <a href="https://youtu.be/iTp8-MqL-Kw">share proof</a> of Covid 19 test status for entry to Aruba. Developed by <a href="https://indicio.tech">Indicio</a>, a leading developer of privacy-first decentralized identity and verification solutions, for <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a>, the leading global supplier of IT to the air transport sector, the solution went on to win an <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-award-ceremony">EIC</a> and <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/events/supernova/2022">SuperNova</a> award for advancing decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cardea contains all of the necessary components to issue, share, and verify a variety of health information using decentralized identifiers, a mobile application, and a distributed ledger. The unique parts of the codebase were built on Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries and originally donated by SITA as the Cardea Project to Linux Foundation Public Health, where it was further developed to address the broader need for a complete open source solution for sharing health data in a privacy-preserving and secure way. (Read <a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf">this white paper</a> for a deep dive into how Cardea works and some of the initial use cases.)</p>



<p>_____<br><br>Be sure not to miss our <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings">next meeting</a> on 5/11/2023 at 12 noon Eastern Time featuring <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-samis-31190a/">Sarah Samis</a>, VP of Public health Products and Platforms of GCOM, on vital records!<br>_____</p>



<p>Preserving privacy is a critical need both for digital health credentials and travel passes. A recent poll from IATA highlighted that 78% of passengers who took part in the survey will only use a travel health credential app if they have full control over their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data privacy and security are equally critical in healthcare. In 2021, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/03/31/2413675/0/en/Largest-Healthcare-Data-Breaches-Reported-in-February-2022-Confirms-Need-for-Network-Security-Based-on-Zero-Trust-Microsegmentation.html">93% of healthcare organizations experienced a data breach, while 57% of healthcare organizations have had more than five breaches</a>. By using a decentralized approach we are putting control of the end user’s data back into their own hands to store locally on their own verifiable credentials, reducing both the impact of these breaches and the incentive for bad actor’s to attempt them.</p>



<p>By becoming a Hyperledger Lab, Cardea aims to empower public health authorities to design, build, and deploy open-source, privacy-first, and simple-to-use digital health solutions. With this technology, the community can work together to reopen economies without people having to give up their privacy.</p>



<p>“With the migration of Cardea to Hyperledger,” says Heather Dahl, Indicio’s CEO&nbsp; “Indicio has taken the lead on privacy-first decentralized identity technology. And as a Public Benefit Corporation, we believe that open sourcing decentralized identity technology through Hyperledger Foundation will lay the foundation for a better, fairer world to come.”</p>

<p>Verifiable credentials can revolutionize how we store and share personal information. This technology promises greater privacy, security, and convenience in many contexts by enabling individuals to control their data. However, as with any new technology, there are significant challenges to be addressed by developers, implementers, and adopters if society is to realize its potential fully.</p>



<p>The comments and findings presented in this report reflect interviews conducted with representative organizations concerning the level of interest in using verifiable credentials in their respective organizations and industry sectors as part of their identity management offerings. This report does not examine or consider enabling technologies related to the generation, use, and management of verifiable credentials (e.g., blockchain, digital wallet, and public key cryptography components) except in broad terms.</p>

Community members are collaborating on projects and initiatives that have helped to advance our shared goals. We’ve also been able to raise our profile through events, community calls, and other forms of outreach.

We’ve held off on establishing a more formal governance structure, choosing instead to work collectively, mostly in our monthly community call. There’s been a small increase in participation in this call, so clearly word is getting around that all members have a voice in shaping the direction of the community.

<p>In IDunion we develop concepts for wallet security with verifiable credentials. In the PDF below, you will learn about the three pillars of wallet security, the attestation process and trust model, and much more.</p>



<p>The three pillars of wallet security are:</p>



<p>1. Integrity of the Credential</p>



<p>2. Authenticity of the Holder</p>



<p>3. Authenticity of the Wallet</p>



<p>These pillars are important because they ensure that the credentials issued by an issuer are secure and cannot be tampered with, that the holder is who they claim to be and can prove it, and that the wallet itself is authentic and trustworthy. By maintaining these three pillars, trust can be established in the SSI triangle between the verifier, issuer, and holder/wallet.</p>



<p>More security-relevant use cases demand new requirements for trust in the holder/wallet relationship. One example of such a use case could be a situation where a holder is required to present their credentials to access sensitive information or perform a critical action, such as accessing medical records or transferring large sums of money.</p>



<p>In these cases, it is important to ensure that the holder’s authentication is strong enough to meet the requirements of the regulated use case and that their wallet is authentic and trustworthy.</p>



<p>This document was created by Paul Bastian from Bundesdruckerei in the context of developing a secure attestation service based on OpenID4VC flows. This flow was tested and presented at the Internet Identity Workshop with the Lissi Wallet.</p>

<p>OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce that the first set of FAPI 2.0 self-certifications have been published and can now be viewed on the <a href="https://openid.net/certification/#FAPI2">Certification Listings</a>.</p>
<p>We congratulate Authlete, Cloudentity, ConnectID, Ping Identity, and Raidiam for achieving compliance with the current FAPI 2.0 certifications and for being thought leaders on the leading edge of this important work. We are grateful to ConnectID in Australia who adopted FAPI 2.0 for their ecosystem and funded the FAPI 2.0 conformance test suite development, as noted in <a href="https://openid.net/2023/03/21/fapi-2-conformance-tests-available/">our announcement</a>. We expect further announcements of FAPI 2.0 adoption and additional certifications later in the year.</p>
<p>We also thank all these members and the FAPI Working Group for their valuable feedback on the FAPI 2.0 specifications and the certification tests. The conformance tests and certification programme are a vital part of ensuring interoperable, secure Open Banking and Open Data ecosystems.</p>
<p>The FAPI 2.0 specification has been through formal security analysis by the University of Stuttgart as <a href="https://openid.net/2022/12/19/fapi-2-0-announcement/">previously announced</a>. The Foundation encourages existing and future implementers to consider their adoption plans for FAPI 2.0 now as the current Implementor’s Draft 2.0 is mature and stable, and Implementor’s Draft’s are commonly selected by public and private entities to implement against. The working group expects the specification advance to Final before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CMO</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-password/">Google announced support for simple and secure sign-ins with passkeys</a> for all Google Account users. This is a huge milestone in our journey towards a passwordless future. Why?</p>



<p>It’s been only a year since Apple, Google and Microsoft announced their commitment to passkeys with plans to expand support for a common passwordless sign-in standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium. Since then, Apple and Google have readied their operating systems for service providers to enable sign-ins with passkeys that sync across devices; Windows 10 and 11 have long supported device-bound passkeys in Windows Hello – and passkeys from iOS or Android devices can also be used to sign into sites in Chrome or Edge on Windows.</p>



<p>Additionally, service providers like PayPal, Yahoo! Japan, NTT DOCOMO, CVS Health, Shopify, Mercari, Kayak, SK Telecom and more are committed to or already providing passkey sign-ins. Google now joins them, and will serve as a great way for large swathes of consumers to become familiar with passkeys, while also helping accelerate deployments from other service providers.</p>



<p>Consumer Readiness On the Rise<br>The growing number of service providers supporting passkeys matches a growth in consumer awareness and readiness.</p>



<p>According to a new survey released today by FIDO Alliance, over 57% of U.S. consumers said they are interested in using passkeys to replace passwords, compared with 39% who said they were familiar with the concept of passkeys in FIDO’s <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/barometer-2022/">2022 Online Authentication Barometer,</a> released in October 2022.</p>



<p>Recovering or resetting passwords is one of the many hassles that consumers face. Only 9% of those surveyed report that they never need to recover their password – with 13% having to recover passwords daily or several times per week and nearly 60% reporting several password resets per quarter.&nbsp; It is little wonder then that 29% of consumers prefer signing in with biometrics (e.g. fingerprint or face scan) versus 19% who prefer to enter a password manually.</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys are resistant</a> to threats of phishing, credential stuffing and other remote attacks often used to take over online accounts. Based on the survey, approximately 65% of people who prefer to use biometrics to sign in would be interested in using a passkey and nearly half (45%) of people who prefer to use passwords to sign in would be interested in using a passkey. This is another clear signal telling us that consumers want less friction and greater ease of signing into their online accounts.</p>



<p>Passwords Create More Friction for Online Transactions</p>



<p>Consumers are tired of the hassle and complexity of passwords and are ready to embrace passkey sign-ins, which enable them to access online services simply and securely. Passkeys can help reduce shopping cart abandonment and turn the tide against the ongoing plague of data breaches and identity theft.</p>



<p>In addition to security implications, passwords continue to be costly for online retailers – according to the survey, nearly 60% of consumers said they have abandoned their carts due to a forgotten password in the past six months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simply put, passkeys stand to dramatically improve consumers’ online shopping experiences – as well as their service providers’ bottom lines.</p>



<p>Perceived Password Risk<br>Despite the large number of breaches and warnings, many consumers maintain poor password hygiene, unmoved by the risks passwords pose to their digital lives. According to the survey, 70% of people use passwords that are at least one year old. Despite the known risks of phishing attacks and other security breaches, the survey shows that 21% of respondents believe entering their password manually is the most secure authentication method.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly 60% said they would not pay for increased security measures or official verification on social media platforms. Earlier this year, Twitter warned users they would lose the ability to secure access to their account via text message two-factor authentication unless they pay to subscribe to Twitter Blue. It seems clear from this data that consumers would naturally look to passkeys as a seamless and secure alternative.</p>



<p>To review the FIDO Alliance’s full survey results, click <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/research-findings-consumers-are-ready-to-embrace-new-authentication-methods/">here</a>.</p>



<p>What’s next?<br>Both the data and the increasing number of organizations rolling out passkeys shows that the future of authentication is here. But this does not mean the work is done. The FIDO Alliance and its members continue to iterate to improve the experience of passkeys. Be on the lookout for upcoming UX research and guidelines to further increase the adoption and usability of passkeys.&nbsp;The FIDO Alliance is also continuing to provide education, UX guidance, adoption perspectives and more through upcoming industry events. Attend our <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/fido-alliance-at-identiverse-2023/">sessions</a> at Identiverse and be sure to attend the FIDO Alliance’s conference, <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/authenticate-2023/">Authenticate</a>, in Carlsbad, CA (or virtually) on October 16-18, 2023.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased announce the final publication of the white paper on “Government-Issued Identity Credentials and the Privacy Landscape,” published here (<a href="https://openid.net/Government-issued-Digital-Credentials-and-the-Privacy-Landscape-Final">https://openid.net/Government-issued-Digital-Credentials-and-the-Privacy-Landscape-Final</a>). The Foundation joins with five other non-profits (the Kantara Initiative, ID4Africa, Open Identity Exchange, Secure Identity Alliance, Better Identity Coalition, and the Trust Over IP Foundation) along with a wide range of experts from civil society, government, and the private sector for this thorough assessment of the global privacy landscape in the context of government-issued digital identity credentials.</p>
<p>This paper is an especially timely as governments around the world seek to scale their existing digital identity credential implementations, or chart a path to deliver new digital identity credential programs. It seeks to offer a balanced, global view of privacy concerns by exploring laws, implementations, gaps, and tradeoffs facing the people developing these new ecosystems. It builds on the thoughtful work of other studies and concludes with tangible recommendations in three areas:</p>
 
 
 The Basics of Security and Privacy 
 Addressing Ongoing Concerns 
 Getting Ahead of Emerging Concerns 
 
 
<p>Beyond identifying issues, the contributors to this paper seek to point our concrete areas that will inform how to build more privacy preserving ecosystems, and what issues the community needs to continue working on together. This is a final paper, but&nbsp;&nbsp;those interested in taking part in future discussions and papers on this topic are welcome to share your interest to <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a>.</p>
<p>Our thanks to lead editor Heather Flanagan, who has distilled a complex and rapidly changing domain space for the benefit of lay people and experts alike.</p>

 A conversation with Elodie Vialle, affiliate at the Berkman Klein Center and Senior Advisor on Digital Safety and Free Expression at PEN&nbsp;America Photo courtesy of <a href="https://medium.com/u/9bf278485c05">Elodie&nbsp;Vialle</a><p>Death threats. Defamation campaigns. Doxxing.</p><p>These are just some of the threats journalists face in their day to day, especially women and journalists of color who are disproportionately targeted for their work. Online harassment remains one of the largest threats to world press freedom, with 73% of women journalists worldwide experiencing online violence in their course of work, <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unescos-global-survey-online-violence-against-women-journalists?TSPD_101_R0=080713870fab2000cebe8667e99a2979fc19b93b58b373fc77c69ded596f1527bfb7d18430e7dd3d087d106cc51430006e57bd6929665b27b4aea72ae8d136bd810b56d8454e9655add857ae7d41bef1bc5e69af718262623fe125321b82bc1b">according to UNESCO and ICFJ</a>. To combat this issue and preserve press freedom around the world, it is crucial to increase safety measures for journalists in online&nbsp;spaces.</p><p>In her work as a 2022–2023 RSM Assembly Fellow with the Institute for Rebooting Social Media at the Berkman Klein Center, journalist and press freedom defender <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/elodie-vialle">Elodie Vialle</a> proposed creating an escalation channel within social media platforms to better support journalists and human rights defenders harassed online. While social media platforms do have features like “reporting” and “blocking,” Vialle’s proposed system would provide customized support in emergencies and situations of severe online abuse such as doxxing or coordinated attacks. The “Escalation Channel 2.0” would act as customer service for journalists and human rights defenders, making targeted, trauma-informed support more accessible to journalists around the world with a focus on protecting marginalized voices.</p><p>“What I felt in my own experience is the feeling of being powerless when your peer journalists reach out to you being traumatized, facing a situation that no one can help with or that no one is listening to. I wanted to listen to them, and I wanted to find a solution,” Vialle said when I asked her about what led to the creation of Escalation Channel&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>As we talked, I thought about my own experiences as a young woman of color, GenZ journalist, and a student press freedom activist. Malicious online comments about my age, race, and gender are not unique to me, as these proliferate for young women and journalists of color everywhere. Online harassment is creating a chilling effect on free speech, not just through censorship but also through self-censorship.</p><p>I sat down with Vialle to further discuss her proposal, her work preserving press freedom online, and challenges with press freedom around the&nbsp;world.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/ja/@joeldevriend?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Joël de Vriend</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>Pratika Katiyar: How do you approach women, people of color, or younger, student journalists facing harassment? These are three different groups who receive uneven support and attention when it comes to harassment online. Do you find that focusing on women or other marginalized groups is effective?</p><p>Vialle: Women and marginalized groups are <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/5/2/mr-musk-we-need-twitter-guardrails-that-protect-lives-and-free">becoming deplatformed</a> because of online harassment. And, we have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/01/13/the-state-of-online-harassment/">research in the US</a> showing that journalists of color are particularly targeted. Trying to build solutions to tackle this issue is a way to better enhance diversity. There’s a lot of interest in promoting diversity, but actually, it’s only a layer of communication if you don’t create the conditions to make sure that people can work safely within the newsroom. So acknowledging that women and marginalized groups are disproportionately targeted by online harassment, newsrooms that are committed to work on enhancing diversity can put in place better safety measures.</p><blockquote>There’s a lot of interest in promoting diversity, but actually, it’s only a layer of communication if you don’t create the conditions to make sure that people can work safely within the newsroom.</blockquote><p>Katiyar: In your presentation, you briefly discussed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/19/student-journalist-harass-arizona/">Taylor Lorenz’s article on how online groups and mobs are coming for student journalists</a>, who already don’t have a lot of protections. Aspiring journalists or younger, GenZ journalists are dropping out of the journalism industry in large numbers because of both online harassment and the tumultuous nature of the media industry right now. How can solutions combating online harassment help bring some younger journalists back into the field or encourage them to continue pursuing journalism?</p><p>Vialle: We cannot do our work as journalists without being on Twitter or on Facebook. We have to be visible and engage with our readers. As journalists, this is a tool we have to use for our work. I cannot just stop tweeting; freelancers need to be visible. The same goes for young journalists entering the field; they need their work to be&nbsp;visible.</p><p>I spoke with student journalists in the US facing death threats, and they didn’t have any idea how to deal with that. There’s two layers of action here. One is institutions. The institution or organization has to set up and implement safety protocols and training. And as always, we acknowledge that newsrooms today are struggling to survive, and that it is difficult to implement additional costs. So when we have these discussions about safety, we really want to acknowledge the limited [financial] constraints for student newspapers too. In universities, building connections between the existing support helplines to get access to therapists or getting a special connection with safety hotlines for students in journalism, because we do know that they face a higher level of risk. Students can also learn how to better protect themselves <a href="https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/?_gl=1*1jm7o6p*_ga*NDg3NDgzMDIwLjE2Nzc3Njc3MTI.*_ga_0RQGYGDH22*MTY4MjYyMTY5OS4zNC4wLjE2ODI2MjE2OTkuNjAuMC4w">using PEN America’s resources</a>.</p><p>Katiyar: There is a lot going in terms of press freedom around the world. The recent arrest of WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich in Russia is an example of a physical violation of press freedom, but there’s also a lot of online censorship in countries like India, where the government is blocking access to information. Additionally, in the United States, there’s so many news outlets shutting down or laying off staff, with BuzzFeed News being one of them recently. The landscape for the future of journalism looks very uncertain right now. What challenges do you anticipate in preserving press freedom around the world right now, and is there any&nbsp;hope?</p><p>Vialle: Today, journalists are facing, I will say, a new array of threats, between arbitrary detention, physical attacks, arrest, murder, online harassment, intimidation, and defamation campaigns. The situation is really bad for the journalism field. The fact that in democracies now, we are facing threats that are similar to the one we’re used to in authoritarian regimes, that’s also a signal that things are going&nbsp;badly.</p><blockquote>The fact that in democracies now, we are facing threats that are similar to the one we’re used to in authoritarian regimes, that’s also a signal that things are going&nbsp;badly.</blockquote><p>The rise of disinformation and the lack of trust in the media normalizes attacks against journalists. All these narratives developed by governments and enemies of the free press, trying to use journalists as scapegoats, leads to direct physical attacks. I observed this in France because we had some protests, of course during COVID. The rise of disinformation led to attacks on journalists and attempts to censor content. A <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news-powerful-and-privileged-how-misrepresentation-and-underrepresentation-disadvantaged">Reuters Institute report </a>saw that there’s a lot of disinformation that exploits the fact that underrepresented communities don’t feel served, they don’t feel represented well in the media&nbsp;outlets.</p><p>I want to give you a sign of hope though. We’ve mentioned the social media platforms relating to my project. These platforms are being used to amplify online abuse and gender-based violence, but but they can be a part of the solution as well, <a href="https://pen.org/report/no-excuse-for-abuse/">if they implement features to mitigate the impact of online abuse</a> and <a href="https://rebootingsocialmedia.org/2022/12/01/from-emergency-to-prevention-protecting-journalists-from-online-abuse/">proactively work with civil society on code signing solutions</a></p><p>Katiyar: Thank you for that answer and for your time&nbsp;today.</p><p>The theme for World Press Freedom Day 2023 is “Freedom of expression as a driver for all other human rights.” When freedom of expression is suppressed, access to information and all other human rights are put at risk. It is more important than ever to ideate and implement sociotechnical solutions to better support journalists who are attacked and abused online beyond the traditional methods within social media platforms. That rings especially true with the recent layoffs of trust and safety roles in the tech industry, specifically at Twitter, a platform known extensively for the presence of journalists.</p><p>Centers like Berkman Klein showcase how to best combat this pervasive issue: by putting practitioners — civil society folks, technologists — and academics together. But more attention needs to be paid to including young journalists. GenZ is chronically online, and solutions to combat online harassment should start at the university/journalism school level. That includes advocating for classes on online safety, working on public policy efforts in conjunction with social media companies to educate GenZ on online abuse, and pressing news organizations and journalists to prioritize hiring young journalists of color. Newsrooms highlight their innovation and diversity efforts, but those efforts cannot succeed if journalists are currently under threat and if the next generation is dropping out of the industry altogether.</p><p>Pratika Katiyar is a research assistant at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University, a student at Northeastern University, and a board member for the Student Press Law Center, a nonprofit that defends students’ press freedom rights. She is a GenZ free expression activist that has been profiled in Teen Vogue, NBC Washington, and ABC for her work and has spoken on panels for the United Nations, PEN America, and Georgetown Law&nbsp;School.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/online-harassment-threat-to-world-press-freedom-540adb768c54">Online harassment makes world press less free</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Michael Pytel has years of experience in the manufacturing world from developing wheelchairs, greeting cards, shoes, poultry and meat products, and even rockets. Through all of this, he felt like there wasn't a lot of innovation in warehouses. His aim to change that is by building a platform that uses machine learning and AI from the ground up, rather than antiquated warehouse management systems that were built 15, 20 years ago. So what are these cutting-edge technologies that Michael has created and how do they lead to efficiency and success?</p> <p>Michael Pytel, Co-Founder &amp; CTO at Fulfilld, explains the importance of technology in the warehouse for mapping products, eliminating fork truck traffic, and how it all leads to success.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Key takeaways:</p>     <p>An optimized warehouse is one that focuses on reducing waste. Wasteful time, wasteful travel, wasted movements, and focusing on where you want employees to feel engaged and successful in the day. Fulfilld is focused on creating technology to structure the ballet in the warehouse where movement is optimized and there is no wasted travel.</p>     <p>Fulfilld is focused on creating a ‘digital twin’ for mapping out products in the warehouse. They take the CAD drawing of a manufacturing space, of a warehouse space, and load it into a computer model, and essentially generate their own version of Google Maps. It can create routes for employees to optimize their travel on a forklift or on foot.</p>     <p>Transparency creates efficiency. By having something be visible, you can optimize more! Fulfilld’s technology has given customers the ability to see where their order is in the process so they aren’t constantly wondering when it’s going to ship. This creates a great consumer experience.</p>     <p> </p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1 US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guest:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelpytel/">Michael Pytel’s LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

Since then, the use cases have expanded to help a plurality of communities better detect when a wallet is linked to a unique human. Gitcoin Passport offers critical scoring mechanisms to keep Web3 communities safe from malicious actors. So far, Gitcoin Passport has been used in conjunction with a number of other data science analyses to prevent<a href="https://impact.gitcoin.co/?ref=blog.ceramic.network"> $3M</a> of fraud during the grants rounds.</p><p>As part of Gitcoin's efforts to decentralize and democratize the grant funding process, they are transitioning from a centralized grants platform to a decentralized protocol—<a href="https://gitcoin.co/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Gitcoin Allo</a>. This protocol and the accompanying dApps in Gitcoin’s Grants Stack will enable multiple grants rounds to run concurrently on-chain, empowering any community to permissionlessly coordinate its own grants program and create a more inclusive and community-driven funding ecosystem.</p><p>We're excited to see how developers leverage the decentralized Grants Stack, with tools like Gitcoin Passport, to launch and manage their own projects. Passport enables developers to verify the 'unique humanity' of a wallet that wants to access an application or project. The data collected is intended for broad interoperability for any system that wishes to issue or consume VCs to establish the unique humanity of an individual through their direct ownership of multiple accounts (Twitter, BrightID) or Web3 assets (ENS).</p><p>To determine who gets access to a developer's application, the new and improved Passport Scorer App gives users a 'Unique Humanity Score'. Developers can check out this<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bfkalDSvRDc&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network"> starter video</a> to integrate it into their application—helping to increase the trustworthiness of Web3 and onboard more users. Developers can also check out <a>ComposeDB on Ceramic</a> if they're just getting started building a decentralized application. </p><p>The<a href="https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-the-gitcoin-grants-beta-round?utm_campaign=Grants%20Program&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=255538070&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_6byUvX4Uqt99PsSYDsrM9PhCqGFLGkT4S4rcFWpWHzJjiv2_hzapREw5faI5eEL996_g2_KbL7TlgPuSnLZRAANZnSw&amp;utm_content=255538070&amp;utm_source=hs_email"> Gitcoin Grants Beta Round</a> runs from April 25th to May 9th, you can read more about quadratic funding and sybil resistance with Passport on Ceramic<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/gitcoin-builds-passport-on-ceramic/"> here</a>.</p>

<p>The RSA Conference&nbsp;further proved that passwords are a problem. The solution, we’re told, lies in using Passkeys, or cryptographic credentials that securely authenticate individuals without usernames or passwords and have multi-factor authentication (MFA) built-in. Several sessions at RSAC focused on the benefit of Passkeys, while also taking a look at the&nbsp;challenges still ahead.&nbsp;</p>
