<p>By Wafa-Ben Hassine, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>I believe it can. And it must. As a human rights attorney, I come at this issue thinking about people&nbsp;first.</p><p>Whether its messaging a family member asking them to bring home a loaf of bread, or discussing next year’s business strategy with a colleague, secure encryption ensures we can have private conversations and guarantees the integrity of our communication. Users’ quick adoption of encrypted, private messaging speaks volumes of its importance: billions of users worldwide use encrypted messaging on a daily basis as an indispensable tool in their livelihoods.</p><p>While the examples above are innocuous, we know that encrypted messaging platforms can also be used for more nefarious purposes. And with these platforms’ breadth, reach, and the undetectable nature of the content of conversations, we are deeply concerned about the harms that their deployment creates. Examples include <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44856910">lynch mobs in India</a>, <a href="https://mediaengagement.org/research/encrypted-propaganda/">widespread disinformation</a> on the coronavirus pandemic in Mexico and the US, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/whatsapp-skewed-brazilian-election-showing-social-medias-danger-to-democracy">swaying election results</a> in Brazil, facilitating global <a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2019/9/13/20863489/encryption-stanford-conference-facebook-ncmec-ghq">child abuse</a>, and providing white supremacists the channels needed to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/karstenschmehl/whatsapp-groups-nazi-symbol-stickers-germany">spread Nazi propaganda</a> in Germany and the&nbsp;US.</p><p>But we can’t just blame encryption for these harms. Encryption is universally regarded as a <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/in/documentViewer.xhtml?v=2.1.196&amp;id=p::usmarcdef_0000246527&amp;file=/in/rest/annotationSVC/DownloadWatermarkedAttachment/attach_import_832e8e2a-88a0-4df2-a332-c945a30d9f8f%3F_%3D246527eng.pdf&amp;locale=en&amp;multi=true&amp;ark=/ark:/48223/pf0000246527/PDF/246527eng.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A145%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C0%5D">prerequisite for the exercise of rights</a> like freedom of expression, and freedom to privacy online. It is a means to a fundamental end. With the Internet increasingly permeating every aspect of our lives, encryption is a technology that will not and should not go away anytime soon. Health and financial institutions also utilize encryption to ensure that individuals’ personal information is safe from identity theft and&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>We need to disrupt the status quo that materially benefits the large tech companies that provide these platforms (often for free), who then turn a blind eye to the harms they can cause. Researchers, civil society groups, and governments should be able to have select information on how the technology is operated and used — e.g. market sizes based on geography, metadata about how information travels, peak use and dynamics, etc. — all appropriately aggregated so as to protect individual privacy — so they can better understand the nature, type and impact of these harms, and ultimately, help propose ways to fix them. And tech platforms who provide these services should be ultimately accountable for ensuring their safety and&nbsp;quality.</p><p>I joined Omidyar Network to lead and support the type of work that can change that status quo. Our goal is to work with our partners to advance a robust, evidence-driven, and sensible public conversation that ensures encrypted messaging is safe, trustworthy, inclusive, and doesn’t sacrifice encryption and privacy. One that, based on my professional background, respects and upholds human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>To do that, we must start by envisioning the kind of messaging we want to see. The debate around whether we should, or should not encrypt, is a non-starter. Instead, we should ask: What kind of information do researchers need to help understand and prevent some of the issues we see? What pressure points can we identify to tilt the balance with policymakers? What does accountability look like in an encrypted ecosystem that in some instances, verifiably led to rampant organized disinformation and propaganda campaigns? What can different stakeholders do to stop the exploitation of technological gains benefitting privacy?</p><p>Answers to these questions will help us collectively conceive of more effective ways to mitigate any harmful byproducts of private, secure messaging, and begin to truly enjoy all that it has to&nbsp;offer.</p><p>As social activist and author Alice Walker said: “Look closely at the present you are constructing: it should look like the future you are dreaming.”</p>

The world's attention has turned to healthcare this year, with many initiatives exploring the use of open data and standards. Schema.org has made a number of efforts already to contribute to the global Coronavirus response, including the creation of <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">SpecialAnnouncement</a> markup, improvements around events, jobs, <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">hospital reporting</a>, and other schemas to reflect our changed reality.&nbsp; <br>  This week we have invited <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">longstanding</a> Schema.org collaborator Aneesh Chopra to provide an introduction to some important developments in the United States, where Schema.org is being used to improve the accuracy of information about healthcare provider directories.&nbsp; <br>  Guest post by Aneesh Chopra, former U.S. CTO (2009-2012) and President/Co-Founder of <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">CareJourney</a>: <br>  Just over 9 years ago, the schema.org community <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">launched a markup for JobPostings, </a>an important resource to meet a call to action in helping veterans find jobs that valued their skills. During the early months of the pandemic, this community responded with an important upgrade to the nation’s health IT infrastructure to democratize access more <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">trusted health information online</a>. <br>  Today, at an <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">API Summit</a> hosted by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, Kathy Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced an open collaboration that builds upon the same regulations and industry standards to improve another important aspect of the consumer health navigation experience - searching for timely, accurate provider directory information. <br>  For many Americans, finding a health plan that includes their trusted providers is critically important, but often requires tedious work looking up each plan’s provider directory. Sadly, as CMS found in a recent <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">review</a>, nearly 50% of provider directories contained inaccuracies regarding whether the provider was accepting new patients, practicing at the address listed, or reachable via the listed phone number.&nbsp; <br>  Regulators have attempted to solve these problems by imposing penalties on government-sponsored plans for inaccurate information, but an additional solution may be at hand. A <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">provision</a> embedded in CMS’ interoperability regulations requires government-sponsored health plans to publish machine-readable access to timely directory information by July 2021. In an effort to reduce administrative burdens, a multi-stakeholder collaborative is looking to both improve the quality of physician websites to include this information and to enable health plans to source timely, accurate information from them to comply with the rules. <br>  Similar to the work that was done to make it easier for consumers to find <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">COVID announcements</a> on physician websites, such as testing availability, revised office hours or telemedicine services, this collaborative will work to standardize how to publish structured provider directory information. To further simplify the search experience, providers can now publish their website URL when updating their “digital contact information” on CMS’ <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">NPPES NPI Registry</a>. <br>  Adding structured data from a provider’s website to the portfolio of tools health plans use today – including plan-agnostic reporting tools, “secret shopper” visits, mailings, and a number of emerging data-driven solutions – should result in a reduction in the administrative burden of updating physician directories. Directory maintenance is burdensome. The average practice has over 20 health plan contracts and directories to maintain with over 50% of these updates being conducted via phone or fax. According to a 2019 CAQH (Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare®) <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">report</a>, the average practice spends $1,000 each month for directory maintenance. Yet at the same time, physician practices find value in online marketing as a way to attract new patients, and invest an average of $650 per month to design websites and optimize search results, according to a study by <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">Zocdoc</a>. A web standardization effort will therefore have multiple benefits. It will allow physicians to more efficiently communicate useful information via search engines that can also be used to populate health plan directories and to meet regulatory compliance, thus reducing administrative burdens.&nbsp; <br>  CareJourney, with support from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, seeks to engage public and private sector stakeholders in an effort to accelerate the development and adoption of <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">schema.org</a> web standards for physician information, and to curate a portfolio of tools to structure this information on a practice’s website. Our goal is to improve consumer access to provider information while lowering physician burden. We anticipate the following benefits:&nbsp;<br>  Increased consumer access to high-quality, accurate provider information, such as whether a doctor, practicing at this location, is seeing new patients from my plan.   Consistent webpage documentation and maintenance practices that are sufficient to meet health plan regulatory requirements   Improved search engine results by leveraging the structured website markup&nbsp;  This effort will benefit from the active participation of the healthcare community and we welcome additional participants to play a part in our initiative. Assistance in testing and providing feedback on the proposed web standards will be critical and extremely helpful in further promotion and adoption. Once the resulting open information and markup instructions are freely available, we welcome assistance in the widespread dissemination. Finally, we are grateful the prominent search engines are engaged in a process for site maintenance that ensures physicians keep their websites properly structured at the lowest possible administrative burden. <br>  Thank you, in advance, for your interest in advancing this important work! Please sign up <a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">here</a> to participate!

 Q&amp;A covers election misinformation, content moderation, and&nbsp;COVID-19 Oumou Ly (left) interviews Joan Donovan (right) for The Breakdown from the Berkman Klein&nbsp;Center.<p>The 2020 US election was marked by misinformation and bad actors stemming from domestic&nbsp;sources.</p><p>In this episode of The Breakdown, Oumou Ly, an Assembly staff fellow at the Berkman Klein Center is joined by Joan Donovan, the director of The Technology and Social Change Project (TaSC) at Harvard Kennedy&nbsp;School.</p><p>Read the transcript, which is lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to The Breakdown. My name is Oumou, I’m a fellow on the Assembly: Disinformation Program at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard. Our topic of discussion today continues the discussion of the election. I am joined today and thrilled to be joined today by Joan Donovan, who is the Research Director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. Dr. Donovan leads the field in examining internet and technology studies, online extremism, media manipulation, and disinformation campaigns. Thank you Joan for joining&nbsp;us.</p><p>Joan Donovan (JD): Really excited to talk about this stuff&nbsp;today.</p><p>OL: So our discussion today centers on domestic actors and their goals in purveying disinformation, and we would be remiss if not to mention that at the time it was this recorded, just last night, the president fired Chris Krebs who was the head of CISA at DHS, the agency within the federal government that takes the lead on countering, mitigating and responding to disinformation, particularly as it relates to democratic processes like elections. Joan, what do you sort of make of this late-night firing, this last-minute development?</p><p>JD: If you study disinformation long enough you feel like you’re looking through a crystal ball in some instances. So we all knew it was coming, even Krebs had said so much. And that’s because countering disinformation, it’s a really thankless job, in the sense that it wasn’t just the fact that Krebs had built an agency that over the course of the last few years really had flown under the radar in terms of any kind of partisan divides, had done a lot of work to ensure election security and cared about the question of disinformation, misinformation as it applied to questions about election integrity, right?</p><p>So CISA and Krebs [weren’t] trying to dispel all of the crazy myths and conspiracies out there, but they were doing their part within their remit to make sure that any kind of theory about voter fraud was something that they took seriously and took the time to debunk. And so it wasn’t necessarily just the kinds of tweets that were coming out of CISA, but it was really about this website that they had put together that was really a kind of a low budget version of Snopes in the sense that the website it’s called Rumor Control. And the idea was very simple which was provide [a] very rapid analysis of any conspiracy or allegation of election fraud that was starting to reach a tipping point, not everything, but things that started to get covered in different areas, covered by journalists, and to give people an anchor that says, “This is what we know to be true at this&nbsp;moment.”</p><p>Of course, as the president has come to refute the election results rather forcefully online, Krebs’ role became much more important as a vocal critic with the truth on his side. And over the last few weeks, especially the last week, we’ve seen Trump move anybody out of his way that would either contradict him in public or would seriously imperil his desire to stay in the White&nbsp;House.</p><p>OL: That makes me think of something that I think about a lot recently, particularly over the last four years, but especially in 2020, is this use of disinformation as political strategy by the GOP. It seems like one pillar of that strategy is just [a] want to spread disinformation. The second is to sort of leverage our institutions to legitimize the information that they’re spreading. And the third is just to accelerate truth to get in a matter that’s advantageous to the GOP’s particular political aims. How do you respond to that? And how do you think the information ecosystem should be organizing around that problem? That is, that we have a major political party in the United States for whom this is [a] strategy for&nbsp;them.</p><p>JD: They’re really just leveraging the communication opportunities in our current media ecosystem to get their messaging across. And in this instance when we know where the propaganda is coming from, that is it’s coming from the White House, it’s coming from Giuliani, it’s coming from Bannon, it’s coming from Roger Stone, how then do we reckon with it? Because we actually know what it is. So the concept of white propaganda is really important here because when we know what the source is, we can treat it differently. However, the difference between something like what went down in 2016 and what happened in 2020 is an evolution of these strategies to use some automated techniques in order to increase engagement on certain posts so that more people see them, coupled with serious, serious money and influence in order to make disinformation travel further and&nbsp;faster.</p><p>The third thing about this communication strategy in this moment is that the problem really transcends social media at this point where we do have our more legitimate institutions starting to bow out and say, you know what? We’re not even gonna try to tackle this, where like for us, it’s not even an issue, because we’re not gonna play into allegations that there’s voter fraud, we’re not gonna play into any of these pet theories that have emerged about Hammer and Scorecard and Dominion. And if you’ve heard any of those keywords then you’ve encountered disinformation. But it does go to show that we are immersed in a hyper-partisan media ecosystem where the future of journalism is at stake. The future of social media is at stake. And right now, I’m really worried that the US democracy might not survive this&nbsp;moment.</p><p>OL: I completely agree with you. And that is a really scary thing to think. Can you talk a little bit about sites like Parler, Discord, Telegram, Gab. Just recently after the election, Facebook disbanded a group called Stop the Steal, and then many of those followers found a new home on Parler. The Parler app then went #1 on Apple’s iTunes downloads chart. Why are sites like this so attractive to people who have a history of creating affinity around conspiracy theories?</p><p>JD: So I think about Gab, for instance… me and Brian Friedberg and Becca Lewis <a href="https://mediarep.org/bitstream/handle/doc/13283/Post_Digital_Cultures_49-65_Donovan_ea_Parallel_Ports_.pdf?sequence=3">wrote about Gab </a>post the Unite the Right Rally, because Gab really put a lot of energy into recruiting white supremacists who were being removed from platforms for terms of service violations. And they were basically saying, “we’re the free speech platform. And we don’t care what you say.” And for Gab that went overhead pretty fast, where they did have to start banning white supremacists. Because unfortunately what you get when you make a platform that emphasizes lack of moderation is you get some of the worst kind of pornography you can ever imagine, no style, no grace, nothing sexy about it just — Here’s a bunch of people in diapers, right? Like it’s just not good. And so right now these minor apps that are saying on we’re unmoderated, come one, come all are actually facing a pretty strong content moderation problem where trolls are now showing up pretending to be celebrities. There [are] lots and lots of screenshots out there where people think they heard from some celebrity on one of these apps. And it’s really just a troll with a fake account. But this moment is an opportunity for these apps to grow and they will say and do anything in order to capture that market&nbsp;segment.</p><blockquote>Right now, we’re having a crisis of stability in terms of content moderation policies.</blockquote><p>If we think about infrastructure, as all three things: the technology, the people that bring the technology together including the audiences, and the policies. Right now, we’re having a crisis of stability in terms of content moderation policies. And so people are seeking out other platforms that increase that kind of stability in their messaging because they wanna know why they’re seeing what they’re seeing and they want for those rules to be really&nbsp;clear.</p><p>OL: Picking up on that content moderation thread to talk about larger and sort of more legacy tech platforms more broadly, what is your sense of how well content moderation, and maybe even more specifically labeling efforts, work? We saw Twitter and some of the other platforms to do a pretty, I think, comparatively good job when compared with the past. Slapping labels on the president’s tweets, but that’s because there was an expectation that there would be premature claims of victory. What’s your sense of how well it minimizes virality?</p><p>JD: So we don’t really know or have any data to conclude that the labeling is really doing anything other than aggravating people.</p><p>OL: Yeah.</p><p>JD: Which is to say that, we thought that the labeling was gonna result in massive reduction and virality. In some instances you see influencers taking photos or just screenshots of the labels on their tweets on Twitter, and then you saying like look, it’s happening to me as a kind of badge of honor. But at the same time when done well, they convey the right kind of&nbsp;message.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don’t think any of us anticipated the amount of labels that were gonna be needed on key public figures, right? And so I imagine that okay, they’re gonna do these labels for folks that have over a hundred thousand followers on Twitter, or they’re gonna show up on YouTube and in ways that deal with both the claims of voter fraud, but also the virality. But it’s hard to say if anybody’s clicking through on these labels, I’ve clipped through some of them and the information on the other side of the label is totally irrelevant. That is it’s just not about the tweet or any, it’s not specific&nbsp;enough.</p><p>Which is to say that, in watching the tech hearing this week, Dorsey seem[s] to not really be committed to a content moderation policy that deals with misinformation at scale. And as a result, what you get is these half measures that we don’t really know what their effect is gonna be. And for the partners in the fact-checking world that power partnered with Facebook, they’re now under a delusion of allegations that they’re somehow partisan and they’ve been weaponized in a bunch of different ways. And so I don’t even know what the broad payout is to risk your reputation as a news organization, to do that kind of fact-checking on Facebook, where Facebook isn’t really committed to removing certain kinds of misinformation.</p><p>OL: Joan, why is medical misinformation different than other types of information we see circulating, maybe related to elections or other democratic processes?</p><p>JD: So when we think about medical misinformation, we’re really thinking about well, how quickly are people gonna change their behavior, right? If you hear that coronavirus is in the water, you’re gonna stop drinking water, right? If you hear that it’s in the air, you’re gonna put a mask on. And so the way in which people receive medical advice, really it can stop them on a dime and move them in a different direction. And unfortunately, we’ve entered into this situation where medical advice has been polarized in our hyper-partisan media environments. And there’s been some <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/24/qa-how-pew-research-center-evaluated-americans-trust-in-30-news-sources/">recent studies</a> that can even show the degree to which that polarization is happening that is really leading people to downplay the risks of COVID-19. And this has a lot to do with them encountering misinformation from what they might consider even trusted&nbsp;sources.</p><blockquote>Unfortunately, we’ve entered into this situation where medical advice has been polarized in our hyper-partisan media environments.</blockquote><p>And so when we think about the design of social media in this moment, we actually have to think about a curation strategy for the truth. We need access to information that is timely, local, relevant, and accurate. And if we don’t get that kind of information today, people are going to continue to die, because they don’t understand what the real risk is, they don’t understand, they don’t understand how they can protect themselves. And especially as we enter into this holiday season, where a lot of people are starting to relax their vigilance and are hoping that it won’t happen to them, that’s the exact moment where we need to crank up the health messaging and make sure that people understand the risks and have seen some form of true and correct information about COVID-19. Because I’ll tell you right now if you go on social media and you start poking around, sure there’s a couple of interstitials, or there’s a couple of banners here and there, but we can do a lot better to make sure that people know what COVID-19 is, what the symptoms are, how do you get tested, how to keep yourself safe and how to keep your loved ones safe as&nbsp;well.</p><p>OL: I’m just curious what are the sorts of data points you’ve seen that would explain why some people don’t necessarily believe information from authoritative sources about the spread of COVID-19. Why are some people inclined not to believe that authoritative information?</p><p>JD: It’s a good question. And part of it has to do with the echo chambers that they’ve been getting information in for years. We’ve started to see certain Facebook groups, that maybe it’s a local Facebook group and you’ve been in it a long time and is about exchanging like of the free list, exchanging things in your neighborhood. And then people slowly start to talk about these really important issues. And misinformation is introduced through a blog post or an article. Or I saw this on the quote-unquote news, and you find out that they’ve been watching one of these hyper-partisan news sources that [are] downplaying what’s happening. And so you kind of see it in the ephemera, but our journal, the <a href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/">Harvard Kennedy Misinfo Review</a>, we’ve published research around even within the right-wing media ecosystem, the degree to which someone watches a lot of, let’s say Hannity versus Tucker, they’re gonna have different associations with the risk of COVID-19, because it’s covered differently these folks that are at the same outlet. And so it’s really important to understand that this has to do with the communication environment that is designed and the fact that people are really trying when they’re sharing things that are novel, or outrageous or things that might be medically incorrect. They’re doing it in some cases out of love. They’re doing it just in case, and maybe you didn’t see this. And it’s an unfortunate situation that we’ve gotten ourselves into, where the more outrageous the conspiracy theory, the more outlandish the claim, the more viral it tends to be. And that’s an unfortunate consequence of the design of these&nbsp;systems.</p><p>OL: Thank you so much for joining me today Joan, I really enjoyed our conversation.</p><p>JD: That’s great, thank you so much. I really appreciate you doing these&nbsp;series.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-joan-donovan-on-domestic-misinformation-da4f60296420">The Breakdown: Joan Donovan on domestic misinformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>As a data sharing service, XDI is intended to be very simple and generalized, so it can be bound to any transport protocol offering basic primitives like HTTP or SMTP. Similarly, the XDI graph model is intended to be very simple and generalized, so it can carry data directly (serialized in XML, JSON, or other formats) or reference it externally (much as XML or HTML documents can carry content directly or reference it externally). Such a “lingua franca” for data interchange can solve many problems related to mapping and sharing of data and metadata across domains, directories, schemas, ontologies, applications, and languages (both human and machine).</p>

      <p>Though the potential uses of XDI are very broad, the scope of the OASIS XDI TC work is limited to defining the specifications required for it to interoperate successfully. This includes:</p>

       
         Defining the XDI graph model for describing and linking XRI-identified resources and data. 
         Defining concrete serialization formats for this graph model. 
         Defining rules for XRI addressing of XDI documents and the graphs they contain independent of serialization format. 
         Defining an abstract XDI API consisting of logical operations on the XDI graph. 
         Defining bindings of this abstract API to concrete transport protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, SIP, and XMPP, and to invocation protocols such as SOAP, REST, and RMI. 
         Defining the semantics of XDI dictionaries — self-describing ontologies for use in XDI data sharing. 
         Defining the semantics of XDI link contracts — XDI documents used to govern the terms of XDI data sharing relationships. 
         Defining the semantics of other types of XDI graphs that fulfill general interoperability requirements of XDI infrastructure, e.g., context discovery, versioning, queries, etc. 
         Maintaining additional versions of these specifications as they evolve over time.

   <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xdi/faq.php">OASIS XRI Data Interchange (XDI) TC - FAQ</a>
    <blockquote>
       
         What is XDI?<br>
Specifically, XDI consists of three parts:
           
             The XDI Meta-Schema-a very simple XML schema that uses XRIs (Extensible Resource Identifiers) developed by the OASIS XRI TC to describe and link data that may be in many other native formats, including other XML schemas. 
             XDI Service: a WSDL-defined protocol for exchanging data and metadata using XDI documents, together with bindings to different transport protocols (HTTP, SOAP, SMTP/MIME, etc.) 
             The XDI Service Dictionary: a set of pre-defined XDI resources for describing other XDI resources and controlling XDI data interchange using XDI link contracts (see below). 
           
         
         Is XDI a Web service?<br>
XDI over SOAP is a Web service. However XDI can also be bound to HTTP for use in “RESTful” architectures, as well as to other transport protocols like SMTP/MIME. So strictly speaking XDI is a generalized service based on XML document exchange that can be implemented as a Web service. 
         What are the primary problems XDI is intended to solve?<br>
The general problem XDI is designed to address is interoperable, automated data interchange across distributed applications and trust domains. There are many specific examples of this problem:
           
             Exchange, linking, and lifetime synchronization of electronic business cards, public keys, and other common identity attributes across distributed directories (commonly known as dynamic address books).* 
             Internet calendar sharing.* 
             Trusted search (searches that need to cross multiple private websites).* 
             Auto-configuration and intelligent data synchronization across multiple user devices (desktop, laptop, PDA, land phone, cell phone, etc.) 
             Automated website registration, form-fill, and e-commerce transactions.
 Cross-domain security and privacy management. 
           
         
         What is the Dataweb?<br>
The inspiration for XDI was the application of the architectural principles of the Web and XML to the problem of distributed data sharing. The result is called the Dataweb, as summarized in the table below: 
       

      
        
          
            Principle
            World Wide Web
            Dataweb
          
        
        
          
            100% addressable resources
            URIs
            XRIs
          
          
            Common representation and linking language
            HTML
            XDI Meta-Schema &amp; XDI Service Dictionary
          
          
            Common interchange protocol
            HTTP
            XDI/HTTP, XDI/SOAP
          
          
            Logical organization and navigation of resources
            Website
            Dataweb site
          
        
      

      <p>In essence, the XDI meta-schema and protocol is to sharing and linking machine-readable data what HTML and HTTP are to sharing and linking human-readable content. In particular, Dataweb links are can define and control two-ways data sharing “pipes” between dataweb sites that can actively synchronize shared data when it changes, as illustrated below.</p>
       
         Why is existing URI syntax not sufficient for cross-domain data sharing? 
       

      <p>While URIs in general, and HTTP URIs (commonly called URLs) in particular, have been spectacularly successful for building the Web, they are missing several features that are vital for cross-domain data sharing:</p>

       
         HTTP URIs do not provide absolute addressability of data instances down to any level of containment or nesting-they work only to the page or page fragment level. While XPath provides additional addressing features for XML documents, it operates only relative to XML document roots and is not integrated with HTTP URI syntax. 
         HTTP URIs do not provide support for persistent addresses (the Dataweb equivalent of global foreign keys in databases). Other persistent URI schemes have been created, most notably the URN scheme, however they are not integrated with HTTP URI syntax and have not gained widespread adoption. 
         HTTP URIs do not provide addressability of resources across contexts, i.e., the ability to share identifiers across multiple websites in order to identify the same logical resource in multiple domains or physical locations. This is extremely useful for cross-domain data sharing.

    <blockquote>
      <p>XDI (XRI Data Interchange) is a new service for generalized distributed data sharing and mediation usingXRIs (Extensible Resource Identifiers), a URI-compatible abstract identifier scheme developed by the OASIS XRI Technical Committee. The goal of XDI is to enable data from any data source to be identified, exchanged, linked, and synchronized into a machine-readable dataweb using XML documents just as content from any content source can linked into the human-readable Web using HTML documents today. Because the controls needed to mediate access and usage of shared data can be built right into every XDI link, the emergence of a global Dataweb has the potential to do for trusted data interchange what the Web did for open content exchange.</p>

      <p>This white paper presents several examples of classic cross-domain data sharing problems, explains how the Dataweb model can provide a generalized solution, and describes the key objectives of the newlyformed OASIS XDI Technical Committee (<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xdi">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xdi</a>).</p>

  The purpose of this TC is to define a syntax for abstract structured identifiers -- identifiers that can be used within other URI schemes (such as http: and https: URIs) to share semantics across any number of domains and applications. The TC is also defining a simple XML descriptor format and HTTP(S) protocol for uniform resource metadata discovery.

         XRIs provide a standard means of protecting privacy by revealing the least possible information in an identifier and allowing an authority to control further access.

    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xdi/faq.php">XDI FAQ</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>What features do XRIs have that URIs don’t?</p>
       
         XRIs are “location-independent” - the content of an XRI is decoupled from the network location of any data or services associated with the XRI. This means, among other things, that accessing a resource associated with an XRI isn’t limited to a particular network location or protocol. (Most URI schemes in wide use today use identifiers that imply a close association to a network location or protocol.) 
         XRIs can assert persistence of all or parts of an identifier. XRIs allow two types of separators (persistent and reassignable) between segments of an XRI, so the XRI can suggest that certain parts of the identifier are intended to be long-lived “primary keys” (a concept borrowed from database technology) and others are subject to change. Most URI schemes, on the other hand, are all-or-nothing. With URNs, for example, the entire identifier is persistent. With HTTP URIs, the entire identifier is potentially transient. The XRI scheme allows both characteristics to be combined in one federated identifier. 
         XRIs provide the ability to “contain” other URIs or XRIs in the form of cross-references. Conceptually this is similar to using quote marks in English to talk about someone else’s text. Cross references allow a well-defined URI or XRI to identify not only a concept or resource, but also to identify that concept or resource relative to another concept or resource. For example, a URI could identify a book, and an XRI could then identify a particular library’s copies of the book by using that URI in a cross-reference appended to the library’s XRI. So if “ urn:isbn:0-131-10362-8” represents The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Ritchie, and “xri:@SeattlePublicLibrary” represents the Seattle Public Library, then “xri:@SeattlePublicLibrary/(urn:isbn:0-131-10362-8) “ represents The C Programming Language in the context of the Seattle Public Library. 
         XRIs also support self-references, a special form of cross-reference that indicates that an XRI is not intended to be resolved on the network but is intended solely as a unique identifier. For example, “xri:(@SeattlePublicLibrary/(urn:isbn:0-131-10362-8))” is a self-reference because it is entirely enclosed by parentheses, and as such represents the identifier itself. 
         XRIs allow unlimited delegation of namespaces. While many URI schemes rely on DNS delegation, XRIs also have the ability to use abstract (non-DNS) names or identifiers that can contain a wider set of characters and strings. The XRI specification includes several global context symbols for this purpose (e.g., the “@” in “xri:@example/foo” represents a standard global namespace for organizations). In addition, a cross-reference can also serve as a namespace root, thus creating a private or community-based identifier space whose management is entirely community defined (for example, “xri:(http://www.example.com)/foo”). 
         XRIs are fully internationalized. XRI syntax builds on the W3C IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier) specifications that adapt URIs to the Unicode character set.

   <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/5109/xri-syntax-resolution-1.0-cd.pdf">Extensible Resource Identifier (XRI) Syntax V2.0</a> - Committee Specification, 14 November 2005
    <blockquote>
      <p>Extensible Resource Identifiers (XRIs) provide a standard means of abstractly identifying a resource independent of any particular concrete representation of that resource—or, in the case of a completely abstract resource, of any representation at all.</p>

      <p>As shown in Figure 1, XRIs build on the foundation established by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) and IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) as defined by [URI] and [IRI], respectively.<br>
<br>
The IRI specification created a new identifier by extending the unreserved character set to include characters beyond those allowed in generic URIs. It also defined rules for transforming this identifier into a syntactically legal URI. Similarly, this specification creates a new identifier, an XRI, that extends the syntactic elements (but not the character set) allowed in IRIs. To accommodate applications that expect IRIs or URIs, this specification also defines rules for transforming an XRI reference into a valid IRI or URI reference.</p>

   <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/11854/xri-metadata-V2.0-cd-01.pdf">Extensible Resource Identifier (XRI) Metadata V2.0</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[XRISyntax] establishes five global context symbol (GCS) characters that may be used to begin an XRI authority segment for the purpose of expressing the abstract global context of an identifier. One of these GCS characters, “$”, is reserved for identifiers for which the authority is a standards specification.</p>

      <p>A second key XRI feature, cross-references (see section 2.2.2 of [XRISyntax]), allows XRIs to be embedded within other XRIs in order to share identifiers across contexts. This syntactic feature allows XRIs in the $ namespace to be used as metadata to describe an XRI itself. For example, the following XRI includes a cross-reference with version metadata.</p>
         <code>xri://@example*resource*($v/3)
                        \----/ cross-reference with XRI metadata
</code>         
      <p>The purpose of this specification is to define a set of XRIs in the $ namespace that function as identifier metadata—attributes that may be used describe an identifier itself, as opposed to attributes of the resource it identifies. This specification defines four such types of identifier metadata:</p>
       
         Language metadata that specifies the human language in which an identifier is intended to be interpreted. 
         Date/time metadata that specifies the point in time an identifier was established. 
         Version metadata that specifies the identifier’s position in a sequence of identifiers for the same logical resource. 
         Annotation metadata that allows XRI producers to add annotations to XRIs or XRI segments.
The definition of each metadata type also specifies comparison rules, significance in resolution, and any other special processing rules specific to that type.

    <blockquote>
      <p>Extensible Resource Identifier (XRI) provides a uniform syntax for abstract structured identifiers as defined in [XRISyntax]. Because XRIs may be used across a wide variety of communities and applications (as Web addresses, database keys, filenames, object IDs, XML IDs, tags, etc.), no single resolution mechanism may prove appropriate for all XRIs. However, in the interest of promoting interoperability, this specification defines a simple generic resource description format called XRDS (Extensible Resource Descriptor Sequence), a standard protocol for requesting XRDS documents using HTTP(S) URIs, and standard protocol for resolving XRIs using XRDS documents and HTTP(S) URIs. Both generic and trusted versions of the XRI resolution protocol are defined (the latter using HTTPS [RFC2818] and/or signed SAML assertions [SAML]). In addition, an HTTP(S) proxy resolution service is specified both to provide network-based resolution services and for backwards compatibility with existing HTTP(S) infrastructure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The EIP process has led to a rich diverse engagement of developers in improving Ethereum - this decentralized ability of all to contribute ideas and features is a benefit to the ecosystem. This process has also led to EIPs of varying specificity, application, and quality, which presents a challenge to developers and organizations looking to adopt the most interoperable standards.</p>

  <p>The Ethereum OASIS Open Project seeks to address this problem and improve the interoperability of implementations for all. Working within a process that is predictable, fair, transparent, and time-tested, the Ethereum OASIS Project will provide a forum for producing standards in a style familiar to corporate contributors. Additionally, we wish for an Ethereum standard to be able to be blessed as more canonical among the sometimes mutually-exclusive EIPs. Finally, we also wish to ease the transition of technology and standards from Mainnet to private and/or permissioned chains such as those from the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.</p>

      <p>The Baseline Protocol is an open-source initiative aimed at the synchronization of private business processes, like document exchange, via a public blockchain. It leverages cryptography techniques like zero-knowledge proofs and signatures, peer-to-peer messaging protocols, and the blockchain to achieve its goals.</p>

      <p>On one hand, it is designed with confidentiality, privacy, and data security in mind. The mixture of technologies is aligned in such a way that none of your sensitive data is leaked. This data stays safely with you and your counter-parties. Outsiders looking in will not know what process is being executed, who are the actors, or what goods are exchanged.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, the protocol is designed with complex interactions in mind. Inter-company business processes involve many stops and checks and are never straightforward. The protocol will allow you to describe and accommodate your business process however complex it is.</p>

      <p>The procurement use case in the demo released today highlights how two Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, Microsoft Dynamics and SAP can maintain consistency with each other using blockchain technology without exposing information about business activities or relationships to competitors or the public. Its use of the public Mainnet reduces capital expense while increasing operational integrity when automating business processes across multiple companies.<br>
[…]<br>
Several companies worked together to create the demo. Unibright extracted the domain model from the Unibright connector, set up a connection proxy to the Provide/Baseline stack and integrated SAP. Provide adapted the Baseline Protocol as a standard within the Provide stack, including its secure messaging infrastructure service. This was critical as it enabled orchestration of the baseline containers and management of key material. Envision Blockchain configured and integrated the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain Management business apps.</p>

      <p>Businesses spend hundreds of millions of dollars on ERP, CRM, and other internal systems of record. Failure to properly synchronize these systems between organizations causes disputes, lost inventory, inflated capital costs, regulatory actions, and other value leakages. To avoid these problems, systems need a common frame of reference, an integration layer that typically only the largest partnerships can afford. The baseline approach uses the public Ethereum Mainnet as its common frame of reference, which means it’s always on, companies can’t be locked out, and firms only pay for what they use.</p>

<p>Information about the Candidate OASIS Standard and the KMIP TC</p>



<p>The Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) is a single, comprehensive protocol for communication between clients that request any of a wide range of encryption keys and servers that store and manage those keys. By replacing redundant, incompatible key management protocols, KMIP provides better data security while at the same time reducing expenditures on multiple products.</p>



<p>The KMIP Specification v2.1 is intended for developers and architects who wish to design systems and applications that interoperate using the Key Management Interoperability Protocol Specification. Note that Committee Specification 02 was produced to correct non-material changes discovered during the 60-day public review. This was done in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 2.8.2 of the TC Process (<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#OSpublicRev">https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#OSpublicRev</a>).</p>



<p>KMIP Profiles v2.1 specifies conformance clauses that define the use of objects, attributes, operations, message elements and authentication methods within specific contexts of KMIP server and client interaction.</p>



<p>The TC received 3 Statements of Use from Cryptsoft, Utimaco, and PrimeKey [6].</p>

 <p></p>
<p>What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning?</p> 
<p>I am the Director of Partnerships at Simprints, a non-profit technology company with the mission to radically increase transparency and effectiveness in global development, making sure that every vaccine, every dollar, every public good reaches the people who need them most. Practically, I lead a passionate and determined team to develop partnerships with a variety of other stakeholders within the international development space — iNGOs, technical providers, governments, etc.</p>
<p>What gets me out of bed in the morning (besides a strong cup of coffee)?</p>
<p>It’s seeing our sector throw millions of dollars into programs that simply do not reach the people they’re intended for. It may be that some of these programs are&nbsp; reaching beneficiaries and we just don’t know it but there is a data discrepancy of up to 50% in vaccination programmes. That means that we just don’t know whether or not 50% of beneficiaries received the intended services. Without real-time, accurate data linked to an individual, it’s like we’re fighting poverty and disease blindfolded. I must admit that makes me really angry </p>
<p>Simprints looks to address the “accuracy” piece by deploying biometrics to create unique IDs for each beneficiary. Our sense of purpose is really strong and the people that I get to interact with on a daily basis are an awesome, committed, smart, capable, passionate team.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I kind of stumbled my way into it!&nbsp; In my previous life I was a crisis counsellor, working with folks who were often at their most desperate – survivors of assault and trauma, people suffering with addiction or those feeling suicidal. I worked across a number of countries (Zambia, South Africa, the U.S., China) and the impact was incredibly tangible. I really loved it and sometimes I do miss the day to day buzz of that work. But I felt we were always just reacting to some of the world’s larger more systemic issues. I wanted to get involved in driving forward change that will make a real difference for the future.</p>
<p>So, I decided to shift towards the global health and international development sectors. &nbsp;The main reason we are in this space is to create greater transparency and trust around the whole issue of identity and biometrics.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>This is going to sound a real cliche but, honestly, it was to trust myself. I know I won’t get things right all of the time but being able to cut through the noise and listen to myself was a huge learning curve for me. I noticed that the more I did it, the better results I had. Even if I was still wrong, at least I could own it as my own decision instead of something that was decided for me by others</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>There are 1.1 billion people in this world that lack a formal identity. When you are working on developing identity solutions for the masses, don’t forget about those folks! There is a massive gap in the amount of data being used to underpin programmes. This can lead to complacency and an acceptance that data – and therefore resources – will be misused. We have to stop this NOW!</p>
<p>If you continue to focus on narrow proprietary solutions, we will never get a truly holistic view of the individual. And when you are talking about healthcare programmes, this can lead to life-threatening situations. For instance, a midwife working in Dhaka’s Beguntila needs a single view of her patient, complete with medical histories. Often the Mother won’t have a formal ID, date of birth or other identifier so ensuring the correct interventions are given is incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>We need interoperability across the identity sector. At the end of the day all of the work we are doing will need to intersect so anything we can do as a global community to start that work now will be key! Your people have the talent, the passion and the ideas – make sure you use ALL of them and encourage knowledge sharing appropriately.</p>
 Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Achieving global impact is never the outcome of one individual. It is achieved by having a strong collective – one that it is diverse in background, ethnicity, opinion, education, gender, sexuality, ability …. We work closely with Community Health workers on the ground because they bring knowledge and experiences that feed straight into our product development.</p>
 What book or film would you recommend to your fellow members and why? 
<p>IMy choices all lay out (in a very readable, story-like way) the incredible histories / backgrounds of some of the most effective and ground-breaking global development interventions of our time.</p>
<p>Whatever It Takes by Paul Tough (an in depth look at the inspiration behind the Harlem Children’s Zone in the U.S.)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Mountains Beyond Mountains by Tracy Kidder (biography of Paul Farmer who is a founder of Partners In Health), and Banker To The Poor by Muhammad Yunus (story of how he started Grameen Bank).</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>You’re going to be just fine. Keep doing what you do and stop worrying so much about what others think.”</p>

 Outlining three essential narratives in the political history of the&nbsp;Internet <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/pdefilippi">Primavera De Filippi</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jortizfreuler">Juan Ortiz Freuler</a>, and <a href="http://www.joshuatan.com/research/">Joshua&nbsp;Tan</a></p><p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large portion of social interactions have moved online. While our interactions in the physical world are affected by national lockdowns and social distancing rules, our interactions in the digital space are increasingly affected by online operators and algorithmic gatekeepers. Proposals such as the <a href="https://contractfortheweb.org/">Contract for the Web</a> can help us navigate through some of the current challenges, yet new narratives might be needed to navigate the uncharted waters&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>A declaration is a political act, which describes what should be done. A narrative is a political tool, which elaborates on why it should be done. We sketch here three essential narratives in the political history of the Internet: the libertarian narrative, the corporate narrative, and the nationalist narrative. Each narrative emerged from a community of shared interests; each calls for a set of institutional arrangements; each endures in today’s politics. And each has something to teach us as we build new narratives to shape the future of the Internet.</p> The libertarian narrative: cyberspace as an independent space <p>In 1996, John Perry Barlow, poet of the Grateful Dead and founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, drafted <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a>: “Governments of the Corporate World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we&nbsp;gather.”</p><p>Indeed, the early Internet relied on a <a href="https://www.smallpieces.com/">loosely-networked system</a> of small, private servers which was relatively free from regulatory interference. From its inception in 1989 to the year of Barlow’s declaration, this system had evolved into a global infrastructure connected through a series of open and standardized protocols — one where everyone with sufficient technical knowledge and means could deploy a server without seeking permission from anyone. But the relative absence of regulation <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/works/lessig/laws_cyberspace.pdf">does not imply</a> the impossibility of regulation. Things changed rapidly as governments and corporations began to see the potential of this global network, leading subsequent critics to point out that Barlow’s claims about state sovereignty (“You have no sovereignty where we gather”) were inaccurate or, at best, <a href="https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/march-april-2006-can-we-know-everything/jp-barlow-cyberspace-still-anti">wishful thinking</a>.</p><p>Still, declarations are judged not by the facts they assert but by the myths they create. Barlow’s Declaration articulated a vision of the Internet as a libertarian space, free from any form of regulatory control. It spoke to the highly meritocratic, get-stuff-done ethos of early Internet pioneers — to whom the Declaration was originally addressed — while glossing over the pivotal role of governments in funding and regulating the underlying infrastructure of the Internet. It told a story that was both fearless and optimistic, and in so doing rallied a movement of digital activists who would stand up and fight to preserve their newfound digital freedoms. Such a libertarian narrative was, however, not the only narrative that emerged in the early years of the Internet.</p> The corporate narrative: access through advertising <p>The first clickable web ad <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/10/1027hotwired-banner-ads/">was served in 1994</a> by an online publication then known as HotWired. By clicking on a banner, users would be taken to the <a href="http://thefirstbannerad.com/youdid.html">landing page</a> of AT&amp;T’s “You Will” ad campaign. For the first time, websites and advertisers could see not only the number of banner impressions on a website but also the number of click-throughs.</p>The first banner ad, served by HotWired.com (later Wired.com), for an AT&amp;T ad&nbsp;campaign<p>The two-sided, advertisement-based business model first tested at HotWired eventually gave rise to the Internet as we know it today: one where we can search through Google, watch YouTube, and catch up with friends on Facebook — all for “free”. Ad revenues funded the Web’s growth, spurring and sustaining a swath of online services that we now regard as essential services on the&nbsp;Web.</p><p>This ad-based business model engendered a powerful new narrative for the corporate Web. To its proponents, web advertising was a positive force: it massively expanded access to Internet services; sustained independent projects and websites across the Internet; and matched relevant ads to those who would benefit from them the most. In a way, those with purchasing power were subsidizing access to those who had&nbsp;none.</p><p>To this day, many people maintain a positive view of the role that Internet giants like Google (“don’t be evil”) and Facebook (“move fast and break things”) played in the development of the Internet. To its detractors, the ad-based business model was the economic basis for a new and extractive system of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook">surveillance capitalism</a> and <a href="https://autonomy.work/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Avila.pdf">digital</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1527476418796632">coloni</a><a href="https://sur.conectas.org/en/digital-sovereignty-or-digital-colonialism/">alism</a> very different from the open and permissionless web promised in the libertarian narrative. Yet, to those complaining about the commodification of personal data and the commercialisation of Internet content, the proponents of this corporate narrative would respond that, while companies like Google, Facebook or Twitter could have funded their online services by directly charging users, how many people would have been able and willing to pay for that service? Would the Web have been more “open” and “free” had it been sectioned off into siloed paywalls in its early&nbsp;years?</p><p>All political narratives have an institutional agenda, in the form of a set of business models, governance systems, or ways of life. The corporate narrative emerged to defend a set of institutional arrangements that serve the interests of a specific set of social, commercial, and political actors. But once it is articulated, the same narrative can be deployed for a range of different uses and interests. For example, the narrative of access through advertising has been used to defend everything from zero rating programs such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/27/16050446/facebook-net-neutrality-digital-colonialism-internet-org">Facebook’s Free Basics</a> to the rise of <a href="https://medium.com/mediarithmics-what-is/what-is-a-walled-garden-and-why-it-is-the-strategy-of-google-facebook-and-amazon-ads-platform-296ddeb784b1">walled gardens</a> in the Web 2.0. And those who benefit from a given institutional arrangement will often change over time — witness, for example, the way in which advertising has shifted away from the operators of discrete websites to a new class of algorithmic intermediaries that manage large inventories of online ad&nbsp;space.</p>Sketch of where narratives stand across key dimensions<p>Narratives can also be used to narrow or redirect the debate away from a particular set of issues. Just as the libertarian narrative obscured the legal and regulatory arrangements that enabled the early Internet to emerge, so the corporate narrative deliberately introduces a dichotomy between advertising-based business models and pay-for-access solutions. Yet, this vision reflects a limited perspective of the institutional alternatives available to us. We delineate below a set of different narratives that might help overcome this dichotomy.</p> The nationalist narrative: national hegemony and&nbsp;control <p>As governments began to see the Internet as a critical infrastructure for economic development, political stability and national security, a new narrative has emerged, focused on national sovereignty and control. China’s Great Firewall is probably the most popular example of this emerging narrative, but it is certainly not the only one. In the past few months, several governments have intervened, regulating access to the Internet, framed as an attempt to protect their national sovereignty — sometimes even going as far as disconnecting from the global network (or at least threatening to do so, perhaps as an attempt to increase their negotiating power). For instance, the U.S. recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/github-ban-sanctioned-countries/">required GitHub to block access to its platform in Iran</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20904030/adobe-venezuela-photoshop-behance-us-sanctions">Adobe to refuse access to the Venezuelan government</a>. At the same time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/26/russia-starts-testing-its-own-internal-internet/">Russia has taken steps to create a national intranet</a>, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/china-moves-to-ban-foreign-software-and-hardware-from-state-offices/">Chinese government started banning foreign software and hardware in government offices</a>, and the Trump administration <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/tiktok-trump-and-need-digital-non-aligned-movement/">is advocating for a “Clean Network” agenda, aimed at excluding Chinese software and hardware</a> from the U.S. territory, and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>This type of fragmentation is not particular to the digital space; nor can it be encapsulated in a left-right wing dichotomy. It is present in the Brexit and the “America First” narratives, in the growth of blocks like <a href="https://cyberbrics.info/">BRICS</a>, in the nationalistic speeches of India’s Modi, in the xenophobic waves in Europe and elsewhere, and in the closing of borders all over the world in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also present in more progressive approaches advocating for national or regional autonomy: calls to resist the technological, industrial, cultural and agro-economic dependency to the currently dominant nation-states and corporate actors.</p>Comparing different narratives The need for a new narrative? <p>These three established narratives did not properly address a wide variety of grievances that emerged over the years, as more and more of our social interactions became online interactions. People disenchanted with the state of the Internet coalesced into smaller camps to address the grievances which remained unattended and unresolved.</p><p>These include a multiplicity of groups, with different objectives in mind: those who advocate for the need to further the development of the Internet as a <a href="https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/">decentralized global network</a>; those who condemn the growing influence of governments <a href="https://logicmag.io/bodies/another-network-is-possible/">and consolidated corporate actors</a> as a form of <a href="https://autonomy.work/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Avila.pdf">digital</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1527476418796632">coloni</a><a href="https://sur.conectas.org/en/digital-sovereignty-or-digital-colonialism/">alism</a> or extractive surveillance capitalism; those who defend the <a href="https://colorofchange.org/">rights of minorities</a>, women and systematically excluded groups, and those who criticize the current Internet landscape as enabling the propagation of hate. While most of these communities would benefit from uniting their forces in a shared front, they have so far failed to coordinate their actions — thereby reducing their ability to ensure that their respective interests and values are effectively catered&nbsp;to.</p><p>In contrast, the libertarian, corporate, and nationalist narratives enjoyed tight coordination towards the propagation, consolidation, and attainment of the goals set out by their respective interests. The libertarian narrative was born within the circles of like-minded technologists often in a position of power, and whose coordination was driven by a shared ideology. The corporate narrative emerged from an increasingly-consolidated set of corporate actors who could easily coordinate their lobbying strategies in favor of their shared vested interests. Lastly, the nationalist narrative benefited from an existing bureaucracy that was already well-trained in elaborating and propagating well-articulated narratives to a population that often perceived them as natural extensions of their pre-existing nationalist values.</p><p>The other groups were left with a multiplicity of grievances that were more difficult to articulate into a cohesive set of actions or a concrete institutional proposal. The lack of a shared narrative contributed to this failure of collective action. While the power imbalances that exist between these dispersed groups and the more coordinated actors backing up the other three narratives could be seen as a potential source of this coordination failure, another limiting factor in achieving proper coordination is the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2687120">wide discrepancy</a> of rights and values brought forward by these disparate groups. The problem with this framing is that it further underlines the differences that keep these groups apart, rather than focusing on what they all have in common. For example, women fighting against hate and discrimination, decentralization advocates pushing for more openness and interoperability, and global south activists requesting a seat at the table in global policy discussions all share a common objective: more equality and a level playing&nbsp;field.</p><p>With the evolution of the Internet from a voluntary network of private actors mostly located in the developed West, to a global commons available to the public at large, it has become more and more important to discuss whether we can develop <a href="https://twitter.com/nielstenoever/status/1243960008259391488">a public network on privately-owned infrastructure</a>. In its early days, the Internet was regarded as a “public” infrastructure because of its permissionless nature. The Web was neither owned nor controlled by any single individual or entity; it functioned through collective adherence to a common set of protocols and standards. Later, as Internet adoption burgeoned during the 1990s (jumping from 1% adoption in the US to almost 50% by 1999) and as the Internet became home to a wide range of private, commercial, and governmental online services, “public interest” considerations emerged, especially with regard to accessibility, free speech, privacy and security. By 1999 — with the publication of <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2687120">what is now regarded as the first</a> <a href="http://www.pccharter.net/charteren.html">“bill of digital rights”</a> — cyberspace had already started to pick up the qualities of a public square, inspiring new analogies such as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/to-mend-a-broken-internet-create-online-parks/">digital public parks</a> and <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/the-case-for-digital-public-infrastructure">digital public infrastructure</a>.</p><p>Despite their different orientations, these unattended grievances marked the emergence of a wide variety of proposals, manifestos, contracts and constitutions for the Internet, which all share one common observation: as the Internet has become a public space, rights must be safeguarded on cyberspace at least as much as they are in the physical space. Yet, the argument goes, current arrangements have failed at providing substantially just and procedurally legitimate solutions.</p><p>The multistakeholder model of Internet governance promoted through <a href="https://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a>, the United Nations <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/">Internet Governance Forum</a>, and the <a href="https://www.wipo.int/ip-development/en/agenda/recommendations.html">WIPO Development Agenda </a>has been presented as an attempt to mediate the grievances of these different groups. Yet, this specific approach to Internet governance has been subject to criticism due to the growing perception that it has fallen under corporate capture. The multistakeholder model — allegedly designed to serve the public interest — is being condemned as a <a href="https://www.tni.org/en/publication/multi-stakeholderism-a-corporate-push-for-a-new-form-of-global-governance">guise for watering down the legitimate role of governments</a> in the pursuit of a neoliberal ideology or corporate interest, or as a means of <a href="http://twentyseven.fibreculturejournal.org/2016/03/08/fcj-198-new-international-information-order-niio-revisited-global-algorithmic-governance-and-neocolonialism/">forwarding the compound interests of a small set of corporate and state actors from the&nbsp;north</a>.</p><p>The ingredients for an effective shift in the way the Internet operates are already there. The current sources of discontent are varied in nature, yet they are not necessarily distinct. If the strategy of consolidated power is to keep critics divided, it is all the more crucial to underline the commonalities that subsist underneath these different struggles. The goal is to form a united front that actually leverages these different narratives, bringing a multiplicity of actors (including software engineers, activists, legal experts and policy-makers) together around a stronger consolidated narrative. We need a narrative that can accommodate all these grievances into a cohesive and coherent story, enabling proactive cooperation across these groups. We need to bridge the gaps between these separate narratives, even if that requires acknowledging that we all speak different languages, and that we are all looking at a similar problem, from distinctly situated perspectives.</p>A sketch of alternative narratives Declarations, new and&nbsp;old <p>As we navigate new governance challenges, these narratives — new and old — are already being used to mobilize collective action and rally political will. Understanding these narratives can help us write better manifestos. But seeing these narratives side-by-side can also help us understand the interplay and interdependence that subsists between these narratives: for example, the degree to which the corporate narrative is an outgrowth of the libertarian one, the extent to which the nationalist narrative feeds on the perceived failures of the former two, and the conflict or overlap between different variations of the blockchain and dweb narratives. Understanding these patterns in political storytelling can help us identify those liminal gaps between narratives where new narratives, new politics, and new declarations might&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>Acknowledgements: this document grew out of discussions at the “<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iD_d8qovuZcXdxH1RX_3Sjw9YHMtVgmOVsgl_hLOl34">Building blocks of Web 3.0</a>” workshop held at Harvard Law School in the spring of 2020.

    <blockquote>
      <p>A decentralized identifier (DID) is a pseudo-anonymous identifier for a person, company, object, etc. Each DID is secured by a private key. Only the private key owner can prove that they own or control their identity. One person can have many DIDs, which limits the extent to which they can be tracked across the multiple activities in their life. For example, a person could have one DID associated with a gaming platform, and another, entirely separate DID associated with their credit reporting platform.</p>

      <p>Each DID is often associated with a series of attestations (verifiable credentials) issued by other DIDs, that attest to specific characteristics of that DID (e.g., location, age, diplomas, payslips). These credentials are cryptographically signed by their issuers, which allows DID owners to store these credentials themselves instead of relying on a single profile provider (e.g., Google, Facebook). In addition, non-attested data such as browsing histories or social media posts can also be associated to DIDs by the owner or controllers of that data depending on context and intended use.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>If an identity is tied to a single persistent private key, then loss or compromise of the private key will mean total loss of the identity. Since key compromise and/or loss do happen there needs to be a way to recover from this in order to have a persistent digital identity. <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/shared_terminology_for_digital_identity_systems.md">See here for definitions used</a>.</p>

      <p>If the user of the identity suspects that a key is or may be compromised the user can rotate their key by submitting a new key to the system, signed by the old key. After this the old key can be revoked.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A blockchain can provide a good foundation for a PKI since it acts as a distributed well-publicized ledger whose integrity can be validated through the proof-of-work mechanism. A blockchain with a fully featured virtual machine such as Ethereum (with its Ethereum VM or EVM) or the recent Bitcoin sidechain project Rootstock (also EVM-based) provides a rich scripting language with which to build tools that can be used in a PKI.</p>

      <p>A blockchain with such a virtual machine allows the user to send transactions creating blockchain-native programs, sometimes called “smart contracts” or simply “contracts”. These programs have an associated address and expose API functions which can be called by sending a transaction to the address with a data message containing the signature of the function along with its parameters. The programs are run by miners and they have associated storage and/or funds (Ether in the case of the Ethereum blockchain) which is updated upon contract execution.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Daniel Buchner, head of decentralized identity at Microsoft, kicked off the discussion by announcing the formation of the DIF, its unifying goals, and who it will benefit.</p>

      <p>“We know the only way to this is to join hands with these folks,” said Buchner. “We all have the same intents and collaborative ideas. We want to make identity real for people, organizations and devices, and I think the thing that I’m most excited about here, is not only the commercial opportunities that opens up, but the fact that it’s actually going to be good for people.”</p>

      <p>Buchner was joined by ConsenSys’ uPort project lead Rouven Heck, Gem founder and CEO Micah Winkelspecht, Chief Trust Officer at Evernym Drummond Reed, Blockstack co-founder Ryan Shea, and founder and CEO at Tierion Wayne Vaughan.

    <blockquote>
      <p>Last week I’ve attended Consensus 2017 conference and would like to share some highlights. While the overarching theme at the conference continued to be cryptocurrencies (evidenced not only by the surge to all-time highs of Bitcoin and Ether, but also by the attention given to this new asset class by reputable institutional investors), self-sovereign and digital identity topics had strong presence.</p>

      <p>As blockchain fever hit financial institutions in 2013, naturally, first use cases were focused on payments and more specifically cross-border payments. Later financial services focused on paper-intense, T+3 capital markets use cases, such as pre-trade, post trade, securities servicing. Oliver Wyman and Euroclear have published a nice report outlining opportunities blockchain could bring to Capital Markets ( ‘Blockchain in Capital Markets: The Prize and the Journey’, 2016). As use cases expanded to other industries beyond financial industry, and banks started to focus on permissioned blockchain or distributed ledger technologies (DLT), the intersection of blockchain and digital identity became more evident. While I don’t intend to cover all the aspects of digital identity, it is probably worth mentioning here that digital identity is defined as an entity’s online presence, encompassing personal identifying information (PII) and ancillary information, referred to as attributes or verifiable claims.</p>

<p>1.What is the mission and vision of ARUCC?</p>



<p>The Association of Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (<a href="https://www.arucc.ca/en/">ARUCC</a>) provides leadership in the post-secondary education field and service to its member institutions nationally and internationally, helping foster the advancement of registrarial practices in Canada. ARUCC strives to meet the needs of its members by adopting proactive measures reflecting changes in our professional environment.</p>



<p>Member institutions consist of universities, colleges and polytechnics that are recognized through either <a href="https://www.univcan.ca/">Universities Canada</a> or the <a>Colleges and Institutes Canada</a>.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



 <a href="https://arucc.ca/en/"></a> 



<p>The need for online solutions increased with the COVID-19 pandemic. These solutions will become the norm as Canada and the global economy adapt to consumer expectations. As members of the post-secondary education field in Canada, we are not unfamiliar with the need for trustworthy digital identity given the increased demand for sending/receiving electronic documents.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does ARUCC address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identity is most often managed as a gate to individual businesses through methods such as confidential passwords, PINs, and security questions. With each business having its own requirements (i.e., variations of password length and structure) it becomes nearly impossible for people to remember them all. Businesses and post-secondary institutions are forming allegiances to minimize the impact on the individual while maintaining trustworthy digital identity. An example of this is with CRA and banking passwords.</p>



<p>ARUCC also recognizes the need for trustworthy digital identity and is leading the implementation of a <a href="https://www.aruccnationalnetwork.ca/">National Network</a> with the core objective of improving permission-based, trusted access and portability of learner documents (i.e., transcripts, confirmation letters) across Canada and with trusted international partners for students, graduates, participating post-secondary institutions, provincial application centres and member 3rd party organizations.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada is in the global arena and is recognized as being trustworthy and reliable. From the post-secondary perspective, Canada has over <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3710001801">2.5 million students</a> including more than 642 thousand <a href="https://cbie.ca/international-students-in-canada-continue-to-grow-in-2019/#:~:text=Newly%20released%20numbers%20from%20Immigration%2C%20Refugees%20and%20Citizenship,numbers%20grew%20by%2016%25%20over%20the%20previous%20year.">international students</a><a>[1]</a> (based on 2019 statistics). As a destination for higher education it is imperative that trusted networks be established for identity management. The formation of the ARUCC National Network allows us to establish a ‘made for Canada’ solution that can also be tied to other trusted networks (i.e., My eQuals, CHESICC).</p>



<p>In 2018 Canada ratified the <a href="https://www.cicic.ca/1398/an_overview_of_the_lisbon_recognition_convention.canada">Lisbon Recognition Convention</a> which demonstrates our commitment to the recognition of academic credentials, which need to be portable, as learners and alumni move to work and live around the globe. This inspires the work of ARUCC to enhance trusted document exchange and provide learner credential wallets.</p>



<p>5. Why did ARUCC join the DIACC?</p>



<p>ARUCC believes in working together to achieve common goals. We feel the purpose of ARUCC and the creation of the National Network to support learner mobility aligns well with DIACC’s principals.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about ARUCC?</p>



<p>ARUCC was formed in 1964 and became incorporated in 2018. It includes over 150 member institutions representing over 2.5 million current learners and millions of alumni from within Canada and around the globe.</p>

  <p>Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.</p>

  <p>Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.</p>

Microdata is a set of tags, introduced with HTML5, that allows you to do this.</p>

<p>Women in Identity spoke to Erdoo Yongo, Policy &amp; Advocacy Manager at GSMA – the industry body for the mobile telecoms sector. Given the prevalence, and significance, of mobile phones and mobile technology across the globe, we wanted to know how she sees the development of ‘identity’ in this space – and whether policies and products really have the individual user at their core.</p>
 What do you love most about your job? 
Erdoo Yongo
<p>I work within the Mobile for Development department that explores how mobile technology can be used as a platform to create growth and reduce inequalities. To really understand the impact mobile can have on people, my role spans two areas: the Digital Identity programme and Mobile for Humanitarian Innovation programme.</p>
<p>My work involves uncovering the policy-related barriers that individuals face in accessing mobile services. Identity is a gateway to some of the most fundamental resources and services including healthcare. My responsibilities focus on high-level policy research. It is vital that we fully understand the different approaches governments around the world take to ID. We saw this year how COVID-19 released a whole new reliance on mobile technology. But in some countries, no ID meant no SIM – means no connection, not to family and friends and also, sometimes, not to school resources, financial support or healthcare initiatives.&nbsp; My research focuses on creating an evidence base that can be used to campaign for better access to all these vital services.</p>
<p>I am of Nigerian heritage but born and bred in the UK.&nbsp; I am very aware that we don’t connect with the concept of ID as they do in countries where a national ID is mandated by the government. In many of the countries I have researched, citizens value mobile services even more than they do basic things like food services or banking. It is a lifeline but, if it is tied to ID, it can exclude millions of people who – for whatever reason – don’t have a recognised identity.</p>
<p>So, to answer the question …. what I love most about my job is that it relates very much to the provision of vital life services. And, because very few people are involved in this kind of work, I really feel it is valued.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>It was an accident! I started within GSMA’s Digital Identity team as an intern. I stumbled across the internship through ‘The Brokerage’ – a social mobility network that focuses on providing opportunities for young people from disadvantaged communities, helping them take their first step into a professional career. Before seeing the internship, I had no idea who GSMA was or what they did. My internship lasted for just under a year but a number of opportunities arose which enabled me to progress from an intern to my current role. I feel it was a mixture of luck and positioning that got me to where I am today.</p>
 Luck???? Really ….? 
<p>OK…:)&nbsp; Maybe there was some hard work and risk-taking along the way!&nbsp; I studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Manchester University and was always interested in international development and humanitarian issues. So I guess being curious and not afraid to ask questions was a help! I think I was willing to take more risks too when I was younger – guess you have less to lose! I went for the GSMA internship even though it was initially advertised for 3rd year undergraduates – and I knew nothing about ‘identity’!! I’d just graduated but loved the sound of it so I went for it – and got a place!!</p>
<p>It is hard to do things that – on the face of it – look like there’s no chance of success. But what have you got to lose? I hope I retain that element of me, but it does get harder as your career develops </p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Good question. I guess it would be “You are in control of your destiny”. When I first started at GSMA I was pretty timid. I didn’t really know what I was doing and tended to expect that opportunities would come to me from my manager. Now, 3 years in, I realise that I am the only person who can control and direct my career. If I want exposure to certain things, I need to carve out the opportunities myself.</p>
<p>To this end I now recognise how important it is to have a mentor who can help you – especially in the early years. I was one of the first interns within GSMA’s 2017 intake and it was pretty scary coming out of university and into a corporate role. I didn’t really have a mentor but do feel it would have been beneficial. I now mentor others within the GSMA and externally at Queen Mary’s University as I feel it is so important to have someone ‘safe’ who can help you chart your path.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am the only person who can control and direct my career</p></blockquote>
 What do you feel needs to change in the identity sector? 
<p>We need to attract more people into our sector. As yet, it is still a relatively unknown sub-sector of “technology” and I feel I sort of stumbled into it by accident! Most young people would just look at it and assume the only opportunities are in computing or coding. Yet here we are chatting – a Policy person and a Communications person, both working in Identity! </p>
<p>There are so many great ways you can develop your career in this sector – we just need to promote it better!</p>
 In a nutshell, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>As individuals we are all unique in our own way with different skills, qualities and ideas. In ‘identity’, we are all about the individual, yet our teams often look very homogenous. This creates an underlying tone that you need to conform and it is better just to fit in than to challenge the way we do things.</p>
<p>Greater diversity in our teams will bring a different way of looking at the world – leading to different solutions for the problems it faces.</p>
<blockquote><p>In ‘identity’, we are all about the individual, yet our teams often look very homogenous.</p></blockquote>
 What book or film would you recommend to your fellow members and why? 
<p>I recently watched the film&nbsp;Palm Trees in the Snow. It is based on the Spanish novel&nbsp;by Luz Gabas.</p>
<p>After the death of her father, a young Spanish woman embarks on a journey to discovers&nbsp;generations of family secrets. Typically, movies show colonialism from a British or American perspective, so this it was really intriguing to see it from the Spanish perspective.</p>
<p>Also … as most of the dialogue is in Spanish, it was good to practise my Spanish listening skills, though I admit I did rely heavily on the subtitles!</p>
 Finally, what piece of advice would you give to the teenage Erdoo? 
<p>Keep on getting to know yourself.</p>
<p>We go through life prioritising situations and others and we tend to lose sight of ourselves.</p>
<p>Remember that as an individual you will change, mostly without even recognising it. I implore people to continue learning about themselves – their values, goals and ambitions – it’s the only way to stay true to yourself.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Sarah Douglas
<p>I’m the VP of Global Communication and Marketing for SecureKey Technologies, a leading identity and authentication provider that simplifies consumer access to online services and applications. The idea of finding new stories to tell in an exciting way gets me out of bed in the morning, and digital identity is no different. I feel very privileged to be able to tell the digital identity story to Canadians and to showcase how we are leading the world in the ecosystem-based approach of identity. I think one of the most important skills is to be able to find and tell meaningful stories in new and creative ways that are easy to understand – which isn’t very different from the lessons I teach to my kids. Finding meaning in every story helps broaden your horizons and appreciate the unique perspectives of a wide variety of people. Every story is an opportunity to better understand the world around us.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Where I am today can be summed up in three words: determination, flexibility and creativity. I’ve done every job from being a receptionist and graphic designer, to a visual stylist and an event planner all around the globe to where I am now. There is value to be taken out of every role, and I welcomed every opportunity that came my way with open arms and an open mind. You need to be determined in finishing every task you’ve been given to the best of your ability, flexible to go down avenues you may not have considered – but that can bring you to great places – and creative enough to make the most challenging opportunities successful.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>For me, this lesson is very straightforward and applies to every aspect of my life: always be kind to those around you. People will remember your kindness, your willingness to help and your ability to go the extra mile every day. With kindness, people will be more inclined to work with you in true partnership which always delivers the best results. Ruling with kindness will take you much farther than ruling with fear.</p>
<blockquote><p>Diversity breeds creativity in a sea of digital sameness.</p></blockquote>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>My advice to any CEO, whether they’re in the identity space or not, is to know your audience. Without having a good sense of who your target audiences are at every stage of your product’s lifecycle, you’ll fall short of your goals. Messaging won’t hit home, digital and traditional marketing won’t be optimized, customer bases won’t grow as quickly, and investors won’t see your growth potential. Digital identity in particular is a challenging topic to cover – you can’t be everything to everyone right away. You need to start with individuals who understand the value-add and can act as ambassadors for your product before moving on to audiences who are less familiar with the concept. Educating new audiences takes time, and it’s essential not to rush or bypass this process.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity breeds creativity in a sea of digital sameness. Working with a diverse group of different voices and lived experiences allows you to broaden your horizons and see the world through someone else’s story. I subscribe to Miriam-Webster’s word of the day email blasts and multifarious coincidentally landed in my inbox as I wrote this. Good leaders will live their personal and professional lives in the pursuit of multifariousness, or they will always fall short.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>Read – and read a lot. I don’t align with any one genre. Much like my professional drive of telling good stories, reading good stories from any perspective and in any voice is just as important. The more you answer “yes”, the more you can learn (and I am currently reading The Year of Yes by Shonda Rhimes).</p>
<blockquote><p>The more you answer “yes”, the more you can learn</p></blockquote>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Take every opportunity that is given to you, and don’t be afraid of taking chances. I’m so proud of where I am today because I was open to opportunity. I’ve lived abroad, travelled the world and done so many things that required an open mind and a resounding “yes”.</p>

 Tell us a little bit about you 
Titi Akinsanmi
<p>I am a digital policy expert currently serves as Policy and Government Relations lead for West and Francophone Africa at Google.</p>
<p>I’m also the lead on Privacy for Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>I’m a published academic, with a BA in English from OAU, Ile-Ife in Nigeria; a Masters in Public Policy from University of Witwatersrand in South Africa and an LLM from Osgoode Law School (specialising in Privacy and Cybersecurity).</p>
<p>I was a Fellow at the Berkman Klein Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard from 2018 – 2020; I sit on the boards of digital economy, arts and youth development related institutions and currently serve as an advisor on the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on the Digital Economy.</p>
<p>With over 20 years’ experience in the digital ecosystem, I have learned to live my life focussed on four key principles:</p>
<p>Inspire.</p>
<p>Inform.</p>
<p>Involve.</p>
<p>Impact.</p>
 What drives you forward? 
<p>In my undergraduate years while running for election to the role of librarian, I got inspired and hooked on the famous Latin saying by René Descartes: ‘Dubito, Ergo Cogito, Cogito Ergo Sum. Or… “I doubt, therefore I think. I think, therefore I am.” Where I am today has been shaped by my personal quest to become the change that is needed. For me this has meant transitioning from focussing on the use of technology to creating the policy and regulatory ecosystem necessary to allow innovative technologies to be adopted across all of society.</p>
<blockquote><p>Where I am today has been shaped by my personal quest to become the change that is needed.</p></blockquote>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Be courageous. Do not allow negative doubt and failure to disable you. Just tell yourself: “I am more than enough and much more” </p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>Let us rethink our approach to data: the ways we use and reuse it and, most importantly, the people and context that help generate this ‘infinite’ resource.</p>
<p>It is the 21st century, and the world is at the fingertips, ears and eyes of those that are digitally connected. Innovations in data and information technology are rapidly outpacing statutes, policies and regulations and 2020 has further entrenched the idea that our social and economic lives are fuelled by data – from video conferencing to healthcare. We have a huge opportunity but this has also brought global attention to the risks and threats (including the issue of data protection in relation to personal consent).</p>
<p>We must continue to press for privacy-based trust frameworks and put consent at the heart of our innovations.</p>
 Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the very life blood that enables us to create, exist and succeed! Without it we – and any other living being would cease to exist. Whether in the environment or the identity ecosystem, diversity is essential not just for success – but for existence..</p>
 What book/film would you recommend to your fellow members? And Why? 
<p>Honestly?? There are way too many to name just one. It really depends on the state of mind </p>
<p>Recommended books would include:</p>
<p>Ake by Prof. Wole Soyinka;</p>
<p>Wedlock of the Gods by Zulu Sofola;</p>
<p>The Beautiful Ones Are Not Yet Born by Ayi Kwei Armah;</p>
<p>Weep Not Child by Ngugi Wa Thiongo;</p>
<p>Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe.</p>
<p>And I love to read historical romance !!!</p>
<p>Favourite film is: Black Panther.</p>
<p>Why? These all speak of the experience of those in the minority portraying the, at times, harsh realities of their existence in a deeply divided and biased world.</p>
Black Panther. Source: Disney
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>“Be You To The Full”</p>
<p>Be courageous and you will succeed. Enjoy every moment. Be present in the present. Make memories &amp; don’t be afraid of tomorrow.</p>

 Confidential Storage

   <a href="https://identity.foundation/confidential-storage/">Latest Editors Draft</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>We store a significant amount of sensitive data online, such as personally identifying information (PII), trade secrets, family pictures, and customer information. The data that we store is often not protected in an appropriate manner.</p>

      <p>This specification describes a privacy-respecting mechanism for storing, indexing, and retrieving encrypted data at a storage provider. It is often useful when an individual or organization wants to protect data in a way that the storage provider cannot view, analyze, aggregate, or resell the data. This approach also ensures that application data is portable and protected from storage provider data breaches.</p>

          <p>Hubs let you securely store and share data. A Hub is a datastore containing semantic data objects at well-known locations. Each object in a Hub is signed by an identity and accessible via a globally recognized API format that explicitly maps to semantic data objects. Hubs are addressable via unique identifiers maintained in a global namespace.</p>

 Encrypted Data Vaults (Archived)

    <blockquote>
      <p>We store a significant amount of sensitive data online, such as personally identifying information (PII), trade secrets, family pictures, and customer information. The data that we store is often not protected in an appropriate manner.</p>

      <p>Legislation, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), incentivizes service providers to better preserve individuals’ privacy, primarily through making the providers liable in the event of a data breach. This liability pressure has revealed a technological gap, whereby providers are often not equipped with technology that can suitably protect their customers. Encrypted Data Vaults fill this gap and provide a variety of other benefits.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a> is a hosted 3ID account management and authentication system for browser-based Ceramic applications that allows users to onboard to applications and transact with Ceramic documents by signing authentication messages with their blockchain wallets. Try a demo of 3ID Connect <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">here</a>.</p><p>3ID Connect already supports Ethereum accounts, but this tutorial will show you how to add support for accounts from new blockchains to 3ID and 3ID Connect. This is the final part of a three-part series on 3ID Connect. Previous posts:</p>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-3id-connect/">What is 3ID Connect?</a>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">How to use 3ID Connect in browser applications</a>   About 3id-blockchain-utils <p>All of the core functionality for supporting accounts from new blockchains/networks in 3ID and <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a> is provided by the <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-3id-blockchain-utils">3id-blockchain-utils</a></code> package. This library allows the creation and validation of public links that cryptographically bind a blockchain account to a 3ID DID method using Ceramic documents. It also allows 3ID Connect and other similar 3ID account management/authentication libraries to create these public links as well as add the blockchain account as an authentication method capable of controlling a DID.</p><p>To add a new blockchain, you will need to implement a few functions in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-3id-blockchain-utils"><code>3id-blockchain-utils</code></a>. Before beginning, take a peek at the library to explore examples of current blockchain implementations such as Ethereum, Polkadot, and Filecoin. Then, continue with the process outlined below.</p> Fork 3id-blockchain-utils <p>Start out by forking the <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-3id-blockchain-utils">3id-blockchain-utils</a></code> library on Github. This will allow you to make changes locally and then push everything up in a Pull Request once you're done.</p> Create your files <p>First, create a file with the following path <code>src/blockchains/&lt;blockchain-name&gt;.js</code> to contain the JavaScript code that implements your blockchain. Then, create a file with the <code>src/blockchains/__tests__/&lt;blockchain-name&gt;.test.js</code> path to contain any tests for your blockchain.</p> Adhere to CAIP standards <p>In the interface seen below, note that &nbsp;<code>namespace</code> and <code>AccountID</code> use <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs">ChainAgnostic (CAIP) standards</a>. <code>namespace</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md">CAIP-2</a> which specifies a standard id to represent any blockchain and/or network. For example, this is 'eip155' for Ethereum and 'fil' for Filecoin. <code>AccountID</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md">CAIP-10</a> which defines a standardized way to represent any account on any blockchain.</p><p>If a CAIP standard for the blockchain or network you want to add support for does not already exist, follow directions in the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs">CAIP Github</a> repo to add it.</p> Implement the interface <p>You must create a BlockchainHandler module that exports the following interface which takes a CAIP-2 <code>namespace</code> and three functions: <code>authenticate</code>, <code>createLink</code>, and <code>validateLink</code>.</p> <code>interface BlockchainHandler {
  namespace: string;
  authenticate(message: string, account: AccountID, provider: any): Promise&lt;string&gt;;
  validateLink (proof: LinkProof): Promise&lt;LinkProof | null&gt;;
  createLink (did: string, account: AccountID, provider: any, opts?: BlockchainHandlerOpts): Promise&lt;LinkProof&gt;;
} 
</code> <p>Now, let's implement the interface.</p> authenticate() <p>The <code>authenticate</code> function allows a blockchain account to be added as an authentication method (authMethod) to a 3ID. This means using your blockchain account you will always be able to access that 3ID and derive its <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-20/CIP-20.md">3ID Keychain</a> for use, for example in 3ID Connect. This function consumes the following:</p>  <code>message</code>: string, can be any string  <code>AccountID</code>: an instance of a CAIP-10 AccountID  <code>provider</code>: specific to your blockchain. This is any standard signer or provider defined for your blockchain. Ideally your ecosystem has a widely-accepted standard interface so that this module can support signing by most accounts.  <p>The function should be implemented such that the given <code>AccountID</code> signs the given <code>message</code> using the given <code>provider</code>, and then returns a fixed length string deterministically derived from the signature.</p><p>The only strict requirements here are that:</p>  The string derivation is deterministic, and will return the same string for a given message + AccountID combination.  Unique messages return unique strings.  <p>Typically implementation looks as follows:</p> <code>async function authenticate(message: string, account: AccountID, provider: any): Promise&lt;string&gt; {
  const address = account.address
  // convert message into proper input for your signer, ie object, encoding, etc
  const payload = toPayload(message, address)
  // use provider to sign message
  const signature = await provider.sign(payload, address)
  // typically good to hash and return, so that fixed length hex string is returned
  return sha256(signature)
}
</code>  createLink() <p>The <code>createLink</code> function allows a blockchain account to create a verifiable link proof that publicly binds the blockchain account to a given DID. In Ceramic, these these link proofs can be used to create <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-7/CIP-7.md">CAIP-10 Link Documents</a> which allow anyone to look up the 3ID DID linked to your blockchain account, and then resolve any other public info linked to your 3ID. The DocIDs of your CAIP-10 Link documents can be stored in the IDX <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-21/CIP-21.md">Crypto Accounts documents</a> for simple lookup.</p><p>This function consumes similar arguments as described above. It also consumes the 3ID DID string that is being linked. This function is implemented such that when the given <code>AccountID</code> signs a <code>message</code> including the given <code>DID</code> with the given <code>provider</code>, a LinkProof is returned.</p> <code>async function createLink (did: string, account: AccountID, provider: any, opts: BlockchainHandlerOpts): Promise&lt;LinkProof&gt; {
  const address = account.address
  // util function that returns standard message string including did 
  const linkMessage = getConsentMessage(did)
  // convert message into proper input for your signer, ie object, encoding, etc
  const payload = toPayload(linkMessage.message, address)
  // use provider to sign message
  const signature = await provider.sign(payload, address)
  const proof: LinkProof = {
    // version and type are implementation specific context used for verifying linkProofs later
    version: 2,
    type: 'eoa',
    message: linkMessage.message,
    signature: signature,
    account: account.toString()
  }
  return proof
}
</code>  validateLink() <p>Lastly the <code>validateLink</code> function validates a given LinkProof. This allows anyone to easily verify linkProofs and for Ceramic to validate &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-7/CIP-7.md">CAIP-10 Link Documents</a>. The function consumes a LinkProof and returns the LinkProof if valid, otherwise it returns null. Valid typically means that the given signature in the LinkProof is valid over the given message and is created by the given account.</p> <code>async function validateLink (proof: LinkProof): Promise&lt;LinkProof | null&gt; {
  const account = new AccountID(proof.account)
  const address = account.address
  const payload = toPayload(proof.message, address)
  // specific to how ever you verify signatures
  const res = await verifySignature(proof.signature, payload)
  return res
}
</code>  Open a pull request <p>Now that you have implemented the required interface and have included the necessary tests with adequate coverage, open a pull request in <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-3id-blockchain-utils">3id-blockchain-utils</a></code>. Once reviewed, it will be merged and released.</p><p>When opening a pull request, please be sure to minimize the size of new dependencies and/or try to use libraries that are likely shared across blockchain implementations. If you include large, one-off dependencies in your PR, support for the blockchain may not be included by default in other libraries like <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">js-ceramic</a></code>.</p> Usage in 3ID Connect <p>After adding support for the blockchain in <code>3id-blockchain-utils</code>, it is easy to use these newly supported blockchain accounts with 3ID Connect. 3ID Connect consumes this functionality through an AuthProvider. You can implement an AuthProvider in your own codebase and/or also submit a pull request to 3ID Connect so that others can easily use it as well.</p><p>The interface for AuthProvider can be found below, and we will use the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect/blob/develop/src/authProvider/ethereumAuthProvider.js">ethereumAuthProvider</a> as an example. You can reference that code for more details, and find the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect/blob/develop/src/authProvider/abstractAuthProvider.js">AbstractAuthProvider</a> interface to reference.</p> <code>class EthereumAuthProvider extends AbstractAuthProvider {
  constructor(ethProvider: any, address:string ): string {
    //...
  }

  async authenticate(message: string, address:string): Promise&lt;string&gt; {
    // call authenticate from 3id-blockchain utils, encode any params as needed
    // ...
    return authenticate(message, accountId, this.provider)
  }

  async createLink(did: string, address: string): Promise&lt;LinkProof&gt; {
    // call createLink from 3id-blockchain utils, encode any params as needed
    // ...
    return createLink(did, accountId, this.provider, { type: 'eoa' })
  }
}</code> <p>Once you have an authProvider you can now use your newly supported blockchain accounts to authenticate and link accounts to 3IDs in 3ID Connect. You can reference the "<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">How to use 3ID Connect in browser applications</a>" post for more details, but you simply have to pass your AuthProvider when connecting to 3ID Connect.</p> <code>const threeIdConnect = new ThreeIdConnect()
const authProvider = new yourAuthProvider(yourProviderOrSigner, addressOrAccount)
await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)</code>  That's it! <p>This tutorial covered how to implement support for any simple key pair account on any blockchain in 3ID Connect. However, these interfaces also allow support for more complex account implementations such as contract accounts that may support multi-sig accounts and other account or identity features. It may be possible to add support for other types of accounts in the future as well.

<p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a> is a hosted 3ID identity management and authentication system for use within browser applications that allows users to use their existing blockchain accounts to onboard to applications, control/authenticate their DID, and interact with Ceramic documents. We covered a full overview of 3ID Connect, how it works, and various user flows in a <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-3id-connect/">previous post</a>. You can try a simple demo of 3ID Connect in a browser application <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">here</a>.</p><p>This guide will walk you through how to add 3ID Connect to your browser-based Ceramic application. It is the second part of a three-part series on 3ID Connect. Other posts include:</p>  Previous: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-3id-connect/">What is 3ID Connect?</a>  Next: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">Add authentication with new blockchains in 3ID Connect</a>   Installation <p>Install 3ID Connect into your browser application using npm.</p> <code>npm install 3id-connect@next</code>  Usage &amp; Authentication <p>During application runtime, 3ID Connect can help you onboard decentralized identities to your application while allowing your users to leverage their existing blockchain wallets to provide authentication signatures.</p><p>First, import 3ID Connect:</p> <code>import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'
</code> <p>Then use an AuthProvider to connect a blockchain wallet to 3ID Connect. AuthProviders typically consume a signing interface and an account or address. </p> <code>const threeIdConnect = new ThreeIdConnect()
const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()

const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])

await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)
</code> <p>In the future there will be support for AuthProviders using accounts from many different blockchains and services, however right now Ethereum is primarily supported. In the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">"Add authentication with new blockchains in 3ID Connect"</a> post we detail how to add support for new blockchain accounts as AuthProviders. This would allow your users to use different blockchain wallets to authenticate 3IDs in 3ID Connect.</p> Application Interactions <p>Once connected using an <code>authProvider</code>, you can begin to interact with 3ID Connect. However most often your application will not directly interact with 3ID Connect; instead you will just get a <a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">DID Provider</a> from 3ID Connect which will allow you and your users to interact with a number of other libraries that require DID authentication, signing, encryption, etc such as <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">Ceramic</a></code>. The library consuming the DID Provider will request authentication and permission from 3ID Connect when necessary.</p> <code>const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()
</code> <p>For example you can now instantiate <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-idx">js-idx</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">js-ceramic</a></code> with the DID Provider and a user can create and update Ceramic documents with their DID using 3ID Connect.</p> <code>import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/ceramic-http-client'
import { IDX } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'

const ceramic = new Ceramic(&lt;'LOCAL_CLI_NODE_OR_REMOTE'&gt;, {didProvider})
const idx = new IDX({ ceramic })
</code>  Experimenting with Ceramic <p>The simplest way to to get started using 3ID Connect as a DID Provider for a Ceramic node is by running a local node using the Ceramic CLI. To do this you'll need to install the Ceramic CLI and then you can create and update Ceramic documents for your application's data.</p> <code>$ npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli
$ ceramic daemon</code> <p>Once the daemon is running, the Ceramic API will be available at <code>http://localhost:7007</code>.</p> Additional ways to install 3ID Connect <p>This guide demonstrates how to directly install 3ID Connect into your Ceramic application. However, 3ID Connect is also included out of the box as a dependency in the <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/libs-web">IDX Web SDK</a>. If you're building browser-based applications and want to use the full IDX protocol for decentralized identity and user-centric data, we recommend checking it out.</p> Further Reading <p>Check out the other posts in this three-part series on 3ID Connect:</p>  Previous: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-3id-connect/">What is 3ID Connect?</a>  Next: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">Add authentication with new blockchains in 3ID Connect</a>   Questions? <p>Reach out in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> is a decentralized content management network where all content is stored in documents and all transactions on these documents must be signed by the decentralized identifier (DID) of the document owner(s). </p><p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a> is a hosted authentication system for browser-based Ceramic applications that allows users to onboard to applications, control their DID, and interact with Ceramic documents using their existing blockchain accounts. Try a demo of 3ID Connect <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">here</a>.</p>3ID Connect in action<p>You might consider using 3ID Connect in your application if: </p>  You're building a browser application that uses Ceramic  Your users already have a blockchain wallet  Other features of your app use a blockchain and you want your users to use the same wallet to interact with DIDs  You don't want to be bothered with DID key management  You don't want your users to be bothered with DID key management   <p>This post provides a technical overview of the 3ID Connect system, and is the first part of a three-part series on 3ID Connect. Other posts:</p>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">How to use 3ID Connect in browser applications</a>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">Add authentication with new blockchains in 3ID Connect</a>   What is a DID? <p>DIDs is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C standard</a> for globally-unique, persistent decentralized identifiers. These identifiers have an associated DID document which contains public keys used for signature verification and encryption. There are currently more than 60+ implementations of DIDs, called methods. The primary DID method for end-user accounts on Ceramic is called 3ID.</p> DID Providers <p>DID providers are lightweight libraries that implement the standard <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP-2844</a> interface for a particular DID method. DID providers allow for creating DIDs, signing data, verifying data, encrypting data, and decrypting data. A DID provider needs to have a currently authenticated DID, then be passed to a Ceramic instance in order to allow the user to perform transactions on Ceramic. <code><a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">3id-did-provider</a></code> provides this interface for the 3ID DID method.</p> Key Management <p>Like any other asymmetric cryptographic account, DIDs have a public identifier that is controlled by a private seed (pneumonic/private key). Therefore, building applications with Ceramic functionality requires that this DID seed is managed and protected in a secure way. When a 3ID DID is created using the raw <code>3id-did-provider</code> interface, it is up to the wallet or application developer to decide how to manage this seed.</p><p>This flexibility in DID key management is desirable considering the many different runtime environments where you might want to build a Ceramic application. For example in a React Native application, you might want to use the device's local storage to store a 3ID seed. Alternatively, you might want to implement your application using a custodial key management solution so users don't need to worry about keys at all.</p> 3ID Connect: A hosted 3ID wallet for browser apps <p>3ID Connect is a secure DID wallet purpose-built for Ceramic browser applications which offers all the <code>3id-did-provider</code> interfaces, but wraps them in a novel solution to key management and authentication using one or more blockchain wallets that your users already have. By using 3ID Connect, neither users nor developers need to worry about managing DID keys and instead users can rely on the key management of their blockchain wallet(s) to protect their DID seed.</p><p>During the process of onboarding to an application, 3ID Connect makes it seamless for users to create a 3ID, permission one or more blockchain accounts to authenticate/control their 3ID, and grant applications permissions to utilize their DID in various ways using signatures provided by this blockchain account. Instead of needing to provide the raw <code>3id-did-provider</code> to your application's Ceramic node in order to transact with the user's Ceramic documents, you can simply pass 3ID Connect as the user's DID provider.</p><p>This multi-account-to-one-DID model provides resilience against identity loss while offering additional security benefits. When more than one blockchain account is connected to a single DID, the only way a user could ever lose control of their DID is if they simultaneously lose control of all of their blockchain keys. This type of catastrophic key loss scenario is highly unlikely and improves security by delegating and distributing DID key management to all of a user's blockchain wallets. Additionally since each blockchain account is considered an equal "owner" of the DID, any account can remove any other account at any time. This allows a user to deprovision an account in the case that particular wallet account is compromised or lost, without losing their DID.</p><p>3ID Connect also provides many other benefits:</p>  Intuitive data consent management screens let users know which permissions they're giving to the application  Simplified user onboarding flow removes DID creation and key management friction, and remembers which permissions a user has given to an application on future visits so they don't need to sign unnecessary messages each time  Users can publicly link their blockchain accounts to their DID, which allows data associated to the DID (such as linked profiles, social graphs, verified social accounts, other blockchain accounts, application data, etc.) to be resolved by simply looking up the blockchain account   How it works  Architecture <p>3ID Connect is a hosted 3ID account management application that runs in an iFrame window alongside any applications which have <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">installed the 3ID Connect library in their app</a>. The 3ID Connect library communicates with the iFrame application over an RPC interface. It implements RPC calls to support functionality in 3ID Connect and most importantly relays any DID provider calls from the application to the <code>3id-did-provider</code> instance running in the iFrame. </p><p>The iFrame application uses <code>3id-did-provider</code> , <code>js-ceramic</code>, and <code>js-idx</code> in combination to support all keychain and identity management operations. It also connects to a community Ceramic node managed by the <a href="https://3box.io">3Box Labs</a> team, to persist all 3ID and IDX related Ceramic documents. The 3ID Connect application is hosted on AWS under the <code>app.3idconnect.org</code> domain.</p> Key Management System <p>3ID Connect uses Ceramic, the 3ID DID provider, the <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX identity protocol</a>, and blockchain wallets to manage the DID's seed and authentication data in a secure, decentralized manner. The various components of this system are outlined below.</p><p><code>3ID DID Method</code>: An implementation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) stored on Ceramic. 3ID Connect uses 3IDs as end-user identities.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">3id-did-provider</a></code>: A DID provider interface for the 3ID DID method.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">js-ceramic</a></code>: A node that implements the full Ceramic protocol. 3ID Connect connects to this node over an HTTP API and uses it to store 3IDs, as well as other documents described below.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-idx">js-idx</a></code>: A JavaScript/TypeScript library which implements the IDX decentralized identity protocol for keeping track of data associated with a DID in a decentralized manner.</p><p><code><a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/concepts/index">IDX Index</a></code>: A key-value store document which contains an index of a DID's personal information. This document is stored on Ceramic and a reference to it is included in the DID document of the <code>3ID DID</code>.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-20/CIP-20.md">3ID Keychain</a></code>: A document which stores copies of the DID's seed encrypted to their various authentication methods. This document is stored on Ceramic and a reference to it is included in the DID's <code>IDX Index</code>. When a user authenticates with a blockchain account in 3ID Connect, this DID seed is decrypted inside the iFrame.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-21/CIP-21.md">Crypto Accounts document</a></code>: A document which stores a list of blockchain accounts that are publicly linked to a DID, along with their <code>CAIP-10 Link</code> proofs. This document is stored on Ceramic and a reference to it is included in the DID's <code>IDX Index</code>.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-7/CIP-7.md">CAIP-10 Link document</a></code>: A document which acts as a proof that publicly binds a blockchain account to a DID. This document is stored on Ceramic and a reference to it is included in the DID's <code>Crypto Accounts document</code>.</p><p><code>iFrame localStorage</code>: A local store which stores a decrypted copy of the DID's seed (which permanently resides inside the <code>3ID Keychain</code>) under the 3ID Connect domain, and permissions granted to each application under each application's domain. These secrets are stored in the iFrame for convenience and user experience. Even if all data is lost from the iFrame it can always be resynced from the <code>3ID Keychain</code>, using the path <code>3ID &gt; IDX Index &gt; 3ID Keychain</code>.</p><p><code>Blockchain wallets</code>: Key management and signing solutions for accounts on blockchain networks. These providers are used for user authentication and permissions management in the 3ID Connect system. They are used to sign messages, and encrypt and decrypt the DID's seed which is then stored in the <code>3ID Keychain</code>. 3ID Connect currently supports Ethereum wallets, but any blockchain that supports deterministic signatures can easily be added. See <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">this tutorial</a> to learn how to add support for accounts from a new blockchain in 3ID Connect.</p> 3ID Connect User Flows <p>In the next post, "<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">How to use 3ID Connect in browser applications</a>," we guide you through installing 3ID Connect in your application. In the section below, we walk through some of the most common user flows that your users can experience while using 3ID Connect within your application. These flows will shed light on how the various components of the key management and authentication system described above work together. Try a simple demo app that includes 3ID Connect <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">here.</a></p><p>Users of your application will encounter one of a few 3ID Connect flows depending on: 1) whether or not they already have a 3ID linked to their blockchain account; and 2) whether or not they have previously used their 3ID with your application. </p><p>Here are the four different flows described in this section:</p>  The blockchain account has a 3ID, and the 3ID has previously used this domain.  The blockchain account has a 3ID, but the 3ID has not yet used this domain.  The blockchain account does not have a 3ID, and the user wants to create a new 3ID.  The blockchain account does not have a 3ID, and the user wants to connect to an existing 3ID.  <blockquote>Some of the examples below show 3ID Connect being used with the MetaMask browser extension wallet on Ethereum, but any other wallet on any other blockchain would have a similar flow.</blockquote> Onboarding Flow 1 <p>The blockchain account has a 3ID, and the 3ID has previously used this domain.</p><p>If the user's blockchain account already has a DID, and if they have already provided your application's domain with the permissions that are being requested during a previous session, the user will automatically be authenticated into your application. No action will need to be taken on the user's part and they won't see any 3ID Connect windows. Because 3ID Connect had stored the keys and permissions in iFrame localStorage from a previous session, they will be used for this session and all future sessions.</p> Onboarding Flow 2 <p>The blockchain account has a 3ID, but the 3ID has not yet used this domain.</p>The 3ID Connect permissions screen will appear in the corner of your browser window.<p>If the user's blockchain account is already connected to a 3ID (likely from using 3ID Connect in a separate application) but they have not yet provided your application with the permissions that you're requesting, then the user will see a 3ID Connect permissions window. After clicking "Continue", the user will be authenticated. </p> Onboarding Flow 3 <p>The blockchain account does not have a 3ID, and the user wants to create a new 3ID.</p><p>If the user's blockchain account does not have a 3ID, they will be prompted with a 3ID Connect new account window which provides them with the option to "Create new 3ID" or "Link existing". If the user clicks "Create new", behind the scenes 3ID Connect will perform a series of actions to initialize a new 3ID and connect their blockchain account to it.</p>The 3ID Connect new account screen<p>First, 3ID Connect creates a new 3ID enabled with IDX.</p>  Create a new 3ID DID on Ceramic  Create a new IDX Index on Ceramic  Create a new 3ID Keychain on Ceramic  Create a new Crypto Accounts document on Ceramic  Store the DocID of the IDX Index inside the 3ID  Store the DocID of the 3ID Keychain inside the IDX Index  Store the DocID of the Crypto Accounts document inside the IDX Index  <p>Next, 3ID Connect adds the blockchain account as an authentication method for the 3ID.</p>  The user is prompted to sign a message with their blockchain account that says: <code>Add this account as a Ceramic authentication method</code> (see above). From the resulting signature, an encryption key is deterministically derived. Because determinism is used to derive the encryption key from the signature, the user is always able to regenerate this encryption key wherever they can sign the same message with this same blockchain account.  3ID Connect encrypts the seed of the DID with this derived encryption key (called an <code>authMethod</code>).  3ID Connect stores this encrypted seed in the 3ID Keychain document on Ceramic.  <p>Lastly, 3ID Connect publicly links the blockchain account to the 3ID.</p>  The user is prompted to sign a message with their blockchain account that includes their DID (see above). 3ID Connect then uses this signed payload to create a CAIP-10 Link document which binds the blockchain account to the 3ID.   3ID Connect stores the DocID of the CAIP-10 Link document inside the DID's Crypto Accounts document.  <p>After the user has completed the steps above, they will now have a new 3ID that can be controlled by a blockchain account. Upon completion, they will see the 3ID Connect permissions window. Once approved, the user will be authenticated. </p> Onboarding Flow 4 <p>The blockchain account does not have a 3ID, and the user wants to connect to an existing 3ID.</p><p>If the user clicks "Link existing" instead of "Create new" when they see the 3ID Connect new account window, they will enter a flow where they connect their current blockchain account to an existing 3ID. </p><p>To accomplish this, 3ID Connect will redirect the user to an external domain where the user can: 1) see their other 3IDs currently managed in their 3ID Connect window; 2) search for 3IDs not currently in the 3ID Connect window; and 3) manage the account linking process. By default, 3ID Connect will redirect this flow to the domain of an 3ID identity management application (to be announced).</p><p>Behind the scenes, this flow will then execute the second and third steps outlined in Flow 3 to add the blockchain account as an authentication method for the 3ID, and publicly link the blockchain account to the 3ID.</p><p>Once the user has completed these steps, they will be redirected back to the original application domain and see the 3ID Connect permissions window. Once approved, the user will be authenticated.</p> Security Considerations <p>The current implementation of 3ID Connect makes a number of usability and security tradeoffs. The development team has a list of planned security improvements for the future, but here are a few things to be aware of with 3ID Connect as it's implemented today: </p>  While the code is open source, the application is still hosted by 3Box Labs. In the future this could be hosted on IPFS and resolved through ENS or IPFS.  Key material is kept in iFrame local storage. While it is sandboxed and we restrict any third party JavaScript from running in the app, local storage is still vulnerable to known attacks.  Phishing attacks and/or malicious websites could impersonate 3ID Connect screens and/or have the user sign a message that allows that attacker to access their DID kept in the iFrame.

<p>The truth is that women don’t self-promote as much as men. But they should and here’s why – Your personal brand is valuable. Demonstrating your expertise consistently will create both career and business opportunities. When your true talents are understood, recognised and noticed, it’s far more likely you’ll be tapped on the shoulder for relevant and interesting assignments&nbsp;or opportunities – you will stand out from the competition.</p>
<p>In 2019 Harvard Business Review (HBR) ran a detailed <a href="https://hbr-org.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/hbr.org/amp/2019/12/why-dont-women-self-promote-as-much-as-men">study</a> where they&nbsp; found a large gender gap in self-promotion —men rating their performance 33% higher than equally performing women. To understand what’s driving this gap, HBR looked at two factors that might influence one’s level of self-promotion: confidence (you may be unsure of your actual performance) and strategic incentives (you may talk up your performance to get a raise or promotion).&nbsp; The HBR results found that men engaged in substantially more self-promotion than women. For example, despite the fact that men and women performed equally well in the given test, men rated themselves an average of 61 out of 100 while women only rated themselves a 46 out of 100. This self-promotion paid off: workers who rated their performance more highly on the 0 to 100 scale were more likely to be hired and offered higher pay.</p>
<p>Many women may feel uncomfortable talking about their accomplishments and promoting themselves directly. But there are other ways to show your skills and knowledge when building a personal brand. Content curation and creation is a good way to share your ideas and build a positive reputation at scale. I would also suggest having a personal LinkedIn strategy that really amplifies your brand and demonstrates your knowledge whilst often helping others.</p>

<p>One of the quickest ways to build your personal brand is by growing a LinkedIn network – reaching out and connecting with your peers, thought leaders, alumni, clients and prospects. Once you have a high value group of people to talk to, you should invest time into sharing your insights and knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a member/supporter of <a href="https://womeninidentity.org/">Women in Identity</a> can play a very important role in helping you to become part of a well-established community.&nbsp; Being part of a group like WiD means that others will help you to shine and “raise you up” which can often be the lift that we all need.&nbsp; This is where “not for profit” organisations really help us to broaden our horizons by giving us access to mentors, coaches, leaders and other members who can inspire us!&nbsp; So, congratulations on being part of something so much bigger that will not only help you but will help so many others too, collectively making a difference by changing hearts and minds on such an important issue.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;Your personal brand is valuable</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are my quick tips for building your personal brand on LinkedIn and getting yourself noticed in an already crowded marketplace:</p>
 
 Optimise your LinkedIn profile page – Spend some time and energy bringing your profile to life. Talk to the challenges you solve for clients, your unique skill set and your deep expertise. Complete the ‘featured’ section on the profile page – add your capability statements, video interviews, articles and press releases.<br>
Remember you are trying to stand-out from 690 million members on the platform! 
 Personalise your Connection Strategy on LinkedIn – It is time to identify who you need to talk to on the platform and get yourself in front of them. Think carefully about who the players are that need to see you and hear you in their feed. Once you have identified this group of people, you need to sit down and reach out individually sending personalised and authentic ‘connection requests’. 
 So, you now look good on LinkedIn and you now have a growing relevant audience. It is time to socialise. Put some time in your diary 3 – 4 times a week to get active on LinkedIn – not just ‘liking’ posts, actually engaging with content and sharing your insight and knowledge – this will be what sets you apart. And if you really want to go next-level share a high value piece of content (once a week), wrapped in smart commentary, tagging authors and publications and adding hashtags – this is a sure fire-way to really build credibility and thought-leadership. 
 
<p>These 3 steps when done well and with consistency will really assist with that all-important personal brand amplification. If you want to become known as an industry expert with a strong point of view you need to embrace a personal branding strategy. I know from working with many senior industry leading women that those who take on LinkedIn marketing head-first are a step ahead of their competition regardless of the gender.</p>
<p>I urge you all to jump onboard.</p>

<p>Effective access to applications and data is essential to the performance of every organization. As the number of applications and platforms we use every day continues to grow, IT teams are burdened with the challenge of securely managing access for users. In this session, we’ll review how a modern identity management solution can streamline account provisioning and access for users across a wide spectrum of applications, improving IT operations and user satisfaction, and saving your organization time and money in the process.</p>
<p>You’ll learn…</p>
 
 
 
 How modern identity management platforms deliver&nbsp;secure access to the&nbsp;right users at the right time. 
 How effective identity management can unite on-premise and cloud applications for seamless access 
 How multi-factor authentication provides security and ease of access 
 
 
 
<p>Plus, you’ll hear from the IT team at Fairleigh Dickinson University as they share their journey to IT modernization. FDU is working with Okta to enhance security and streamline the account provisioning/deprovisioning process, and is already seeing a positive impact on IT operations,&nbsp;IT budget, and user&nbsp;satisfaction.</p>

<p>Storing authenticated and encrypted data on <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> is a core building block for many Web3 applications, but to date there has not been a standardized way to encode this type of data.</p><p>Without a standard, many developers have been forced to create custom formats for their signed and encrypted data. This has been prohibitive to the openness and interoperability of information stored in IPFS by siloing data to their particular implementation. Another approach to authenticated data has been to put data in IPFS and put the CID of the data in a smart contract on a blockchain, such as <a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a>. This is essentially an expensive way of adding a signature on top of the data and persisting the signature record on the blockchain.</p><p>With the introduction of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP-2844</a>, a standard that allows wallets to support a few new methods for signing and decrypting data based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/269"><code>dag-jose</code></a> IPLD codec, we can now simply put authenticated and encrypted data directly into IPFS. In this tutorial, you will learn how you can utilize these primitives with two libraries, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did"><code>js-did</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect"><code>3ID Connect</code></a>!</p> What are DIDs and JOSE? <p>DIDs is the W3C standard for Decentralized Identifiers. It specifies a general way of going from a string identifier, e.g. <code>did:3:bafy...</code>, to a DID document which contains public keys for signature verification and key exchange. In most DID methods the document can be updated when keys are rotated for security reasons.</p><p>JOSE is a standard from <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/">IETF</a> which stands for JSON Object Signing and Encryption, and that pretty much explains what it is. There are two main primitives in this standard: JWS (JSON Web Signatures) and JWE (JSON Web Encryption). Both of these formats allow for multiple participants: in JWS there can be one or multiple signatures over the payload, and in JWE there might be one or multiple recipients for the encrypted cleartext.</p> Building with dag-jose and EIP2844 <p>As we have been building out <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> with dag-jose and EIP-2844 as basic building blocks, we've created a few lower-level tools which allow us to more easily use these technologies. This tutorial will show you how to use these powerful tools directly.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js/">IdentityWallet</a> is an implementation of EIP-2844 using 3ID as the DID method. It can be used standalone as a DID Provider, or more conveniently within the <a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect/">3ID Connect</a> library. 3ID Connect allows users to use their Ethereum wallet (support for more blockchains coming soon) to get access to a DID Provider.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did">js-did</a> is a library that allows developers to represent a user in the form of a DID. This is the main interface we're going to be looking at in this tutorial. It allows us to sign data with the currently authenticated user, encrypt data to any user (DID), and decrypt data with the currently authenticated user.</p> Signed data in IPFS <p>By using the dag-jose IPLD codec we can create data structures that are linked and signed. This is done by creating JSON Web Signatures (JWS) that contain a link to additional data. One of the main problems that the dag-jose codec solves is that the payload of a JWS is traditionally encoded as <code>base64url</code> which means that if it contains any IPLD links you can't traverse those links. Instead what we do with DagJWS is enforce the payload to be the bytes of a CID. The codec then transforms the payload into a CID instance and sets it to the <code>link</code> property of the DagJWS. This allows us to easily traverse the resulting DAG.</p> Setup your environment <p>This section will cover how to set up some specific dependencies needed for this tutorial. If you just want to skip the setup part we have prepared <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">a simple playground</a> which bundles ipfs, 3id-connect, and dids. You can use it by opening the web page, clicking on connect, then opening the developer console where you can run the commands. If you decide to do so, skip the following two sections.</p> Setup IPFS with dag-jose support <p>Since dag-jose is a new IPLD codec it's not yet included in js-ipfs by default. It also implements the new IPLD codec API which is also not supported by js-ipfs yet. Therefore we need to do the following when we are creating an instance of IPFS:</p> <code>import IPFS from 'ipfs'
import dagJose from 'dag-jose'
import multiformats from 'multiformats/basics'
import legacy from 'multiformats/legacy'

multiformats.multicodec.add(dagJose)
const dagJoseFormat = legacy(multiformats, dagJose.name)

const ipfs = await Ipfs.create({ ipld: { formats: [dagJoseFormat] } })
</code> <p>Make sure to install the correct version of multiformats:</p> <code>$ npm i multiformats@3.0.3</code>  Setup DID and 3ID Connect <p>In the example setup below we use an injected Ethereum provider (such as MetaMask) to create a 3ID Connect and DID instance.</p> <code>import { DID } from 'dids'
import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'

// create 3id connect instance
const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()
const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])
await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)

// create did instance
const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()
const did = new DID({ provider: didProvider })
await did.authenticate()
window.did = did
console.log('Connected with DID:', did.id)</code>  Create a signed data structure <p>We can now start signing and adding data to IPFS! First lets create a simple function that takes a payload, signs it using the <code>did.createDagJWS</code> method, and adds the resulting data to IPFS. As we can see in the code below we get two objects back from this method: <code>jws</code> which is the DagJWS itself and <code>linkedBlock</code> which is the raw bytes of the encoded payload. What happens in the background is that the payload gets encoded using dag-cbor, after this the CID of the encoded payload is used as the payload of the created <code>jws</code>. We can access this payload CID on the DagJWS instance as <code>jws.link</code>.</p> <code>async function addSignedObject(payload) {
  // sign the payload as dag-jose
  const { jws, linkedBlock } = await did.createDagJWS(payload)
  // put the JWS into the ipfs dag
  const jwsCid = await ipfs.dag.put(jws, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
  // put the payload into the ipfs dag
  await ipfs.block.put(linkedBlock, { cid: jws.link })
  return jwsCid
}</code> <p>Using this function, let's create our first signed data objects:</p> <code>// Create our first signed object
const cid1 = await addSignedObject({ hello: 'world' })

// Log the DagJWS:
console.log((await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)).value)
// &gt; {
// &gt;   payload: "AXESIHhRlyKdyLsRUpRdpY4jSPfiee7e0GzCynNtDoeYWLUB",
// &gt;   signatures: [{
// &gt;     signature: "h7bHmTaBGza_QlFRI9LBfgB3Nw0m7hLzwMm4nLvcR3n9sHKRoCrY0soWnDbmuG7jfVgx4rYkjJohDuMNgbTpEQ",
// &gt;     protected: "eyJraWQiOiJkaWQ6MzpiYWdjcWNlcmFza3hxeng0N2l2b2tqcW9md295dXliMjN0aWFlcGRyYXpxNXJsem4yaHg3a215YWN6d29hP3ZlcnNpb24taWQ9MCNrV01YTU1xazVXc290UW0iLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NksifQ"
// &gt;   }],
// &gt;   link: CID(bafyreidykglsfhoixmivffc5uwhcgshx4j465xwqntbmu43nb2dzqwfvae)
// &gt; }

// Log the payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid1, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }

// Create another signed object that links to the previous one
const cid2 = addSignedObject({ hello: 'getting the hang of this', prev: cid1 })

// Log the new payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; {
// &gt;   hello: 'getting the hang of this'
// &gt;   prev: CID(bagcqcerappi42sb4uyrjkhhakqvkiaibkl4pfnwpyt53xkmsbkns4y33ljzq)
// &gt; }

// Log the old payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link/prev/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }
</code> <p>Note that the values of the CIDs and JWS will be different for you since the payload will be signed by your DID.</p> Verify a signed data structure <p>Verifying a JWS is very straight forward. Simply retrieve the JWS object and pass it to the <code>verifyJWS</code> method. If the signature is invalid, this function will throw an error. If the signature is valid, it will will return the DID (with key fragment) that was used to sign the JWS.</p> <code>const jws1 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)
const jws2 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid2)

const signingDID1 = await did.verifyJWS(jws1)
await did.verifyJWS(jws2)
</code>  Encrypted data in IPFS <p>Signed data in IPFS is one piece of the puzzle, but perhaps more interesting is encrypted data. With the use of dag-jose and EIP-2844 we can encrypt data to one or multiple DIDs and store it directly in IPFS. Below we demonstrate how to use the convenient tools provided by the js-did library to do this.</p> Encrypt IPLD data <p>There is a simple method to create a DagJWE object which is encrypted to one or multiple DIDs, <code>createDagJWE</code>. This method accepts an IPLD object (a JSON object that may also include CID links) and an array of DIDs. It will resolve the DIDs to retrieve the public encryption keys found in their DID document and create a JWE that is encrypted to these keys. To get going, let's create a helper function that creates a JWE and puts it into IPFS.</p> <code>async function addEncryptedObject(cleartext, dids) {
    const jwe = await did.createDagJWE(cleartext, dids)
    return ipfs.dag.put(jwe, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
}
</code> <p>Once we have this function we can create a few encrypted objects. In the example below we first create a simple encrypted object, then we create an additional encrypted object that links to the previous one.</p> <code>const cid3 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'secret' }, [did.id])

const cid4 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'cool!', prev: cid3 }, [did.id])</code> <p>Note that in the example above we use <code>[did.id](&lt;http://did.id&gt;)</code> to encrypt the data to the currently authenticated DID. We can of course also encrypt the data to the DID of a user that is not locally authenticated, such as another user!</p> Decrypt IPLD data <p>When the data is retrieved from IPFS we will just get the encrypted JWE. This means that we need to decrypt the data after we fetch it. Since we have created objects that link to each other, lets create a function that retrieves these objects and decrypts them recursively.</p> <code>async function followSecretPath(cid) {
    const jwe = (await ipfs.dag.get(cid)).value
    const cleartext = await did.decryptDagJWE(jwe)
    console.log(cleartext)
    if (cleartext.prev) {
        followSecretPath(cleartext.prev)
    }
}
</code> <p>The function above is a toy example that just logs the decrypted objects. We can use it to look at the content of these objects.</p> <code>// Retrieve a single object
followSecretPath(cid3)
// &gt; { hello: 'secret' }

// Retrive multiple linked objects
followSecretPath(cid4)
// &gt; { hello: 'cool!', path: CID(bagcqceraqittnizulygv6qldqgezp3siy2o5vpg66n7wms3vhffvyc7pu7ba) }
// &gt; { hello: 'secret' }
</code>  <p>That’s it for this tutorial! Hope you enjoyed diving deep into IPFS-enabled authenticated and encrypted data. I'm really looking forward to what you build on top of these powerful standards.</p><p>If you want to go deeper into how we are using these technologies in Ceramic, have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">js-ceramic Github repo</a> and jump into our <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a>.</p>

In my prior communication, I noted the Foundation performed an analysis of the Australian Consumer Data Standards (ACDS) that highlighted some deviations from the OpenID Connect and Financial Grade API ( FAPI ) standards.&nbsp; Now that the majority of deviations have been removed this enables CDR Data Holders and Data Recipients to demonstrate their technical conformance with the FAPI standards. This increases the reliability of systems leveraging these standards, the repeatability in successive systems and trust among all stakeholders in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The ACDS’s adoption of FAPI enables the members of your community to leverage the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Foundation certification program</a>. It is a mature model in use today, at scale, via the Open Banking Implementation Entity from UK regulators, identity providers (Data Holders) and relying-parties (Data Recipients) to self-certify their OpenID Connect and FAPI deployments. The tests are available to all, today, at no cost, at any time. The test suite can be run by participants themselves locally on their infrastructure or by using the OIDF’s hosted service. At a time of their choosing participants’ test results are checked by the OIDF, a modest fee and they are added to a publicly available list of organizations that have demonstrated conformance to the FAPI standard.&nbsp; This greatly assists participants, all types, large and small to achieve ACDS compliance and interoperate globally.</p>
<p>The Foundation recently updated the FAPI conformance suite to ensure that servers following the CDR standards comply with the underlying FAPI specifications.&nbsp; A number of Australian organizations have tested these tests against their CDR environments. The interoperability and security issues found in the deployments of Data Holders and Data Recipients were then able to be fixed well before they caused concerns.</p>
<p>The success of testing the tests’ allows the Foundation to launch a FAPI compliance service for CDR data holders. This new service also optionally covers the new pushed authorization spec that CDR plans to start introducing in November 2020.&nbsp; This is timely and important given the CDR’s is a new protocol without the benefit of existing test suites and few vendor implementations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this communication is to gauge the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC), and relevant internal parties, interest in supporting the OIDF’s launch of a FAPI technical conformance service for CDR participants. Your support would help expand its value to Accredited Data Recipients, and influence evolving the service in the future. We welcome ACCC’s involvement in the FAPI Working Group at any time. Any feedback on the FAPI CDR compliance service is welcome, especially prior to launch.</p>
<p>The Foundation’s considerable investment in its certification program ensures trusted implementations of open standards. The return is measured in positive impacts on interoperability and security. The UK’s use of the Foundation’s test suites has resulted in reduced engineering costs for all parties and facilitated market entry for new participants. This becomes particularly important as CDR is expanded to more entities. It highlights the importance that standards like FAPI evolve within their working groups.</p>
<p>OIDF’s certification program has proven its value to UK OpenBanking. It has revealed and assisted in resolving a significant number of interoperability and security problems in production systems in the nine largest UK banks while reducing integration costs for all. The certification and FAPI teams continue to work to ensure the tests reflect the intent of the specification authors and the needs of users.</p>
<p>We have run a series of joint workshops with the OpenBanking Implementation Entity in the UK, the Financial Data Exchange in the US to increase understanding of the standards and the benefits of the certification tools.&nbsp; We hope we could run similar workshops with the assistance of the appropriate Australian entities.</p>
<p>Please consider engaging with the OpenID Foundation on the launch of the CDR testing service. Your involvement benefits the community at large by alignment with ACCC and ACDS goals. We would be happy to arrange a call to answer any questions you might have. Thank you for your consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

 The Potential of Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed Reality Experiences for Remote Teaching and&nbsp;Learning <p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/melyssa-eigen-37b51889/">Melyssa Eigen</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/scortesi">Sandra Cortesi</a>, &amp; <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ahasse">Alexa Hasse</a><br>In collaboration with Pedro Maddens Toscano, Maya Malik, Leah Plunkett, &amp; Urs Gasser (PI). Illustrations and animations by Euan Brown, Rebecca Smith, Melanie Tan, &amp; Claudia&nbsp;Thomas</p><p>Due to the global pandemic, the past several months have been a whirlwind of changing norms and lifestyle modifications, as well as an increase in impact of the digitalization of our day-to-day lives (highlighting the importance of high-quality access to digital technologies and areas where such access might be improved). With the inability for life to “return to normal” anytime soon, we are bound to see more change, especially in the educational context. For some of us, remote teaching is the only option to continue school. There are some <a href="https://edarxiv.org/437e2">guidance</a> documents, but each state, school district, and individual educator has been asked to assume significant leadership in shaping their own remote learning space and defining the technologies available towards creating a successful online experience.</p><p>For educators and students with high-quality access to digital technologies and the skills and agency to use these tools and platforms (the pandemic has <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/16/as-schools-close-due-to-the-coronavirus-some-u-s-students-face-a-digital-homework-gap/">shed new light</a> on the persistence of digital divides and participation gaps in the learning space and the urgency to close these gaps), there are a number of opportunities available to enhance their remote teaching and learning experiences to help them in their transition. The tools range from learning platforms such as KhanAcademy; social media platforms like Facebook; video sites such as YouTube; storing and sharing platforms like Google Classroom or Dropbox; and more playful platforms like Minecraft and Scratch, or our own <a href="https://dcrp.berkman.harvard.edu/about">Digital Citizenship+ (Plus) Resource Platform (DCPR)</a>, that hosts an evolving collection of free and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons</a>-licensed learning experiences, visualizations, and other educational resources (many of these resources are available in over 35 languages).</p>Illustration by Claudia&nbsp;Thomas<blockquote>The XR environment includes multiple technologies, like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR). It allows users to integrate a variety of creative technologies in order to expand both their real-world and virtual surroundings. With <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/augmented%20reality">AR</a>, users can overlay virtual effects in their real-world environment, whereas with <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/virtual%20reality">VR</a>, users can act in a completely virtual environment. Further, MR gives users the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/551/1/012049/pdf">ability</a> to use real-world objects when interacting in virtual environments. All in all, there are a lot of possibilities for users under the “umbrella” of XR technologies. In some instances, users may need VR headsets, but in other cases, individuals can access the technologies with just a mobile device or computer and access to the Internet.</blockquote><p>One emerging set of tools in this space falls under the category of extended reality technology (XR), which is becoming increasingly prevalent in the lives of young people. For example, as part of an <a href="https://www.weforum.org/communities/global-future-council-on-virtual-and-augmented-reality">ongoing project</a> by <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">Youth and Media</a> at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University</a>, we are exploring the potential roles XR may play in the youth context while also recognizing the various access and usage barriers. A forthcoming publication — sign up for our team’s mailing list <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">here</a> to receive an early copy — addresses XR as it relates to domains such as education, physical and mental health, and social issues, as well as the potential roadblocks that stand in the way of these technologies becoming widely available. Additionally, the publication introduces the reader to over 30 XR experiences that have the potential to enhance teaching and learning across these domains in the youth&nbsp;context.</p><p>There are a variety of XR tools that can be explored in remote environments that may help improve the teaching and learning experience, enhance students’ motivation and engagement, or simply make a learning activity more novel or fun. It’s important to note, however, that while there is an increasing <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131513002108?via%3Dihub">evidence base</a> around using AR and VR to teach different subjects, a great deal of the literature focuses on using these technologies to teach a certain course or topic area. As the following <a href="https://library.educause.edu/-/media/files/library/2019/10/2019hpxr.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=306474918AA2F101DDDCABD59E4366AD7244D572">report</a> indicates, however, far fewer studies examine the efficacy of XR technologies compared to the use of non-XR tools in the educational space. As such, we envision XR technologies as one possible tool educators might consider integrating in the classroom — depending upon the affordability and accessibility of these technologies, which we elaborate upon further in this&nbsp;piece.</p><p>Preliminary evidence indicates <a href="https://library.educause.edu/-/media/files/library/2019/10/2019hpxr.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=306474918AA2F101DDDCABD59E4366AD7244D572">three key areas</a> with respect to potential ways XR technologies may be integrated in the classroom. First, XR technologies can be used to foster skill-based learning, such as learning a language. <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jgc/research/ssla_intro/collentine_freed_ssla_2004.pdf">Research</a> demonstrates that immersion may be helpful in learning a second language, and that <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/4/1/13/htm">VR, for example, can effectively simulate an immersive language experience</a>. Second, XR can expand the possible activities youth can learn from in a hands-on manner. Such technologies can, for example, allow young people to <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/news/klopfer-thompson-implement-collaborative-games-vr-learning">travel inside the human body and explore cells</a> for a biology course, or, for a physics class, <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/vr-physics-lab/overview/">examine how charged particles can interact with each other</a>. Thus, XR has the potential to increase the topics young people can learn from by turning abstract concepts into concrete experiences. And third, XR can allow for new functionalities, or affordances, that allow for young people to learn in ways that have not yet been possible with other technological tools. For students taking vocational classes interested in architecture or construction, for instance, XR can <a href="https://idvl.syr.edu/">simulate architectural designs</a> that are <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24751448.2017.1292794">more realistic that computer-aided designs</a> — allowing individuals to walk through a space and explore various objects in&nbsp;it.</p>Illustration by Claudia&nbsp;Thomas<p>In addition to these three areas, there are several other areas connected to the educational space that appear promising in the context of XR. For example, XR technologies may be able to help fill in some of the gaps created by transitioning from in-person to remote learning. Against the backdrop of the global pandemic and disrupted education in regions around the world, field trips, which are often one of the most exciting aspects of formal education, are unlikely to occur in the coming months. While not equivalent to an in-person experience, XR technologies, <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/uploads/pdfs/csm_vr101_final.pdf">such as VR</a>, can create the opportunity to explore places that have not been possible for many to travel to. For example, students could <a href="https://theoceanagency.org/googleoceaneducation">explore the depths of the ocean</a> or even <a href="http://missioniss.magnopus.com/">take a rocket to outer space</a>. Instead of in-person field trips to museums, students can use XR technologies to explore exhibits — some museums have their own XR-based apps, such as the Louvre’s <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/leonardo-da-vinci-0/realite-virtuelle">“Mona Lisa: Beyond the Glass”</a> VR app or the “<a href="https://www.annefrank.org/en/about-us/what-we-do/publications/anne-frank-house-virtual-reality/">Anne Frank House VR</a>” experience. Additionally, some XR technologies allow young people to <a href="https://arvr.google.com/tourcreator/">create their own</a> AR and VR exploration experiences.</p>Illustration by Claudia&nbsp;Thomas<p>XR technologies have also been designed with the aim to cultivate skills that are relevant in (and out) of the classroom, both for educators and students. For example, there are XR experiences that allow educators to practice their <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/19/09/virtual-reality-teachers">pedagogical skills</a> and those that seek to strengthen students’ <a href="https://arvredtech.com/blogs/news/using-augmented-reality-for-student-presentations">presentation skills</a>. In addition to skill-building, XR technologies can simulate different scenarios to prepare educators and students alike for emergency situations. For example, in a remote health class, one could use an XR app to teach students <a href="https://ahahealthtech.org/augmented-reality-ar-hands-only-cpr-trainer/">CPR</a>. Other use cases could involve different forms of disaster prevention as well as vocational training.</p><p>Another promising application of XR technology centers around addressing social issues in the educational setting, such as how to prevent and respond to bullying. In the context of remote learning, while students may not be in physical contact with one another, this does not eliminate the potential for <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/publication/2019/youth-and-cyberbullying/another-look">bullying</a>. Given the isolated nature of remote learning, anti-bullying programming remains vital to the educational setting. In response, there are a number of different XR technologies that help students learn about one another’s differences in an effort to prevent and mitigate bullying, which educators may implement in a remote curriculum. These platforms use a variety of techniques to promote empathy, ranging from <a href="https://harmonylabs.org/vr-action-lab">stand-up comedy</a>, to <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/virtual_reality_games/">placing the user in the role of the bully or bullied</a>, to focusing on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7495417">training teachers to identify bullying</a>.</p>Illustration by Rebecca&nbsp;Smith<p>With respect to the adoption of XR technologies in the educational space, <a href="https://library.educause.edu/-/media/files/library/2019/10/2019hpxr.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=306474918AA2F101DDDCABD59E4366AD7244D572">research</a> in the context of higher education suggests two key factors are important. First, the XR technologies need to fit into current curriculum standards and educators’ instructional methods. This finding aligns with research around the diffusion of innovations more broadly. For any innovation to be implemented in a given setting — from the workplace to the classroom — <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Diffusion_of_Innovations_5th_Edition.html?id=9U1K5LjUOwEC">it must fit within systems currently in place</a>. Second, as with the diffusion of other innovations, the adoption of XR is influenced by the cost of these technologies — not only in terms of the monetary value, but, for instance, the cognitive load of learning how to use&nbsp;XR.</p><p>While this brief overview focuses on the opportunities that XR technologies may present in the educational space, it’s also important to highlight that these technologies come with <a href="https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/22485/ETHICAL%20IMPLICATIONS.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y">challenges</a> related to accessibility, privacy, and safety. In order to take advantage of the affordances of XR, as with other digitally networked technologies, <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2020/05/14/poverty-race-linked-to-lack-of-internet-for-students.aspx">Internet connectivity</a> is needed. This may prevent a significant number of people from leveraging the technology — even more so during the pandemic with many schools and libraries closed. Further, we often associate XR with expensive VR headsets, which can be financially burdensome and inaccessible to many. These barriers are real. At the same time, <a href="https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/computingengineering/article/17/3/031013/370980/A-Review-of-the-Capabilities-of-Current-Low-Cost">less costly VR headset options</a>, such as Google Cardboard, as well as free and low-cost VR and AR apps have become available, which students can use on their phones without further equipment.</p>Illustration by Rebecca&nbsp;Smith<p>Additionally, as with many other networked technologies, such as <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/publication/2019/youth-and-artificial-intelligence/where-we-stand">artificial intelligence</a>, there are concerns around the extent to which the design of XR incorporates the voices and perspectives of underrepresented groups — whether in terms of age, ethnicity, race, gender and sexual identity, religion, national origin, location, skill and educational level, and/or socioeconomic status. In terms of additional issues around inclusion, XR is more reliant (compared to other digital technologies) on individuals’ ability to control their physical motions (e.g., quickly moving one’s hand). How can these technologies be made <a href="https://ablegamers.org/thoughts-on-accessibility-and-vr/">more accessible for those with limited mobility</a>?</p><p>Second, there are numerous challenges around privacy, data and data protection, and commercial risk, some of which are resonant with general concerns that come with digitally networked technologies, while others are specific to XR. For example — like many digitally connected systems — XR has the ability to collect, aggregate, analyze and monetize users’ data — data which is “<a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/my-privacy-uk/Assets/Documents/Childrens-data-and-privacy-online-report-for-web.pdf">durable, searchable, and virtually undeletable</a>.” Given that <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/my-privacy-uk/Assets/Documents/Brief-teachers.pdf">children and youth are often pioneers in exploring emerging technologies</a>, they may experience XR-related privacy and data protection risks before adults enact strategies to mitigate such concerns. Moreover, the unprecedented amount of data that networked technologies such as XR are able to collect can be sold to third parties, including companies that can target marketing to youth. These targeted messages may <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/media/1111/file/UNICEF-Global-Insight-data-governance-covid-issue-brief-2020.pdf">put youth at risk</a> for commercial exploration and exposure to content that may impact their perspectives and behaviors in ways not optimal for healthy development.</p>Illustration by Rebecca&nbsp;Smith<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/assets/documents/research/projects/childrens-privacy-online/Evidence-review.pdf">research shows</a> that young people (like many adults) generally lack an <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/my-privacy-uk/Assets/Documents/Childrens-data-and-privacy-online-report-for-web.pdf">adequate understanding</a> of the processes of data collection and resultant commercial profiling and marketing to which they can be subject. The risks associated with commercial profiling are only worsened in the context of COVID, with young people spending increased amounts of time in the digital environment and commerce currently being driven online. In addition to collecting information such as young people’s product preferences and location, XR technologies also have the potential to <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2018/protecting-nonverbal-data-tracked-in-virtual-reality/">gather large amounts of data about nonverbal behavior</a>, such as gestures, facial expressions, and eye gaze — even if one is only using the system for short periods of time. Indeed, spending a mere 20 minutes within a VR simulation may capture slightly under <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2018/protecting-nonverbal-data-tracked-in-virtual-reality/">two million recordings</a> of one’s body language. In the context of education, researchers have used nonverbal data gathered through VR to predict <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/mm/2014/won-ieeeac-nonverbal-predicts-learning.pdf">test scores</a>, and <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2011/automatically-analyzing-facial-feature-movements-to-identify-human-errors/">estimate the number of mistakes</a> made while learning a specific task. A young person’s future — from the university they are admitted to, to their employment opportunities and quality of working life — could be (positively or negatively) <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2018/protecting-nonverbal-data-tracked-in-virtual-reality/">impacted</a> by the nonverbal data that XR technologies collect. The data captured through XR will also strengthen companies’ efforts to target advertising to youth — a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02116/full">study</a> shows that data about one’s head movements in VR is associated with how positively someone rates the content in a simulation. Legal protections against these and related privacy risks vary across jurisdictions and application areas. When it comes to student privacy issues in the context of formal education in the U.S., <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/youthandmediaalpha/files/2017/03/PrivacyStudentData_Companion_Learning_Tools.pdf">this publication</a> (pages 4–5) by authors from the Youth and Media team and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/teaching/cyberlawclinic">Cyberlaw Clinic</a> at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard offers both a general point of entry into the privacy analysis, as well as a roadmap for exploring additional information and engaging with decision-makers who might be involved in determining whether, how, with which students, and for what purposes XR technologies can be employed, and what privacy safeguards need to be put in&nbsp;place.</p><p>And third, there are safety risks connected to XR technologies. As with many other networked technologies, such as computers and mobile phones, some users may experience eye strain using XR. Unlike many other Internet-enabled technologies, however, XR may induce side effects such as nausea, dizziness, seizures, and discomfort wearing the needed equipment. Recently, there have been efforts to make VR headsets, for instance, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1HIxQIOTds&amp;t=1s">more comfortable to wear for those of different racial and ethnic backgrounds</a>. Additionally, XR offers another online space for young people to be cyberbullied in. Research shows that harassment in XR, such as VR,<a href="https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harassment-in-Social-Virtual-Reality-Challenges-for-Platform-Governance.pdf"> may take different forms</a>, such as environmental (e.g., throwing virtual objects) or physical (e.g., unwanted physical contact). Given the immersive nature of XR, will these types of harassment be experienced as more intense compared to bullying via text message or chat? And how can educators, parents, and other stakeholders most effectively reduce and prevent these forms of online harassment?</p><p>With time, we hope that we as researchers will be even more equipped to understand the impact the global pandemic may have on learners from all backgrounds. By all indications, however, there are <a href="https://edarxiv.org/437e2">several reasons</a> to be concerned. On a global level, students — particularly those from underrepresented communities — are facing serious disruptions in accessing learning opportunities, particularly those that are online. Projects such as <a href="https://www.voicesofyouth.org/campaign/studying-home-due-coronavirus-how-young-people-around-world-are-keeping-their-mood">UNICEF’s Voices of Youth</a> and <a href="https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse/learningneverstops">UNESCO’s COVID-19 Education Response</a>, which are examining some of the challenges youth are facing in the context of learning, have found that, over the coming months, it will be increasingly crucial to ensure that young people can connect learning with their needs and interests. Engaging in interest-driven learning online with a community of supportive peers and mentors — or, <a href="https://clalliance.org/publications/the-connected-learning-research-network-reflections-on-a-decade-of-engaged-scholarship/">connected learning</a> — can help inspire young people to be more creative and <a href="https://edarxiv.org/437e2">foster their ability to learn online</a>. As with any other educational technology, the value of XR depends on many contextual factors and will require careful assessment before it is introduced in any learning environment — whether online or in-person. However, the technology comes with the promise to provide educators with additional options in terms of remote student engagement, and ways to support and complement efforts to equip youth with the skills to participate and thrive in an increasingly digitally connected economy and&nbsp;society.</p>Illustration by Claudia&nbsp;Thomas <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/extended-reality-e5038b38d628">Extended Reality</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The future of Web3 identity has arrived <p>IDX is in alpha but if you’d like to start experimenting, <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz/">join our discord</a> and jump into the <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs">docs</a>.</p> A new era for Web3 development <p>The Web3 vision for an internet that is open and interoperable, where users control their information requires a decentralized, cross-platform identity system. To this end, IDX is an open source JavaScript/TypeScript library that exposes high-level developer APIs to various meta-protocols and standards for decentralized identity. Not only is IDX powerful and flexible enough to meet all of your user and data management needs, but it wraps everything in an easy-to-use package that makes decentralized identity accessible to all Web3 developers.</p><p>Designed to be cross-platform and highly configurable, IDX is compatible with all blockchains, wallets, and a wide variety of user and application data storage options including <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a>, <a href="https://textile.io/">Textile</a>, <a href="https://orbitdb.org/">OrbitDB</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://sia.tech/">Sia</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/">Secure Data Stores</a> — so you can seamlessly integrate decentralized identity with the rest of your Web3 tech stack. With IDX, developers can now build much more sophisticated and powerful Web3 applications that rival and even exceed what’s currently possible on Web2.</p> Why decentralized identity? <p>If you’ve ever asked yourself any of these questions, then you should definitely consider adding a decentralized identity system to your development stack.</p>  How can I create a universal identifier to associate data resources from a variety of platforms to a single user?  How can I improve my user experience with decentralized social profiles?  How can users create a unified Web3 identity that links many different accounts within and across various blockchain platforms?  How can users establish trust and reputation by connecting their Web3 identity to existing Web2 social accounts (i.e. Twitter), various anti-sybil systems (i.e. <a href="https://brightid.org/">BrightID</a>), domain names (i.e. DNS, <a href="https://ens.domains/">ENS</a>, <a href="https://handshake.org/">Handshake</a>), and identity verification services (i.e. KYC)?  How can users create a universal and portable social graph of followers, friends, and contacts?  How can I store user and application data in various centralized and decentralized data storage technologies in a way that isn’t siloed to my application, gives users ultimate control and portability over their data, and works with all of their existing wallets/accounts?  How do I discover and import data that a user has created on another application, platform, or network so that I can use it inside my app?   IDX: An open identity framework for Web3 <p><br>Decentralized identity and user-centric data management are complex, broad-ranging capabilities that touch almost every other aspect of your app architecture. IDX removes the all of the guesswork from implementing these in a scalable and future-proof way.</p> Build with unified digital identities <p>Using IDX, all applications can access a shared, globally-available identity layer that contains unified users identities. Built 100% on permissionless protocols, IDX enables users and their most important information to seamlessly flow and interoperate across platforms, while giving users the ownership and control they demand. In a way, the identity capabilities offered by IDX sort of function as a decentralized Keybase but with much greater flexibility and decentralization.</p>A unified digital footprint!<p>The core of each identity consists of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> which acts as a globally-unique ID and an <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/cip/idx/CIPs/CIP-11/CIP-11.md">identity index</a> which keeps track of an identity’s information. IDX allows developers to deploy identities as well as create, read, update, and delete a variety of metadata and information related to the identity, including but not limited to:</p>  Multiple user profiles for different contexts or applications  Portable social graphs, from followers to contacts and family  Links to multiple blockchain accounts from different protocols (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, NEAR, Flow, etc)  Links to existing social accounts (Twitter, Github, Discord, Matrix, etc)  Links to domain names (DNS, ENS, Unstoppable, Handshake, etc)  <p>All DIDs, identity indexes, and metadata are securely stored on Ceramic’s permissionless document management network. Because all information is publicly available (but optionally encrypted) and linked via the identity index, any bit of information can be cross-resolved by querying based on any other information. For example you could lookup a user’s profile based on their DID, their Ethereum account, or their Twitter handle; or you could lookup a user’s Filecoin account based on their Polkadot account. We are working with <a href="https://thegraph.com/">The Graph</a> on indexing these identity structures which will open up many new opportunities in this realm.</p> Integrate with data storage solutions <p>Unified identities are the gateway to a world of additional functionality for your application. If you also need a way of storing and managing user data, you have three main options.</p>  Use the IDX library to directly store documents on the Ceramic Network and add references to those documents in the user’s index. For this option, no additional software is needed; it works out of the box with IDX.  Store data in alternative data storage systems such as Filecoin, IPFS, Sia, Arweave, Textile, OrbitDB, Secure Data Stores, or Ethereum contracts and use IDX to add references to this data in your user’s index. For this option, you would need to separately install these technologies in your app alongside IDX.  Use a combination of the different data storage solutions above for your application, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, while mapping everything in your user’s IDX.  <p>Whichever data storage configuration you choose, IDX allows all data to be controlled by the user, discoverable by others, and portable across platforms. This is true regardless of where the data resides (servers or decentralized networks) or which application first created the data.</p>The identity index contains mappings to various data sources Share data across applications and silos <p>As described above, the key aspect of IDX that de-silos information, promotes interoperability, and enables user control is the identity index. It provides a standard interface which allows any application or developer to set and query all available data that belongs to a user so that they might make use of it within their application. The identity index serves as the information root for each user and makes everything discoverable.</p><p>To further promote interoperability, the identity index allows developers to:</p>  Publish schemas, names, and descriptions for data points they are adding to the index, so others can more easily consume this information  Publish endpoints for where this information can be found, whether a DocID on Ceramic, a CID on IPFS/Filecoin, a contract on Ethereum, or an endpoint for a hosted service  Request permission to access encrypted data points in the index   Developing with IDX <p>The following section outlines how to get started building with IDX. For more supporting materials, <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs">read the docs</a>.</p> Installation <p>First, we’ll need to install the main IDX library and associated dependencies:</p> <code>npm install @ceramicnetwork/ceramic-http-client @ceramicstudio/idx @ceramicstudio/idx-constants</code>  Query an identity <p>Then we can use these libraries to connect IDX to a Ceramic network and interact with the documents associated to a given DID. This example shows how to simply query the basic profile for a given user.</p> <code>import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/ceramic-http-client'
import { IDX } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'
import { definitions } from '@ceramicstudio/idx-constants'
// Use Ceramic devnet
const ceramic = new Ceramic('&lt;https://ceramic.3boxlabs.com&gt;')
// Use IDX-provided definitions aliases
const idx = new IDX({ ceramic, definitions })
// Get the basic profile of a known DID supporting IDX
async function getProfile(did) {
  return await idx.get('basicProfile', did)
}</code>  Save data <p>More advanced examples involving authentication and setting content can be found in the <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/guide-authentication">IDX documentation</a>.</p><p>Remember, IDX is still in alpha. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback on what we’ve built or how to use it, please <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz/">reach out on Discord</a>.</p> About <p>IDX is an open source library that is built and maintained with 💜 by the 3Box Labs team, creators of <a href="https://github.com/3box/3box-js">3Box.js</a>, a leading decentralized identity and data storage solution for Ethereum that has been used by 30,000+ users and 1,000+ projects. IDX is a smarter, mature evolution of 3Box.js. All DIDs and profiles created using 3Box.js will be automatically migrated to IDX once the library goes into production. We are working on various solutions to migrate user data that has been saved in spaces and threads to other IDX compatible data storage systems including Ceramic, Textile, and OrbitDB.

<p>​Chainlink, Morpheus.Network, Nethermind, Provide, and Unibright Also Sponsor Baseline Open Source Project &nbsp;</p> 


<p>9 Nov 2020 – Industry leaders across the globe are coming together to support the new <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/">Baseline Protocol</a>, part of the Ethereum <a href="https://oasis-open-projects.org/projects/">OASIS</a> open source initiative. The Baseline Protocol&nbsp; defines a method for using the Ethereum Mainnet or other public blockchains to coordinate complex, confidential workflows between enterprises–without moving company data out of traditional systems of record. In today’s announcement, Accenture, Chainlink, Morpheus.Network, Nethermind, Provide, Splunk, and Unibright join Baseline’s founding sponsors, the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, Ethereum Foundation, and ConsenSys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re seeing a groundswell of excitement for using the Baseline method, as more and more organizations and developers realize the simplicity and security it offers,” said Guy Martin, executive director of OASIS Open, the nonprofit consortium that hosts the project. “The support of Accenture, Splunk, and all the other Baseline sponsors shows how ready the market is for a low-cost blockchain solution that doesn’t compromise data integrity and that can be used by everyone.”</p>



<p>Support for Baseline<br>“Our clients have significant operational demands of multiparty systems like blockchain,” said Michael Klein, director of blockchain technology at Accenture. “We continue to see innovations in and around blockchain technologies that are rising to meet those demands. For Accenture, the notable work happening around the Baseline Protocol is an example of the next wave of evolution in this space. We see tremendous potential in the Baseline Protocol’s ability to maintain the integrity and uniqueness of privately-held assets— providing ‘double-spend’ protection without compromising confidentiality—and believe this will expand the applicability of blockchain technology to a broader range of enterprise use cases.”</p>



<p>“As a founding sponsor to the Ethereum OASIS Open Project, the EEA is very pleased to see global leaders rallying around the Baseline Protocol to drive Mainnet business use cases,” said EEA Executive Director Dan Burnett, the Ethereum OASIS Open Project Governing Board Chair. “Baseline is enabling the Ethereum Mainnet to be a new tool for enterprise solution development from automation, business integration, finance to supply chain and sustainability efforts. EEA members alongside the EEA Mainnet Working Group will continue to collaborate on how tools like Baseline can deliver value to consumer-facing industries through peer-to-peer transactions and services.”</p>



<p>“Morpheus.Network is really pleased to be a sponsor of the Baseline Protocol! Baseline is an ideal complement to our supply chain SaaS middleware platform. One common challenge within the supply chain industry is encouraging the open flow of communication and information to help facilitate the movement of goods around the world, while balancing that with the need to keep sensitive and confidential information strictly private. Baseline enables this flow of information by allowing companies to use the data in their existing databases and ERP systems, and ensure that it remains synchronized and consistent with other third-party databases, in a completely private way while using the always-on, distributed, censorship-resistant and tamperproof Ethereum mainnet as a common frame of reference,” said Noam Eppel, Morpheus.Network Co-Founder &amp; COO.</p>



<p>“Nethermind is proud to be a sponsor of the OASIS Open Project alongside industry peers. As maintainers of, and the first Ethereum client embracing Baseline, we are excited that the solutions delivered by Nethermind and Provide enable rapid adoption, allowing enterprises to reinforce their integrations with the unique notarization capabilities and liveness of the Ethereum mainnet. There has never been a better time for enterprises to harness its power,&nbsp; nor has the mainnet ever been as ready as it is now.” said Tomasz Stańczak, Nethermind Founder &amp; CTO.</p>



<p>“The dawn of the Data Age has created monumental business and societal shifts, while forcing businesses to digitize faster than ever before,” said Nate McKervey, Head of Blockchain and DLT, Splunk. “Data is no longer a nice to have, it’s an essential component of nearly every business worldwide. Organizations that can confidently synchronize their data in real-time and empower themselves through their data insights will leap ahead. The Baseline Protocol enables automation of business processes by leveraging data in new or traditional systems while maintaining integrity and confidentiality. This unlocks data in ways previously impossible, which coincides with Splunk’s vision of helping organizations turn data into doing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>About Baseline and Ethereum OASIS</p>



<p><a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org">Baseline</a> is part of <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/">Ethereum OASIS</a>, an <a href="http://oasis-open-projects.org/">OASIS Open Project </a>that provides a neutral forum for supporting open source projects and specifications that advance interoperability for blockchain applications worldwide. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the Baseline Protocol, and suggestions for new Ethereum OASIS projects are encouraged.</p>

<p>Collaborating on next-generation standards</p><p>DIF is proud to announce that it has entered into a liaison agreement with the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>). This provides a mechanism for both parties to work together on areas of mutual interest, allowing working groups to align and coordinate through dual-members. The first major collaboration, which has already been underway for weeks, is a process for revising the Self-Issued OpenID Connect (SIOP) <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">chapter</a> of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">specification</a>. This revision takes place in the AB/Connect working group of OIDC, which focuses at any given time on extending the core OIDC specification.</p><p>Given the foundational nature of this collaboration (and the potential for breaking changes or mental-model shifts in the next major version), the work on DIF’s Self-Issued OpenID Connect Provider DID Profile working draft, referred to colloquially as “did-siop,” has been paused. It is expected to resume, still housed as a work item in DIF’s DID Authentication<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html"> Working Group</a>, after the work on the new SIOP specification in AB/C is finalized.</p><p>DIF members from the group are actively contributing to the new version of SIOP specification through OIDF’s structure and channels. If you are interested in advancing or contributing to this work substantially, you are very welcome to join the calls, details of which you can find <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">here</a>.

<p>The DEON project focuses on the application of blockchains to secure data sharing in private networks and was initiated in 2018 in the wireless and sensor networks laboratory at the Yale Institute for Network Science. The use case of off-grid communication networks was identified with the goal of enabling their full decentralization in terms of data management and identity management. Off-grid (communication) networks are peer-to-peer networks that are autonomous, without super nodes and not dependent on the Internet’s physical infrastructure. Several recent developments like goTenna[1] and the Beartooth[2] offer standalone wireless devices that could be used to form local peer-to-peer networks. Other developments like the well-known Guifi community network[3] in Catalonia, Spain, are community-led paradigms in that space. Although these networks promote decentralization, openness, and fairness, they rely on legacy, centralized technologies for specific parts of their architecture like data and identity management. The integration of blockchains into off-grid networks appeared promising since blockchain provides attributes like transparency, privacy, distribution of governance and decentralization that are highly desirable in off-grid networks.</p>



<p>We chose Hyperledger Fabric as the framework to build our architecture because of its flexibility, performance and the potential we saw behind this huge community of enthusiasts and developers to further advance the technology. After we got familiar with the framework, we identified a key missing aspect: a decentralized identity management component. Unlike the rest of Fabric’s architecture, its native identity management is centralized and based on Certificate Authorities. So we came across the following questions: “which of the nodes in the network is going to host and manage the CA?”, “can we stick with the initial plan of having equal nodes?”and “how can we preserve the decentralization of off-grid networks if we rely on centralized nodes?”</p>



<p>Looking at the rest of the Hyperledger ecosystem, we found that Hyperledger Indy and Aries enable decentralized identity management. We could transform the centralized CAs of Fabric to a distributed CA entity, aka the Indy ledger, so that they are accessible by all nodes but not hosted by a specific one. This approach would work like a distributed oracle of trust in the network but necessitated some changes in Fabric and other extensions in the entire stack to bring DIDs into the “Fabric world.”</p>



<p>Approach and proposed architecture</p>



<p>The first Fabric extension identified as necessary for the integration was an Indy-based MSP to verify identities, signatures and transactions signed by DIDs. In addition, we had to enable the Fabric SDK (Go) to sign transactions using DIDs. For the Indy/Aries part, we leveraged the Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent (aca-py) [4], which is deployed in each node of the network and serves as both the verifier and the issuer in the network. On one hand, it signs Fabric transactions using DIDs and issues credentials to the users of the network, and on the other it verifies proofs and transactions signed by DIDs. The DEON Core Service leverages Fabric private data collections and an interface to IPFS to expose a REST API for secure, transparent, fast and privacy-preserving data storage. An overview of the integration is shown in the figure below. The proposed architecture can be employed by off-grid networks of any kind, from IoT to communication and inter-enterprise consortia networks, for enabling self-sovereign identity and user-centric data sharing.</p>




Figure 1: HL Fabric-Indy/Aries integration




<p>Project outcomes and future work</p>



<p>The work started as a joint effort between the wireless and sensor networks lab of Professor Leandros Tassiulas at the Yale Institute for Network Science and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which put its expertise in decentralized identity to work in the development of the identity parts. Part of the work and initial benchmarks of the architecture deployed in off-grid settings are presented in the paper “A Blockchain-based Decentralized Data Sharing Infrastructure for Off-grid Networking[5].”</p>



<p>Currently the Yale team is working on improving the code to make it more usable by others as a standalone solution for integrating Fabric and Indy/Aries. The team is also working on feature enhancements for the DEON platform, such as supporting Fabric v2, updating DEON identity agents to the latest version of the aca-py agent, extending the DEON REST API with admin functionalities and finally looking for new applications of the platform.

<p>Second opportunity for public review. Ends November 18th.</p> 

<p>We are pleased to announce that XACML v3.0 Related and Nested Entities Profile Version 1.0 CSD02 from the OASIS eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) TC is now available for public review and comment. This is the second public review for this work.</p>
<p>The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) defines categories of attributes that describe entities of relevance to access control decisions. XACML rules, policies and policy sets contain assertions over the attributes of these entities that must be evaluated to arrive at an access decision. Principal among the various predefined entities are the entity that is requesting access, i.e., the access subject, and the entity being accessed, i.e., the resource. However, it is not unusual for access decisions to be dependent on attributes of entities that are associated with the access subject or resource. For example, attributes of an organization that employs the access subject, or attributes of a licensing agreement that covers the terms of use of a resource.</p>
<p>This profile defines two ways of representing these associated entities in the request context – related entities and nested entities – and defines additional mechanisms to access and traverse these entities.</p>
<p>About the TC</p>
<p>The XACML TC specifies access control standards, based on the Attribute-based Access Control model (ABAC). The core of this work is the specification of the syntax and semantics of a policy language called XACML. Current work in the TC consists mostly of defining additional profiles of various types which build on version 3.0 of the XACML core specification.</p>

 Tanveer Hasan &amp; Rahmanuddin Shaik  Session <p>Wikipedia is a group project, and people in the group need to have separate pages to discuss changes and improvements to Wikipedia’s content, be that an article, a policy, a help page, or something anything else. Reading these discussion pages is a vastly rewarding, slightly addictive, experience. Sometimes reading Wikipedia can ruffle feathers.</p><p>E.g. 1:</p><p>The song, Jana-gana-mana, composed originally in Bengali by Rabindranath Tagore, was adopted in its Hindi version by the Constituent Assembly as the National Anthem of India on January 24, 1950. It was first sung on December 27, 1911 at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress. [1]</p><p>Whereas Wikipedia entry of National anthem mentions&nbsp;thus:</p><p>“Jana Gana Mana is the national anthem of India. Written in highly Sanskritised (Tatsama) Bengali.” [2]</p><p>E.g. 2:</p><p>Are these beautiful waterfalls on the Kaveri River located in Tamil Nadu — or on the border between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka — or in Tamil Nadu on its border with Karnataka? Or is it really the Cauvery river, and Hogenakal Falls?&nbsp;[3]</p><p>Whatever you believe, be sure to bring a (Google) map to the debate, and point out that your opponent’s sources are not RS or&nbsp;NPOV!</p><p>E.g. 3:</p><p>Born of Serbian parents in a part of the Austrian Empire, which a short time later became a part of the Hungarian half of Austria-Hungary and is now in Croatia. He eventually became a naturalized citizen of the US.&nbsp;[4]</p><p>So was he Serbian? Croatian? Austrian? Austro-Hungarian? Istro-Romanian? Jewish? American? Martian? You decide! But don’t forget to leave an edit summary saying how pathetic it is to choose any other version. (Guess who are we talking about?) Clue: He is inventor par excellence.</p><p>In this day and age where information is often a touch and go process, a forgotten mode, a solitary quest towards creating knowledge sounds romantic (almost). Networked collaborations (such as Wikipedia) which have created knowledge sites have led to democratic interpretation and assimilation of such knowledge. They also as a basic necessity have sprung up various modes of annotation, verifiability of the Knowledge thus produced and utility quotient of the same. After all, why create and hold on to information that no body really cares&nbsp;about.</p> Plan <p>In this discussion session, the co-leaders of the session shall attempt to peel out the benign face of the visible Wikipedia page(there is a hidden world out there) and discuss the political, technological and social contours of information available on Wikipedia. We shall take the participants through the various stages of discussion about a Wikipedia page and how discussions tend to alter the course of an article. How false consensus is proposed, consent is manufactured and how these efforts are usually defeated by ‘Answer People’ and ‘Vandal Fighters’. It is no less of a war than the one between information and mis-information. The discussion on, calculus, for instance, was host to some sparring over whether the concept of “limit,” central to calculus, should be better explained as an “average.”</p><p>This discussion session brings to the table questions of legitimisation of knowledge and the inherent hierarchies that operate even within open networks of collaboration and offers a critique on consumption oriented knowledge production. The session also aims to ask questions around knowledge as an agent that has levelled some of the earlier existing contours but has introduced some of its own and how that has changed our usages and shapes our experiences.</p><p>The session will involve an edit-a-thon on a topic that will be selected by the co-leaders of the session and live commentary on the discussion pages will be tracked for further analysis. The session intends to build a dialogue towards attempting to problematise the questions of the starkly hierarchical and segmented experiences that have played a significant role in production of knowledge in the era of new knowledge practices. The session also will question the ‘best practices’ in building consent in the present global techno-economic contours of the internet, and its effect on academic spaces, creative practice and intervention.</p> Readings   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Using_talk_pages">Using Talk&nbsp;Pages</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines">Talk page guidelines</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial/Talk_pages">Tutorial on Wikipedia talk&nbsp;pages</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_talk_pages/1">Introduction to talk&nbsp;pages</a>  <a href="https://cis-india.org/raw/www.networkcultures.org/_uploads/%237reader_Wikipedia.pdf">A Wikipedia Reader (pdf, 6.6&nbsp;MB)</a>   Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day2WikiShadows">IRC 2016: Day 2 #Wiki Shadows : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Tanveer Hasan works with the Wikimedia Foundation.

<p>Opportunity for public review ends November 17th</p> 

<p>We are pleased to announce that Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) Version 1.0 CSD03 from the OASIS Business Document Exchange (BDXR) TC is now available for public review and comment. This is the fourth public review for this work.</p>
<p>The Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) specifies an XML vocabulary for expressing, in machine-processable syntax, the semantics of describing either a header to or an envelope for a set of payloads of content. This is distinct from any transport-layer infrastructure header or envelope that may be required to propagate documents from one system to another. The metaphor of a paper envelope in which one places business documents for transport or management is an apt way to describe the role of an exchange header envelope. Concepts of routing, authentication, non-repudiation and concealment all apply in both the metaphor and the electronic equivalent.</p>
<p>XHE is developed jointly by UN/CEFACT and OASIS. It is the successor to the UN/CEFACT Standard Business Document Header (SBDH) Version 1.3 and the OASIS Business Document Envelope (BDE) Version 1.1. The vocabulary is modeled using the UN/CEFACT Core Component Technical Specification Version 2.01 [CCTS 2.01].</p>

<p>In recent months, the Web3 ecosystem has seen an explosion of of new tools and platforms that allow developers to build mature, sophisticated dweb applications with functionality that was previously unimaginable.</p><p>To celebrate this evolution in Web3, <a href="https://medium.com/3box/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity-48edc88e8e85">IDX</a> is teaming up with <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skydb-a-mutable-database-for-the-decentralized-web-7170beeaa985">SkyDB</a> to kick off a hackathon which gives you the opportunity to experiment with and build applications that combine these two new technologies.

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee and Atsuhiro Tscuhiya, APAC Market Development Team</p>



<p></p>



  



<p>[Snapshots of AMF Inauguration Members]</p>



<p>As the world struggles to contain the global pandemic, cybercriminals are launching their attacks and taking advantage of the anxiety and uncertainty that people are feeling. They impersonate trusted authorities or brands to mislead their victims. This is not surprising as cybercriminals are always on the lookout for opportunities and vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity ranks amongst the top ten global risks, and reducing cyber-risk exposure has become a priority for business leaders, according to the <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risk_Report_2020.pdf">World Economic Forum’s 2020 Global Risks Report</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, cybersecurity and technology experts overwhelmingly agree that reliance on passwords should be reduced if not totally scrapped: <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Passwordless_Authentication.pdf">80 percent</a> of all data breaches involve weak or stolen passwords, and <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Passwordless_Authentication.pdf">29 percent</a> of all attacks leverage the latter.</p>



<p>The use of passwords poses many challenges. As we increasingly live our lives and perform mission critical work online, safe access to connected devices and online services is more important than ever. The need to raise authentication standards and reduce reliance on passwords is now more urgent than ever.</p>



<p>APAC Marketing Forum</p>



<p>Since 2012, the FIDO Alliance has been working with organizations across Asia Pacific (APAC) to reduce the reliance on passwords and encourage the adoption of simpler and stronger approaches to authentication. Today, we have close to 40 members from both the public and private sector in this region.</p>



<p>Recently, more than 30 representatives from these member organizations got together for the very first FIDO Alliance APAC Marketing Forum (AMF). The AMF, held virtually, was an informal marketing related discussion.</p>



<p>The event provided a platform for members to connect, learn about each other’s markets and share best practices. It facilitated communication and cooperation amongst members, and the authentication industry as a whole.</p>



  



<p>Recent Initiatives in APAC</p>



<p>FIDO members in APAC also have made tremendous progress in recent months.</p>



<p>Companies that deployed FIDO authentication include PrivyID in Indonesia, and Japan-based NTT Docomo and KDDI. Furthermore, VinCSS became the first company in Vietnam to develop FIDO2-certified strong authentication servers.</p>



<p>FIDO also was included in official standards documents developed by the Taiwan Association of Information and Communication Standards (TAICS) and SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) Taiwan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also in Taiwan, the Taiwan-Cathay United Bank has added the FIDO logo to the latest version of its app, which was released to customers in August.</p>



<p>Additionally, we had successful events like the FIDO Security Key Support Campaign, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jnhklee_in-the-afternoon-of-july-1st-2020-a-mid-term-activity-6684348243301822464-d8Rv/">2020 FIDO Hackathon</a> – Goodbye Password Challenge that offered member organizations opportunities to interact with each other despite physical distancing.</p>



<p>Activities in the Pipeline</p>



<p>Moving forward, we aim to organize more of both digital and onsite collaborative marketing events where members can promote their innovations and share case studies. Currently, planned initiatives include:</p>



  FIDO Alliance virtual AMFs to be organized once every quarter, where post discussion updates will be shared through the FIDO Blog  FIDO Alliance quarterly member newsletter&nbsp;  Updated FIDO Alliance orientation material with contents customized for the needs of APAC members  



<p>We look forward to seeing you at the next virtual meeting in October!</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>If you wish to take part in these exciting new initiatives, or have any inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:tsuchiya@fidoalliance.org">tsuchiya@fidoalliance.org</a>.</p>



<p>By joining AMF, you will not only get to connect with key authentication players in APAC, but also gain benefits of participating in FIDO branded awareness and promotional activities together with global champions.</p>

     <p>Número Global de Artículo Comercial</p> <p>Una empresa puede utilizar los números globales de artículo comercial (GTIN) para identificar de forma única todos sus artículos comerciales. GS1 define los artículos comerciales como cualquier artículo (producto o servicio) sobre el cual existe la necesidad de recuperar información predefinida y que puede ser tasado, pedido o facturado en cualquier punto de cualquier cadena de suministro. Para obtener más información sobre GTIN, consulte las <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes-epcrfid-id-keys/gs1-general-specifications" title="Go to Especificaciones generales de GS1 ">Especificaciones generales de GS1</a>.</p> <p>Estructura de un GTIN</p> <p>Las empresas pueden obtener la licencia de un Prefijo GS1 de empresa de una Organización Miembro GS1, que viene con la documentación completa sobre cómo asignar GTIN a sus productos.</p> <p>Los GTIN deben tratarse como números no significativos. Esto significa que siempre deben registrarse y procesarse en su totalidad; ninguna parte del número se relaciona con ninguna clasificación ni transmite información alguna.</p> <p>Prefijo GS1 de empresa</p> <p>Los Prefijos GS1 de empresa se otorgan por parte de las Organizaciones Miembro de GS1 a una empresa usuaria para autorizarla a crear cualquiera de las claves de identificación GS1, como GTIN, SSCC o GIAI.</p> <p> Nota: Si bien el Prefijo GS1 de empresa puede usarse para determinar qué organización miembro de GS1 asignó el prefijo, no puede usarse para determinar dónde se produjo o distribuyó un artículo.</p> <p>UPC Prefijo de empresa</p> <p>AUPC El prefijo de empresa se deriva de un prefijo GS1 de empresa que comienza con cero ("0") al eliminar ese cero inicial. AUPC El prefijo de empresa DEBE utilizarse únicamente para construir identificadores de artículos comerciales de 12 dígitos (por ejemplo, GTIN-12). Cuando se agrega un cero a la izquierda a un UPC. El prefijo de empresa se convierte en un Prefijo GS1 de empresa que puede usarse para emitir todas las demás claves de identificación GS1.</p> <p> Nota: Por ejemplo, el UPC de 6 dígitos El prefijo de empresa 614141 se deriva del Prefijo GS1 de Empresa de 7 dígitos 0614141.</p> <p>Referencia del artículo</p> <p>La referencia del artículo es un componente del Número Global de Artículo Comercial (GTIN) asignado por la organización a la que el Prefijo GS1 de empresa o Prefijo de empresa UPC se ha otorgado para crear un GTIN único y es un número no significativo, lo que quiere decir que los dígitos individuales del número no se relacionan con ninguna clasificación ni transmiten información específica. La forma más sencilla de asignar las referencias de artículos es secuencialmente, es decir, 000, 001, 002, 003, etc.</p> <p>Dígito de verificación</p> <p>El dígito de verificación es el último dígito. Se calcula a partir de todos los demás dígitos del GTIN.</p> <p>La siguiente figura muestra las cuatro estructuras GTIN y cómo deben almacenarse en una base de datos. Los GTIN deben estar justificados a la derecha y llenados con ceros a la izquierda.</p> <p></p> <p>“N" representa el espacio numérico dentro de una base de datos o aplicación</p> <p>“D" representa el dígito asignado para cada posición del GTIN</p> <p> Nota 1: Cuando cualquiera de estos GTIN se codifica en un portador de datos que debe codificar una cadena de datos de longitud fija de 14 dígitos, los GTIN de menos de 14 dígitos de longitud debe tener como prefijo ceros que simplemente actúan como dígitos de relleno. Agregar ceros de relleno no cambia un GTIN-8, 12 o 13 a un GTIN-14. Sin embargo, los ceros de "relleno" no están codificados en códigos de barras EAN-8, UPC-A ni EAN-13.</p> <p> Nota: 2: El formato GTIN de 14 dígitos se utiliza en transacciones comerciales, especialmente para comercio electrónico (por ejemplo, pedidos electrónicos, facturas, catálogos de precios, etc.) y en la Red Global de Sincronización de Datos (GDSN).</p> <p>Indicador</p> <p>El indicador solo se usa en la estructura de datos GTIN-14. Toma el valor de 1 a 8 (consulte la Nota 1 a continuación) y se utiliza para niveles de acondicionamiento inferiores o superiores. La forma más sencilla de asignar el indicador es secuencialmente, es decir, 1, 2, 3… a cada grupo de artículos comerciales.</p> <p>Una agrupación uniforme de artículos comerciales es una agrupación ordenable de artículos comerciales idénticos. El propietario de la marca tiene la opción de asignar un GTIN-13 o GTIN-12 único a cada grupo o asignar un GTIN-14 único con un valor de dígito indicador de 1 a 8. Estos GTIN-14 incorporan el GTIN del artículo comercial (menos su dígito de verificación) contenido en cada grupo. Luego, se vuelve a calcular el dígito de verificación para cada GTIN-14. Debido a las opciones de valor de 1 a 8, se pueden crear ocho GTIN-14 separados y únicos a partir de un solo GTIN-13 o GTIN-12.</p> <p>Los dígitos del indicador no tienen significado. Los dígitos no tienen que usarse en orden secuencial y algunos pueden no usarse en absoluto. La estructura GTIN-14 para agrupaciones de artículos comerciales estándar crea una capacidad de numeración adicional. El dígito indicador se asigna según lo requiera la empresa que construye el GTIN.</p> <p> Nota 1: El valor del indicador 9 está reservado para elementos de medida variable. Medida variable: Si la medida de los artículos contenidos en una caja no está predefinida, entonces el artículo comercial es de medida variable. Algunos de los atributos relacionados con este artículo comercial de medida variable, como el conteo de unidades contenidas y el peso, por ejemplo, no están predefinidos, sino que solo se conocerán cuando se fabrique el producto. Debe decidirse por adelantado si un artículo es de medida fija con atributos esenciales predefinidos o de medida variable, donde una medida, como el conteo de unidades contenidas, no está predefinida, sino que es específica a cada instancia. En tales casos, se puede utilizar un GTIN-14 con el indicador 9 y el identificador de aplicación (30). Para obtener más información, consulte el conteo variable de elementos: Sección AI (30) de las <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes-epcrfid-id-keys/gs1-general-specifications" title="Go to Especificaciones ">Especificaciones</a> <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes-epcrfid-id-keys/gs1-general-specifications" title="Go to generales de GS1 ">generales de GS1</a>. Se encuentra información adicional sobre la medida variable en las siguientes secciones de la Especificación General de GS1: Artículos comerciales de medida variable escaneados en distribución general y artículos comerciales de medida variable escaneados en el punto de venta minorista.</p> <p> Nota 2: Algunos escáneres en puntos de venta minoristas pueden no ser capaces de leer e interpretar simbologías de códigos de barras que no sean EAN/UPC, que no pueden codificar un GTIN-14.</p> <p> Nota 3: Consulte las secciones GTIN de las <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes-epcrfid-id-keys/gs1-general-specifications" title="Go to Especificaciones generales de GS1 ">Especificaciones generales de GS1</a> para obtener más información.</p> <p> Nota 4: Para obtener más información sobre cómo construir un GTIN, consulte <a href="https://www.gs1.org/services/activate/how-to-create-a-GTIN" title="Go to Cómo crear un GTIN ">Cómo crear un GTIN</a> en el sitio web de GS1 o <a href="https://www.gs1.org/contact" title="Go to comunicarse con su Organización Miembro de GS1 local ">comunicarse con su Organización Miembro de GS1 local</a>.</p>

     <p>Dentro del sector salud hay muchos ejemplos de marcados de certificación. Un marcado de certificación es un símbolo, logotipo o texto en un producto que declara la conformidad con un conjunto regulado de criterios (por ejemplo, el marcado de certificación europea CE). Cuando se cambia un producto para incluir un marcado de certificación (que no se mostraba anteriormente en el empaque o el producto en sí), se debe asignar un nuevo GTIN para los mercados donde el marcado de certificación es relevante. Un principio clave de la asignación de GTIN es que el GTIN identifica de forma única el producto la configuración de su acondicionamiento.</p> <p>Un cambio en el acondicionamiento para agregar un marcado de certificación nuevo o eliminar un marcado de certificación existente (por ejemplo, el marcado de certificación europea CE), que tenga importancia para los organismos regulatorios, los socios comerciales o el consumidor final, requiere la asignación de un nuevo GTIN.</p> <p>Niveles jerárquicos de asignación de GTIN:</p> <p>■ El cambio de GTIN ocurre en el nivel de la unidad base.</p> <p>■ Se asigna un GTIN único en cada nivel existente de la jerarquía de acondicionamiento superior del nivel de la unidad base.</p> <p>Ejemplos de escenarios comerciales que requieren un cambio de GTIN:</p> <p>Los marcados de certificación que aparecen o cambian en las etiquetas de los productos que afectan los canales de distribución global debido a la licencia o el registro del país deben comunicarse entre los socios comerciales y, por lo tanto, requieren un cambio de GTIN.</p> <p> </p> <p>Figura 1-16 Inclusión de un marcado de certificación: GTIN nuevo</p> <p></p> <p>Sin embargo, también debe tenerse en cuenta que cuando se agrega un marcado de certificación para permitir las ventas en un nuevo país/mercado, esto no tiene impacto en los países/mercados donde el producto se vendió anteriormente; en este caso, no es necesario asignar un nuevo GTIN en el escenario anterior.</p> <p>Información adicional:</p> <p>Los propietarios de marcas son responsables del control interno de su inventario y de cualquier sistema de devolución. Es importante que dichos sistemas, así como la gestión logística de introducción y eliminación, puedan distinguir entre productos "antiguos" y "nuevos". Cuando esto se puede lograr de manera eficaz, por ejemplo, utilizando el número de lote o la variante del producto, no es necesario asignar un nuevo GTIN en este escenario si la cadena de suministro externa no se ve afectada.</p> <p> Nota: Tenga en cuenta los requisitos del cliente, los regulatorios y los del mercado objetivo si se trata de una práctica implementada.</p> <p>Principios rectores relevantes:</p> <p> </p>   <p>Nombre de la regla GTIN</p>   <p>¿Se espera que un consumidor, paciente, proveedor de atención y/o socio comercial distinga el producto nuevo o cambiado de los productos anteriores/actuales?</p>   <p>¿Existe un requisito de divulgación regulatoria/de responsabilidad para el consumidor y/o socio comercial?</p>   <p>¿Existe un impacto sustancial en la cadena de suministro y los socios comerciales (por ejemplo, cómo se envía, almacena, recibe o manipula el producto en el entorno clínico)?</p>   <p>Agregar o quitar el marcado de certificación</p>   <p>SÍ</p>   <p>SÍ</p>   <p>SÍ</p>   <p> </p>

      Un cambio de más del 20% a una dimensión física, en cualquier eje (por ejemplo, altura, ancho, profundidad) o peso bruto, requiere la asignación de un GTIN nuevo.    Nota: Los cambios por debajo del 20% pueden requerir un nuevo GTIN, a criterio del propietario de la marca.   Niveles jerárquicos de asignación de GTIN:   ■ La asignación de GTIN se da a nivel de artículo comercial o unidad base.

<p>By Mike Kubzansky, CEO, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>2020 has challenged and consumed us — as individuals and as a society. From the pandemic to politics, to the severe economic downturn and the desperate cries for Black lives to matter; too many across the country and around the globe are struggling — financially, physically, and mentally.</p><p>We are at times scared, or angry, or resigned, and a pervasive sense of helplessness underpins so much of current daily life, across whole swathes of society. Yet so many people have remained remarkably resilient and resolute. We have donned our masks and taken to the streets to peacefully protest, help at food banks, or simply serve as poll watchers. We have prayed, meditated, eaten (and then tried to exercise) our way through this year of chaos and uncertainty. Several of us even got new kittens or&nbsp;puppies.</p><p>While everyone has different coping mechanisms, there is one thing I hope we all do:&nbsp;vote.</p><p>As political scientist Larry Sabato said, “Every election is determined by the people who show up.” Whether it’s by mail, drop box, in person, early, or on election day (masked, of course), we must all show up. We believe deeply in democracy. It is the bedrock of this nation, and it will only be of, for, and by all the people if we all vote. That’s why Omidyar Network signed <a href="http://adayfordemocracy.com/">A Day for Democracy</a> pledge to give our staff in the US time off to vote and do their civic&nbsp;duty.</p><p>And when voters do their civic duty, their votes must be counted. We are proud of the work of our sister organization, <a href="http://democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a>, and many of our grantees like <a href="http://communitychangeaction.org/">Community Change Action</a>, <a href="https://demosaction.org/">Demos Action,</a> <a href="http://citizen.org/">Public Citizen</a>, and <a href="http://jwj.org/">Jobs With Justice</a> for their ongoing efforts to dismantle barriers to voting, so that everyone who is eligible can vote with ease — <a href="http://www.protecttheresults.org/">and can trust that election outcomes are legitimate</a>, so that we have genuine majority rule by a full and fully empowered electorate. It’s also why I signed on to <a href="https://medium.com/world-justice-project/a-joint-appeal-to-protect-the-rule-of-law-in-the-2020-u-s-elections-1f1f6876b351">World Justice Project’s letter</a>, along with a number of other foundation presidents, demanding that the rule of law is protected to ensure the security and integrity of the elections.</p><p>We cannot let expediency outweigh accuracy. We must be patient as election officials do their jobs and count every vote, even if it takes extra time before a winner is declared. Ensuring that every vote is counted will enhance the legitimacy of the election and strengthen our democracy.</p><p>While democracy is not a focus area for Omidyar Network — nor is improving its functioning our mission — it weaves through much of our work to strengthen technology and the economy. And pluralism, if true to its ideals, should have spillover benefits that improve democracy.</p><p>In Responsible Technology, we know that online platforms with outsized power can ravage our democracy by allowing unfettered hate, bigotry, racism, antisemitism, and disinformation to run rampant. We support organizations leading the <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">#StopHateforProfit</a> campaign to call on Facebook to change its policies that inflame intolerance and undermine democracy. We also support <a href="https://graphika.com/">Graphika’s</a> investigations into domestic disinformation and potential foreign interference in the 2020 election, as well as its partnership with the <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/">Election Integrity Partnership</a>, which identifies instances aimed to “prevent or deter people from voting or to delegitimize election results.”</p><p>In our call to <a href="https://omidyar.com/our-call-to-reimagine-capitalism-in-america/">reimagine capitalism</a>, we recognize that democracy and the economy are fundamentally intertwined. We cannot address one without taking into account the other. Concentrated economic power too easily spills over into political power. That has resulted in policies that prevent the economic interests of the many from being fulfilled. We are working to address these imbalances, and support communities, working families, and small businesses to have greater power and voice in the economic decisions that impact their&nbsp;futures.</p><p>We also cannot reflect on American democracy without reflecting on race. The US is still not living up to its democratic ideal in which all people are created — and treated — as equal. In addition to the continued horror of the 164 Black individuals who have been killed by police through August, we see every day continued work <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/poll-prri-voter-suppression/565355/">to disenfranchise and suppress voting by Black and brown voters</a>. So it’s not surprising that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/us/election-nonvoters.html">some voters drop out of the system and choose to simply not participate</a> — real change has been too slow to&nbsp;come.</p><p>We know that change won’t always happen as quickly as we would like — or many times need — but it will happen. Voting is the first step on this journey toward a more just and equal&nbsp;future.</p><p>As President Obama said in Philadelphia at a rally last week, “Voting’s about using the power we have, and pooling it together to get a government that’s more concerned, and more responsive, and more focused on you and your lives and your children, and your grandchildren, and future generations. And the fact that we don’t get 100% of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote. It means we’ve got to vote, and then get some change, and then vote some more, and then get some more change, and then keep on voting until we get it&nbsp;right.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/keep-voting-until-we-get-it-right-88e3cb4611ab">Keep Voting Until We Get it Right</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What Digital Contact Tracing Can Teach Us About Public Trust, Health Equity, and Governance in the United&nbsp;States  Reflections from over a dozen Digital Pandemic Response Working Group meetings hosted by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University. <p>By Adam Nagy with contributions from Hilary&nbsp;Ross</p>Screenshot from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0tD98B4SBM&amp;ab_channel=TheBerkmanKleinCenterforInternet%26Society">visual tutorial on digital contact tracing </a>narrated by DPR Working Group Co-Chair Professor Jonathan Zittrain and produced by the BKC Digital Pandemic Response staff team. This animated sequence illustrated how Bluetooth enabled exposure notification systems function.<p>As of October 2020, COVID-19 cases are continuing to climb across much of the world. The global economy is in tatters. Education, commerce, worship, and all things in between remain disrupted. Over a million people are&nbsp;dead.</p><p>The overall situation was resoundingly similar five months ago when the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society launched its Policy Practice focusing on <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/bkc-policy-practice-digital-pandemic-response">Digital Pandemic Response</a> (DPR), along with a Digital Pandemic Response Working Group (“Working Group”). With generous support from the Ford Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, and MacArthur Foundation, the DPR Program and Working Group emerged as the linchpins of BKC’s response to the crisis. As members of the BKC staff supporting this project, we’ve had the opportunity to join the Working Group as observers, scribes, and contributors: the following is a snapshot of what we considered to be some of the significant learnings, unturned stones, and ongoing debates of the Working Group over the past several&nbsp;months.</p> About the Working&nbsp;Group <p>Amidst clouds of uncertainty, group members saw an opportunity to attenuate this unprecedented crisis — if not in whole, at least in part — using the equally unprecedented capabilities of the digital age. We wanted to examine those opportunities together, building bridges and regularly convening experts and policymakers from across sectors to dig into the complex social, technical, and political questions, and sharing learnings as we went. To start, the Working Group focused on contact tracing, an essential pillar of an effective public health response and a key locus for significant human and technological investment.</p><p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/bkc-policy-practice-digital-pandemic-response">Composed of representatives from public health, technology, and state government, alongside civil liberties advocates, legal experts, and academics</a>, the Working Group has operated as a weekly venue for issue-spotting, collaboration, and candid, Chatham House Rule discussion with invitees. The group’s attention has largely focused on the use of information and communications technology (ICT) to support or supplement traditional contact tracing efforts. Over the course of this work, the group gravitated towards several key questions around how technology and access to data can support contact tracing — and surfaced important concerns related to technical limitations, public health efficacy, and civil liberties risks. Succinctly, these interrelated domains are the essential relationship between public trust and digital interventions, the risks of uneven costs and benefits of digital interventions, and the urgent need for increased coordination between and among the private sector, public health professionals, researchers, and political leadership.</p> The Essential Relationship Between Public Trust and Digital Interventions <p>The pandemic struck at a time when Americans’ trust in government, institutions, in experts, and in information is at <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/09/14/americans-views-of-government-low-trust-but-some-positive-performance-ratings/">near-record lows</a>. And it is precisely among some of the hardest-hit communities where these deficits are most well-founded — why should an undocumented immigrant trust a government-employed contact tracer? Why should people of color, especially Black Americans, trust that an app won’t use their data to harm them in the future? Why should anybody trust a tech company not to sell, misuse, or otherwise fail to protect their&nbsp;data?</p><p>This is an enormous problem, and barring enforced mandates, tools in the public health kit hinge on the public’s willingness to use them.<a href="https://medium.com/@ugasser/trust-and-digital-contact-tracing-initial-insights-from-the-swiss-proximity-tracing-system-27291eae1c"> Trust is a key enabler when it comes to the efficacy of different pandemic responses</a> from population-level interventions such as wearing masks and social distancing, to downloading an app or picking up the phone to share information with a contact&nbsp;tracer.</p><p>More Privacy or More Data — Debating Difficult Trade-Offs:</p><p>Given this environment, many digital solutions, most notably the Apple and Google Exposure Notification system (GAEN), prioritized preserving user privacy at the expense of providing contact tracers with more comprehensive contextual data. Reasonable minds may (and do) disagree about whether any individual approach gets the balance of trade-offs right.<a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-apple-google-contact-tracing-ee3432c8-a150-4f71-a190-67dbdc2157b6.html"> GAEN is considered the ‘gold standard’ from a privacy standpoint</a>, but there are a host of non-GAEN digital contact tracing apps in development or in use around the world. What is clear is that robust privacy protections are intended to make adoption more palatable for wary governments and populations. But a privacy-preserving app is certainly not a sufficient condition for high adoption among a population — <a href="https://apnews.com/b05e442f8d1bc23252b872c289a2b063">adoption rates differ significantly across countries even when the underlying technology is identical </a>— and adoption rates, while a crucial metric, are not a perfect proxy for efficacy and actual public health&nbsp;impact.</p><p>Even once someone has downloaded a digital contact tracing or exposure notification app, opportunities for attrition abound. First, users must activate the app and keep it on. Upon receiving a positive test result or an exposure notification users must be proactive — either uploading their result to warn others or heeding the instructions accompanying the exposure notification. In other words, it is not enough for people to simply download the app. As Working Group member Mary Gray has written<a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/colorblind-tech-is-killing-us-why-covid-19-tech-must-focus-on-equity-9cd2b67cf84c"> elsewhere</a>, solving the “wicked hard tech problem” of notifying exposed individuals in a privacy-preserving way does not solve the critical last mile problem of routing them to trusted care workers and ensuring they self-quarantine with the necessary support to weather COVID-19. Accomplishing that task — under the privacy-protective constraints of GAEN — will require creative, non-technical solutions such as employing trusted local institutions or community members to serve as extensions of public health agencies to encourage participating in contact tracing programs — digital or otherwise — and to connect people who’ve tested positive to necessary resources.</p><p>Trust, but Verify: Evaluating Efficacy</p><p>Aside from users, there is an additional, crucial layer of trust: do public health authorities have confidence in the contact tracing app? A major unresolved barrier to buy-in concerns the lack of large-scale, replicated studies measuring the efficacy of these digital interventions. While developers have expressed concern with ‘analysis paralysis’ and the slow pace at which jurisdictions adopt these apps — arguing in favor of deploying quickly and making improvements down the line — it is difficult to expect jurisdictions to invest time and resources into still under-proven products. There are significant concerns around the costs of releasing technologies that are not proven as efficacious in terms of spent political capital, eroded public trust, and overall reduced adoption rates. Striking the right balance will remain challenging until there is more data available on the efficacy of these interventions.</p><p>In the interim, technologists and developers must work diligently to reduce other areas of uncertainty and pain points for public sector implementers. These include the potential for privacy and security breaches, overall cost, and lack of input from subject matter experts during the design process. Organizations like the<a href="https://www.lfph.io/"> Linux Foundation for Public Health (LFPH)</a> have attempted to reduce these challenges by channeling the attention of the OS community and substantial resources to the increasingly widely adopted GAEN-enabled COVID Shield and COVID Green apps, vetting developers and firms for jurisdictions to work with, and producing useful guidance documentation. Google and Apple’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/01/apple-google-exposure-notification-express/">Exposure Notifications Express</a> — turn-key solutions to building and launching a contact tracing app — will expedite adoption while allowing local authorities to customize certain key elements. The willingness of organizations to serve as ‘air-traffic’ controllers — certifying third-party vendors, scaling testing, creating replicable best practices, and working closely with local officials and public health authorities — will be critical drivers of trust and&nbsp;buy-in.</p><p>Takeaways and Calls to&nbsp;Action:</p>  State and local public health leaders and policymakers should urgently invest in building and strengthening relationships with locally trusted community groups, which are critical to helping individuals and communities collectively support each other and understand strategies to weather COVID-19. In states that have adopted exposure notification apps, community groups could help members understand privacy-preserving exposure notification tech as part of a suite of holistic supports.  As exposure notification and digital contact tracing technology is so new, we need further research on its efficacy. Who is responsible for evaluating efficacy, potential adverse effects, and the impact of these technologies across a variety of communities? What monitoring structures ought to be put into practice? (For example, Ireland established a <a href="https://github.com/HSEIreland/covidtracker-documentation/blob/master/documentation/privacy/Data%20Protection%20Impact%20Assessment%20for%20the%20COVID%20Tracker%20App%20-%2026.06.2020.pdf">COVID Tracker App Advisory Committee</a> to continually assess the efficacy of the app alongside a mechanism to wind-down the app in 90 days if they find it ineffective.) What might cross-sector evaluation of these technologies look like, with companies, researchers, policymakers, and community groups working in collaboration? A complete cost-benefit analysis for policymakers will require research into a variety of questions — many of which are outlined in this <a href="https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20324">robust research agenda from the University of Zurich</a>. Some of this work is <a href="https://github.com/digitalepidemiologylab/swisscovid_efficacy/blob/master/SwissCovid_efficacy_MS.pdf">already underway</a> — and it might be a useful exercise to catalog the existing literature.   Health (In)Equities: Uneven Costs and Benefits of Digital Interventions <p>The impacts of COVID-19 are not distributed equally — its devastating effects fall most heavily along pre-existing lines of socioeconomic and racial inequality. <a href="https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race">COVID-19 death rates are disproportionately high across communities of color</a>, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2020/20_0255.htm">especially among Black Americans who are more likely to contract COVID-19, be hospitalized for it, and die of the disease in comparison to other racial groups</a>. Longstanding disparities in access to health insurance, employment, education, quality healthcare, environmental justice, and other rights, increase the prevalence of comorbidities in Black, Latino/Hispanic, Native Americans, and Pacific Islander populations making them more vulnerable to COVID than other racial groups. In addition to causing compounding pre-existing medical conditions, social determinants can make transmission events more likely. For example, racial minorities in general and Black Americans in particular, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-racism-is-shaping-the-coronavirus-pandemic">are more likely than non-Hispanic White populations to use public transit as a primary mode of transport, to live in densely populated areas and in multigenerational households, and to work in essential frontline jobs that preclude isolating at home.</a> The Working Group has grappled with how digital public health interventions account for these disparities and can risk exacerbating them&nbsp;further.</p><p>Data Disparities</p><p>A major issue of concern raised to the Working Group pertains to gaps in state and federal public health agency data collection regimes, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0033354917745503#bibr14-0033354917745503">particularly with respect to important demographic information such as race, ethnicity, language, and other factors</a>. In the absence of this data, <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/07/a-data-driven-approach-to-addressing-racial-disparities-in-health-care-outcomes">doctors and epidemiologists have had to build improvised solutions</a> in order to better understand the disparate impacts of COVID-19 and create response strategies. These innovations, while highly impressive, are ad hoc and cannot substitute for improvements in collection, universal data standards, and best practices. Of course, the collection of demographic data is fraught — <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/09/743296249/why-is-the-census-bureau-still-asking-a-citizenship-question-on-forms">take, for instance, the legal fight over the inclusion of a citizenship status question in the 2020 Census</a> — and without robust safeguards and public trust in how the data will be used there are risks such as stigmatization or suppressed response among vulnerable populations. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2012910">Scholars Merlin Chowkwanyun and Adolph Reed Jr. recently explored the risks of relying on demographic data without also considering socioeconomic status data in The New England Journal of Medicine</a>, arguing inter alia that on its own demographic data can erroneously feed perceptions that a social problem is actually a “primarily racial” one, which in turn can be “used to rationalize neglect and funding cuts.” They go on to argue in favor of incorporating data on socioeconomic factors alongside demographic information to help preempt these dangers, discover how risks intersect across different racial and social lines, and also draw attention to racial disparities. Data collection that ignores these key areas limits healthcare professionals’ ability to develop a complete hierarchy of risk on which to base the prioritization of care and resources.</p><p>The Working Group also discussed the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340108912_Aggregated_mobility_data_could_help_fight_COVID-19">potential of aggregated mobility data</a> from mobile operators and sources like <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid19/">GPS trace data from social media applications</a> to inform epidemiological models and to provide policymakers with important insights regarding movement patterns and a way to evaluate the efficacy of different strategies. But this data must be interpreted in context: urban and rural populations behave differently, as do communities of differing socioeconomic status. Further, data quality gets worse in rural areas. Each of these factors must be considered in interpreting data, finding and correcting for biases, and comparing across datasets.</p><p>Digital Divides</p><p>App-based digital contact tracing solutions risk leaving disproportionately vulnerable populations at a further disadvantage due to unequal access to smartphones. Furthermore, false alerts from inaccurate digital contact tracing tools will have greater impacts on essential workers — disproportionately people of color — who cannot work from home more than white-collar workers. Because the costs of a false-positive exposure notification are not borne equally, policymakers ought to consider necessary legal protections and social benefits to support individuals alerted that they should quarantine for 14-days. Overall, there is inadequate investment of key resources to protect communities of color; this lack of investment has both contributed to and revealed inequalities that make populations of color more susceptible to the&nbsp;virus.</p><p>Takeaways and Calls for&nbsp;Action:</p>  In order to understand people’s lived experiences of the pandemic and develop equitable mitigation strategies to protect communities, data-collecting organizations — both government agencies and academics — should be collecting relevant disaggregated health data on race, ethnicity, language, socioeconomic status, and environmental factors that contribute to inequities, such as ventilation and levels of crowding in living conditions.  Policymakers, the private sector, and academics should consider how mobility data moves across sectors and ensure that government actors use datasets in a manner that is proportionate and necessary to achieve a legitimate aim. Social media data, adtech data, and data from third-party aggregators are particularly sensitive, and in some jurisdictions privacy regulations are far less rigorous than those imposed on mobile operator&nbsp;data.  People need support to be able to effectively self-isolate and quarantine, but lack of resources prevents many people from being able to do so. Policymakers, community groups, and other relevant institutions should strongly consider offering funding and other community-based support to those who need to self-isolate and quarantine and therefore are unable to work. Policymakers should implement legal protections to protect those who need to self-isolate and quarantine from a broad range of adverse impacts at work, at home, and in their communities.   Domestic Disarray: The Urgent Need for Increased Coordination in the United&nbsp;States <p>In the United States, the COVID-19 response has been stymied from the start due to the Trump administration’s decision to delegate many decisions to industry, state, or local leaders. The lack of a national strategy on everything from mandatory mask requirements to the allocation of protective equipment has proven disastrous. Federal leadership and coordination of contact tracing efforts — digital or otherwise — continues to be lackluster. Expanding the contact tracing workforce, creating technological components, and bolstering public trust in contact tracing has been left to the states, albeit with guidance, assistance, and funding available from the Center for Disease Control and other agencies. What have been the consequences of limited federal coordination of contact tracing efforts across jurisdictions and the lack of standardized tools and practices? What is filling in the gaps? And looking outwards, are there lessons to be learned from international contexts?</p><p>Weighing the Costs and Benefits of a Decentralized Approach</p><p>Most countries engaged in digital contact tracing adopt a singular, national app. The United States has taken a decentralized approach. Currently, a growing number of states and territories use GAEN enabled apps, South Dakota, Utah, and Rhode Island use GPS-based apps, and the majority of states do not have an app. Meanwhile, employers, universities, and other private entities are steadily developing or adopting their own hyper-local solutions.</p><p>Decentralization gives the public health authorities actually engaged in contact tracing more flexibility with respect to the allocation of their funds and energies, enables them to customize apps according to their needs, and crucially, affords them the freedom to decide between GAEN and competing approaches.</p><p>But there are obvious trade-offs to this heterogeneous approach. These include the uneven adoption of digital contact tracing (most states still don’t have an app), interoperability problems, and a disjointed outreach/communications strategy. Thankfully, different GAEN enabled-apps can now communicate exposure events to one another across state lines if they are configured to use the <a href="https://www.aphl.org/programs/preparedness/Crisis-Management/COVID-19-Response/Pages/exposure-notifications.aspx">Association of Public Laboratories national key server</a> — but not all of them are configured to do so, non-GAEN apps do not work with the server, and it took months (and the generosity of private actors) to get the system up and&nbsp;running.</p><p>Lessons from&nbsp;Europe</p><p>A state-by-state model did not, however, force the Federal government to the sidelines. The European Union, which also adopted a decentralized approach, is instructive. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/travel-during-coronavirus-pandemic/mobile-contact-tracing-apps-eu-member-states_en">Nearly every EU member state has a digital contact tracing app</a> with far higher adoption rates than seen in the United States — and there are significant ways in which the EU has been more proactive than the Federal government.</p><p>Standardizing and clarifying privacy protections and requirements is one such aspect. Congress has proposed several COVID-19 privacy bills, but none have passed, so currently<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10511"> no single federal law creates consistent and clearly-applicable privacy protections with respect to contact tracing</a>. The European Commission and the European Data Protection Board, on the other hand, have issued legal guidelines and decisions to EU Member States regarding digital contact tracing (See, <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-042020-use-location-data-and-contact-tracing_en">1</a>, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020XC0417%2808%29">2</a>, and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/covid-19_apps_en.pdf">3</a>), aggregated mobility data (See, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reco/2020/518/oj">1</a> and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/modelling_mobilitydata_en.pdf">2</a>) and <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.LI.2020.227.01.0001.01.ENG">interoperability</a>.</p><p>Providing detailed technical guidance and assistance is another. The CDC guidelines to states around digital contact tracing are<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/php/guidelines-digital-tools-contact-tracing.pdf"> high-level and cursory</a>. Federal assets such as 18F or the U.S. Digital Service, which could have been deployed to assist states with the design and roll-out of their own apps, have not been empowered to do so. Meanwhile, EU organs have produced <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/mobileapps_interoperabilitydetailedelements_en.pdf">significant technical guidance to Member States</a> as well as concrete technical solutions — most notably creating a single European Federation Gateway Service to make GAEN apps interoperable.</p><p>Other entities have attempted to fill the leadership vacuum left by the Federal government. Private non-profit organizations such as the <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> or <a href="https://pathcheck.org/">PathCheck Foundation</a> are providing jurisdictions with technical assistance and solidifying best practices. Organizations such as the National Governors Association, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, and many others are using their coordinating power and expertise to issue recommendations to members and concentrate efforts.</p><p>Takeaways and Calls to&nbsp;Action:</p>  Fully launched in October, the “Federation Gateway” enables European Union Member States with properly configured GAEN-apps to interoperate. Launched in July, the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) National Key Server and Verification Server allows properly configured GAEN-apps in U.S. states and territories to interoperate. While the end results are similar the associated processes were markedly different. In the EU, the European Commission led work with member states to coordinate on <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/contacttracing_mobileapps_guidelines_en.pdf">interoperability guidelines</a>, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/key_documents_en#anchor0">technical specifications</a>, and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.LI.2020.227.01.0001.01.ENG">adoption of a legal basis for the service</a>. In the United States, the APHL, a non-governmental non-profit, partnered with Apple, Google, and Microsoft to create and host a national exposure key server (as well as a unified verification server). The APHL-led approach brought an interoperable server online more quickly than the European Commission’s effort, but is it possible that the EU’s holistic approach will offer more enduring lessons? Our goal — if not for this pandemic, than at least the next one — ought to be a globally interoperable system for digital contact tracing. Accomplishing this will require tremendous synchronization across diverse legal and policy architectures. The EU’s effort, which confronted not only the technical question but legal questions as well, is a step in that direction.  Uneven state-level adoption of contact tracing apps opened the door to hyper-local test and trace solutions by private institutions, namely universities and employers. Labeled the “<a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/is-digital-contact-tracing-over-before-it-began-925c72036ee7">company-town model</a>” by Working Group Co-Chair Prof. Jonathan Zittrain, this approach has had some unsavory real-world consequences.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/coronavirus-albion-security-flaws-app/"> In one extreme example, Albion College deployed a mandatory app with around the clock location surveillance that was discovered to have several security flaws, endangering the privacy of their students</a>. As the chief enforcers of privacy protection laws, state attorneys general must remain vigilant about the privacy impacts of these apps — and would do well to issue guidelines to developers to help ensure safeguards are met. In instances where a private institution has both a large footprint in a community as well as the resources to conduct a rigorous testing and tracing program — as is the case with Harvard University — decision-makers ought to consider how to mitigate any negative community effects reopening may&nbsp;cause.   Concluding Thoughts <p>The early success of digital contact tracing in countries like South Korea — <a href="https://undark.org/2020/10/05/south-korea-covid-19-success/">which had a critical combination of high levels of public trust, a legal framework that enabled sweeping public health surveillance using a variety of data sources, and a robust pandemic response infrastructure</a> — inoculated belief in mobile technology as a critical tool to fight the spread of COVID. That belief persists in many corners, as evidenced by the slow but steady rollout of different contact tracing apps throughout the US and globally, but it has been tempered.</p><p>A silver bullet solution was always unlikely. An app cannot solve for an impoverished public healthcare infrastructure, for inadequate support of the sick and the possibly sick, or for leaders that actively spread misinformation and undermine trust in scientific authorities. But ‘no-app’ doesn’t solve these issues&nbsp;either.</p><p>Digital contact tracing solutions are arrows in our quiver, silver or otherwise, and ones that are increasingly affordable and accessible to public health authorities. The challenge now is making them as effective as possible and also, as with any weapon, working to prevent unintended harms. Invested stakeholders can re-invigorate enthusiasm for these solutions by supporting research that investigates the effectiveness of ongoing efforts and ways to improve their effectiveness. There are legitimate concerns that ineffective or insecure tools will erode the public’s trust in government-sponsored technological solutions or that the impacts of false positives will be unequally distributed. Authorities need to have a transparent plan for not only monitoring the effectiveness of these interventions in breaking transmission chains but also to guard against unintended consequences, particularly for already vulnerable or disenfranchised populations.</p><p>Until a vaccine is developed and widely dispersed, our work will continue. Despite the fact that many schools and workplaces are reopened (at least partially) and that states are easing restrictions on various activities such as indoor dining, we are still deep in this crisis. As the Working Group looks towards engaging in new topics — such as vaccine distribution schemes — it’s crucial to take stock of what we’ve learned during our examination of digital contact tracing, why we wrestled with these questions, and how we can best use what we’ve learned moving&nbsp;forward.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/what-digital-contact-tracing-can-teach-us-about-public-trust-health-equity-and-governance-in-the-510ce5f2c6f6">What Digital Contact Tracing Can Teach Us About Public Trust, Health Equity, and Governance in the…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; In which sector(s) and country(ies) do you operate?</p>
<p>Airside’s privacy-based digital identity solutions help individuals and organizations share, verify, and manage personal information. While Airside started with the goal of using mobile technology to drive convenience throughout the travel experience, we believe no one should have to choose between convenience and privacy in any digital exchange of personal information. Our products and services are available and operational globally across a variety of sectors, such as travel, tourism, health, financial services, and more.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; What is your current market focus and what needs and areas of concern does your service/product address?</p>
<p>Our new Airside App is facilitating an easy and safe way for airline travelers to share their verified IDs from their mobile device, then self-check their luggage with facial recognition technology at the airport. Our app may also be used to enable other seamless, touchless, biometric experiences in the travel sector. For instance, our interoperable solution allows airports and airlines to implement the ID verification process without asking travelers to re-enroll information for each trip or sacrifice the privacy of sensitive information, enabling airports and airlines to provide the best experience for customers and employees.</p>
<p>Coming soon, Airside will also enable the sharing of verified COVID test results. Individuals can easily add their verified results to the new Airside App directly from a certified lab and securely share the results with an employer, travel operator, venue, and more. These organizations gain confidence that test results have not been tampered with and are compliant with local public health requirements, and worldwide privacy regulations.</p>
<p>Since 2014, our award-winning Mobile Passport App expedites a safe process through U.S. customs by U.S. and Canadian passport holders. Mobile Passport is the first app authorized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (U.S. CBP) and is trusted by over nine million people.</p>
<p> 3. &nbsp; &nbsp; In what ways does your service/product push beyond the state-of-the-art? </p>
<p>Privacy and security are at the core of everything we build, and now, more than ever, the integrity of our virtual selves is of the utmost importance. We see how identity theft and identity fraud have skyrocketed with the rapid need for technology during COVID-19. While there may be other ways to verify and share IDs and other personal information, Airside does so in a way that is user-controlled and consent-driven, putting the individual in control of their data. This mitigates health and security risks that come with tedious and often inconsistent paper processes, human intervention and low-grade technology.</p>
<p>Our products and services build a connection of digital trust between people and the organizations with whom they share their ID(s). What’s more, Airside cannot access, does not own, and will not sell the information transmitted using our network. We only keep transaction records (which do not contain any personal information) for audit purposes.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; Where do you see the market trending in the mid/long term and how do you see your product/service playing into it?</p>
<p>The paradigm for digital identity has shifted and Airside is uniquely built in such a way to lead the industry with the highest levels of security and privacy standards. Digital identity now serves a critical function for everyday tasks. People are digitally sharing everything, from driver’s licenses and passports to school records and gym memberships. At the same time, the general public is becoming more aware and empowered by well-known privacy regulations, like GDPR and CCPA. Biometrics, for instance, is no longer a topic for tech-savvy early adopters. There is an immediate need for it and the secure transaction of all personal information. So, while people will continue to seek more virtual opportunities to conduct certain transactions, they’ll increasingly look for organizations or businesses that keep them safe, physically and digitally.</p>
<p>A lot of industries hit by COVID-19 are going to rebound and those who commit to personal data rights will do so faster than others. We’re eager to work with industries seeking to keep their employees and customers safe and healthy using our secure, scalable solutions to manage personal information with transparency.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; Why were you motivated to join Kantara Initiative and how do you see it helping your organization specifically, and the digital economy as a whole?</p>
<p>Airside has great respect for Kantara Initiative’s work to make our complex, connected lives ones that are user-centric, consent-driven, and ultimately, built on trust. We were motivated to join Kantara Initiative to help us establish an architecture where a clear, unambiguous information exchange can take place. Using Kantara’s Consent Receipt specifications, we are able to offer our partners a service that eliminates the need for centralized databases of personal information and greatly simplifies their compliance requirements. This also provides our network members with clarity of the scope of their personal information and control as to when, how and with whom to share it in a focused, deliberative manner.</p>
<p>It’s a huge step when we can bind our secure and convenient technology with first-class privacy and data protection principles, as standardized by Kantara and echoed in various data protection laws, regulations and international standards. Being together in the global, thought-leading digital economy with Kantara means that Airside’s digital identity privacy network has put the highest levels of privacy assurance and interoperability into real-life practice.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; What other significant aspects about your organization (service/product) should our global community know about?</p>
<p>Airside has always believed that privacy is a human right and builds secure and convenient digital identity technology in a manner that protects personal information and meets privacy regulations around the world accordingly. We promise to lead and innovate with our core principle, “Privacy First. Human Always.” Everyone deserves to be treated with equality, respect, and dignity because, ultimately, our true identity is as a human always.</p>

 An agenda for meaningful connectivity in&nbsp;Africa <p>The World Bank’s annual World Development Report 2021 themed “Data for better lives’’ will be launched in Q1 2021. In our modern world where the impact of data and digital technology has never been more keenly felt, the focus of the World Bank — a major international developmental partner — on improving lives through data and technology could not have been more&nbsp;timely.</p><p>This is particularly true for Africa, the least <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx">digitally connected</a> continent. Africa lags behind the rest of the world in Internet access, digital device access, and digital skills. The World Bank’s focus on data and technology in 2021 should rally governments, industry, academia, and civil society to push for the actualization of developmental targets focused on digital penetration and adoption.</p>Photo: <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/system-web-network-globe-europe-3699552/">Pixabay</a><p>An important facet of the theme “data for better lives’’ is an acknowledgment that in developing countries, the collection, collation, and analysis of development data which forms the basis of national planning is done infrequently and often lacks the granularity required to achieve its objectives. Many developing countries have <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/dcr-2017-9-en.pdf?expires=1603460038&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=1C3E254DD96B72F0CDD1A182615F3839">poorly supported government statistical offices</a>. Within these contexts, digital signals such as from mobile phone usage and Internet use can be useful, when expertly marshaled, to fill in gaps in developmental data needed to inform developmental outcomes. The most recent blog by the World Development Report 2021 team highlights the poignant example of the use of social media activity to <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/finding-missing-data-creating-actionable-information-solving-development-problems?cid=dec_tt_data_en_ext">improve traffic safety</a> in Nairobi&nbsp;Kenya.</p><p>What is obvious in the profitable and scalable use of these new sources of data is the need for a critical mass of Internet and digital device users in Africa. Applications of these emerging Big Data sources are most efficient and reliable when there is an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oreillymedia/2012/01/19/volume-velocity-variety-what-you-need-to-know-about-big-data/#33f03a161b6d">abundance of data</a>. The World Bank’s focus on the role of technology and data in national development is another opportunity for national governments, industry, academia, and civil society to rally for increased digital penetration and adoption.</p><p>A useful framework for thinking about what constitutes real digital progress for nations is the concept of “meaningful connectivity’’. According to the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI), we have <a href="https://a4ai.org/meaningful-connectivity/">meaningful connectivity</a> when we can use the internet every day (regularly) using an appropriate device (smartphone) with enough data (unlimited broadband) and a fast connection (minimum 4G). Only under these conditions of user experience can the durable benefits envisaged by the World Bank’s “Data for Better Lives’’ theme be realized.</p><p>From applications ranging from traffic management, mobile money, e-commerce, e-health, software development, and many others, opportunities for individual and national development are opened up when there is a critical mass of digitally connected citizens. “Data for Better Lives’’ thus serves as a rallying point for countries to work towards achieving <a href="https://a4ai.org/as-internet-access-proves-critical-we-are-missing-targets-to-connect-everyone/">international developmental goals</a> related to digital connectivity.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/data-for-better-lives-an-agenda-for-meaningful-connectivity-in-africa-baa3970d2bf9">Data for better lives</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Election interference and platform interventions in the lead-up to November&nbsp;3 Oumou Ly (left) interviews Naima Green-Riley (right) for The Breakdown from the Berkman Klein&nbsp;Center.<p>Concerns about election interference and disinformation are rampant in the weeks before the U.S. presidential election on November 3. In this episode of The Breakdown, Assembly Staff Fellow <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/oumou-ly">Oumou Ly </a>interviews <a href="http://www.naimagreenriley.com/">Naima Green-Riley</a>, a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University.</p><p>Ly and Green-Riley review recent foreign interference, the weaponization of social issues, and various platform interventions to mitigate the spread of mis- and disinformation ahead of the election.</p><p>Read the transcript, which has been lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity:</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to The Breakdown. My name is Oumou. I’m a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center on the <a href="https://www.bkmla.org/">Assembly: Disinformation </a>program. I am really excited to be joined today by Naima Green-Riley. Naima’s a PhD candidate at the Department of Government at Harvard University, with a particular focus on public diplomacy and the global information space. She also was formerly a foreign service officer and a Pickering fellow. Welcome, Naima. Thanks so much for&nbsp;joining.</p><p>Naima Green-Riley (NGR): Well, thank you so much for having&nbsp;me.</p><p>OL: So our conversation today centers on foreign interference in the upcoming election, which is drawing close as of the time of this recording. We’re about two weeks out from November 3rd. One big topic on my mind today is the big threat actors this time around… We know that 2016 was sort of a watershed moment in terms of foreign interference for American democratic processes.</p><p>In terms of social media manipulation in particular, how do foreign influence efforts in 2020 look in contrast to active measures we saw in 2016? Have the primary threat actors changed, optimized their methods a little bit, or adopted overall new approaches to influencing public&nbsp;opinion?</p><p>NGR: Well, you’re definitely right that 2016 marked the first time that the U.S. started to really pay attention to this type of online foreign influence activity. And during that election year, we saw a series of coordinated social media campaigns targeting various groups of individuals in the United States and seeking to influence their political thoughts and behavior. The campaigns were focused on sowing discord in U.S. politics, mainly by driving a wedge between people on very polarizing topics, so they usually involved either creating or amplifying content on social media that would encourage people to take more extreme viewpoints. So some examples might be that veterans were often targeted. There was this one meme that was run by Russian trolls, basically, that showed a picture of a U.S. soldier, and then it had the text, “Hillary Clinton has a 69% disapproval rate amongst all veterans,” on it. Clearly intended to have an impact on how those people were thinking.</p><p>They might also give misleading information about the elections, like they might tell people that the election date was maybe several days after the actual election date and therefore try and ruin people’s chances at using their right to vote. Some disinformation campaigns told people that they could tweet or text their vote in so they didn’t have to leave their&nbsp;homes.</p><p>And also there was exploitation of real political sentiment in the U.S., often encouraging divisions and particularly divisions around race. And so there were YouTube channels that would be called things like Don’t Shoot or Black to Live that shared content about police violence and Black Lives Matter, and some racialized campaigns that were linked to those types of sites would then promote ideas like, “The black community can’t rely on the government. It’s not worth voting&nbsp;anyway.”</p><p>So that’s the type of stuff that we started to see in 2016, and many of those efforts were either linked to the GRU, which is a part of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, or the Internet Research Agency, the IRA, of Russia. And many characterized the IRA as a troll farm, so an organization that particularly focuses on spreading false information online.</p><blockquote>Since 2016, unfortunately, online influence campaigns have only become more rampant and more complicated.</blockquote><p>So since 2016, unfortunately, online influence campaigns have only become more rampant and more complicated. We’ve seen a more diverse range of people being targeted in the United States, so not just veterans and African-Americans, but also different political groups from the far right to the far left. We’ve seen immigrant communities be targeted, religious groups, people who care about specific issues like gun rights or the Confederate flag. So, basically, the most controversial topics are the topics that foreign actors tend to drill deep on to try and influence Americans. And so it’s just gotten more and more&nbsp;complex.</p><p>OL: I want to pick up on this point, because so often particularly racial issues form the basis of disinformation and influence campaigns because, like you said, they are the most divisive, contentious issues. In what ways have you seen foreign actors work to weaponize social issues in the United States just this year, since the death of George&nbsp;Floyd?</p><p>NGR: Well you know, it’s interesting, because we focus a lot on disinformation as targeted towards the elections, but a number of different types of behaviors and activities have been targeted through disinformation, so we’ve seen people try to manipulate things like Census participation or certain types of civic involvement. And the range of ways that actors are actually different platforms is changing too, so we’re seeing text messages and WhatsApp messages being used to impact people in addition to social&nbsp;media.</p><p>But after George Floyd was killed, as you might expect, because it’s a controversial issue that affects Americans, absolutely there was sort of this onslaught of misinformation and disinformation that showed up online. So there were claims that George Floyd didn’t die. There were claims that were stoking conspiracy theories about the protests that happened after his death. And I have to say, not all dis- and misinformation is foreign, so that’s why this is such a large problem, because there are many domestic actors that engage in dis- and misinformation campaigns as well. So the narratives that we’ve seen across the space just come from so many different people that sometimes it can be hard to target the problem to one particular actor or one particular motive.</p><p>OL: So in 2016, the Russian government undertook really sophisticated methods of influence, certainly for that particular time and for that election, including mobilizing inauthentic narratives via inauthentic users, leveraging witting and unwitting Americans and social media users. How would you contrast the threat posed by Russia’s efforts with other countries known to be involved in ongoing influence efforts?</p><p>NGR: Well, I have to say that Russia continues to be a country of major concern. We saw just recently, this week, the FBI announcing that Russia has been shown to have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-russia-voter-registration-data-2020-election-national-intelligence/">some information</a> about voter registration in the United States. And Russian disinformation campaigns have definitely re-emerged in the 2020 election cycle, but those campaigns only make up a small amount of the overall activities that Russia is engaging in today, all with the goal of undermining democracy and eroding democratic institutions around the world. That being said, we’ve seen other actors emerging in this space. Within the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese agents were shown to be pushing false narratives within the U.S. saying that President Trump was going to put the entire country on lockdown.</p><p>Iran has increasingly been involved in these types of campaigns as well. Recently, they used a mass of emails to affect U.S. public opinion about the elections. And one more thing I want to mention is that this is really a global phenomenon. So these actors, these state actors, often outsource their activity through sort of operations in different countries. So for instance, there are stories of a Russian troll farm that was set up in Ghana to push racial narratives about the United States. And there have also been troll farms that are set up by state actors in places like Nigeria, Albania, the Philippines. And so what’s interesting here is that the individuals who are actually sending those are either economically motivated, they’re getting paid, or they might be ideologically motivated, but they’re acting on behalf of these state actors. And that makes this not just a state to state issue, but a real global problem that involves many people in different parts of the&nbsp;world.</p><p>OL: So turning to the platforms for a second, what are your thoughts on some of the interventions platforms have announced so far? Like limiting retweets and shares via private message, labeling posts and accounts associated with state-run media organizations… The list of interventions goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>NGR: Yeah, all of the things that you mentioned are a good start, I would say. At the end of the day, I think it’s got to be a major focus on, how can we inform social media users of the potential threats in the information environment? And how can we best equip them to really understand what they are consuming? So I think that part of the answer is for these tech companies to, of their own accord, continue to create policies that will address this issue, but we also need better legislation, and that legislation has to focus on privacy rights, has to focus on online advertising, political advertising, tech sector regulation. And then we need policies that will enforce this type of thing moving forward. So it can’t all be upon the tech companies without that guidance, because I don’t know that they necessarily have the total will to do all that’s necessary to really get at this&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Social media companies have already started to label content. They’re also searching for inauthentic behavior, especially coordinated inauthentic behavior online. But I think that there is particular work to be done in terms of the way that we think about content labeling. So when platforms are labeling content, they are usually labeling content from some sort of state-run media. And if it’s a state-run media, much of the state-run media that they’re looking at is not completely a covert operation. It’s not a situation where this media source just doesn’t want anyone to know that it’s associated with the state, but it might be pretty difficult for the audience to actually determine that that outlet is from a state-run site.</p><p>So an example would be our RT, formerly known as Russia Today. There’s a reason, I think, that it went from Russia Today to RT. If you go to the RT website, you will see a big banner that says, “Question more, RT.” And then there’s lots of information about how RT works all over the world in order to help people to uncover truth. And then if you scroll all the way bottom to the bottom of the website, you’ll see RT has the support of Moscow or the Russian government… So it’s difficult for people to actually know where this content is coming&nbsp;from.</p><blockquote>At the end of the day, I think it’s got to be a major focus on, how can we inform social media users of the potential threats in the information environment?</blockquote><p>And this summer Facebook made good on a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/labeling-state-controlled-media/">policy</a> that they had said that they were going to enact for some time, where they now label certain types of content. And basically, they say that they’ll label any content that seems like it’s wholly or fully under editorial control that’s influenced by the state, by some state government. And so lots of Chinese and Russian sites or outlets are included in this policy so far. And according to Facebook, they’re going to increase the number of outlets that get this label. And basically what you see is, on the post, you see, “Chinese state-controlled media,” “Russian state-controlled media,” something to that effect. That’s helpful because now a person doesn’t have to click and then go to the website and then scroll to the bottom of the page to find out that this outlet comes from&nbsp;Russia.</p><p>But at the same time, I still think we need to do more in terms of helping Americans to understand why it’s an issue, why state actors are trying to reach them, little old me who lives in some small city or some small town in the middle of America, and how narratives can be manipulated. And so only if that’s done in connection with labeling more of these types of outlets on social media, I think you’d get more&nbsp;impact.</p><p>YouTube does something else. In 2018 they started to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46139189">label their content</a>, but the way they label the content is, they basically label anything that is government-sponsored. So if some outlet is funded in whole or in part by a government, there’s a banner that comes up at the bottom of the video that tells people that. And so you’ll see RT labeled is Russian content, but you’ll also see BBC labeled as British content, so it doesn’t have to do with the editorial control of the&nbsp;outlet.</p><p>One final thing on this, because I think this is really important. So I have heard stories of people who, let’s say, for whatever reason have stumbled upon some sort of content from a foreign actor. And so this content might come up because somebody shared something and they watched the video, right? So they watch a video. Let’s say they watch an RT video. Maybe they weren’t trying to find the RT video, and maybe they also aren’t the type of person who would watch a lot of content from RT, but they watch that one video. They continue to scroll on their newsfeed, and then they get a suggestion. “You might enjoy this.” Now the next thing that they get comes from Sputnik. It comes from RT again. So now they’re getting fed information about the U.S. political system that is being portrayed by a foreign actor, and they weren’t even looking for it. I think that’s another thing that we’ve got to tackle, is the algorithms that are used in order to uphold tech companies’ business models, because in some cases those algorithms will be harmful to people because they’ll actually feed them information from foreign actors that might have malicious intent.</p><p>OL: Naima, this week the FBI confirmed that Iran was responsible for an influence effort giving the appearance of election interference. And in this particular episode, U.S. voters in Florida and, I think, a number of other states received threatening emails from a domain appearing to belong to a white supremacist group. Can you talk a little bit about what in particular the FBI revealed, and what its significance is for the election?</p><p>NGR: Right. So there was a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/20/proud-boys-emails-florida/">press conference</a> on October 21st in which the FBI announced that they had uncovered an email campaign that was orchestra orchestrated by Iran. The emails purported themselves to come from the Proud Boys, which, as you mentioned, is a far-right group with ties to white supremacy, and it was also a group that had recently been referenced in U.S. politics in the first presidential debate. But actually, now we know that these emails came from Iran, and some of the individuals who received the contents of the email posted them online. So they were addressed to the email users by name, and they said, “We are in possession of all of your information, email, address, telephone, everything.” And then they said they knew that the individual was registered as a Democrat because they had gained access to the U.S. voting infrastructure. And they said, “You will vote for Trump on election day, or we will come after&nbsp;you.”</p><p>So first of all, they included a huge amount of intimidation. Second of all, they were purporting themselves to be this group that they were not. And third of all, they absolutely were attempting to contribute to discord in the run-up to the elections. It’s dangerous activity. It is alarming activity. It’s something that I think will have multiple impacts for a time to come, because even though the FBI was able to identify that this happened, that goal of shaking voter confidence of course may have been a little bit successful in that instance.</p><p>And so one of the things that is good about this is that the FBI was able to identify this very quickly, to make an announcement to the U.S. public that it happened, to be clear about what happened. Unfortunately, what they announced was not just that the Gmail users were receiving this email and there was false information in it, but they also said that they had information that both Russia and Iran have actually obtained registration information from the United States, and that’s concerning as&nbsp;well.</p><p>There appears to be good coordination between the private sector and the government on this issue. Google announced the number of Gmail users that are estimated to have been targeted through the Iranian campaign. Unfortunately, the number is about 25,000 email users, which is no small amount. And so this is just another instance of how not social media but the internet realm, email, can be used as a way to target American public&nbsp;opinion.</p><p>OL: Thank you. Thank you so much for joining me, Naima. I really enjoyed our conversation. I know our viewers will&nbsp;too.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-foreign-interference-and-the-u-s-2020-election-69b91ca64220">The Breakdown: Foreign Interference and the U.S. 2020 Election</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Being able to use Ceramic directly from the convenience of your web browser is one of the core functionalities required to fulfill the vision of a permissionless dataweb. <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a> enables this by providing a sandboxed IdentityWallet instance which users can authenticate to using any of their existing Ethereum wallets, and soon other Blockchain wallets as well. This tutorial will show you how to combine 3ID Connect with Ceramic in order to start building your app using dynamic, tamper resistant documents!</p> Using Ceramic on the web <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">Typescript Ceramic implementation</a> provides two main ways to interact with the ceramic network, Ceramic Core and Ceramic http-client. The former implements the entire protocol and relies on a js-ipfs instance to be available, the latter relies on a Ceramic Daemon which you can run from your terminal. Both of these implementations consume a DID Provider which is used to communicate with a wallet with DID support (see <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP2844</a>). In the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">Building on Clay tutorial</a> we described how to use the http client together with an instance of <a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js/">IdentityWallet</a>. This is good if you want to dive into fundamentals, but 3ID Connect enables us to connect to a DID directly from the comfort of your Ethereum wallet. This DID will also be linked together with the ethereum address using <a href="https://idx.xyz/">IDX</a>.</p><p>In this tutorial we will be using Ceramic Core, which means that we’re running the entire Ceramic protocol inside of the browser!</p> Setup 3ID Connect with Ceramic <p>First let’s install the needed packages. Currently the 3ID Connect version with Ceramic support is available using the <code>next</code> flag. In the example we will be using <code>ceramic-core</code>, but you can use <code>ceramic-http-client</code> as well.</p> <code>$ npm install --save 3id-connect@next @ceramicnetwork/ceramic-core</code> <p>Using 3ID Connect to authenticate to Ceramic is fairly straight forward once the basic flow is setup. In the example below we use an “injected ethereum provider” that’s available on <code>window.ethereum</code>. You can of course use any ethereum provider that you like.</p> <code>import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'
const threeIdConnect = new ThreeIdConnect()
// Usually the following three steps are taken when
// a user choose to connect their wallet
const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()
// Create 3id connect instance
const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])
await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)
// create a Ceramic instance
import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/ceramic-core'
import IPFS from 'ipfs'
const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()
const ipfs = await IPFS.create()
const ceramic = await Ceramic.create(ipfs, { didProvider })</code>  Create documents in the browser <p>We can now start using Ceramic directly in the browser! Below are just some examples that you can also try out on the <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">Web Playground</a> which comes with 3ID Connect and Ceramic already set up. First, open the developer console and then click connect. The 3ID Connect modal will appear, and once approved, you will see “Connected with DID: did:3:&lt;yourDID&gt;” in the console. Once this appears, then you can run the below commands directly in the console. Note, if you’d like to reset the 3ID Connect iFrame state, clear application data for 3idconnect.org from localStorage.</p> <code>const jsonSchema = {
  "type": "object",
  "$schema": "&lt;http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#&gt;",
  "required": [
    "title",
    "description"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "description": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
const doc1 = await ceramic.createDocument('tile', { content: jsonSchema })
// This will throw an error because it's missing the "description":
const doc2 = await ceramic.createDocument('tile', {
  metadata: { schema: doc1.id },
  content: { "title": "Client Document" }
})
// Uncaught Error: Validation Error: data should have 
// required property 'description'
// We can create the document if we provide all required fields:
const doc3 = await ceramic.createDocument('tile', {
  metadata: { schema: doc1.id },
  content: {
    title: "Client Document",
    description: "A Ceramic Document created from the browser."
  }
})
// Now we can of course also update the document:
await doc3.change({
  content: {
    title: 'Client Document',
    description: 'This document has now been updated from the browser'
  }
})</code>  <p>That’s it for this tutorial! Hope you found it useful and thanks for reading.

<p>On October 21, Capital One hosted the 2nd Women in Identity DC Area Meetup. Speakers from both Women in Identity and Capital One brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to the (virtual) table. The entire meetup was moderated by Melissa Heng, Senior Director of Digital Product Management at Capital One. &nbsp;It included a number of great discussions on the issues of identity and privacy as well as the tools women need to succeed in the industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Leadership and Identity</p>
<p>Sara Strauss, the Senior Vice President for US Card at Capital One, kicked off with a look at why it is important to have diversity in leadership positions in general – and specifically within the identity space. Because everyone has implicit bias, it is crucial that all perspectives are represented when developing new technologies. As unique individuals, we all need an environment that encourages us to share our perspectives openly – they are critically important in the identity space.</p>
<p>Sara also shared some tips from her own experience</p>
 
 Embrace that you are different. Your perspectives matter and what you bring to the table is unique and valuable. 
 Don’t try to look the same and think the same as everyone else because your uniqueness is what will set you apart. 
 When you are speaking up, speak what you believe not what you think you are supposed to say. 
 Find allies. Knowing that you have someone in the room who will support you, can give you the courage to stand out. 
 
<p>Networking for Professional Development</p>
<p></p>
<p>Career Development Facilitator Jennifer McCluskey then moved the discussion into a networking and professional development session. Attendees were able to share their anxieties and struggles with networking and Jennifer highlighted that these are common to ALL of us. What we need to do is shift our perception of networking from a negative, necessary, evil to a positive tool that can help us foster connections in our careers and everyday lives. Networking can help build our professional capital by giving us access to resources, information and influencers. It can give us the competitive edge we need to succeed. Attendees then took the opportunity to put those tools to the test, networking actively in several smaller breakout groups.</p>
<p>The Intersection of Identity and Privacy Panel Discussion</p>
<p>A panel discussion followed featuring Dr. Jenn Behrens, Becky Heironimus, Maggie Martin, Kimberly Sutherland and Sara Farmer. Panellists addressed several questions about privacy and identity and underscored the importance of communication and transparency when collecting and retaining data. Customers and users have a right to know what their information is being used for and,as a sector, it is our responsibility to make sure that they are informed and comfortable with the security of their data. Dr. Behrens suggested that more user friendly language around what is happening to our data in real time will help create an atmosphere of transparency.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, we need to provide customers with different authentication options. We can gradually increase the complexity of requirements as consumers become more comfortable with increasingly sophisticated technology.</p>
<p>The Power in YOU</p>
<p>Aparna Sarin, Vice President of Small Business Card at Capital One, then finished our conversation with an inspiring message: “As women, we have strengths that are hugely valuable.” Her personal journey of discovery includes overcoming bad, self-deprecating habits. She referenced How Women Rise by Sally Helgesen and Marshal Goldsmith and described several common bad habits including a reluctance to claim our achievements, putting your job before your career, falling into the perfection trap, and many more. Overcoming these habits will allow us to focus in on our strengths and give us the courage to be confident, assertive, fearless and empowered leaders.</p>
<p>We finished with an overview of Women in Identity including our mission, goals and member activities. This includes an invitation to all participants – and our readers (men and women) – to sign up!&nbsp;<a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/become-a-member.">https://www.womeninidentity.org/become-a-member.</a></p>
<p>We had such excellent conversations on identity, privacy and our role as women within the industry. And we thank the many inspiring women who provided attendees with practical and accessible tools to succeed in the identity space.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who participated and made this event such a success!</p>

<p>The WiD Leadership team was out in force at KuppingerCole’s CusTech 2020 from 20-22 October.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a series of sessions across the event, we shared practical tips to encourage better leadership around DEI and considered ways to identify and control unconscious biases when building identity systems that work for ALL customers.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights included 2 great workshops both of which prompted follow up activity. we are actively looking at how we can get more of these sessions out into the public. Watch this space!</p>
 
 Identifying and Breaking Potential Bias in Identity Systems
 
 
 
 A great interactive session led by Colette d’Alessandro and Esther Hoeksema where attendees interacted with the WiD leadership team in small group discussions to share ideas on how to remove bias in identity systems. 
 
 
 
 
 Learning Path to Identity Diversity
 
 
 
 This session, led by Kay Chopard-Cohen, Diane Joyce and Karyn Bright focused on practical ways to make change. We concluded that change needs to start with our individual personal behaviour. From there we can grow into looking at the way our work groups and organizations operate.&nbsp; Try simple tactics like stopping yourself from speaking (if that is what you do!) and asking for the opinion of someone who often goes unheard. Or physically setting down your pen as a reminder to listen! Often the most subtle acts are the most powerful when building an inclusive environment. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>The positive response from audiences was a great indicator that we are seeing a general shift from simply understanding why diversity is important to understanding how we can create diverse environments and champion those that are underrepresented.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Designing for Diversity
 
 
 
 The keynote session with Canadian team leaders, Chanda Jackson and Nicole Landry, gave a great foundation for understanding the impact of bias and what it means when you’re looking to develop identity systems that are genuinely intended to work for everyone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Customers and the Identity Experience
 
 
 
 This final panel brought things full circle, reminding us all that ultimately we are trying to build systems that work for ALL our customers – regardless of their race, gender, financial status or their physical or technical ability. Ably moderated by Nicole Landry, Dia Banerji, Diane Joyce and Louise Maynard-Atem reminded us that while employees may be ‘stuck with’ a bad user experience (UX), our customers have a choice! The past year has seen the identity sector move faster than ever thought possible with products rolling out to meet new sector demands. The team challenged that we may not always fully consider UI/UX needs across the full intersectionality of humanity when doing so. KuppingerCole dubbed this session a “Powerhouse panel!”

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Levels of Assurance (LOA) play a foundational role in the world of standards, digital identity, and digital transactions. Put simply, LOA is the degree of confidence in the validity of a claim, process, or authentication. In the sphere of digital identity, it is a necessary model to verify that the person or entity claiming an identity is the entity to which that identity was assigned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most Canadians don’t think too deeply about LOAs, and yet most Canadians interact with these models, unknowingly, at some point in their lives. For example, Canadian experience LOAs when opening a bank account, demonstrating qualifications for a government service or benefit, making an insurance claim, or wiring money to a client or family member.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations that use LOAs to inform their policies and processes often have dedicated strategies and teams, working out contingencies and approaches to maximize security in Canada and internationally. These teams often face challenges interacting with other service providers, meeting different standards across jurisdictions, and minimizing friction for clients accessing their services.</p>



 How the Current LOA Model Works 



<p>Imagine two people, Samir and Aiya, are trying to apply for a small business loan. Both women have very strong credentials, a passport, driver’s license and the requisite business records. Samir and her credentials are linked through a knowledge-based authentication (KBA), and are accepted after answering a security question she previously populated about her father’s middle name. Aiko and her credential are linked with an in-person ceremony, as she went to her local bank branch with two pieces of identification and her business records to complete the loan application. Aiya’s scenario offers a stronger LOA and Samir’s a weaker LOA. Despite these differences, Canada’s federal LOAs currently dictate that Samir and Aiya both have the same assurance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Canada and many places around the world, it is common for LOA structures to combine a number of factors into a single score. The result is an obscured view of the risk factors and authentication. This lack of granularity into the LOAs of specific capabilities is a challenge present in the construct of LOA models around the world. The deciding factor regarding acceptance of an identity comes down to Relying Parties (parties who rely on the validity of identities) who determine their own risk profiles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, the relying party is the bank. The banker helping Samir and Aiya also benefits from a stronger LOA as they sign off on the business loan. In addition to building a stronger relationship with the client, they are able to manage their portfolio with confidence.</p>



<p>There is widespread agreement the current LOA model in Canada is inadequate. While LOAs serve a purpose, they are not transparent and dynamic enough to address the myriad digital solutions and scenarios of today. Internationally, single LOA schemes are no longer state of the art and today’s requirements necessitate separate evaluation for specific capabilities. In the DIACC community, there is consensus that there must be separate schemes for credentials and identity, at a minimum, in order to be useful in the widest possible range of scenarios and contexts. An improved assurance model should be capable of asserting identity and credentials at different levels.</p>



 Envisioning a New Risk-based Model for Assurance 



<p>A risk-based model offers a more enduring, user- and industry-friendly path forward that enables existing LOA schemes to participate while building for a more dynamic and scalable digital ecosystem. The notion of leveraging a risk-based model is highly applicable as the application of LOAs&nbsp; today are best determined by performing a threat or risk analysis. The risk-based model must address the likelihood and impact of something happening, and the appropriate mitigation approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LOA is essential in determining liability and risk; offering a clear understanding how a Subject (customer or citizen) and a Relying Party (company or government service) can validate that they are who they say they are. It is a central component in being able to determine whether a transaction should proceed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The risk-based starts by assessing risk first and then the approach drives more value for organizations, as they confront the baseline of their current systems and assess risk realistically. It also helps adopters improve their systems through motivation to&nbsp; reduce or remove risks through various types of mitigation.</p>



<p>DIACC is on a mission to rapidly deliver a modern, risk-based LOA model that is…</p>



  Risk-based  Directive and illustrative  Non-prescriptive in execution  Evergreen  Deterministic in implementation and assessment  Congruent with existing state of the art and best practices  Inclusive in support of both the private and public sector  Supportive of evolving needs on credentials and bindings  



<p>The impact of this evolution is far-reaching, and will ensure that the&nbsp; <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>TM is strong and resilient over time. This evolution takes a framework-wide approach to address interdependencies, independencies, and support communication across platforms. This new approach ensures scalability over time as technologies and their uses evolve.</p>



<p><br>DIACC has engaged a small, representative team to rapidly deliver a new model to support the PCTF, which <a href="https://diacc.ca/2020/09/15/newly-launched-digital-id-framework-to-begin-testing-in-canada/">launched September 15, 2020</a>. The model will benefit from the DIACC’s well-documented peer and public review process. Members can contact <a href="mailto:info@diacc.ca">info@diacc.ca</a> to contribute.

<p>By Jesús Salas, Associate, Responsible Technology</p><p>American consumers are increasingly concerned about privacy and data security when purchasing new products and services, which may be of a competitive advantage to companies that take action towards these consumer values, a new Consumer Reports (CR) study&nbsp;finds.</p><p>The new <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/downloads/CR_PrivacyFrontAndCenter_102020_vf.pdf">study,</a> “Privacy Front and Center: Meeting the Commercial Opportunity to Support Consumers Rights,” from CR’s Digital Lab with support from Omidyar Network, looks at the commercial benefits for companies that differentiate their products based on privacy and data security.</p><p>The report lays out a succinct timeline for the evolution of consumer attitudes toward privacy that culminates with a clear call to action for innovators. Through their comprehensive research methodologies, CR has been able to draw out the nuance around when, why, and how much privacy and security features matter for individuals looking to use and buy security cameras, connected cars, smart speakers, and other products. The report also contextualizes the role that both rule-making through regulation and the supply of better products can have to meet the growing market&nbsp;demand.</p><p>“This study shows that raising the standard for privacy and security is a win-win for consumers and the companies,” said Ben Moskowitz, the director of the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. “Given the rapid proliferation of internet connected devices, the rise in data breaches and cyber attacks, and the demand from consumers for heightened privacy and security measures, there’s an undeniable business case for companies to invest in creating more private and secure products.”</p><p>Here are some of the key findings from the&nbsp;study:</p>  According to CR’s February 2020 nationally representative survey, 74% of consumers are at least moderately concerned about the privacy of their personal&nbsp;data.  Nearly all Americans (96%) agree that more should be done to ensure that companies protect the privacy of consumers.  A majority of smart product owners (62%) worry about potential loss of privacy when buying them for their home or&nbsp;family.  The privacy and security conscious consumer class seems to include more men and people of&nbsp;color.  Experiencing a data breach correlates with a higher willingness to pay for privacy, and 30% of Americans have experienced one.  Of the Android users who switched to iPhones, 32% indicated doing so because of Apple’s perceived privacy or security benefits relative to&nbsp;Android.  <p>The study draws from a nationally representative CR survey of 5,085 adult U.S. residents conducted in February 2020, a meta-analysis of 25 years of public opinion studies, and a conjoint analysis that seeks to quantify how consumers weigh privacy and security in their hardware and software purchasing decisions.</p><p>Omidyar Network is honored to support this endeavor to both understand and inform the commercial case for investments in security and privacy-enhancing technology. While privacy should not be turned into an out-of-reach luxury, these findings do present an opportunity for companies to be among the first to differentiate and capture market share or leverage consumer’s willingness to pay in the short-term. Over time, we expect many privacy and data security features to become “table stakes,” in which case first movers will innovate and raise standards further.</p><p>Supporting efforts like this is key to our vision of enabling responsible technology that promotes well-being and individual liberty. To accomplish this, we support different levers that drive competition and innovation while safeguarding to manage risks and unintended consequences.</p><p>CR also recently launched an updated and expanded website for the <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/">Digital Standard</a> with Omidyar Network joining as a strategic partner. The Digital Standard is an evolving, open source framework used by independent testing organizations, researchers and product teams to evaluate how technologies respect consumers’ privacy and security interests. It serves as a resource for companies looking to implement and take action on stronger privacy and security, as well as ownership and governance.</p><p>We encourage innovators to leverage and enhance this tool to collectively raise the standard on technology, and grow a culture of responsibility within companies overall.</p>

 Omidyar Network’s Statement on US v. Google, Filed Today by the US Department of&nbsp;Justice <p>Today marks a new chapter in the long history of US enforcement of antitrust law. The filing of this lawsuit is recognition that digital platforms, namely Google, have used illegal and improper means to maintain their dominance.</p><p>Over many years, Google has exercised tremendous control over the marketplace of online search. This complaint makes a strong case for how Google manipulated the online search market by paying billions to secure default positions on browsers and mobile handsets to exclude rivals, by denying interoperability to challengers, and by preferencing its own products and services in search&nbsp;results.</p><p>The DOJ did not sue Google because it has grown large or successful. Rather, the investigation yielded sufficient <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/a-legal-roadmap-to-address-googles-monopoly-on-search-engines-effdfbcbc1f7">evidence</a> to show Google has violated US antitrust law — a set of rules that apply to everyone, and are designed to make sure all of us benefit from free markets and fair competition.</p><p>The ideal outcome of this lawsuit is the restoration of competition and safer, more innovative choices for consumers in the online search market. We know that Google’s profit motive influences the content they deliver. Google searches often lead people to Google’s own goods and services, to those who pay Google for our attention, and down rabbit holes of misinformation, hate, and extremism. All of these “results” bolster time spent on the platforms and Google’s revenues. Surely, other search engines, if not excluded from the market, could design algorithms that were safer and more consistent with society’s values.</p><p>Today’s filing is an important first step in enforcing existing laws governing Google’s improper past conduct. But this journey is not over; the legal process could take many years to resolve, and other concerns will need to be addressed. For example, Google also used its online search dominance to develop another illegal monopoly in the digital advertising market. Americans deserve and expect that Google will be held accountable for all of its anti-competitive and otherwise harmful conduct as well as prevented from engaging in similar abuses in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Consumers, competition, our economy, and our democracy have already paid too high a price for what are seen as “free” services. Undoubtedly, Google has provided valuable, innovative services that have become essential to everyone’s lives, creating the foundation for how we live, work, and play. And like other necessities that are embedded in our lives — power, water, cars — technology companies should be held to the highest standards. However, if left <a href="https://omidyar.com/uncheckedpower-the-root-of-big-tech-issues/">unchecked</a>, Google’s practices will continue to create serious consequences for advertisers, publishers, foreclosed technological rivals, and the&nbsp;public.</p><p>To that end, and alongside this case, we call for federal attention toward the ad-tech stack and support for state-level antitrust cases directed at other aspects of Google’s sprawling businesses. Because antitrust action alone will not restore competition to these markets, Congress should also continue to pursue the development of <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3429">new laws and&nbsp;rules</a>.</p>

<p>Electronic, XML-based agreements between trading partners is a key part of the ebXML family of standards developed jointly by OASIS and the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT)</p> 

<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that Collaboration Protocol Profile and Agreement Version 3.0 from the OASIS ebXML Core (ebCore) TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>
<p>Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML) is a family of standards developed through a joint initiative of OASIS and the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT). Five of these ebXML standards, including Collaboration Protocol Profile and Agreement, have been approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as the ISO 15000 standard. ebXML provides an open, XML-based infrastructure that enables the global use of electronic business information in an interoperable, secure, and consistent manner by all trading partners.</p>
<p>Collaborative Partner Profile Agreements are XML-based documents specifying a trading agreement between trading partners. Each trading partner will have their own Collaboration Protocol Profile (CPP) document that describes their abilities in an XML format. This can include the messaging protocols they support, or the security capabilities they support. A CPA (Collaboration Protocol Agreement) document is the intersection of two CPP documents, and describes the formal relationship between two parties.</p>
<p>CPPA Version 3.0 (CPPA3) specifies several improvements and innovations since the previous Version 2.0 (CPPA2). A CPPA3 document is much easier to read and to create and update manually or using automated tooling than a corresponding CPPA2 document. The same information can be expressed in a significantly smaller CPPA3 CPA document than in a CPPA2 CPA document.</p>
<p>CPPA3 adds support for AMQP, WebSocket transport and the SFTP subsystem of SSH2, in addition to the HTTP, SMTP, FTP transports already covered in CPPA2. The specification text is complemented by the normative CPPA3 XML schema, the agreement registration Exception XML schema, documentation embedded in those schemas, and sample documents.</p>
<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation. The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>The world of digital identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) is evolving quickly, giving much cause for optimism. Standards are starting to connect and move towards functional interoperability, governed by testable protocols. Most of this work is happening on the level of VCs. However, DIDs and their infrastructure are also starting to converge and mature as an extensible-yet-interoperable technology.</p><p>Adoption by markets, standards bodies and regulators is largely contingent upon provable security and provable interoperability, so these promising developments cannot come soon&nbsp;enough.</p><p>The Digital Identity Foundation (DIF) is very proud to be hosting one particular research and development project that could prove pivotal in this process. It is currently a work item of DIF’s <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>. However, a charter for an autonomous working group will be available for review at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">#IIW31</a> this week (20–22 October 2020) to facilitate broader participation. The project is called KERI and it is a project that could only be developed in the open, for the public good and for the widest, quickest adoption.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pucelano">Fernando Santander</a> But first, what is&nbsp;KERI? <p>KERI stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. A “key event” is a discrete event in time that involves public/private keypairs, often called blockchain identities or cryptographic identities. These events can be generalized as inceptions (creations), rotations, and signing events: the three kinds of events for which KERI generates and handles receipts. In other words, key events are cryptographic events in the history of an identifier.</p><p>Importantly, everything else a decentralized identifier says, does, or refers to is not a key event. As KERI is deliberately laser-focused on key events only, we can call these other events non-KERI events. The real world consequences of a signature or rotation are out of scope and method-specific to boot. KERI is only interested in the most universal aspect of interactions between keys and cryptographic systems, i.e. the cryptography that allows drastically different DID systems to trust each other’s security guarantees.</p><blockquote>“DID Methods exist to solve a trust issue. This does it in a different way.”</blockquote><blockquote>Charles Cunningham (Jolocom GmbH, Rust development lead for&nbsp;KERI)</blockquote><p>Each key event produces a receipt containing only checkable signatures of key event information. Nothing more. Receipts are threaded into logs tracking the history of each identifier, which is similar to a traceable audit trail of hashes — useful for confirming but not for deducing the underlying key material. These threads are compiled into logs that are shared and replicated according to a consensus algorithm and a logic of trust thresholds that creates a fabric of shared history between&nbsp;nodes.</p> Is KERI a blockchain or a DLT? No. Does it replace blockchains? Also&nbsp;no. <p>The trust fabric created when KERI nodes share and propagate key material records&nbsp;might</p><p>sound redundant to the blockchains where all of today’s DID methods store their key material chronologically. To a degree, this is true: each log containing the history of one key is a “microledger,” like a blockchain with only one participant. Inception and rotation events in all of today’s DID methods are stored in a chronological distributed ledger which can be crawled to create a log of these key events by DID. So, why the redundancy? Why replicate a subset of the blockchain’s capabilities and features in a distinct blockchain-like infrastructure just for key material?</p><p>The answer is simple and manifold: blockchains enable many features outside the scope of KERI. These features bring with them complexity, diversity, scale costs, and trust issues. Within KERI’s scope, however, only some of a blockchain or distributed ledger technology’s (DLT’s) features are necessary. Total ordering and double-spend protection, for instance, are hallmarks of distributed ledgers, but hardly justify the added complexity here.</p>Subset of blockchain/DLT capabilities required by KERI (<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/KERI2_Overview.web.pdf">Dr Sam Smith</a>,&nbsp;2019)<p>Working backwards from a short list of security features, KERI infrastructure can be a much more performant, minimalist distributed ledger system. It is still in the family tree of blockchain, DLTs and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), but it is closer to a sidechain or a trans-blockchain interoperability mechanism. In use cases where all that is needed is a self-certifying, widely-portable identifier, KERI can stand alone as a lightweight DID method. In combination with a traditional DID Method, KERI can increase key management options and strengthen security guarantees by raising a red flag at the first discrepancy between the two parallel and redundant systems.</p><p>As a scaling mechanism, KERI can also take away some of the traffic and complexity from the underlying blockchain. In implementations where key management and state maintenance (record keeping about keys that rotate over time) are entrusted directly to the KERI mechanism, these functions can be operated much closer to the edge and replicate after a slight delay. This might be a totally acceptable trade-off of efficiency for latency in many use cases. For example, a roundtrip write-and-wait-for-finality transaction on a global blockchain makes no sense in a low-connectivity Internet of things (IoT) use case, where double-spend is a non-issue.</p> KERI is both an interoperability mechanism and a standardization incentive <p>More importantly for the DIF, however, is another major feature of KERI: it could become the foundation of massive interoperability and portability at the infrastructure layer. What’s more, if adopted by enough major players, it could even speed up the standardization process of DIDs themselves. By offering a minimum level of security guarantees shared across all participating methods, it would simplify the security review process for both individual DID methods and for interoperable DIDs as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>By abstracting out the universal, minimal set of key functions, a KERI log that spans multiple ledgers or methods is just as verifiable as one that does not. This means that&nbsp;anywhere</p><p>self-certifying KERI identifiers are accepted, an identifier’s history can stretch back further than the existence of KERI. Plus, that history can include so-called “portability events”, where an identifier is deactivated on one ledger and re-activated on another. Method-specific features or records might still need to be exported and imported. The core proof of control function of a DID, however, would be universalized in a way that enabled massive portability.</p><p>This same universalizing effect of sharing a security vocabulary across all participating DID methods has the added benefit of being able to guarantee certain security features in any KERI-compliant system. Since KERI also lends itself to simple compliance tests, and since KERI logs give a benchmark against which to test method-specific and blockchain-specific security, this is a small leap for each DID method and a giant leap for standardization and security engineering.</p> KERI’s history: from whitepaper to community incubation <p>So far we have been highly technical in our explanation of the project. A careful reader, however, may already have caught the community commitment implicit in phrases such as “KERI-compliant” and “participating DID methods.” KERI is only useful if the major DID methods incorporate it, or if the set of participating DID methods becomes congruous over time with the set of major DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>It is, in a nutshell, a community project of alignment as much as a technological innovation: an agreement on the security model for the common core functionality shared across all DID methods, allowing much variety and extensibility to be preserved by the participating DID methods. Decentralized identifiers have been very decentralized in their design and governance from the beginning, with a high degree of extensibility and flexibility within the fiefdom of each DID method and its governance. KERI has been gathering steam for over a year as a countervailing force, potentially making all DIDs function in an end-verifiable and thus universal way.</p><blockquote>“Investing in KERI is investing in interoperability, standardization, and cross-community security guarantees.”</blockquote><blockquote>Dr Sam Smith, author of the KERI whitepaper and project&nbsp;lead</blockquote><p>In large part, the roots of KERI lie in debates within the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a>. For years it has been discussing the “shalls” and “mays” that define a W3C-compliant DID method (and thus a DID system). In practical terms, this process specifies what each DID method can and must assume about other DID methods for such a decentralized and open system to make appropriate security guarantees.</p><p>KERI’s creator and the author of its whitepaper is Samuel M Smith PhD., a pioneering technologist in multiple fields, including automated reasoning, distributed systems, autonomous vehicles and blockchain protocol design. Dr. Smith has been refining and experimenting with such a cross-method mechanism since 2019, presenting at every meeting of the biannual Internet Identity Workshop. First came some core principles and requirements of a key infrastructure at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/OffChain_(PKI)_Key_Management_%E2%80%93_Revocation_Rotation">IIW28</a>, then at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI:_1_Universal_DKMI_Root(s)_of_Trust_Decentralized_Systems_Primitires_%26_DKMI_Last_Mile_of_Trust">IIW29</a> a series of sessions about different aspects of a hypothetical system of witnesses that could replicate logs. For <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_(C)_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">IIW30</a>, Dr Smith brought more concrete sessions on finer points and even the roadmapping session that became the DIF working group. Along the way, he has iterated an ever-growing <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">whitepaper</a> describing and explaining all of&nbsp;this.</p><p>Now, however, Dr Smith has moved the project into the DIF under the auspices of its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a> where he sits as co-chair. Asked about the decision, Dr Smith said, “DIF was a natural choice because I wanted the work to happen quickly but in the open, with participation from the greatest number of companies and innovators across various communities.”</p> KERI’s contributors: join&nbsp;us! <p>Foremost among DIF contributors is, of course, Dr Smith, who brings to his KERI design work more than a decade of engineering experience with scale and high-performance systems. Much of this work, focusing largely on AI and streaming/scaling projects, was done through his Python-centric consulting company <a href="http://prosapien.com">Prosapien.com</a>.

<p>This protocol for publishing service metadata within a 4-corner network enters the 60-day public review that precedes the call for consent as an OASIS Standard.</p> 

<p>OASIS and the OASIS Business Document Exchange (BDXR) TC [1] are pleased to announce that Service Metadata Publishing (SMP) Version 2.0 Committee Specification 02 is now available for public review and comment.</p>
<p>The TC members have approved [2] submitting this Committee Specification to the OASIS membership for consideration as a Candidate OASIS Standard, as described in the OASIS TC Process [6]. This is a 60-day public review, after which it may be submitted to a membership-wide call for consent to promote the specification to OASIS Standard.</p>
<p>This specification describes a protocol for publishing service metadata within a 4-corner network. In a 4-corner network, entities are exchanging business documents through intermediary gateway services (sometimes called Access Points). To successfully send a business document in a 4-corner network, an entity must be able to discover critical metadata about the recipient of the business document, such as types of documents the recipient is capable of receiving and methods of transport supported. The recipient makes this metadata available to other entities in the network through a Service Metadata Publisher service.</p>
<p>This specification describes the request/response exchanges between a Service Metadata Publisher and a client wishing to discover endpoint information. A client can either be an end-user business application or a gateway/access point in the 4-corner network. This specification also defines the request processing that must happen at the client.</p>
<p>The TC has received four Statements of Use from IBM, Philip Helger, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and Efact [3].</p>
<p>The candidate specification and related files are available here:</p>

<p>When the ToIP Foundation launched in May 2020, our mission was to define a new model for achieving trust online—a model that breaks away from the thousands of siloed solutions for secure, privacy-enhancing digital identity and trust that do not work with each other. This lack of interoperability costs billions of dollars per year in complicated and time-consuming integration and hinders adoption by the very customers we are trying to serve.</p>



<p>Our goal is to drive adoption of a new model for digital trust based on open standard digital wallets and digital credentials that are every bit as interoperable as the physical wallets and paper or plastic credentials that we use every day—to do everything from getting on a plane to entering a hospital to signing a mortgage. As these new tools emerge as the primary mechanism for contactless identity verification, payments, and other online transactions, they will become as essential to our digital lives as browsers and email clients have become to the Web today.</p>



<p>As that happens, it is critical to avoid recreating the vendor-lock in and fragmentation of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars</a>” that hindered the early days of the Web. Interoperable solutions that avoid vendor lock-in are paramount for a vibrant digital marketplace where consumers are free to choose their preferred digital wallet software from a variety of vendors and use digital credentials from any issuer as they choose.</p>



<p>The need for market-driven interoperability</p>



<p>Open standards alone do not produce interoperable market solutions—there are too many ways interoperability can still go off the rails. Testing labs are another step in the right direction—but vendors need incentives to use them, and those incentives can be scarce in a new market.</p>



<p>The ToIP Foundation recognized that, as our economy grows increasingly digital and collaboration tools grow steadily more powerful, there is a new path to interoperability: tapping market dynamics to drive incubation and adoption of truly interoperable solutions.</p>



<p>With this approach, vendors and customers voluntarily work together to develop interoperability testing requirements designed to meet explicit customer needs in the market. Vendors then satisfy those requirements by passing these interoperability tests with production-ready software.</p>



<p>Introducing the ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP)</p>



<p>To facilitate this new approach to market-driven interoperability, the Technology Stack Working Group of the ToIP Foundation developed the <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/technical-stack-wg/blob/master/TIP_LIFECYCLE_MANAGEMENT.md">ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP)</a>. A TIP represents a specific combination of technologies that span each of the four layers of the ToIP technology stack in order to meet the requirements of a set of target customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>TIPs can be designed, refined and supported by multiple vendors and customers wishing to collaborate on interoperability. A TIP typically includes the following elements critical to customer success:</p>



  Use cases capturing the specific requirements of customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems.  Design principles that must be clearly defined when combining technology and business policies to formulate a solution architecture.&nbsp;  Documentation that clearly communicates the design, architecture, features, and benefits of a TIP to the digital trust ecosystems targeted for adoption.  Best practices and implementation guidance for adoption of a TIP, including how to incorporate policies from the ToIP governance stack.  Interoperability tests that enable vendors supporting the TIP to be certified for verifiable interoperability.  Adoption metrics and case study references that provide quantifiable evidence of the real market impact.  



<p>TIPs harness market forces to drive convergence on interoperability</p>



<p>Each TIP consists of two types of components:</p>



  Fully-standardized components of the ToIP stack. These components, called ToIP Standard Specifications (TSS), are standards that have already gained Foundation-wide approval.&nbsp;  Custom components that are specific to a TIP. Some places in the ToIP stack do not yet have agreed-upon specifications. For these gaps, a TIP must specify how it fills the gap via an open community specification that can be implemented by any vendor or open source project.  



<p>A conceptual “lego block” picture of a complete four-layer TIP—showing how it is constructed from a combination of standard TSS components and custom TIP-specific components—is shown in the figure below.</p>



  



<p>Launching the Saturn-V TIP</p>



<p>The first TIP published by the ToIP Technology Stack Working Group is named for the historically significant multi-stage rocket platform, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V">Saturn-V</a>. This TIP emerged from work begun at a 2019 Connect-a-Thon event held by the Hyperledger Indy community. When the ToIP Foundation was launched in May 2020, ToIP members including Commerzbank (Main-Incubator), esatus AG, Evernym, IBM, Trinsic and idRamp recognized the opportunity to coalesce their collaboration into a TIP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the ToIP Technology Stack Working Group was formed, it established the criteria for managing the lifecycle of TIP from incubation through design, demonstration, acceptance and adoption. The Saturn-V collaborators then proposed their TIP following this process and it was formally accepted as a Draft Deliverable by the Technology Stack Working Group at their 24 August 2020 meeting.</p>



<p>The next stage: mission-critical collaboration on interoperability testing</p>



<p>All the vendors participating in the Saturn-V TIP actively pair with developers from other participants to work through agreed-upon test plans. Having the Technology Stack Working Group oversee the TIP development life cycle on behalf of all participating vendors ensures a more transparent and robust joint testing project than a typical multi-vendor “plug-fest”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the technologies used for the Saturn-V TIP are Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries at<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack/img/fig-1-toip-full-stack-2020-05-06.png?raw=true"> layers 1-3 of the ToIP Technology Stack</a>, the open source Aries Test suites will be used as the baseline for all test plans. Participating vendors are currently tackling the following stages of the Saturn-V Interop Test Plan One:</p>



  Self-Validation against Aries Protocol Test Suite for Aries Interop Profile v. 1.0  Peer-Validation
 
 Core Aries Interop Profile v. 1.0 (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">Aries RFC 302</a>), which supports DID connections, issuing credentials, and fulfilling proofs 
 Connectionless Proofs using the Service Decorator (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0056-service-decorator">Aries RFC 56</a>), 
 HTTP over DIDComm (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0348-transition-msg-type-to-https">Aries RFC 348</a>). 
 
  



<p>Future missions</p>



<p>Once Test Plan One is complete, TIP Participants will define Saturn-V Interop Test Plan Two which intends to minimally include peer-to-peer validation for:</p>



  Core Aries Interop Profile v. 2.0 (content and scope not yet defined by community)  Out-of-Band Protocol (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0434-outofband">Aries RFC 434</a>)  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">End-to-End testing the Aries Agent Test Harness</a> (contributed by the Government of British Columbia)  



<p>Once these stages of interoperability testing are completed, the Technology Stack Working Group will be able to assess whether component specifications of this TIP meets the criteria to become a TSS. If so, these will be advanced to become their own Draft Deliverables for ultimate approval by the Working Group and then the ToIP Steering Committee.</p>

<p>In December last year members elected the first Digital Identity NZ Executive Council. The Council is the governing group for the association; providing guidance and direction as we navigate the developing world of digital identity in Aotearoa. Each Council member is elected for a two-year term, with elections held annually and results notified at the Annual Meeting in December. As&nbsp;we approach the end of the year it is time for us to call for nominations for the Council seats coming up for re-election.</p>



<p>This year we have&nbsp;four&nbsp;positions up for election, two each in the Major Corporate and SME/Startup categories.<br><br>When we formed the Executive Council last year we asked that you consider electing a diverse group of members who reflect the diversity of the community we seek to support. You did that. The power of that diversity has shone through in the work of the Council this year, especially as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.<br><br>As the Council has reflected on its own makeup we have identified a number of areas where diversity would continue to improve our ability to serve the community. We would particularly welcome nominations from those involved in healthcare and kaupapa Māori organisations. We are also encouraging nominations from young people from within your organisations, as a youth perspective is incredibly important and pertinent to the work we do.<br><br>Once elected in December, one of the first duties of the new Council is to elect leadership roles. David Morrison has held the Chair role since our inception in 2018, and is an exceptional Kaiārahi (guide/counsellor/leader). David’s term on Council extends to 2021, and he has indicated that he is likely to step down from the Executive Council at that time. Our plan this year is for the Council to select two co-chairs to aid in a smooth transition. The opportunity to chair is open to any Council member, and we encourage any who have a desire and passion to serve in this way to make themselves available for nomination.<br><br>2021 is a pivotal year for digital identity with the introduction of the Digital Identity Bill and further development of the ecosystem. We are looking forward to some stellar nominations to help us in exploring and pursuing the best opportunities for Digital Identity NZ to make a positive difference in 2021 and beyond.</p>



<p>Executive Council Nominations</p>



<p>There is now an opportunity to put yourself forward or nominate someone else for a role on the Digital Identity NZ Executive Council. This year we have vacancies for the following positions:</p>



  Corporate&nbsp;– Major (2&nbsp;positions)  SME &amp; Start-up (2&nbsp;positions)  



<p>The nominees for the above positions must be from a Digital Identity NZ member organisation, and be from the same Digital Identity NZ Group that they are to represent on the Executive Council.<br><br>All nominations must be entered into the&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/3LRhbYXTWgVKx4Km8">online form here</a>&nbsp;by 5pm, Thursday 5 November 2020.</p>



<p>Digital Identity NZExecutive Council roles and responsibilities include:</p>

<p>By Sarah Drinkwater, Director, Responsible Technology</p><p>Today our grantee, WaitWhat, launched the second season of <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">Should This Exist?</a>, which earlier this year was nominated by the prestigious Webby Awards for best tech podcast in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>We put Should this Exist? on the “must listen” list! It stretches your understanding about radically new technology and its implications on our lives — both the promising and perilous. The storytelling is riveting, the topics are supremely well chosen, and the show’s host — Internet serial entrepreneur and investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Fake">Caterina Fake</a> — masterfully guides listeners on unforgettable journeys alongside the inventors of our times. In each episode, Caterina engages with a groundbreaking technology — from contact tracing, to a robot caregiving, to deepfake video production — to ask the important questions. The show surrounds you with ideas and interpretations, but ultimately leaves it to you to decide if the tech should exist, and how it&nbsp;should.</p><p>We’re excited to support this show because the world is hungry for this kind of conversation, as we’ve seen with interest in <a href="https://ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer</a> and in Netflix’s recent The Social Dilemma. We want to imagine and guide technology to its greatest potential and help technologists navigate around unintended consequences that are so hard to anticipate.</p><p>After you subscribe <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">here</a> to the podcast, you might want to sign up to the <a href="http://eepurl.com/gnZTf9">weekly newsletter</a>.</p><p>Here’s a <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">custom link</a> to today’s show if you’d like to share, and below, you can read more about our first three episodes.</p><p>LISTEN: <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar</a></p><p>Premieres Wednesday, October 14:<br>The deepfake detective<br>Chances are, you’ve seen a “deepfake” video. But did you know it? A new breed of tech detectives are building tools to spot these hyper-realistic videos — built with AI — where people say things they didn’t say or do things they’d never do. Some of these clips are just good, fanciful fun. But a deepfake deployed at the right moment could sway an election, or wreck a life. That’s why UC Berkeley professor Hany Farid is working on a “deepfake detective” — a tool to help media outlets know what’s real and what isn’t. But the same program could also give deepfakers a blueprint for how to make their work undetectable. Deepfake technology already exists. This episode asks: What should we do&nbsp;now?</p><p>Premieres Thursday, October 15:<br>Contact tracing: So promising. So invasive. <br>It’s one of the best weapons we have to contain a pandemic. But can it defeat the disease without spying on people who might carry it? MIT’s Kevin Esvelt has a bold idea: Let’s try a new form of contact tracing that could more than double the program’s impact. Bi-directional tracing looks both forward and backward from a known transmission, building a chart of the “undiscovered branches of the viral family tree” and identifying potential spreaders other systems can’t see. But how much of our data are we willing to give the government, even if it’s to fight Covid-19?</p><p>Premieres Wednesday, October 21:<br>Grandma, here’s your robot<br>Is it the loneliest idea you’ve ever heard? Or an ingenious hack that helps human caregivers be more attentive and empathetic? You might have these questions when you meet the robot caregivers who roam the halls at retirement homes, doing basic tasks for residents and keeping them connected. Is elder care something we want a robot to do? Roboticist Conor McGinn from Trinity College Dublin actually moved into a retirement home in Washington, DC, to gain a deeper understanding of what residents might want from a robot. The answer surprised him, and it prompts deeper questions: As humans, what responsibility do we have toward our elders? When we fail them, should robots close the gap? And is that the future we want for ourselves?</p>

 Lumen — The Year in&nbsp;Review  September 2019-August 2020 <p>By: Adam Holland, Andromeda Yelton, and Chris&nbsp;Bavitz</p> Introduction <p>September 2019 through the end of August 2020 marked the first year in which Lumen operated with a generous supporting grant from the Arcadia Fund. During that year, the project’s primary objectives fell within three themes: (1) technical improvements to the Lumen site and database; (2) expanding research opportunities, both internal and external; and (3) outreach, both to possible new notice-submitters and to the various constituencies of the Lumen user community. This post draws from Lumen’s first annual report to Arcadia and provides an overview of the project’s key activities during the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>To say the least, it was a complex and difficult year on a number of fronts — most notably, because of the COVID-19 pandemic that forced us into a remote work mode for much of 2020. That said, we were able to make significant progress on a number of key&nbsp;fronts:</p>  Lumen’s developers and technical support team achieved a great deal, especially on the backend of the site, and also by adding new user interface features and new notice categories.  Lumen had success increasing and improving external research using Lumen’s database, with database access credentials granted to 49 new researchers or research teams, ranging from college undergraduates and investigative reporters to law professors and economists. Several of these researchers produced substantive written work along with various other shorter articles and&nbsp;pieces.  Regarding outreach, we had conversations with a range of organizations, online service providers and individuals regarding working more closely with Lumen. The Lumen team participated in a multi-stakeholder virtual workshop in June of 2020, with more topic-specific workshops planned.  The onset of the pandemic put a wrench in the works in terms of hiring, but Lumen plans to bring onboard a new research fellow in the coming&nbsp;months.  <p>The remainder of this overview addresses and provides more details on these main themes in the order outlined&nbsp;above.</p> (1) Technical Improvements and&nbsp;Progress <p>In addition to too many small-scale bug fixes and one-off requests to name, the Lumen developers’ activity in the first year fell into several key main categories:</p> Security/anti-obsolescence updates   Lumen upgraded Rails (the web application framework the whole system uses) from version 4.2 to version&nbsp;5.2.  Lumen upgraded Ruby (the programming language in which Lumen’s site and administrative interface is built) from version 2.3 to version&nbsp;2.5.  Lumen upgraded various software libraries.  Lumen is in the process of upgrading its native search function from ElasticSearch version 5 to ElasticSearch version 7, which is expected to significantly improve the ability of researchers and others to access notices in the database.  <p>In combination, these upgrades and improvements improved system security and system performance, making the database notably faster for users. Additionally, the various improvements keep the site effectively modernized, which in turn allows developers to take advantage of and implement further improvements without too much work. Finally, the ongoing ElasticSearch upgrades allow Lumen administrators to more quickly and effectively redact sensitive data in Lumen’s notices (in addition to making site search functionality more powerful for&nbsp;users).</p><p>Overall, these technical improvements make the Lumen site easier to use by and more responsive to both its internal team and the research community. They also serve to “future-proof” the site to the extent possible, making it far more likely that Lumen will be able to continue to exist and thrive indefinitely, and making continued and sustained improvements easier to accomplish.</p> Improvements to the Lumen administrative interface   Lumen updated rails_admin from version 1.4 to version 2. As an example of modernization making more modernization easier and possible, this upgrade was only possible because of the underlying Ruby upgrade mentioned above.  Lumen added a Content Management System (CMS) to the site and migrated all the old blog posts and pages into it. The CMS will also make it much easier for the Lumen team to share out rich multimedia content on the Lumen website and write short pieces more rapidly and effectively. Some recent blog posts made using the CMS include a write-up of Lumen’s <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/lumen-best-practices-event">workshop on best practices in notice and takedown transparency</a>, <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/background-audio-takedowns">“Algorithmic Copyright Management: Background Audio, False Positives and De facto Censorship</a>” and “<a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/plandemic_DMCAs">Pandemic Misinformation Campaign Comes to&nbsp;Lumen.”</a>   Improvements to receiving and sharing notice&nbsp;data   A series of improvements to the Lumen application programming interface (“API”) improved the quality of data that the database is able to accept and process, most notably with respect to URLs submitted. Some URLs are malformed when submitted, and API improvements dramatically reduced the error rate upon submission.  Prompted by a series of distributed denial of service attacks on the Lumen site, Andromeda Yelton, the lead developer for Lumen, spent a great deal of time and effort putting into place, documenting, and continuing to improve on a series of changes and improvements for managing the requests for data that Lumen receives through its API, which represent a potential vulnerability for the site and database. These changes improved Lumen’s data security, made it easier for legitimate researchers to continue to use the site, and helped better allocate site and system resources. Andromeda later gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NvKfTSr7eU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=330">a presentation</a> about her work at Code4Lib.  Lumen added “Counterfeit” and “Placeholder” notice types. Google began accepting takedown notices referencing the presence of counterfeit goods or advertisements for them on Google sites, and in order to accommodate this new notices stream, we created a new template for such notices. Having this new type available also made it possible for the Lumen team to effectively reach out to new possible submitters, including Amazon and eBay. The “placeholder” notice is another new type that allows Lumen to accept more notice streams. Some large OSPs, like Google, receive takedown requests about which they are unable to share the details for legal reasons. Despite this, they still wish to indicate that they have received a request. In those cases, they can point their users to a “placeholder” notice that provides what details are available.   User Interface <p>Lumen made a series of changes regarding how visitors to the site see the URLs that are part of each notice. The changes make it possible for Lumen to present notice URLs in a truncated form to casual Lumen visitors, while still granting access to complete URLs to Lumen accredited researchers. Casual Lumen users can view one notice’s full set of URLs by providing an email address. Researchers with credentials can be granted access to notices within a limited time frame, up to a maximum specific number of notices, and with or without use of the Lumen API, and can also be given the ability to generate “permanent” versions of Lumen notice URLs that are suitable for use in published works or for citation.</p> (2) Research Using the Lumen&nbsp;Database <p>Lumen granted research credentials to forty-nine different researchers during the year in question. These researchers range from college undergraduates who have recently become interested in copyright law or censorship, to international researchers from a wide range of countries, including Brazil, Turkey, Ukraine, France, India, Austria, Russia, Germany, and the UK, as well as EU-affiliated researchers and international NGOs such as the Committee to Protect Journalists, as well as law professors and journalists and others in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>Many of the projects that these researchers are working on are still ongoing, such as Professor Eugene Volokh’s ongoing series of law journal articles about falsified court orders and online defamation law. Some of the completed research projects&nbsp;include:</p>  Asher-Schapiro, Avi, Zidan, Ahmed. “India Uses Opaque Legal Process to Suppress Kashmiri Journalism, Commentary on Twitter,” Committee to Protect Journalists (blog), October 24, 2019, <a href="https://cpj.org/2019/10/india-opaque-legal-process-suppress-kashmir-twitter/.">https://cpj.org/2019/10/india-opaque-legal-process-suppress-kashmir-twitter/.</a>  Fuller, Andrea, Grind, Kirsten, Palazzolo, Joe. “Google Hides News, Tricked by Fake Claims,” Wall Street Journal, May 15, 2020, sec.

Preliminary Results from a Natural Experiment. <a href="https://osf.io/nc7e2/">https://osf.io/nc7e2/</a>  <p>There are also many shorter articles online referencing or relying on Lumen, such as <a href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/twitter-barely-replied-indian-information-requests">this one</a>, from the Sunday Guardian Live, or <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/movie-tv-show-database-bombards-google-with-bizarre-takedown-notices-200126/">this one </a>from TorrentFreak.</p><p>Over the summer of 2020, the Lumen team also worked closely with a Harvard Law School student research assistant to begin developing a taxonomy of takedown notices, their underlying data, and the various involved stakeholders. This draft taxonomy seeks to cast light on the range of interests and incentives that a given stakeholder in the notice and takedown (“N&amp;TD”) ecosystem must balance with respect to whether a particular piece of information should come down and the degree to which there should be transparency regarding the request and any subsequent action taken. It is the Lumen team’s hope to soon turn this working draft into a white paper, as well as the raw material for a Lumen workshop, as well as use it to inform discussions on any statement of best practices regarding N&amp;TD transparency.</p> (3) Outreach  Events <p>The Lumen team’s original plan had been to hold a fairly intimate in-person workshop over the course of two days, as a way of initiating conversation between the various parts of Lumen’s user and research communities, and to plant the seed for more detailed and targeted workshops to come. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic got in the way of those plans, and as a result, the June workshop was held virtually. Although the Lumen team members were of course very disappointed to not be able to have the full in-depth workshop we had planned, especially the face-to-face network building and conversations, hosting a virtual event had some positive aspects. These included lower costs and the possibility of drawing more participants. The end result was that we were able to diversify and expand the initial invitee list substantially, including a wider range of interested parties, and — critically — giving the group more international representation. On that note, it meant that some foreign human rights activists who would otherwise not have been able to attend were present — including representatives of EngelliWeb, which has published a human rights report on Turkish takedowns that relies heavily on Lumen. The most recent of EngelliWeb’s reports can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://engelliweb.ifade.org.tr/">here</a>.</p><p>Using the lessons learned from this first virtual event, and anticipating that virtual events will be the norm for the foreseeable future, Lumen has planned a series of smaller and more topically focused events for the coming fall and winter, the first few of which will be focused on learning more from current and prospective Lumen researchers.</p> Outreach to New Sources of Notices and Notice&nbsp;Data <p>Encouraging recipients and senders of takedown notices to share copies of those notices with Lumen has proven to be one of the biggest challenges the team has faced. Although Lumen’s name recognition has clearly improved, due in no small part to the increased publicity from outside journalism and research publications, and although those companies with whom Lumen has existing relationships are generally positive about the benefits of sharing, some institutions are still loathe to share notices and notice data. Finding ways to be more effective at turning preliminary outreach into new data-sharing arrangements will be a top priority for the Lumen team in the coming&nbsp;year.</p> General Outreach and Media Participation <p>In addition to the June 2020 workshop mentioned above, and their ongoing work with Lumen researchers, members of the Lumen team participated in the following activities:</p>  Prompted by the increased attention paid to the Internet Archive after it announced its pandemic-motivated National Emergency Library, Adam Holland wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-internet-archives-new-national-emergency-library-generates-a-range-of-strong-reactions-10afc5d2abf7">Medium piece </a>examining the various points of view on the library, and urging the NEL to share any takedown notices it received with&nbsp;Lumen.  Lumen provided some statistics on Google takedowns to TorrentFreak for an&nbsp;article.  Lumen provided statistics on takedowns to Professor Rebecca Tushnet for her testimony to the<a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/the-digital-millennium-copyright-act-at-22-what-is-it-why-it-was-enacted-and-where-are-we-now"> Senate Judiciary subcommittee on the&nbsp;DMCA</a>.  Lumen Project Manager Adam Holland answered some questions from a cyberlaw professor about Google’s search index and robots.txt pertinent to the way in which the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) operates its publicly-accessible database of FL residents who have been previously convicted of various sex offenses.  As noted above, Andromeda Yelton gave<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NvKfTSr7eU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=330https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NvKfTSr7eU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=330"> a presentation on her work</a> defending Lumen against a Russian botnet to Code4Lib.  Adam spoke with a member of the data team of<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__thecorrespondent.com_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=SnvO2m0td3laYhZMLUgVrywBmVR2OC98yFxqHcbtCUM&amp;m=zxgR2e7-pX4UOhXaaySwWtN_jtXNWaknIZmgNpXreio&amp;s=jK3FtWysUuFhvb0EKv_Xg2232Wm5B2A8mtMF6Ta7gpE&amp;e="> The Correspondent</a>, a newsroom based in Amsterdam.  Adam provided general commentary regarding the DMCA and United States fair use law to Daniel Laufer, a German reporter interested in how a German company, Acromax Media, may be abusing the DMCA to take down critical reporting in Albania, and was <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2020/a-german-company-is-responsible-for-the-deletion-of-videos-critical-of-the-albanian-government/">quoted in the ensuing&nbsp;article.</a>  · Adam spoke to a New York Times reporter to give background information about DMCA takedowns for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/business/omegaverse-erotica-copyright.html">an article about a lawsuit</a> between two self-published Amazon&nbsp;authors.  Adam spoke with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/online-reputation-management-cbs-news-investigation-finds-fraudulent-court-orders-used-to-change-google-search/">CBS News</a> regarding a story about Professor Volokh’s research.  Adam spoke with the San Antonio Express News for a story posted online<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.expressnews.com_news_education_article_Someone-2Dasked-2DGoogle-2Drepeatedly-2Dto-2Dremove-2D14029141.php&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=NGg7VqmEIvldEdox2XBkRg9frrgwzBAfp51eaMWwbDg&amp;m=fku_iY8E4EEg8g4QAEQscLLAnDjbuYdpY0R00vp71YA&amp;s=1UiSarqNrgKzLfz6_DtvmOOzkdCU9H2lthmiVTF4ab0&amp;e=">&nbsp;here</a>.  Additionally, members of the Lumen team provided background information regarding Lumen, the DMCA and notice &amp; takedown generally to inquiries from journalists, activists, legislative staffers, researchers, and other interested parties.  <p>Of special note, on December 16, 2019, Lumen project manager Adam Holland and Lumen PI Chris Bavitz made comments to the Third Meeting of the Stakeholder Dialogue on Art. 17 of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market in Brussels. Article 17 references “”Use of protected content by online content-sharing service providers.”</p><p>The presentation was well-received, and also was a boost to Lumen’s broader publicity. Lumen was invited to join a multi-stakeholder mailing list regarding ongoing Article 17 discussions, in which it continues to participate, and also made several new EU contacts, including a former member to the EU Parliament, who have kept Lumen apprised of opportunities to contribute comments or thoughts to ongoing copyright and intermediary liability-related legislative and regulatory discussions within the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>A copy of the remarks can be found&nbsp;at:</p><p>Bavitz, Chris, Holland,Adam, “Lumen Presents Comments to the Third Meeting of the Stakeholder Dialogue on Art. 17 of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market in Brussels” (December 17, 2019) <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/807">https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/807</a></p><p>A recording of the day’s proceedings is available at:</p><p>“COPYRIGHT STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUES — Streaming Service of the European Commission,” <a href="https://webcast.ec.europa.eu/copyright-stakeholder-dialogues-16-12.">https://webcast.ec.europa.eu/copyright-stakeholder-dialogues-16-12</a>, (accessed October 8,&nbsp;2020)</p><p>Lumen’s participation begins at approximately the 4:00:00&nbsp;mark.</p> Other outreach&nbsp;efforts <p>The Lumen team has also had productive conversations with a variety of other activists and researchers about possible cooperative efforts, including with Carrie Goldberg, an American lawyer specializing in representing victims of so-called “revenge porn”; the “Disinfodex” project emerging from the Berkman Klein Center’s 2019–2020 Assembly Program; the Digital Public Library of America, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Harvard’s Caselaw Access Project, and the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society in&nbsp;Berlin.</p> Social Media Statistics <p>Lumen maintains a Twitter account, from which it tweets or retweets about content moderation, takedowns, censorship, academic freedoms, the “right to be forgotten” and other news related to online information. During the period from September 1, 2019 to August 31,&nbsp;2020:</p>  The account added 986 new followers, a ~25%&nbsp;increase  The engagement rate on Lumen’s tweets and retweets went up each quarter, from 0.9% in the first to 2.0 % in the&nbsp;fourth.  Lumen’s tweets received 1.41 million total impressions, and an average of between 20 and 25 link clicks per&nbsp;day.  Lumen’s top mention in terms of engagements (an order of magnitude greater than typical) was when a CNN reporter mentioned Lumen in a tweet referencing a takedown notice sent regarding Donald Trump’s&nbsp;account.   Data and Material&nbsp;Produced <p>During this year, the Lumen database added ~2.6 million more notices, referencing many millions of URLs, involving approximately fifty-eight thousand separate entities. As mentioned above in the technical improvements sections, we put into place our planned changes for displaying URLs in a truncated form to casual Lumen visitors, while granting access to full notices with complete URLs to researchers requesting access. We were and are gratified to have received relatively few complaints from users regarding the change, and none from active researchers. Current policy is to grant a single request per email address to view a notice. Lumen has consistently averaged approximately one thousand such requests per day, but may revisit and revise the bounds of that policy in the coming&nbsp;year.</p><p>During the time period from September 1, 2019 to September 1, 2020, Lumen received almost six hundred thousand unique visitors, who visited Lumen close to fourteen million times, viewing over nineteen million unique Lumen website pages. These traffic numbers represent an approximately 50% increase in activity from the previous year, which the Lumen team attributes to both more research activity and greater use of the site by the public at&nbsp;large.</p><p>The most visited Lumen URL was <a href="http://lumendatabase.org/notices/9415">http://lumendatabase.org/notices/9415</a>, which is a Google placeholder notice for search results that contain URLs reported as illegal under German youth protection laws. There is no way to be certain as to why this notice is visited often, but it may be that this notice’s popularity is a rough proxy for the number of such removals by Google in Germany and the number of searches the internet-using German public performs for the underlying material. Or, it could be the relative novelty of the new laws is driving interest. The second most visited Lumen page, close behind first in terms of total visits, was Lumen’s own search&nbsp;page.</p> Conclusion <p>In the year to come, the Lumen team looks forward to continued progress on all fronts, from expanding the scope, scale and impact of research done with Lumen’s data and gathering new sources of takedown notice data, to improving the Lumen user experience and adding new members to the Lumen team, There will be more events, whether virtual or in person, more publications, and more opportunities to get involved.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/lumen-the-year-in-review-ed6bf4d4be4b">Lumen — The Year in Review:</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>1.What is the mission and vision of Stash?</p>



<p>Our mission is to provide people with the tools and education to help them protect their online accounts. Our vision is a digital world in which people do not reuse any of their passwords across multiple accounts. Ever. <a href="https://stashpass.co/">Stash</a> is bringing this vision to reality by delivering an offline password manager that makes it easy for people to create and securely manage strong, unique passwords for every single account they have. Ultimately, removing the difficulty and frustrations of having to do it on their own.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



 <a href="https://stashpass.co/"></a> 



<p>In the digital age, it is too easy for people to remain anonymous online or claim to be someone they aren’t. In the physical world, we have ways of proving who we are through different identification methods which makes it difficult for someone to fake their identity. As we increasingly go digital, we need a form of digital identity to help people stay secure and limit their risks of being the subject of fraudulent activity.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does Stash address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Simply put, digital identity will make it safer and easier for Canadians to operate online. This will lead to people conducting more business online, nationally and internationally, in ways in which they were not comfortable before.</p>



<p>While it is clear that digital services aid in the efficiencies of businesses and organizations, trusted digital identity has been relegated to a side note by many leaders across numerous sectors in Canada. As digital solutions continue to evolve, access to such services still requires end users to create usernames and passwords – leaving them with hundreds of login credentials to manage.</p>



<p>In the digital world, it has become critical to have strong password management practices. With the ever-increasing amount of online services that require passwords, many are left feeling overwhelmed and frustrated leading them to sacrifice security for convenience. Using a password manager allows people to improve their password security while providing the convenience and peace of mind needed to go about their lives.</p>



<p>Stash Password Manager was created to remove the frustrations of trying to manage unique, complex passwords for all of our digital accounts while ensuring each of your usernames and passwords are securely stored offline and making logging into accounts easy.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada is seen by many global observers as a trustworthy, safe and stable country. Once Canada moves beyond its strategic framework and implements various capacities of digital identification, our reputation will allow us to help influence the rest of the world in adopting a standardized digital identity protocol.</p>



<p>5. Why did Stash join the DIACC?</p>



<p>We believe our patent pending Island Technology™ and our approach to online security can assist in DIACC’s mission to achieve excellence in digital identity.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about Stash?</p>



<p>The simplest way for people to protect their own digital accounts is by having a strong, unique password for every single account they have.</p>



<p>Stash was created because we realized people needed a way, that was both secure and convenient, to easily manage all of the different usernames and passwords they are forced to use in the digital age. We believe the only way to securely manage all of our login credentials (usernames + passwords) and truly keep them safe is to physically store them offline in a way that keeps them disconnected from the internet. This means they should not be managed on any device that is connected to the internet, as those devices can be hacked.</p>



<p>At the heart of Stash is Island Technology™. Island Technology™ creates an air-gapped “island” which allows a user to isolate their data and store it in a secure manner that keeps it disconnected from the internet. Essentially it acts as a dynamic, one way communication bridge that safely transfers data from a disconnected vault to the online world. Although we utilize this technology in transferring login credentials, other companies are now beginning to recognize Island Technology™ for its unique utility in additional use cases.</p>

 A Decade of Digital Public Goods: Holding Up the Digital Economy, Preventing Monopolies, and Safeguarding Freedoms for&nbsp;All <p>By CV Madhukar, Managing Director, Responsible Technology</p>Long lines form with South Africans waiting to receive COVID relief&nbsp;funds.<p>Digital platforms, such as <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/the-open-source-identity-platform-mosip-hits-a-new-milestone-ff9137610bed">digital identity</a> and interoperable <a href="https://mojaloop.io/">payment systems</a>, form the scaffolding that holds up our entire digital economy, improving the delivery of basic services to millions.</p><p>While not visible, this digital architecture has the power to enhance many different aspects of our lives, wherever we live on the globe. Identification enables people to open new bank accounts and access public services like education and health. While interoperable payment systems have the ability to drive down transaction costs for consumers.</p><p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen just how essential digital infrastructure can be. South Korea and Singapore were able to use theirs to track and trace who had contracted the virus — and to whom they had been in close proximity with. India used its digital infrastructure to send more than $200 million in emergency aid directly to more than 340 million citizens in a matter of days. Estonia, meanwhile, used its digital infrastructure to create digital immunity passports, which allow those who have recently tested negative for the novel coronavirus to return to work in person. <br> <br>The problem is that this kind of digital infrastructure is only present in a few countries around the world — which leaves the rest of us to depend on slower, less reliable systems. Even in countries as wealthy as the US, unemployment benefits, which could be paid in seconds via digital infrastructure, can take months to process due to antiquated technology and processes. And when it comes to countries with far fewer resources, especially in Africa, the lack of digital infrastructure can create even bigger impediments to access even basis services. For example, the lack of formal identification is one of the biggest barriers for financial inclusion. And even if governments and philanthropists have every intention of supporting vulnerable people, these will remain mere intentions without a mechanism through which they can get people the resources they need. <br> <br>That’s why Omidyar Network is working to make sure countries have the technical resources to build the digital infrastructure that is powering so much of the developed world — and to do it in a way that is cost-saving, open-sourced, and empowering to local entrepreneurs who will no longer have to be dependent on big technology companies.</p><p>To be clear, digital infrastructure must also be accompanied by rigorous laws and policies to protect individual privacy and prevent harms. Digital infrastructure must be built so people have control over how their data are used, and data privacy must be built-in, not opt-in. It should be seen as a public good that enables private-sector growth, prevents digital monopolies, and safeguards the rights and freedoms of&nbsp;all.</p><p>On September 18, New America organized a virtual event, “<a href="https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/events/un-general-assembly-2020/">2030: A Decade of Digital Public Goods for Effective Institutions</a>,” on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. Philanthropists, heads of state, government regulators, civil society leaders, and startups gathered to launch a decade of work to develop digital goods for the public sector. Several speakers pointed to the shortage of public investment in building such infrastructure.</p><p>We urgently need philanthropists to not only bring development assistance to the countries that need it, but to also invest in the infrastructure that makes it possible to get there. We need governments to own this agenda and build tech so the management of large-scale, digital infrastructure lies within the country’s elected institutions. And in an era where data has become a key factor of economic development, we need to focus on empowering individuals with agency, thereby generating the greatest benefit to the&nbsp;people.</p><p>That’s not to say the private sector won’t reap any rewards from these investments, on the contrary. In the same way companies benefit from public works like roads, bridges, and tunnels, they will also be able to innovate on top of this foundational layer of digital infrastructure — and reach customers they never could have found otherwise. Likewise, this technology will be able to multiply returns on philanthropic investments by exponentially expanding the universe for people across the world. <br> <br>Put simply, digital infrastructure is a first-mile necessity for an equitable digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>This could have a positive, transformative impact on the global economy and global development. But it’s going to take all of us to install safe and inclusive, digital infrastructure all over the world. If we make this kind of investment, we can begin to build a world where gaps in technology never limit the programs governments can implement, the progress they can make, or anything people do to improve their own&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Watch the full <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/events/un-general-assembly-2020/">event recording</a> online to hear how others in the conversation proposed advancing the #DigitalDecade to support public institutions.</p>

<p>New specifications advance OSLC initiative to enable interoperation of change, configuration, and asset management processes across application and product lifecycles.</p> 

<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that OSLC Core v3.0, OSLC Query v3.0, OSLC Requirements Management v2.1, and OSLC Change Management v3.0 from the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration Open Project [1] have been approved as an OASIS Project Specifications.</p>
<p>These join the previously announced OSLC Quality Management v2.1 as the first approved Project Specifications from the Open Projects program. Managing change and configuration in a complex systems development lifecycle is very difficult, especially in heterogeneous environments that include homegrown tools, open source projects, and commercial tools from different vendors. The OSLC initiative applies World Wide Web and Linked Data principles to enable interoperation of change, configuration, and asset management processes across a product’s entire application and product lifecycle.</p>
 
 OSLC Core defines the overall approach to Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration based specifications and capabilities that extend and complement the W3C Linked Data Platform. 
 OSLC Query provides a mechanism for a client to search for RDF resources that match a given criteria. 
 OSLC Requirements Management support key RESTful web service interfaces for the management of Requirements, Requirements Collections and supporting resources defined in OSLC Core. 
 OSLC Change Management defines a RESTful web services interface for the management of product change requests, activities, tasks and relationships between those and related resources such as requirements, test cases, or architectural resources. 
 
<p>These Project Specifications are OASIS deliverables, completed and approved by the OP’s Project Governing Board and fully ready for testing and implementation. The applicable open source licenses can be found in the project’s administrative repository at <a href="https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/LICENSE.md">https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/LICENSE.md</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>The 8-month Business-oriented Programme offers business and technical support to integrate SSI technology with market propositions and it’s structured in 3 competitive stages (only the best performing projects in each phase are entering the next).</p>
<p>The initial stage, which expanded for the first month, was intended for the teams to work in the Proof of concept of their projects and to start building their business case. They both presented the outcomes of their work during business pitches and technology demonstrations in the online Hackathon which took part on September 16th&nbsp;and 17th. All the 19 projects who took part in this first stage, including those by <a href="https://www.filancore.com/">Filancore</a>, <a href="https://www.wellbeingcart.com/">Wellbeing cart</a>, <a href="https://www.mydata.org/">MyData Global</a> and <a href="https://spherity.com/">Spherity</a>, will receive € 15,000 funding to reward their efforts.</p>
<p>During the second stage, which already is ongoing, the 15 selected teams will work during the next 5 months on their developments to create a mock-up and a Prototype and on their business models and will cooperate among them to create a real ecosystem ensuring interoperability and scalability. Funding linked to the participation in this stage is € 50,000.</p>
<p>Only the best-in-class teams from those will reach the third stage and focus on testing their MVPs and defining Business models to get a final funding of € 41,000.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 
					 Are you curious about which ones will be those completing the programme? 
					  
 
 
<p>Follow up the course of the programme at eSSIF-Lab space in NGI Community and join us in congratulating all the participating teams on their development efforts so far!</p>

				 <p>Last but not least, 2nd Business-oriented Call is expected to launch in late spring 2021, and it will be open to SMEs and startups developing commercial SSI-based applications and services with focus in the verticals of HealthTech, eGovernment, Education or competing in the generic track of Open Disruptive Innovation.

    Hi friends,<br>  <br>  If you're interested in getting involved in the Global Privacy Control Spec, you can join the W3C Privacy CG <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/privacycg/">https://www.w3.org/community/privacycg/</a>, and participate in the GPC discussion here:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues/10">https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues/10</a>&nbsp;<br>  <br>  I sent my concerns to the Certification WG last week so won't repeat them all here.&nbsp;<br>  <br>  My main problem with the spec is that it is functionally an opt out--meaning that the individual must take an action to deliberately opt out of selling data.&nbsp; Once again, the burden is put on the individual.<br>  <br>  A central thesis in CCPA and the folks drafting the spec seems to be that "Privacy by default is great but has even more legal teeth with this preference chosen explicitly." [quote from issue in github by Henry Lou]<br>  <br>  Richard and I discussed this a bit earlier in the year, and I'm still confused about the legal foundation for this assertion, and why it's being framed like this.&nbsp; Wouldn't Privacy by default be kinder, and more respectful? Better?&nbsp;<br>  <br>  In any case, I highly encourage you to get involved directly in the work.&nbsp; (Because there's a lot of interesting stuff happening in the Privacy CG.)<br>  <br>  Lisa  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>

<p>What standards are and what it means to make them&nbsp;openly</p><p>I<a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76">n our last post</a> in the series, we drilled down into a granular definition of “open-source” development and the thinking that goes into a choice of license. In this post, we drill down into what “standards” are, and the characteristics of an “open process” for developing standards. Supporting these open standards is where the bulk of DIF’s efforts and resources are focused. In the next post in the series, we will turn to how open source and open standards work together to create new business models and strategies with real-world consequences for cooperation, “coöpetition,” and healthy&nbsp;markets.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jimquenzer">Jim&nbsp;Quenzer</a><p>It is worth noting up front that the term standard has two slightly different usages. One is related to quality assurance or business process compliance — think of marketing that references “the highest standards of _____ ”. This refers to specifications and metrics used to grade outputs in a regulated industry or sector, like “Grade A Beef”. These are set and enforced by some combination of regulators, private-sector auditors and industry associations. Outside of software, this is usually what people refer to by “standardization:” and a specialist in any industry can wax eloquent on the politics and the consequences of decisions by standards bodies fixing those specifications and&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>In software and other IP-driven industries like medicine or engineering, standards have more to do with control and portability of data, enforcing measurable compatibility with the products of others. A common metaphor for this kind of standardization is the width or “gauge” of railway tracks — how far apart the rails are is a somewhat arbitrary decision but if they are different between two countries or regions they will have completely distinct rail systems. Software standards work much the same way, and for this reason standardization is often a prerequisite of procurements from government or substantial investments in the private sector. No one wants to invest in locomotives if all the places they want to take it… use different rails.</p><p>In the software world, as in the world of trains, standards define a given market for products and services. Compliance tests make objective (and far less controversial) the question of whether or not a given product meets a given set of requirements. Explicitly-defined, testable protocols make products provably swappable and/or interoperable. Open standards processes try to define those tests and protocols in the open, with input from initial and future contenders in that market, speeding up the timeline to legitimacy by incorporating major players and incorporating widely-sourced input.</p> Standards processes, as inherited from tangible industries <p>One way to explain standards processes is to begin with some examples in the physical world, which we learned about as matters of fact in our education. These evolved to support the creation of precise manufacturing methods and to support more seamless commerce, giving stability and safety to commodity markets. Weights and measures are classic standards that support for both: after all, there is nothing natural about our units of measure or currencies, as anyone who’s used both metric and non-metric measures knows all too well. How long is something? How heavy is something? How much liquid is in a gallon or&nbsp;liter?</p><p>Standardizing these kinds of measures was a quantum leap for commerce and mercantilism: it gave everyone a common reference point and enabled accounting systems (and “ledgers”) of vastly wider scope and simplicity. The fact that standards have been decided at the international level means it can happen on a global scale. The metric system, for example, is defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, an international standards development organization (<a href="http://unicode.org/faq/sdos.html">SDO</a>). There is little debate in 2020 about what a gram is (it’s the weight of one milli-liter of water), but things like tolerance or accuracy in weighing and marking system is still an ongoing matter of debate and specification carried out&nbsp;there.</p><p>Another physical world standard is the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691170817/the-box">shipping container</a>. A whole global infrastructure has been built around this standard-sized container that allows it to be put on truck beds, shipped on train cars and put in ships that go around the world. It also means if you can fit whatever your thing is inside that box it can get to almost anywhere in the world because there is a standards based infrastructure that can handle it. Massive economies of scale (which have terraformed geopolitics by enabling high-throughput, high-efficiency global trade networks) are unlocked by this kind of standard, which enables the movement of containers (in most cases with no knowledge, or no direct knowledge, of what is inside them) to become a kind of commodity whose price stabilizes and steadies far-flung trade. The analogy to the “packets” or “data points” of modern information technology has been a mainstay of thinking about software business models for decades, and W3C Verifiable Credentials are <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">no exception</a>.</p><p>Similar standards also govern the electricity coming out of the walls in our houses, which has become so reliable and ubiquitous over the last century that few people outside of the relevant industries think much about it, or how dangerous it would be if standards were loosened. The “amount” (load and speed) of electricity, as well as the physical form factor of plugs, wiring, and circuit boards are all standardized at the national or regional level. This creates regional economies of scale in both the delivery of energy as a resource and in the manufacturing of electricity-powered products. Indeed, much of software engineering as an academic discipline and a labor market, as well as many standards around data and their governing standards bodies, evolved out of the electrical and communications infrastructure that preceded the advent of modern software.</p> Standards processes, for bits and&nbsp;bytes <p>Digital technology also needs explicit and testable standards, deliberated by specialists and engineers in a transparent process for the common good and for the stability of huge systems of capital and human effort. As the internet has evolved, the bulk of this effort has focused on the definition of common protocols that allow information to be exchanged by different computer systems, potentially written in very different languages and operating across very different topographies, with very different inputs and automations and governance structures.</p><p>The protocols that make up the modern internet were originally created by the group that began building the ARPA network. In 1986 the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Forcehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">IETF</a>) formed and it is still the steward of many key protocols that form the basis of much of the internet, particularly around security and load-balancing at massive, infrastructure scale. The <a href="http://w3c.org/">Worldwide Web Consortium</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">W3C</a>) was formed in 1994 and works to develop the software standards for the World Wide Web’s core technologies: browsers and&nbsp;servers.</p><p>One example we all use every day is E-mail, or as it was once known, “electronic mail”. How addressing and discovery can work, the limits and parameters of a universally-recognizable address, etc are all written up in authoritative specification documents. Colloquially, these documents are often referred to as “the standard,” or “the RFCs” (“Request[s] for Comment” referring to the collective editorial process by which standards are written). Email is typical, however, in that a patchwork of multiple interlocking protocols are actually required to send and receive&nbsp;emails.</p><p>Although this list of protocols needs to move slowly to give the end-consumer stability and assurance, the list is actually in a state of permanent minor flux, as individual protocols are iterated and upgrades, support for older versions fades away, and now protocols are added that take advantage of security or performance enhancements reaching critical mass elsewhere. For decades, the dominant protocols in email have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)</a>, and underlying handshake/transport protocols like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a>. As you can see clicking any of these links, the “standard” (current best practices and specifications) are compromised of a patchwork of iterating and component specifications with a more narrow scope, allowing for a kind of modular and incremental evolution allowing markets and applications to phase components and subsystems in and out over time without interruptions to service or sudden changes in user experience.</p><p>Another example we use every day is “web standards,” i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>. These protocols are the standards that let any web server present information according to prescriptive formats which will be displayed in roughly the same way by any compliant web browser. Here, as in weights and measures, or electricity, there are always slippages and margins for error, though, as any front-end developer can tell you) This enables a diversity of web servers and a diversity of browsers. There are of course open source examples of each (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">Apache Server </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox Browsers</a> being two examples) but there are also proprietary versions of them as&nbsp;well.</p><p>To many observers, the degree of openness in the codebase matters less than the diversity and complexity of organizations involved in the governance of the protocols: in this regard, control of “browser standards” might be endangered by increasing market power on the part of browser vendors owned by private entities that also have outsized and direct control over operating systems and app store platforms, upon which any competing browser would depend directly. Neither open source nor open standards are a guarantee of a healthy and open market, although both generally contribute to that&nbsp;end.</p> Standards and Proto-standards <p>Standards development is generally a slow process taking years, driven by a balance between (rough) consensus between stakeholders refining and iterating requirements and running code against which these requirements can be measured or considered. Depending on the context, stakeholders can include vendors or commercial actors, regulators, consumer advocacy groups, affected industries, and/or individuals. The terms “running” and “code” both cover a lot of territory, but it would be impossible to arrive at a standard without at least two independent, functioning pieces of code that have been tested, audited, and hardened, ideally by some deployment at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>In some cases, this is where an open standards process begins: two maximally independent implementations decide to cooperate for greater adoption and maturity, and seek out a venue for the relevant stakeholders to debate the merits and trade-offs of their current codebases and future variations or possibilities. Different standards bodies can be more or less public in their processes, more or less transparent in their results, and more or less complex in their rules of engagement: indeed, some operate according to a rulebook as complex as that of a parliament, and a style guide as exacting as an academic institution.</p><p>For the most open of standards, however, it is possible to work in the open, deliberatively and transparently, long before this “first” step. Working in an industry group, trade association, or other neutral venue can speed up the work towards a standards by front-loading the collaboration, peer-review, market-testing, and process legitimacy needed to get an idea ready for the market and standardization sooner. These “pre-standards” venues are like containers where all those participating have signed an IPR agreement up front that means their work is unencumbered by patents or royalties and safe from being front-run or patent-trolled.</p><p>The products of these pre-standards processes are often called “pre-standard specifications” or “proto-standards” (if they are more ambitious and protocol-shaped). Groups that develop proto-standards often have explicitly-defined processes for how to publish a proto-standard, as well as when and how to hand off a sufficiently matured proto-standard to an SDO process for more formal and authoritative standardization.</p><p>We should not overstate the distinction between standards and pre-standards, however: there are many shares of grey in between. “Standards-track” and “non-standards-track” specifications alike can be more mature or legitimate depending on the parties involved, the pertinent SDOs (or lack thereof), and of course the process used to create them. For this reason, work items and working groups at the DIF avail themselves of multiple procedural options and tailor their processes to the context, which is why “scoping” and “chartering” processes can take months to hammer out between organizations and their legal departments. This is also specifications developed at DIF without being further hardened in a more formal standards body can sometimes be called “standards,” in the sense that they are adopted in the industry and function as standards. How the market and the relevant industries treat, and trust, and rely on a specification is the ultimate judge of when it can be called the authoritative text for a standard process or procedure!</p><p>In our next drill-down, we’ll go into more detail on DIF’s processes, how you can get involved, and what decisions go into assuming an active role in a working group or work&nbsp;item.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495">Drilling down: Open Standards</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of the Digital Technology Supercluster?</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU0HuZLGSuU&amp;feature=youtu.be">Digital Technology Supercluster </a>solves some of industry’s and society’s biggest problems through Canadian-made technologies. We bring together private and public sector organizations of all sizes to address challenges facing Canada’s economic sectors including healthcare, natural resources, manufacturing and transportation. Through this ‘collaborative innovation’ the Supercluster helps to drive solutions better than any single organization could on its own.</p>



 <a href="https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/"></a> 



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets? </p>



<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic, now more than ever we are relying on our ability to prove our identity and key personal information remotely. Over the past six months, we have worked with dozens of organizations to develop and deploy cutting-edge digital and virtual health platforms. A critical requirement to ensure uptake of these developments is ensuring that Canadians feel they are in control of their personal data and have trust in the institutions and protocols we have created.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does the Digital Technology Supercluster address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>For the Digital Technology Supercluster, we see digital identity as a key component in the adoption of our many innovative technologies – whether it’s accessing remote addiction and mental health treatment for health care workers, or receiving post-surgical treatment from home. Without secure digital identity, Canada will be unable to continue developing innovative solutions like these. As a team, we strive to collaborate with companies (large and small), organizations and academic institutions to ensure that we are addressing digital security from all sides. Ensuring privacy and control of personal information is at the heart of what we do, and organizations like DIACC provide critical guidance on this front.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>Canada is already seen as a leader in the global economy. We are known for our transparency, ethical business practices and diverse resources. This foundation puts us on solid ground for not only contributing to the policy of digital identity, but alongside DIACC, leading the way on international interoperability in this space.</p>



<p>5. Why did the Digital Technology Supercluster join the DIACC?</p>



<p>We believe there is power in coming together towards a common goal, and that there is strength in bringing different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds to the table. To reach Canada’s full potential, it is critical that we leverage our diversity and unique strengths to share knowledge and expertise.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about the Digital Technology Supercluster?</p>

<p>Kantara to Provide Its NIST SP 800-63-3 Conformity Assessment For Identity Proofing &amp; Authentication</p>
<p>WAKEFIELD, Mass., USA – October 7, 2020 — <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> announced today that the United States General Services Administration (GSA) is joining Kantara and plans to put its Login.gov service through the Kantara assurance and approval program based on third-party assessment against the requirements detailed in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines.</p>
<p>“NIST SP 800-63-3 is focused on modernizing the policy in keeping with rising threat levels for identity proofing, verification and authentication whilst also improving privacy in the overall digital user experience,” said Colin Wallis, Executive Director, Kantara Initiative.&nbsp; “Kantara has developed assessment criteria against each of 63-3’s normative requirements to drive consistency in assessments of applicable credential service providers (CSPs) done by Kantara 3rd party accredited assessors. Consistency in assessments drives long term integrity in Kantara’s Trust Framework and Trust Marks internationally, thereby building trust and confidence for all stakeholders in the wider digital economy.”</p>
<p>With the GSA’s oversight, Login.gov provides simple, secure, private access to participating US government digital services online.&nbsp; A single privacy-aware login.gov account can sign-in to multiple government agencies making managing federal benefits, services and applications easier and more secure for the public. Login.gov is used by over 60 applications at 17 agencies including the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy and the Executive Office of the President. To date, over 25 million people have signed up to use login.gov.</p>
<p>Kantara is one of the leading global consortiums improving trustworthy use of identity and personal data through innovation, standardization and good practice. It <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/800-63-3/">provides third party assessment against the NIST SP 800-63-3 for identity proofing and authentication</a>. US Government agencies are required to follow NIST guidelines and independent, external assessment is acknowledged as best practice to demonstrate NIST standards compliance.</p>
<p>Kantara was authorized as a US Government Trust Framework provider to the GSA’s then FICAM Trust Framework Solutions (TFS) program in 2011 and works with governments and standards-bodies internationally to align its Trust Mark program for multi-jurisdictional adoption. Kantara is one of the premier Trust Framework Providers aligned with the US National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC) program as well as similar initiatives outside the US.</p>
<p>NIST SP 800-63-3</p>
<p>NIST SP 800-63-3 is the set of prevailing digital identity guidelines to which US Federal agencies implementing identity verification and authentication must comply. It also serves as a widely-recognized benchmark for any organization or business wishing to implement identity verification and authentication services, both internationally as well as within the US.</p>
<p>About Kantara Initiative Trust Framework</p>
<p>Kantara Initiative’s Trust Framework Operations and Identity Assurance program is the industry leading program that&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/idassurance/assessor-accreditation/">accredits Assessors </a>and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/idassurance/service-provider-approval/">approves Credential Service Providers</a> (CSPs).&nbsp; The program offers three Classes of Approval that enable CSPs to seek approval of their Identity and Credential Management Services as meeting NIST 800-63 rev.3 requirements. By design, Kantara’s IAF can be applied to a range of standards-derived schemes and classes of approval to verify an organization’s conformance, including NIST SP 800-63-3.</p>
<p>About Kantara Initiative</p>
<p>The Kantara Initiative is one of the leading global consortiums improving trustworthy use of digital identity and personal data through innovation, standardization and good practice. Kantara provides real-world innovation through its development of specifications, applied R&amp;D and conformity assessment programs for the digital identity and personal data ecosystems.

 Omidyar Network’s Official Statement on Today’s Report Issued by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law <p>The House Judiciary subcommittee’s recommendations released today represent the most comprehensive response from Congress to date on anti-competitive conduct in the tech sector. After a lengthy probe into industry giants Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook, we are grateful to see bipartisan understanding of the problems posed by unchecked concentration in this sector, the recognition of how competition policy can improve, and the need for additional resources to enable the DOJ and FTC to enforce existing antitrust laws. We are even more encouraged to see proposals for legislative changes and increased oversight.</p><p>Until now, critical areas of the internet have remained <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/youre-grounded-and-we-re-taking-away-the-keys-to-the-car-b80cf01f527f">unregulated and unchecked</a>, requiring the sort of dedicated investigation that the report reflects. The potentially illegal market dominance of the largest technology platforms, as well as their social and political power, is seriously threatening our individual freedoms, workers’ rights, economies, and democracies. From widespread disinformation and discrimination against vulnerable groups, to questionable tactics to kill competition and pervasive surveillance practices; we have ample <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/a-legal-roadmap-to-address-googles-monopoly-on-search-engines-effdfbcbc1f7">evidence</a> that the status quo is creating adverse conditions for individuals and society at&nbsp;large.</p><p>The “<a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/investigation_of_competition_in_digital_markets_majority_staff_report_and_recommendations.pdf">Investigation of Competition in Digital Markets</a>” Majority Staff Report and Recommendations from the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law, is a thoughtful roadmap for legislative and regulatory action to reign in the power of big tech, protect Americans, and guide Congress’s work in the coming year. Democrats and Republicans agree that the dominant technology platforms have acquired monopoly power in their respective markets; federal agencies should have more resources for enforcement; interoperability and data portability should be mandated; and the burden of proof in merger cases should be shifted. Democrats go beyond, and propose to mandate structural separation between the technology platforms’ many business units, and the removal of certain barriers to private antitrust enforcement.</p><p>To better steward technology and shape the rules of the road for the future, we believe that all people — including those who use technology, or are directly affected by these companies’ business practices — should have a voice in how these platforms operate. Strong competition policy matched with strong oversight is as important to every entrepreneur looking to innovate and build THE next great company as it is to every household, every worker, and every&nbsp;voter.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a> enters Beta, we’re seeing more and more experimentation in the community, and we’re excited to see the network and <a href="http://idx.xyz/">IDX library</a> used in increasingly creative ways. If you’re thinking about your your next project — whether that’s a hackathon entry or a new feature for your stable product — here are 10 ideas to get excited about!</p> Using Ceramic in your product <p>1. Manage user identities, information, accounts and data</p><p>The identity index data structure makes it easy to manage identities and user data without any servers or silos — one of the primary use cases Ceramic was created to support. IDX also lets you turn blockchain keys into authentication for a robust identity, with the ability to manage off-chain data, profile info, settings, and more. Partners like Textile for data storage, Fleek for hosting, Magic for authentication and more can be used with IDX.</p><p>2. Index or catalogue content on IPFS and elsewhere</p><p>Use Ceramic as a flexible index for content being stored on IPFS — or anywhere else. Putting this on Ceramic allows easy discovery, as well as definitions and links that make routing to and consuming the content easier over time.</p><p>3. Publish and manage metadata to make data discoverable, linkable</p><p>Publish metadata like schema and tags for privately stored data, making it discoverable and interoperable while preserving privacy and flexibility. This lets you use any data storage option you can imagine — whether centralized or decentralized — while still building on a linked and open web.</p><p>4. Anchor IPFS content onto Ethereum</p><p>Ceramic can be used for any use case that requires blockchain anchoring, including creating scalable and auditable records or signed documents. Every Ceramic document and update is signed with a DID, and these updates are batched and anchored on a blockchain. This provides super scalable verifiable records for things like content feeds, comments, annotations, proposals, votes, and more.</p><p>5. Trusted content publishing</p><p>Use Ceramic to publish content with verified authorship in a platform-independent way. Because Ceramic documents have a permanent ID but are mutable, you can update and version content over time without needing to adjust pointers. This makes it perfect for storing and distributing content to a number of sources. You could use Ceramic as a headless, trusted and open CMS.</p><p>6. Data storage backend</p><p>Ceramic documents offer capabilities similar to your favorite NoSQL document store. Improve information security, ship faster, and eliminate the need to configure and run database servers for storing user and application data.</p> Project Ideas <p>You can use Ceramic and IDX with most applications. Here are a few ambitious ones we know the community would love to see.</p><p>7. DeFi-Wide Trollbox</p><p>One of the most amazing things about DeFi is the ability to move across interfaces and access the same money legos and pools. But right now, it’s just assets and on-chain information that’s shared. We think the social element should be too. Imagine a chatbox anchored to a given pool or smart contract that users across platforms could all be chatting in!</p><p>You could build this today, using IDX for identity (so users still authenticate with the same Ethereum key) and pairing it with p2p chat like Textile, OrbitDB, or others.</p><p>8. DeFi Account Tracker</p><p>Lost track of all your historical accounts (and where you might have airdrops from Uniswap and others)? Use IDX’s crypto-links to create a self-sovereign, portable and privacy-preserving mapping of your various accounts to a single identity. This could be read across DeFi platforms and interfaces too, reducing the need to recreate your watch list on each one.</p><p>9. Profile Plugin</p><p>Create a simple component that gets rid of hex addresses and replaces them with profiles, read from IDX. Help create a web3 experience that is familiar and human. This could be a plugin developers use to replace hex addresses in their interface, or browser extension for users to overlay profile information where it exists.</p><p>10. Ceramic Explorer</p><p>Create a visual explorer for Ceramic documents, making it easy for content to be discovered and shared by applications across web3. This would make it easy for developers to see what documents exist, what standards are emerging, and how to build their data model on Ceramic.</p><p>Bonus: User Notification Service</p><p>Web3 Apps today don’t have a reliable way to get ahold of their users. This means they either have to let the experience end when the app is closed or they end up storing email addresses and preferences in a server. IDX provides a new option. User notification settings can be stored in a Ceramic document, as can contact info like an email address — encrypted and access controlled. A notification service built on this could enable apps to get in touch with users based only on their Ethereum address, without storing user contact info.</p> Our bounties <p>We’re at lots of hackathons in the next month, including EthOnline.

<p>By Franklyn Odhiambo and Thea Anderson, Responsible Technology, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Earlier this year, the Nigerian government launched a <a href="https://techeconomy.ng/2020/06/fg-inaugurates-steering-committee-for-nigeria-digital-identity-project/">Steering Committee for the National Identity</a> in June, and published the <a href="https://www.nimc.gov.ng/docs/adverts/Advert_for_review_of_Draft_Data_Protection_Bill_2020_for_print.pdf">Data Protection Bill 2020</a> for public comment in August. As a social change venture with a presence across Africa, we as Omidyar Network actively use our voice and partnerships with civil society organizations to reinforce good technology design and policy practices that yield Good ID — equity, inclusion, privacy, security, and transparency.</p><p>To better understand the implications of these developments in Nigeria, we recently spoke with Adeboye (“Boye”) Adegoke, Paradigm Initiative’s senior program manager. Paradigm Initiative is an African social enterprise, focused on increasing transparency and accountability between governments, civil society organizations, grassroots organizers, and the general public, on issues related to digital rights and inclusion. Omidyar Network <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/bringing-data-privacy-and-protections-to-nigerias-id-program-and-digital-economy-why-we-invested-439ad5ba5eef">partnered with Paradigm Initiative</a> in early 2020 to support their advocacy and education efforts with Nigeria’s policymakers and the Nigerian Identity Management Commission, aiming toward securing greater safeguards and transparency in the National Identification Numbers&nbsp;program.</p><p>The commission operates the federal government’s national identity database, and assigns and issues the unique identification numbers that will soon be required for citizens and legal residents ages 16 and&nbsp;older.</p><p>Below Boye discusses these recent announcements and his organization’s vision for increasing digital ID and data protection safeguards, as well as transparency in government decision-making.</p><p>What are your top recommendations to Nigerian policymakers today on the draft Data Protection Bill&nbsp;2020?</p><p>Adegoke: One, the proposed Data Protection Commission must be fully funded, staffed, and operational before there is any further registration, or issuing of [National Identification Numbers] or any other digital ID programs.</p><p>Two, the commission must be truly independent. The overwhelming number of government actors currently proposed for the commission’s advisory board will seriously impact true independence.</p><p>Three, independent members — from civil society, media, and academia — must be included on the advisory board to balance government and private sector representatives equally.</p><p>Four, data protection must never be used as a disguise to deny journalists access to critical information in the interest of the public, especially within journalistic rights.</p><p>Five, vague terms such as “national interest”, “national security”, and “public morality” — which have been used in the past to derogate from citizens’ rights — must be clearly defined in the bill, and not be left open-ended and amenable to different interpretations.</p><blockquote>“Given the work that we do, part of our advocacy objectives is to ensure that the development of digital policy receives quality inputs from us. Our focus is clear in this regard; rights, inclusion, and innovation. We will advocate against draft legislation/policy that seeks to limit rights, stifle innovation or widen access gaps and we will support those who seek to promote access, rights, and innovation.”</blockquote><p>How did Paradigm Initiative come to advocate on digital identity&nbsp;issues?</p><p>Adegoke: Our entry point builds on our existing commitment to digital rights and digital inclusion, alongside our belief in the right to privacy and equity for all Nigerians. When the federal government relaunched and wanted to fast-track the National Identification Number registration process, we were alarmed and had to act. Before a new ID program is even considered, we believe there must be many strong safeguards in place, including a data protection framework. Government-issued ID programs in Nigeria have never been inclusive, starting at the point of registration. They’ve amplified gaps between the “haves” and the “have-nots” that corrupt officials can exploit, especially for Nigerians that are not socially or politically connected, and stateless populations. <br> <br>What issues do feel poorly-managed government-issued IDs create for citizens and residents? <br> <br> Adegoke: There are potential risks depending on how the ID system is instituted. We are mindful of the kind of problems that an [digital] ID for residents can help solve. We are also aware that these can create new problems and amplify old ones. A digital ID may complicate already problematic and non-transparent surveillance activities of repressive regimes. On the other hand, [digital IDs] can ensure state resources are efficiently distributed, and problems, such as eliminating “ghost workers” in government services, can be resolved.<br> <br>What are practical challenges you see with the current National Identification Number process in&nbsp;Nigeria?</p><p>Adegoke: One, poor engagement by the government with the public. The government often assumes they know what is best for people, but have had no engagement with civil society voices or public forums. Two, digital ID vendors and contractors wield a huge influence in the Nigerian [National Identification Number] process, while human rights organizations and civil society voices have been largely ignored. Three, infrastructure challenges, including unstable electricity access and limited internet connectivity. Implementing a transparent and inclusive digital ID program requires not just an internet connection, but a reliable one. In October 2019, for example, it was announced that a [National Identification Number] would be required to write university matriculation Exams. The government was forced to quickly walk back that decision when the [National Identity Management Commission] could not cope with the surge of admission seekers due to the lack of operational [National Identification Number] registration centers. And four, corrupt practices by some [National Identification Number] registration officers. Registering for a [National Identification Number] goes to its highest bidders, weakening the accountability and trust in the government.</p><p>How does Paradigm Initiative engage with Nigerian policymakers to raise these concerns?</p><p>Adegoke: First, we have been at the forefront of the campaign for Nigeria to enact the <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2019/12/03/digital-rights-freedoms-bill/">Digital Rights and Freedom Bill</a> in Parliament since 2016. Second, we engage and educate policymakers on the need for parliament to pass the Nigerian Data Protection Bill (originally introduced in 2011) into law. While the new draft Data Protection Bill 2020 is critical, it only addresses a fraction of our concerns. Third, in 2019 a federal High Court in Abuja recommended the [National Identity Management Commission] put safety measures and a sufficient regulatory framework in place. We led a group of actors to demand that [commission] suspend [National Identification Number] implementation until the government enacts a comprehensive data protection law, and resolves the data security lapses and privacy concerns we identified.</p><p>We [also] facilitate engagement between [the commission] and civil society groups, grassroots advocates, and social media activists. In February, we hosted top officials in two engagement sessions with stakeholders from the Niger Delta region and Uyo. Also, in August, we hosted a virtual conversation between the Director General of [the commission], and civil society, where we received feedback on the [National Identification Number] concerns of our citizens and civil society. This month, we facilitated a virtual <a href="https://paradigmhq.org/pin-host-webinar-on-draft-bill-on-data-protection-launched-report-on-digital-rights-in-nigeria/">public consultation session</a> for feedback and recommendations on the draft Data Protection Bill&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Paradigm Initiative recently released <a href="https://paradigmhq.org/download/digital-rights-and-privacy-in-nigeria/">the Digital Rights and Privacy in Nigeria report</a>, and co-hosted the <a href="https://cipesa.org/fifafrica/">Forum on Internet Freedom in Africa (FIFAfrica</a>) to amplify the voices—and solutions—of African civil society organizations working on digital rights issues. Additionally, just last week, Paradigm Initiative <a href="https://twitter.com/Id4africaE/status/1309010053836480512">represented Nigerian civil society</a> in an ID4Africa panel on Nigeria’s identity ecosystem. The conversation resulted in a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202008/verify-my-life-could-a-nigerian-problem-lead-to-a-global-trust-solution">Biometric Update article</a> on the lack of both accountability mechanisms, and transparency on the ID program, as well as the fees collected when the Nigerian government hires third-party private actors to enroll people in the&nbsp;program.</p>

Sometimes people refer to groups like DIF “working on open-source standards,” but speaking precise, no such thing&nbsp;exists!</p><p>Only software code can be open-source, since after all, “source” is short for “source code” (pre-compiled software). Standards, whether open or not, are not code — instead, they are functional definitions and specifications that define and specify protocols that one application (or code base) uses to talk to another (or code base). Each standard can be understood as a benchmark for testing specific implementations, dividing existing and future codebases into those fully, partly, or non-compliant with its requirements.</p>“Lean Startup workshop” in Amsterdam, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@epicantus">Daria Nepriakhina</a><p>Code, whether open-source or not, can implement or “build to” a pre-existing standard, which can be developed in a variously open or closed manner; there is no inherent link or dependency between the openness or rigor of the two processes. Similarly, a standard can be “written around” one or more existing implementations, in such a way that the existing code is definitively compliant with the resulting standard tailored to it. This latter operation is an important function in open-source communities, in that it invites future developers to make new code that will be interchangeable or interoperable with that precedent. Even if that pre-existing code is closed, the resulting standard can be of great use to open-source development, particularly if the process used to write it was also “open” and participated in by the designers and implementers of that closed-source precedent.</p><p>In this series of three brief explanatory posts, we’ll first explain open-source development as a process rather than defining it by its results. In the next post, we will explain the characteristics and optionalities of an “open process” for developing standards. Supporting these open standards is where the bulk of DIF’s efforts and resources are focused. Lastly, we will turn to how open source and open standards work together to create new business models and strategies with real-world consequences for cooperation, “coöpetition,” and healthy&nbsp;markets.</p> Source Code and Intellectual Property&nbsp;Law <p>At their lowest level, computers are just machines that exercise millions of structured computations every second. They take inputs, perform computation, and produce&nbsp;outputs.</p>(public domain)<p>These computations can be combined into complex structures of data and decision-making called “programs” that interface with humans to make useful and meaningful outputs. At the lowest level, these computations still look like oceans of 1s and 0s to the untrained eye, but decades of refinement of operating systems, programming languages, scripting languages, and other abstractions make it easy for engineers to deal only with “source code” as a kind of human-readable abstraction at higher levels. This is “compiled” into more efficient, machine-readable “binaries” (ones and zeros) that can be deployed to standardized hardware in the real world where it is “run” (live software is often referred to as “runtime”).</p>by <a href="https://scs.senecac.on.ca/~chris.szalwinski">Chris Szalwinski</a> from <a href="https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~btp100/pages/content/compi.html">The C Program</a> is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/ca/">Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Canada&nbsp;License</a>.<p>Because it is human-readable and because licenses apply to compiled binaries and functional software in specific jurisdictions, the software industry has largely applied practices analogous to academic “peer review” for sharing and critiquing core pieces of source code. This complicates the open/closed distinction further, since a closed-source project and a licensed binary might still offer key components up for review through github or other channels traditionally used for open development. Furthermore, the many gradients between complete “open” or “closed” software depends on the ownership and licensing of a given piece of software, which can evolve over time or differ in its enforceability across jurisdictions. Like all legal matters, mileage may vary and always consult a licensed&nbsp;expert!</p> A thumbnail history of licensing <p>There is a range of different licensing regimes for source code. Among open-source licenses, different functions can be enabled or facilitated independently of one another: external review, attribution, innovation, maintenance, and even revenue-sharing and other conditions on business practices.</p><p>Proprietary code bases are released under closed-source licenses, which are optimized for secrecy, exclusivity, and/or sale of the results through licensing-based revenue models. For decades, this was how Microsoft licensed not only its proprietary stand-alone software, but even the bulk of the Windows operating system. The licensing landscape is much more diverse today, but before the 1990s very little commercial software was developed in the open or had its source code published after the&nbsp;fact.</p><p>The culture of academia is one of sharing and publishing intellectual work for peers to see and review — open peer-review is as central in academic computer science as it is in the hard sciences. The internet was originally imagined, architected, prototyped, and built by academics, and tinkerers, primarily supported by military and government funding. These three cultures (the military, academia, and independent “hacker”/tinkerer types) formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet_Galaxy">basis of internet culture</a>. A fourth culture was added later when the general public’s access to the internet evolved into a massive commercial industry in the early&nbsp;1990s.</p><p>For our purposes here, we can limit ourselves to the fairly direct link, sometimes biographical, between the anomalous, non-commercial origins of the internet and the development of the open-source movement within the software industry. One “origin myth” that exemplifies this link is the story of a young Richard Stallman, then working in an early Artificial Intelligence lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who wanted to customize some printer software for an expensive new printer shared across all the floors of a busy research building. To do so, he needed to get the source code from the manufacturer, which he had done to customize the previous “workhorse” printer in the same building.</p><p>The manufacturer of the new model, however, surprised Stallman by refusing to hand over the code on grounds of licensing and intellectual property rights. Stallman, to whom the motto “software wants to be free” is often misattributed, often <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823">credits the incident</a> for his deeply-held belief that the end-users of software have a right to modify and participate in the software they use, whether they paid directly for it or benefited from the procurements of governments. To this day, the details and boundaries of this right are still being debated, not only in open-source requirements for government procurements, but also in “right to repair” laws that extend these rights into the domain of hardware and the physical (and 3D-printed) world.</p> Varying degrees of “Software Freedom” <p>Stallman went on to found the Free Software Foundation and play a pivotal role in the elaboration of an open-source (and “free open source”) movement. He also created the first GNU Public Licence (GPL), still a major and influential family of licenses. All versions of the GPL have within them some version of these 4 essential “freedoms”:</p><blockquote>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (“freedom 0”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (“freedom 1”). Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (“freedom 2”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (“freedom 3”). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><p>Honoring these four freedoms textually and fully can make it very hard to sell software commercially for many reasons, salient among them that freely-available source code in a major language is trivial to compile into functioning binaries; commercial or “closed” software is generally sold as compiled binaries, keeping the source code&nbsp;secret.</p><p>Furthermore, many early open-source licenses like GPL explicitly forbid so-called “enclosure” of the code, i.e., incorporating pieces or subsets of the licensed code into a new, close-source product. Anti-enclosure licensing is often referred to as “copyleft” (because it prohibits future copyrighting!) or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license">viral</a> licensing,” since it cannot be mixed and matched with other licensing without overriding more restrictive licensing. This severely limits commercial potential of “forks” or derived variants. The entire Linux family of operating systems are licensed this way, which keeps Linux development squarely in the camp of maximally-open development throughout.</p><p>Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, the open-source movement grew and at some point the software industry could not afford to ignore it, even if directly participating with licenses like GPL was not feasible for most companies of any size. This period saw the first “compromise-licenses” and hybrid open/closed business-models evolve around them. Many of the licenses still popular today date to these early experiments. For instance, the license originally created for the University of California, Berkeley’s fork of Unix, and still known today as the Berkeley Software Development (BSD) license, is one such “commercially lenient” open-source licenses. These licenses allow developers to take code that was originally open, make significant changes to modified versions of it, and license or even sell those under more classically commercial licenses.</p><p>Similarly, more lenient variants of the Apache and MIT licenses date to this period as well. It is worth noting that Apache web servers were one of the first open-source pieces of software that replaced a dominant commercial product. Apache web server software reaching a dominant position in the previously closed-license, commercial niche was a watershed moment for open-source software.</p><p>Apache is often held up, alongside Linux, as an example of where open-source software optimizes for standardization and safety of mission-critical infrastructure, largely due to the thorough and ongoing auditing and maintenance enabled by its core components being completely open to review, testing, and improvement proposals. Conversely, however, some historians of software development point out that allowing enclosure to the degree that Apache licenses do can lead to simultaneous or “parallel” development of various (partially closed-source) forks to evolve in tandem according to various divergent business agendas. Over time, this can splinter development, wicking off talent, attention, and manpower into closed development and creating a major coordination problem for the open-source “parent” of the family tree. In the most severe cases, this can greatly diminish and forfeit the standardization and security gains that made sharing an open-source parent so desirable in the first&nbsp;place.</p> Today and&nbsp;Tomorrow <p>Today, cloud-based business models and Software-as-a-Service have revived and expanded the toolkit for closed-source development, and in turn breathed new life into the debate about how hybrid models could make open-source infrastructure sustainable by revenue shares from closed-source products that depend on it. Similarly, the so called “cloud loophole” in older GPL licenses, whereby software could be run but not “distributed,” was closed by the newer <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">Affero GPL</a> that applies to cloud environments.</p><p>Another interesting frontier in the evolving licensing landscape is being opened up in recent years by distributing computing and distributed ledgers. One key assumption of traditional licensing is that software runs on a finite set of distinct pieces of hardware, with ownership and liability that follow straightforwardly from there. Distributed computing, however, where computation work is spread out over a more diffuse and indeterminate numbers of computers, which might have limited or no insight into the “big picture” of the software they are running, muddy the waters even further than traditional cloud environment. On the radically open side of the spectrum, the distributed-computing ecosystem project HoloChain has innovated the <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/understanding-the-cryptographic-autonomy-license-172ac920966d">Cryptographic Autonomy Licence </a>to empower users (and the software running in their name) by protecting them with encryption.</p><p>New forms of “confidential computing” and encrypted, self-sovereign networking take this even further, making the boundaries of software and runtime environments similarly porous. Attempts at licensing for these new topographies have been <a href="https://sdtimes.com/os/osi-co-founder-leaves-initiative-over-new-license/">controversial</a> at times, but they are also an important precedent and context for work happening in the DIF, such as that of the Secure Data Storage <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working&nbsp;group</a>.</p><p>There are even more radical experiments and movements happening in the open-licensing problem space, which would restrict usage not [only] according to commercial terms or enclosure, but according to non-monetary and non-licensing rubrics as well. For instance, the “ICE breaker” <a href="https://icebreaker.dev">project </a>has brought more attention to the movement to license software according to so-called “<a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/licenses/">ethical licenses</a>.” These restrict derivative use anywhere it can be proven to support of human rights violations, such as in military applications or for “predictive policing” and other use-cases that run afoul of international authorities on human rights and discrimination. The provisions or triggers for such licensing might be as hard to enforce as international human rights law (i.e., very hard), but it sends a signal that specifications and standards from other disciplines such as human rights law and ethical philosophy might someday find their place among the commercial and attribution clauses in open-source licenses.</p> Further reading <p>All code developed under the DIF umbrella is strictly open source, and while DIF accepts donations of previously-closed source code, it is expected that all ongoing iterations of them will take place in the open. The original vision for DIF as a project within the <a href="https://www.jointdevelopment.org/about1.html">Joint Development Foundation</a> was to host code development, and it has since expanded to include co-developed pre-standards specifications and other educational and non-technical <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/education/home">materials</a> as well. Take a spin through our github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/">repositories</a> if you’d like to see an overview of historical and ongoing projects.</p><p>In this quick overview, we have only scratched the surface, though, and we encourage anyone working in the open software space to educate themselves further. The Open Source Initiative <a href="https://opensource.org/trademark-guidelines#Usage_That_Does_Not_Require_Permission">holds the trademark </a>on the phrase “open source” and maintains a very helpful list of licenses that it has decided are fully conformant with its principles. The <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/category">list of approved licenses</a> that they maintain is a great place to start if you are researching the licensing landscape, and they also hold <a href="https://opensource.org/events">events</a> and offer a substantial offering of <a href="https://opensource.org/osi-open-source-education">educational materials</a>.</p><p>In our next installment, we’ll turn to Open Standards and the work of the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76">Drilling down: Open Source</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Kacie Harold, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Earlier this year, we released the <a href="http://www.ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer Pack</a> — a toolkit designed to help tech workers spark dialogue about the future impacts of their designs, identify early warning signs, and brainstorm positive solutions. This week, we are sharing some additional, practical advice from leading experts on how to mitigate against several of the tech risk zones (or potential downsides) and ensure technology is safe, fair, and compassionate.</p><p>Chris Hughes is the co-founder and co-chair of the Economic Security Project, a group that is working to restructure the economy so that it works for everyone. Prior to this, he co-founded Facebook in 2004, and later worked as a publisher at New Republic for several years. Chris has worked exclusively on economic issues since 2016, focusing on anti-monopoly and antitrust issues, and calling for a guaranteed income and tax&nbsp;policy.</p><p>What motivates you on the issues related to ethics and responsibility within technology?</p><p>I think any systems builder, whether it’s in technology, finance, or the arts needs to think about how their work impacts other people and the world. This is an obligation that we all have as humans first, whether we end up as business people or anything else. Tech in particular has a very important responsibility since so many of the companies that are out there, pioneering and charting new paths for products and services. And each one of those comes with a different set of ethical questions that tech companies need to develop a practice of asking and answering on a regular&nbsp;basis.</p><p>I tend to be an optimist and think that folks in tech now are thinking much more comprehensively and ethically. That said, I don’t think that we should overcomplicate thinking about ethics. Just as parents teach their kids at the playground to think about how their play affects other kids, we do the same thing in schools. We have to do the same thing in business and technology as well. And I don’t think that creating the habit of thinking about how our work impacts others is a particularly tall ask. Part of being human is thinking about how we live in community with other people, what other people provide us and what we’re providing them. If there’s any moment in the past several decades that illustrates that more than ever it’s COVID-19. We can see that we all rely on each other to stay healthy and create the kind of communities that we, have appreciated and want to return&nbsp;to.</p><p>I think that the long arc of history teaches us that we’re all relying on each other and the decisions that we make as individuals affect the greater community. This is true in business. It’s true in politics and in organizing, too.</p><p>How do monopolies hurt entrepreneurs?</p><p>For small business entrepreneurs, the most worrying things about monopolies is their ability to move into a market and effectively shut that market down by either price gouging, copying features or tools, or, hostile acquisitions of companies in that marketplace. From a talent perspective, it is often difficult to compete against monopolies because of their ability to attract and retain&nbsp;talent.</p><p>Increases in market concentration lead to decreases in entrepreneurship and innovation. It becomes harder to enter these markets, and this slows down the pace of innovation. Even before the recession, small business startups were at a near historic low, and one of the chief causes of that is monopoly&nbsp;power.</p><p>My sense is that we’ve lost a vocabulary and a framework to talk about outsized corporate power in the United States over the past 30 or 40 years. Most folks in tech are wary of these conversations, but they are also concerned about the big of the consolidation of power. And so we’re at a transitional moment where folks in tech, like a lot of people elsewhere in the country and even in the world are rethinking what the role of public policy should be to create markets that are fair and create good outcomes for everyone.</p><p>I think another issue is that people have begun to see the large tech monopolies as inevitable and unchangeable. And so they may not think as much about how those monopolies impact their lives or impede their&nbsp;work.</p><p>That’s what the leaders of the large tech companies want you to believe. So if that’s what you’re thinking, they’ve got you right where they want you. The more that they can convince folks that there is no other way, and that this is the best of all possible worlds, then they’ve&nbsp;won.</p><p>I think there are a lot of entrepreneurs out there who are thinking creatively and are skeptical about the role that those large companies are playing. The challenge is less about not buying into what the tech companies are saying — that monopolies are inevitable– and more about believing that government can be a positive force for good in the world. Specifically, that the Federal Trade Commission and the US Department of Justice can create markets that are more dynamic and fair. We live in a time where cynicism about the government runs deep. I think for entrepreneurs, that cynicism is bigger barrier than the tech companies’ talking&nbsp;points.</p><p>If you don’t mind shifting for a moment, I’d like to ask you about something you wrote in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html">op-ed</a> for The New York Times in 2019 about your experience working at Facebook.</p><p>“I’m disappointed in myself and the early Facebook team for not thinking more about how the News Feed algorithm could change our culture, influence elections and empower nationalist leaders.”</p><p>Given your experience of being in the room as decisions like this get made, is there any advice you would give tech developers and teams to identify the key moments where they need to stop and think about what they are creating?</p><p>I can only speak for myself. In the early days of Facebook, it was very hard for me to imagine what a success at scale might look like. These were products that were for college kids in the United States that were largely meant to be fun, about creating connection. We knew that it was more than just fun, but the backdrop was that it was a lighthearted, recreational project that we hoped would bring people closer together. That would have been the way we would have spoken about it at the time. And so for me it was very hard to imagine what this thing would look like when over a billion people were using it, for who knows how many hours a day, and anyone can have access. That difficulty was real, and it isn’t an excuse because we knew that Facebook was a very sticky, very popular product, very early on. And that’s why I wrote what I wrote. Because we should have thought much more seriously about what it could turn into, even at the&nbsp;outset.</p><p>I’m not sure if it would have changed in some of those initial decisions that I made at the time, but it would have created a framework of accountability that we could refer back to as a team and individually. And I think it’s only in the past year or two that Facebook has really come to even understand its responsibility, if it really has. My advice to (tech) teams is, even if you’re working small, think big, and think about what problems could be introduced at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>I think when you are in a company that is growing and doing really well, it’s natural to be excited and want to move quickly, but that speed can make it difficult to predict ways that things could go wrong. Do you have any advice for how tech makers can recognize those pivotal moments where they should slow down and consider the impact of what they are creating?</p><p>You’re always in the moment, and you don’t have to worry about figuring out if you’re in the moment or not. My advice is that you should always be asking that question. Often it will feel theoretical, but it isn’t. I guess that’s my point with the playground analogy at the beginning. Thinking about how your actions impact other people is a basic part of living in a community with other&nbsp;people.</p><p>I realize that interviewing somebody (formerly) from Facebook may be a little counterproductive because people could say, well, my company is not going to become a Facebook, so I don’t need worry about this. But I think everybody should be thinking about it much of the time, whether you’re in the CEO suite or, the most junior customer service&nbsp;agent.</p><p>You can find more of Chris’ thinking on twitter <a href="http://chrishughes/">@chrishughes.</a> The <a href="https://www.economicsecurityproject.org/">Economic Security Project</a> is a grantee of Omidyar&nbsp;Network.</p>

<p>By Kacie Harold, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Earlier this year, we released the <a href="http://www.ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer Pack</a> — a toolkit designed to help tech workers spark dialogue about the future impacts of their designs, identify early warning signs, and brainstorm positive solutions. This week, we are sharing some additional, practical advice from leading experts on how to mitigate against several of the tech risk zones (or potential downsides) and ensure technology is safe, fair, and compassionate.</p><p>Caroline Sinders is a designer and artist focusing on the intersections of artificial intelligence, abuse, and politics in digital conversational spaces. She has worked with the United Nations, Amnesty International, IBM Watson, the Wikimedia Foundation and recently published a <a href="https://medium.com/@OmidyarNetwork/how-to-design-for-delight-and-connection-during-the-pandemic-c54eb2131169">piece</a> with the support of Omidyar Network and Mozilla Foundation. Sinders has held fellowships with the Harvard Kennedy School, Google’s PAIR (People and Artificial Intelligence Research group), and the Mozilla Foundation. Her work has been featured in the Tate Exchange in Tate Modern, the Victoria and Albert Museum, MoMA PS1, LABoral, Wired, Slate, Quartz, the Channels Festival and others. Caroline also has a passion for addressing harassment online, which represents one of the harmful behaviors within the Bad Actors Tech Risk&nbsp;Zone.</p><p>Caroline, can you tell us about how design plays an important role in creating safe and inclusive environments online?</p><p>I’ve been studying online harassment for nearly the past seven years. I look at it from the perspective of how technology products and social networks are designed, and how that design can mitigate or amplify harassment. I focus on how the design of a space allows for harassment to occur, including both the actions that a harasser could engage in and the affordances that a victim has, to mitigate the harassment that they are receiving.</p><p>How can tech companies benefit from protecting their users from harassment?</p><p>I always like to remind people that bad business costs money. Additionally, when people face harassment, they tend to engage in self-censorship. The chilling effect of harassment is that people post less content and they engage less often. I believe that becomes a human rights issue when, for safety reasons, some people can not engage freely in a platform, but others can. Being able to participate safely in a space is crucial for engaging in free speech. Ultimately, a company will lose money if people stop using or all together leave their platform; one way to get users to stay is to protect&nbsp;them.</p><p>In the last few years, you’ve worked with Band Camp, Facebook, and Wikipedia on anti-harassment policies and tools to support victims. Are there any common challenges that you’ve seen tech teams struggle with as they address harassment on their platforms?</p><p>Platforms, across the board, struggle to identify growing forms of harm. Harassers are always changing their methods and finding some new and interesting way to hurt other people. It’s important to regularly talk to a variety of people from underrepresented groups, who are using your product or technology in order to understand how forms are harassment are evolving.</p><p>When you listen to users, you need to be aware their relationship to the tool. Often in open source communities or volunteer led projects, you see a lot of users who feel very committed to a project because they have contributed to it and they are deeply invested in the community. For instance, at Wikimedia, I saw victims who were more willing to forgive or try to empathize or work through the harassment they had faced out of concern that asking the Wikimedia Foundation or community leadership to make changes might rupture the community or hurt the encyclopedia. In these cases, you need to find other marginalized members who have experienced toxicity, and have a conversation with them and make sure you aren’t perpetuating toxicity in order to protect a&nbsp;project.</p><p>Another challenge is that some forms of harassment look innocuous at first. For example, imagine you receive the same message from 10 different people over the course of a year, and although you block the users, the messages keep coming. When you file a report, there’s no way to show the messages are related, and the platform has no way to investigate it. In another scenario where you receive a comment from someone that says, “I love your green top with the polka dots,” you might be scared, wondering why or how that person has seen your shirt. But the content moderator isn’t going to see that, all they see is a comment on the victim’s appearance. Even with harassment policy and procedures in place, reporting flows may prevent victims from sharing context or evidence necessary for a content moderator to verify&nbsp;it.</p><p>How can tech companies be proactive about preventing harm on their platforms?</p><p>Unfortunately, when big tech thinks of preventative care in terms of harassment, they think of technology solutions to it. This can be really problematic because those technology solutions end up being things like AI and AI filters, which aren’t very accurate.</p><p>Preventing harassment would entail much more user friendly privacy settings. The challenge is, most people aren’t necessarily thinking of their safety until it has been compromised. One way to increase safety for users is to make data privacy settings really legible, and easy to find and use. This could also look like sending users a push notification suggesting changes to their privacy settings, keeping location sharing off by default, or even notifying users of ways that harassment can occur on that platform.</p><p>In addition to giving people tools to protect themselves, victims may also need proof that they have reported abuse in case things get worse. So right now, if you file a harassment report on Facebook or Twitter they send you an email, but it would help victims to be able to find all of those reports in one place and in a downloadable format in case they need those reports to build a legal case at some&nbsp;point.</p><p>What advice do you have for tech makers, builders, or companies that are just starting to think about or discuss harassment?</p><p>Hire Black women and other marginalized people who use your tool. If you are a privileged person, you may not quite understand that someone could experience harassment in a place that you feel is very safe. I think of Zoom which, really could not have anticipated this moment or the popularity of their tool. The CEO said that they had never thought of harassment because Zoom was created as a workplace tool. But we know that harassment happens at&nbsp;work.</p><p>When you design a technology, always ask yourself what could possibly go wrong and really map out things, even if they feel absurd to you. Don’t just design for like this middle area of how you hope people will use your technology, design for the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Finally, remember that every data point about harassment is a real person’s traumatic story. So even if you have what seems like really low numbers of harassment, it’s always important to remember that these are people experiencing trauma, not&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>You can find more of Caroline’s work on her <a href="https://carolinesinders.com/projects/">website</a>, and can follow her journey on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/carolinesinders">@CarolineSinders</a>.</p>

 Zeenab Aneez &amp; Neha&nbsp;Mujumdar  Session <p>It was media theorist Marshall McLuhan who popularised the phrase ‘the medium is the message’; to him, different kinds of media engage the senses in different ways, affecting how we process it and engage with its contents. Before situating research in the digital space, it is important to ask ourselves: what is the nature of the medium are we dealing with here? How do people interact with it? What are the opportunities it provides and the risks it poses? How can we study new digital objects, such as online-first news outlets, podcasts, etc in a way that recognises the medium’s&nbsp;newness?</p><p>The proposed session is an exploration of a methodology that is informed and defined by specific characteristics of the medium, with a special focus on digital news and journalism in India. Through this, it seeks to tackle the first of the four key focus areas of the conference: How do we conceptualise, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India?</p><p>Keeping this key question in mind, we ask: how can digital methods research contribute to the study of news and journalism in the digital space? How can we use digital objects such as tags, Likes, and Comments to understand how user feedback works in the new information economy? What can the interface of a news creation platform tell us about the changing roles of Indian journalists in today’s media environment? How can we formulate a methodology for studying the metamorphosis of a news story by using Twitter and what skills are required to gather and process information for research of this&nbsp;nature?</p><p>In order to inform our responses to such questions, we borrow from Richard Rogers’ adage ‘Follow the medium’ (Rogers 2013), which argues that “natively digital”(Ibid. 19) objects like tags, links, Likes or Comments, which originate in digital networks, cannot be fully understood with methods, such as, say content analysis; an example of a non-digital method that does not recognise its digital nature. The proposed session will make use of the general philosophy embodied by Rogers’ approach and urge participants to acknowledge the specific properties of the Internet as a medium and look at news and journalism as part of the larger media ecology of the web. This calls for the use of new methods that are digital in nature; the discussion on contemporary news should expand from how the news industry is coping with the digital transition, to how we can better understand the specific elements of this transition and use this understanding to reflect upon the changing nature of journalism and news&nbsp;itself.</p><p>In order to channel the discussion, the session proposes using the framework from one particular field of digital research: platform studies. With the advent of Web 2.0 and the emergence of the ‘web as platform’ (O’Reilly 2007) and the strengthening relationship between the news industry and social media platforms(‘Reuters Institute Digital News Report’ 2015), traditional as well as digital-born news sites are increasingly adopting a platform model. Therefore, platform studies makes for a fitting framework within which to understand the workings of these platforms, their technological and formal structures, and the specific ways in which they allow users to interact with news&nbsp;content.</p> Plan <p>The session will begin with a brief introduction to digital methods (Rogers 2013) and the field of ‘platform studies’ (Bogost and Montfort 2009; Gillespie 2010; Dijck 2013), which will serve as a loose framework through which to study existing news platforms as well as perform analyses on social media platforms as sites for news and journalism. This will be supplemented by the works of Anne Helmond (2015) and Tarleton Gillespie (2010).</p><p>Following this, participants will be divided into groups of four-six, with each group anchored by a volunteer, with added support from the two co-leaders. They will then be given the task of formulating a research question that makes use of one or more of the digital methods presented and are also required to frame a methodology that makes allowances for the particularities of the Indian news environment. The session will conclude with a brief discussion based on their findings.</p><p>The goal of the workshop will be to explore how digital methods can be aligned with current concerns about news and journalism in India, and open up avenues for research that acknowledges that online news occupies a space that includes natively digital objects and information architectures and hence demands research methods specific to this environment. The workshop also aims at reflecting on potential collaborations between researchers in media studies, data scientists and technologists in developing a comprehensive methodology using which to study digital media in&nbsp;India.</p> Readings <p>Gillespie, Tarleton. “The Politics of ‘Platforms’.” New Media &amp; Society 12, no. 3 (2010):&nbsp;347–364.</p><p>Rogers, Richard. “The End of the Virtual: Digital Methods,” Digital Methods.

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of ModoHR?</p>



<p>ModoHR is a Canadian technology-driven business that provides modern solutions for the human resources industry. Our web application, <a href="https://www.screeningcanada.ca/product">ScreeningCanada™</a> was developed with the goal to empower Canadian organizations to remotely conduct background screening and digital identity verification. We help set the standard for Canadian privacy, compliance and data security; these unwavering principles provide Canadian organizations with compliant products and services that mitigate risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



 <a href="https://modohr.com/"></a> 



<p>Simply put, digital identity is the foundation of background screening. Without a candidate’s consent and identity verification, compliant and thorough background screening cannot take place. In addition, the emerging markets like on-demand delivery services and ride-sharing have further highlighted the need for speed in the background screening industry. We strongly believe that a trusted digital identity solution is critical in removing these obstacles and improving remote hiring.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does ModoHR address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identity will transform the Canadian and global economy by removing geographical barriers for individual job applicants. ModoHR is pioneering new identity verification solutions in the marketplace with tools that utilize credit file-based verification, live video verification and facial accreditation. Existing background screening processes have traditionally required face-to-face interaction with the hiring manager, or an in-person verification conducted by an authorized third party like Canada Post. ModoHR’s digital identity solutions remove barriers that previously existed for remote hiring. The process is compliant with federal and provincial physical distancing recommendations and approved by police services. This transformation will empower Canadians and organizations to increase diversity and inclusion by removing traditional remote hiring barriers.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>There is no question that Canada possesses the necessary knowledge and capabilities to be a leader in digital identity. Our national approach to privacy and compliance and the value we place on protecting personal information across all industries, is highly regarded around the world. In the coming months and years, Canadian provinces will need to work together to centralize, standardize and unilaterally protect personal information, and develop methods to securely utilize this information to verify identity.</p>



<p>Our competitors in this space are already operating on the global stage; Canada must move quickly to share resources, seek federal support and ensure that our sovereign interests will not be negatively influenced by the standards set by other nations. More importantly, we need to lead this charge to develop processes and platforms that are truly Canadian.</p>



<p>5. Why did ModoHR join the DIACC?</p>



<p>ModoHR Technologies joined DIACC to share our knowledge and experience relating to the important topic of digital identity, compliance, risk mitigation and global regulatory challenges.&nbsp; We believe that together, Canadian organizations can not only improve processes for Canadians but remain at the cutting edge of policy development globally. We look forward to networking and sharing knowledge with other DIACC members.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about ModoHR?</p>



<p>ModoHR is owned by background screening and risk mitigation industry experts. Our executive team founded the pre-employment industry in Canada 20 years ago and built the largest risk mitigation firm in Canada. These subject matter experts came together to collaborate, re-imagine and empower Human Resources with technology that ensures privacy, security and streamlines processes for organizations and individuals alike. Our drive and enthusiasm is reflected in every new risk mitigation product or service that we create. In summary – we build what’s next™.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We sat down with CYNAM Director, Madeline Howard, to find out what makes this ‘woman in identity’ tick….</p>
Madeline Howard
 What do you do and what gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m delighted to wear a few different hats! My day job is the Socio-Technical Engagement Manager at Cygenta, where I work on the human side of cyber security. I particularly focus on awareness, behaviour and cultural change. I love my field of work as I constantly feel as though I’m making a positive difference to help people and organisations to live more secure lives.</p>
<p>Cygenta also supports me as an <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/industry-100-introduction">i100 for the National Cyber Security Center</a> and their CyberFirst Schools programme. I dedicate one day a week to this – and I absolutely LOVE this part of my job.</p>
<p>Here, I get to work with amazing international, national and local companies to inspire, excite and enthuse the next generation about computer science and cyber security. It’s so rewarding to make a difference to the futures of young people while also supporting the industry talent pipeline.</p>
<p>Finally in my spare time, I’m a Director of Cyber Cheltenham, CyNam. It is a real privilege to be a Director of the UK’s largest cyber cluster and support the development of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>So what gets me out of bed in the morning? Well I’m passionate about making a positive difference. Whether that is in improving organisations and individuals cyber security awareness, exciting the next generation about their future opportunities or developing the incredible cyber security ecosystem we have, I always want to make a positive impact.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>It was not exactly a ‘traditional’ route! I studied Geography at Newcastle University and really didn’t know what I wanted to do. Well that’s a lie, I knew my dream job was to be a weather girl… still true! When I finished university, I started in a role within cyber security working in business development. In months I knew I’d found my niche! I loved the pace at which this sector moves and it’s great to be constantly learning about how we engage with technology.</p>
<p>I was keen to pursue a career, raising awareness about cyber security. At Cygenta, I am extremely lucky enough to work for – and be mentored by – Dr Jessica Barker. One thing I recognise is that I’ve always been really lucky to have lots of fantastic people to turn to for advice and guidance and support when I’ve had to make tough decisions during my career.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The biggest lesson I’ve learned is to go with your gut, ALWAYS.</p>
<p>I’ve had lots of great opportunities but I nearly turned down some of these simply because I over-thought things. Sometimes things can feel like a risk but if it feels right in your gut it normally is . And, if it doesn’t work out, you’ll still have learned so much simply by learning to take a risk – it’ll all help to shape the future you.</p>
 What’s your advice to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>STOP: Thinking that your employees are your ‘human firewall’ against cyber attacks and incidents. The human firewall suggests your employees should prevent attacks and incidents. When it comes to cyber attacks, you can’t prevent every incident, and so this is a totally unrealistic ask on individuals. It also doesn’t prepare people for what to do when something does go wrong.</p>
<p>START: Developing individuals as ‘Human Sensors’. The concept of human sensors suggests that individuals know how to detect and respond to incidents. They understand the indicators of compromise and feel empowered to approach the correct individuals or platforms to report incidents. This ultimately minimises the fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) they may have when they think an incident has occurred.</p>
<p>CONTINUE: Investing in cyber security – not just the technology but talent development and people skills. Ensure your employees feel confident and empowered to positively engage with cyber security to improve your response and resilience capabilities.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>In all aspects of life, diversity is the enabler for growth, innovation, collaboration and positive change.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p><a href="https://thegogiver.com/"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://thegogiver.com/">“The Go-Giver”</a>.</p>
<p>It really resonated with me. In short, it suggests we shouldn’t do things because we expect something in return but because we just want to help. It is a fantastic ethos to live by – it’ll empower you to become the best version of yourself!</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Care less about what people think of you.</p>
<p>It’s not ‘uncool’ to want to achieve.</p>
<p>Go with your gut and everything will work out.</p>
<p>And, finally, accept that you can’t be in control of everything.</p>
<p>I tell myself everyday ‘I wonder if the stars will align?’. If something works out, the stars have aligned. I don’t know anything about the stars but sometimes when things work out, it’s nice to visualise the stars aligning and shining for you.</p>

<p>A cross-community effort to standardize on common, DID-anchored capabilities</p><p>If you are reading this, you probably know already what Decentralized Identifiers (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DID</a>) are: they are “identifiers” or addresses which can be queried to return some information about the subject represented. The addresses take the form of a long, opaque “string” (a long block of letters and numbers, in this case of a fixed length), and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID “documents”</a> that get returned when they are queried contain some cryptographic key material and, depending on the particularities of the returning system, maybe a few other pieces of information or addresses.</p><p>Identity systems have traditionally been largely hierarchical, focusing on asymmetrical or vertical relationships. The most open system that allows horizontal communications between users in different systems is email, and even there, user-to-user communications are mediated by servers, which banlist each other based on a federated reputation system. DIDCommunications (DIDComm), on the other hand, is a set of tools to allow horizontal (or at least, power-neutral) and bidirectional channels of communication between two entities that know each other’s DIDs and nothing else. It resembles today’s end-to-end encryption systems like Signal, Telegram, and Whatsapp more than it resembles traditional email.</p> How DIDComm&nbsp;works <p>DIDComm is a cross-community standard that creates libraries and design patterns for two or more DID-controlling entities from diverse DID-based systems to communicate directly with one another. It creates a secure communication channel between software controlled by each of these entities, which can be people, organizations or things. This constitutes an “authenticated channel,” in that control of a given DID’s private keys is, barring a failure of design or operational security, proof of authenticity of the party represented by that&nbsp;DID.</p><p>This architecture is powerful because it provides a way to do mutual authentication between any two parties. Right now many systems of messaging and communication on the open web don’t provide for mutual authentication with cryptography; they ask individuals to authenticate to sites or businesses (nowadays mostly with single-sign on integrations, i.e. “log in with your XXX account” buttons), and these businesses vouch for and secure the end-user. In exchange, businesses get valuable insight into the communications or commercial activity they facilitate — insights they often sell to third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Furthermore, while the onus is on individuals to authenticate themselves to these enabling institutions and middlemen, the business themselves do little to authenticate themselves reciprocally. Over time, the “lock icon” next to URLs in modern browsers has come to be a useful norm (and users have been habituated to reacting suspiciously to any website which cannot provide on). However, phishing attacks, where intercepted or falsified communications lead users to malicious websites impersonating ones they trust, continue to be a major attack vector for fraud and identity theft. By supporting mutual authentication, a more uniform and democratic protocol is established for secure communications, which raises the bar for user expectations for security assurances from institutions and websites.</p> A Quick History of DIDComm and the Aries Protocols <p>DIDComm was first developed within an international and collaborative open source co-development project called <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a> (hosted at <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger</a>) and under a IPR regime <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs#about">designed to cover</a> software but not specifications. Aries was spun out of the earlier Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> project, to both iterate, expand, and make more blockchain-agnostic the codebase and tooling created earlier for the identity blockchain Indy. In the same process, Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Ursa</a> was also created to advance the underlying cryptographic elements independently of the blockchain and the identity systems relying on it. The Indy project continues evolving as well, from a single blockchain to a family of <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=36734079">interoperable</a> ones.</p><p>The name “DIDComm” and version 1 of its libraries and designs evolved in this context: it adapted the Indy-specific horizontal communications libraries to a more agnostic Aries context and iterated them to be more configurable for new contexts and implementations. At some point, however, it became clear that further interoperability would be best served not by writing specifications based on existing Aries implementations, but by a more “green-field”, specification-first design process with interlocutors from further afield. This work came to be co-sponsored by DIF and Hyperledger partly to engage these outside interlocutors, and partly because the IPR protections of DIF were more appropriate to a specification-first open-standards process. The charter of the DIDComm working group at DIF&nbsp;.</p>Source: CHAPI101/DIDComm101 <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI)_and_DIDComm">joint session</a> at&nbsp;#<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW30</a> The Future of&nbsp;DIDComm <p>Since the chartering process began in September of 2019 at the post-IIW DIF Face to Face, the work of designing a new core for DIDComm and thinking through new features and structure has proceeded at a steady clip. The implementations and details are still being hammered out in some places, but the feature set is stable. The benefits of the new protocol will&nbsp;include:</p>  Mutual authentication  Robust, email-like threading support for relying messaging systems (including error-handling and other machine-readable messaging systems)  Support for new security and transport primitives like the <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">JWM&nbsp;envelope</a>  Asynchronous by default, but with synchronous communication modes also supported  Offline support so that two agents who are not online can exchange information via bluetooth or QR&nbsp;Code  Easy to support with a web server (among many other topographies)  Many of the positive qualities of the earlier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/soap12/">SOAP</a> protocol, include message format standards, routing, transport agnostic support, and subprotocols.  <p>This effort has the direct support and participation of many core members of the Aries community. It is within the plans of the Aries community to migrate to DIDComm V2 as it becomes ready for use and tested. In both existing DIDComms (many of which are already in production), protocols relying on a DIDComm-encrypted channel for authentication or communications functions will be moved over. The relationship between DIDComm and these relying “subprotocols” is quite similar to the relationship between HTTP and the APIs created on top of HTTP — an upgrade to the underlying security or feature set will not affect the relying applications that just need a secure&nbsp;channel.</p><p>There is <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/111">some consternation</a> about the use of the term “DIDComm Protocols” to describe the various different types of exchange or transactions that could be built on a DIDComm foundation. Regardless of whether one chooses to call them “protocols” or something else, a cross-community standard will be crucial to co-developing broadly interoperable capabilities and common libraries on the basis of secure, authenticated DIDComm channels. Some examples of what these would&nbsp;include:</p>  Secure user messaging or even chat-like instant messaging  Issuing a credential  Presenting a credential or an identity&nbsp;proof  Interactions with IOT systems or even directly with specific, authenticated devices  Payment coordination   Getting involved <p>A good place to jump in would be this video recorded by DIDComm WG Chair Sam Curren at the June DIF Face-to-face meeting:</p><p>With this background, a read through the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_DIDcomm_WG_Charter_v1.pdf">charter</a>, the mailing list <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/didcomm-wg/topics">archives</a>, the github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/DIDComm-js">repository</a>, or the Slack channel of the DIDComm <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">working group</a> at DIF will make a lot more sense; as will DIDComm sessions at the new IIW and F2F meetings.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/understanding-didcomm-14da547ca36b">Understanding DIDComm</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Whether, why, and how to attend the biannual conference along with&nbsp;DIF</p><p>The <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com">Internet Identity Workshop</a> is an interactive “un-conference” that has convened various kinds of researchers, identity technology companies, and thinkers since 2005. It brings together a wide swath of people working towards great control of the digital representations of themselves, incorporating theoretical, market-building, research, and policy-oriented projects. This coming month, the 31st edition will be held entirely only on the Qiqochat platform, like the 30th edition before&nbsp;it.</p> The Storied History of&nbsp;IIW <p>Kaliya Young, Doc Searls and Phil Windley founded the conference in 2005. At the time, all three were active in a group known as “the Identity Gang”. They had been discussing identity technology concepts in detail on a mailing list since meeting each other at Digital Identity World in the fall of 2004; after a year of passionate discussions, there came a point where an in-person meeting felt necessary. The first meeting was in Berkeley, California, and ever since it has been hosted at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. It has moved online-only since the Covid-19 pandemic began in early&nbsp;2020.</p><p>In 2005, many in the community were blogging and writing about identity and related themes. Some had made broad and widely acclaimed pronouncements like Kim Cameron, most known in this regard for his essay, <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">The Seven Laws of Identity.</a> One early collaboration within the community was a <a href="http://wiki.idcommons.net/Lexicon">Lexicon</a> that has aged well. Many were also writing code and founding projects to realize their various visions. At the first IIW, eight different projects gave structured presentations on the first day, while the second day was devoted to a more open-ended and collaborative synthesis, facilitated by Kaliya Young using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space Technology</a>.</p><p>At that first event, several of the projects focused on using URLs as identifiers for individuals, who could authenticate against these as they moved around the early Web 2.0, commenting on different sites. Conversations at the event were formative on the OpenID protocols and the OpenID Foundation. Since then, many different protocols have been conceived and/or nested at the conference, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, <a href="http://www.simplecloud.info/">SCIM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_card">Information Cards</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Resource_Identifier">XRI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDI">XDI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebFinger">Web Finger</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_(protocol)">Salmon</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSub">PubSubHubbub</a>, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>The event attracts people from all over the world and continues to be the “biggest tent” for collaboration and ideation across the various user-centric identity spheres and communities, particularly for what is now called “decentralized identity” or “self-sovereign identity”. You can see the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">book of proceedings</a> from most of the IIWs for the last 15 years, refined and edited in the month after each organic and <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/engagement-guidelines/">self-organizing</a> event.</p> The Decentralized Identity Foundation at&nbsp;IIW <p>IIW has always been a neutral venue where diverse groups across the community focused on the decentralized identity, that often work in parallel between IIWs, come together to report out and understand each other’s projects. Furthermore, many attendees come from established sectors of the software industry, such as Enterprise Identity and Access Management (EIAM), Cybersecurity, or Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). This creates a healthy mix of specialists, professionals, activists, and novices, balancing the “bikeshedding” of technology specifics with societal conversations and industry-wide trends and roadmaps. The open culture of DIF and its commitment to integrations with today’s identity technologies thrive in this environment, and many key DIF collaborations have begun or successfully recruited new participants at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>Anyone who attends from any of the myriad organizations in the space can put agenda/discussion topics forward, which also makes it a very generative place for researchers, innovators, and market-watchers. Many of the DIF working groups present their latest work at the event for technical or business review, and it is a key venue for soliciting insightful feedback from related organizations and industry stakeholders. Sometimes projects in early stages of development, specification, or scoping even do requirements gathering or technical sanity-checks at the&nbsp;event.</p><p>Historically, the DIF has hosted a one-day face-to-face meeting immediately before or after the IIW conference proper to take advantage of the geographic co-location of so many key players. This time around, however, DIF is experimenting with a more spaced-out approach to allow for a period of processing of the IIW sessions to allow for a more complementary role 5 or 6 weeks after the fact. Stay tuned for more details about design or development sprints to take place bookended by the two&nbsp;events.</p> Hot Topics across #IIW30 and&nbsp;#IIW31 <p>At the last IIW, DIF working groups put forward these sessions:</p>  The internal governance group shared its new <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Code_of_Conduct_-_at_DIF">Code of Conduct </a>and the <a href="https://identity.foundation/open-groups/glossary.html">Glossary Group</a> also gave a presentation on its <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/finding-the-bell-curve-of-meaning-61a1d22b7bdd">methodology</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Glossary_Results_-_Credentials,_Wallets,_Agents_Defined._%2B_Next_Steps">results</a>  There were four different sessions presenting and gathering feedback on four different aspects <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/%22KERI_(A)_Key_Event_Receipt_Infrastructure._A_ledger_agnostic_framework_for_decentralized_identity._KERI_unifies_many_DID_methods_types.">of</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_-Part_B_Key_Event_Reciept_Infrastructure.A_ledger_agnostic_framework_for_decentralized_identity._KERI_unifies_many_DID_methods_types.">the</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_(C)_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">KERI&nbsp;</a><a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_Implementation:_Whats_Next_DID:UNI_Method._Ref_Imp._DIF_Project.">project</a>.  Similarly, there were multiple presentations on the BBS+ signature suite at the heart of both the Aries <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/BBS%2B_JSON-LD_ZKPs_and_Aries_%26_Indy._Your_Thoughts%3F">AnonCreds2</a> system for verifiable presentations and a novel <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD_using_BBS%2B_-_Round_2">JSON-LD-based system</a>, development of which continues to be lead by Mattr&nbsp;Global.  The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm</a> WG gave a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/DIDComm_WG_Progress_Update">progress report</a>, which was particularly important to many stakeholders in the Aries community not involved in the autonomous research &amp; development project. A separate session was held on the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/JSON_Web_Messaging_(JWM):_What_are_they_and_why_are_they_useful_for_secure_messaging_sytems%3F">JSON Web Messaging (JWM)</a> proposal that the DIDComm WG submitted to the&nbsp;IETF.  Similarly, there was a well-attended joint progress report on the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Sidetree_Protocol_/_Element_DID_and_Friends">SideTree Protocol / Element DID and Friends</a>&nbsp;, as well as an update from the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/TxAuth_and_XYZ_(and_Maybe_someday_OAuth_3)">XYZ project</a> to iterate the OAuth protocol.  A breakthrough <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI)_and_DIDComm">panel</a> (which was recorded — see previous link) explored the potential interaction or combination of the complementary browser-based CHAPI communications/transport protocol and the more browser-independent work of the DIDComm&nbsp;WG  Frameworks and ecosystem maps were presented by the new Trust-over-IP foundation, the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Understanding_MyData_Operators_-_white_paper_published_today">Operators</a> <a href="https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/Understanding-Mydata-Operators-pages.pdf">project</a> of MyData Global; certification programs were announced and outlined by the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Intro_to_the_Me2B_Alliance_Testing_Specification">Me2B Alliance</a> and the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ID2020_Certification:_feedback_and_next_steps">ID2020</a>&nbsp;project.  For a more detailed overview of highlights, see Juan Caballero’s <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/lessons-from-the-internet-identity-workshop-2020-89a4915c4658">detailed recap</a> for the <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">company blog</a> of DIF member organization, Spherity&nbsp;GmbH  For the complete, edited notes from all sessions, see the <a href="https://github.com/windley/IIW_homepage/raw/gh-pages/assets/proceedings/IIW_30_Book_of_Proceedings.pdf">Proceedings Book</a> (sponsored by DIF member organization, Jolocom&nbsp;GmbH)   Heading into the 31st IIW, we can expect significant interest and attendance at sessions on these&nbsp;topics:   A progress report on the alignment of the browser-native Presentation Exchange DIF specification and the relevant Aries RFCs and libraries  Moving KERI from prototype to actual implementations (and integrations!), as well as Drummond Reed’s less-technical introduction entitled “KERI for Mere&nbsp;Mortals”  Cross-method interoperability and portability, within and beyond Indy networks (which are proliferating quickly in&nbsp;Europe!)  Test Suites and a process to incentivize (or even fund?) revisions of major specifications to include more explicit test&nbsp;vectors  Lessons from the mid-2020 DID-Core sprint and PING W3C Security&nbsp;Review  Updates on OIDC-DID bridging work, OAuth &amp; GNAP, and fast-moving regulatory changes in Europe and North&nbsp;America   Making your IIW&nbsp;plan <p>DIF has had great success presenting work at IIW — and increasingly, it is becoming an important aspect of our educational and outreach efforts to post recordings of these presentations on our youtube <a href="https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCicZIzvOXOyij0A6jlA7nxQ?c=UCicZIzvOXOyij0A6jlA7nxQ">channel</a>. We’re hoping this tradition will build more momentum at the upcoming&nbsp;IIW!</p><p>The event is a great opportunity for those who are already very active in the community working on standards and code related to decentralized identity. It is also a great opportunity for those who are very new to get up to speed quickly via what language professors call “deep immersion.” It is very welcoming and friendly, and since each session includes experts from different fields, there are few assumptions and much level-setting. DIF leadership attends the event and encourages its membership to actively participate.</p><p>For those already planning to attend, please note that a skeletal structure is already <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/schedule/">posted</a>. The most important sessions to attend are each day’s “agenda creation” sessions; the “demo hour” sessions for live demos of new products and prototypes, and the “closing circle” readouts from each day’s events are close seconds. Cordoning off those timeslots in your calendar weeks in advance is highly recommended, as a way of keeping those timeslots free of conflicts in your home time&nbsp;zone!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-at-iiw31-f8aafe64c985">DIF at #IIW31</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Urs Gasser on two new books — and what’s&nbsp;ahead <p>The precariousness of the early days of the pandemic turned parents into educators and scholars scrambling to make sense of the historic challenges faced by our societies and the institutions governing them.</p><p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ugasser">Urs Gasser</a>, the Executive Director of the Berkman Klein Center (BKC) and Professor of Practice at Harvard Law School, has co-authored two timely books that inform both of those struggles.</p><p>Gasser co-authored <a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/john-palfrey/the-connected-parent/9781541618022/?fbclid=IwAR0ulyZ9NQKm-mqVQdg6WidnjTpS6IqSswaAgAChB2W7OJOV6IVGjV035kU">The Connected Parent</a> with <a href="https://www.macfound.org/about/people/president/">John Palfrey</a>, president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which turns a decade of academic research into practical guidance for parents raising children in a “digitally connected” world. He also wrote an essay series published in German (<a href="https://www.helbing.ch/detail/ISBN-9783719044022/Pandemie-als-Verbundkrise-und-digitales-Ph%C3%A4nomen">Pandemie als Verbundkrise und digitales Phaenomen</a>) that focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic, risk, digitization, and the law. This book is co-authored with <a href="http://drolshammer.net/work-experience/">Jens Drolshammer</a>, professor emeritus at the University of St. Gallen and former BKC faculty associate.</p><p>We spoke with Gasser about the books, threads between them, and what he is working on&nbsp;next.</p> You’re the co-author of two new books to be published within a few weeks’ time. Let’s start with “The Connected Parent”. In a nutshell, what is this book&nbsp;about? <p>“The Connected Parent”, written with my friend and long-time collaborator John Palfrey, offers advice to parents and other caregivers on how to support their children as they grow up in an increasingly digitally connected environment. The book includes very practical advice and suggestions. John and I summarized the best available research, including 15 years of <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">youth and media</a> work at the Berkman Klein Center (BKC), to help parents figure out how to think about issues like screentime, social media usage, privacy and well-being, digital activism and citizenship skills, to name just a few — and what to do about them to minimize risk and embrace opportunities.</p> Your second book focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic, risk, digitization, and the law. Can you tell us more about&nbsp;it? <p>This book is published in German and in the form of an essay collection. It offers initial reflections on COVID-19 as a specific type of risk that Judge Posner a decade ago in a seminal <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/catastrophe-9780195306477?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">book</a> described as a “catastrophic risk” — something most recently also taken up in Tony Ord’s <a href="https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/toby-ord/the-precipice/9780316484893/">new&nbsp;book</a>.</p><p>The texts were written during the “lockdown” and in collaboration with my former teacher and previous BKC associate Jens Drolshammer. Switzerland serves as a country case study to better understand what role the law plays during such a massive crisis. We have heard and learned a lot from public health experts during the crisis. Understandably, the legal system has been less front-and-center. Yet, it turns out that law is almost everywhere and hugely relevant especially during a crisis of this magnitude. Some of the essays also explore the historic role digital technologies play in dealing with COVID-19 — I call it metaphorically the first “digital pandemic.” We talk about the intersectionality of these&nbsp;things.</p> Both of these books are timely to the ongoing pandemic, in different ways. Are there any connecting points between these two&nbsp;books? <p>We submitted “The Connected Parent” manuscript before COVID-19 arrived in the US and were only able to add small references to it as our publisher was initially skeptical about how much of a “big deal” COVID-19 would be. Well, of course, now we know better. Parents and educators are trying to figure out how digital tech can be used to support kids around the world as their education is so deeply disrupted by COVID-19. The book will not give a full answer to the current crisis, but might be still helpful in the present based on the connected parent philosophy we sketch in the book. And we believe it offers sound longer-term guidance that helps parents to engage with their kids — and be connected with the digital world they live in. The book on the pandemic reflects on some of the educational experiences in real-time, albeit from a policy and not necessarily a parental perspective. There are also other connection points between the two books. Both are written with a broader audience in mind, and both are the fruit of collaboration.</p> What motivated you and John Palfrey to write “The Connected Parent”? Isn’t it unusual for scholars to write a parents’&nbsp;guide? <p>Yes, it is! John and I have already written several books together, including our 2008 and 2016 book “<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/node/99526">Born Digital</a>,” and in some ways, the new book is its cousin. Since our last book, we’ve been asked many times for more practical guidance than we were willing to offer in our previous work. And at some point, we decided to take on this challenge and translate what we can learn from research in ways that it translates into recommendations for parents. For me, it’s been a great learning experience to write this book. As academics, we are used to making all sorts of caveats — “can’t say, more research is needed” — where the data is shaky. But as a parent, you have to make decisions, whether you have scientific evidence or not. So we’ve tried to take this seriously and be helpful even where we don’t have all the answers. We did so by being very honest about what we know and what we don’t know — and then still give advice based on what we think makes sense based on our own experiences as researchers, educators, and parents. The <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">Youth and Media</a> team at BKC has been very helpful to keep us honest and grounded.</p> In the introduction to the essay series on the pandemic, risk, digitization, and the law, you and Jens Drolshammer state that the book is an experiment. What do you mean by&nbsp;that? <p>It’s been an experiment in multiple ways. It’s experimental in the sense that it was written during the early moments of the pandemic, with lots of uncertainty and even unknown unknowns. The texts offer real-time observations and reflections, without a rigorous methodology, which of course means that our observations are not scientific and offered more in the spirit of early hypotheses. We looked at it like writing initial observations and questions into a personal journal and making these entries publicly available because it might be of interest to others as well. We did so based on stories, reports, news coverage, etc. we’ve collected from the first day of the pandemic based on a set of 10 criteria.</p><p>So both the format and working style is experimental, at least for me. We hope that these early and only tentative entries into what we termed our “logbook” might invite more rigorous work over the years to come. It’s also an experiment to write and publish such a book across the Atlantic during such an extraordinary time.</p> Will you publish an English translation of the&nbsp;book? <p>I don’t think so. While I enjoy the challenge of writing and publishing in two different languages, I generally don’t feel excited about translating what I’ve written in one language to the other. To me, it’s about more than translating the text: When writing in German or English, I think differently about what I am going to say and how — it’s like flipping a&nbsp;switch.</p><p>That said, a brief summary with some of the key observations, as well as a transatlantic conversation with Professor Martha Minow and John Palfrey that is included in the essay collection, is also <a href="https://medium.com/@ugasser/pandemic-as-a-composite-crisis-and-digital-phenomenon-ba45cb5e3b9b">available on&nbsp;Medium</a>.</p> Do you plan to continue writing books, and if so, what’s&nbsp;next? <p>I try to keep a balance as far as types of contributions are concerned. I’m working on a number of shorter articles right now, but have another book project lined up — this time a book on the turn to information and information law, which brings me back to the roots of my academic&nbsp;life.</p><p>On a personal level, I enjoy working on books because it forces me to learn and engage in different ways than what has become the dominant mode in today’s professional lives. I’m acutely aware that both reading and writing books are an enormous privilege, and I couldn’t be more grateful for&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/urs-gasser-on-two-new-books-and-whats-ahead-de04c663b385">Urs Gasser on two new books — and what’s ahead</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m working for HSBC and have been here since May 2016 doing a variety of roles, but recently (well since Jan 2018), I have been getting my fingers dirty in something very exciting –&nbsp; defining and creating a brand new strategic capability for the Bank called – Events Based Data Assurance – which will underpin our Digital Identity efforts.</p>
<p>Essentially, all Digital Identity is customer data that we trust. We have a lot of customer data in the Bank but we don’t record why we trust this data and so we ask the customer to prove who they are over and over again. i.e. when someone wants to open a new account, we ask them to prove their ID by showing us their passport. Someone in the Bank will look at the passport, match the photo on the passport to the person standing in front of them, and confirm that they match. However, what is recorded is the person’s name, DOB, Nationality BUT not the event of ‘passport check in branch’.</p>
<p>If we recorded ‘why we trust the data’ using a new type of data called ‘EVENTS’ i.e. the event which led to us knowing why we trust a piece of data (in the above example, Suzie, a Branch advisor in our Canary Wharf branch checked that the photo on the passport matched the person in front of them and it matched, it unlocks a huge opportunity inside the bank to ‘RE-USE’ data across markets and functions – resulting in a fantastic customer experience and reduction in costly and often duplicative processes.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I started on the Barclays Bank Graduate Programme and tended to move around every 3 years or so to new places.</p>
<p>I had a curious mind and wanted to do ‘new’ things rather than be in a BAU type role.</p>
<p>I was hungry to learn and develop and so sought opportunities every time I felt like I had learnt all I could from an organisation. I’ve tried my hand at all sorts of things from Banking, to Management Consulting, to starting up a brand new dotcom business, to digitising an insurance company, studying for an MBA, moving to the online travel industry and then back to Digital Banking and now most recently, qualifying as a Personal Performance Coach and setting up a Coaching Business as a side hustle!&nbsp; I absolutely love helping people understand what their potential is and to guide them to go and realise this!</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The most important lesson I have learnt along the way is to be your authentic self, don’t try and be someone who you’re not. I know this is difficult because we all suffer from this, especially us women. We’re always comparing ourselves with the person who is always getting the promotions, the attention, the recognition etc – but by trying to be like her, you slowly start to move away from who you are at your core – your authentic self.</p>
<p>This will only result in a lot of frustration and unhappiness which can become a huge problem.</p>
<p>Remember, you’re an individual with skills, experience and a personality which is unique to you. Embrace this and become comfortable in your own skin and let people see the real you! You’ll be surprised where this can lead!</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
 
 
 
 Writing down your internal business activities in a granular way – so that others can understand why they should trust this piece of data 
 Agree on a common data model which can be used to describe events 
 Define the key trusted providers in your country (utility companies, passport office, mobile phone companies, travel companies) who are willing to start exchanging data/ events with you; get them to write down what they do to assure data in a machine readable way (using the same data model) 
 
 
 Stop:
 
 Trying to solve for the World – start small, and then scale focusing on real life use cases 
 
 
 Continue:
 
 to have dialogue with organisations, governments and customers/ citizens to keep the conversation going so that potential solutions/ way forward are relevant 
 to define key customer/ citizen/ employee pain points and look to solve for these 
 
 
 
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>We are all unique and with this uniqueness, we each bring a different viewpoint to the same problem so be tolerant, embrace this difference and experience the powerful results that follow.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>I’d highly recommend ‘Man’s search for meaning’ by Viktor Frankl because it teaches us/demonstrates the power of the mind and resilience.</p>
<p>I absolutely love the quote in the book: “he who has a WHY to live can bear with almost any HOW……and what alone remains is the last of human freedoms is the ability to choose one’s attitude in a given set of circumstances.”</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Don’t be afraid, speak your mind, be yourself and think positive thoughts. As a kid growing up in the UK, I suffered from both racial discrimination and bullying – which impacted hugely on my self -confidence. I hid in my shell and didn’t feel as valued, important or equal to my peers and therefore didn’t take the opportunities that presented themselves to me because of this.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about what people will think; ask the ‘stupid’ questions and never feel that you’re not good enough!</p>

Photo: Pixabay<p>Should tech companies follow human rights law to govern online speech? This proposal has tremendous appeal. International human rights law can offer a set of rules designed in the public interest with the broad support of a global community. This certainly appears superior to the status quo wherein a handful of CEOs set rules for the speech of billions of social media users. Unsurprisingly, scholars (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3250950">here</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/lawless/8504E4EC8A74E539D701A04D3EE8D8DE">here</a>) and civil society organizations (<a href="https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Regulating-speech-by-contract-WEB-v2.pdf.">here</a> and <a href="https://www.observacom.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Estandares-regulacion-grandes-plataformas-Internet.pdf.">here</a>) have expressed their support and the project has gained a lot of traction since David Kaye — then UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression — <a href="https://www.undocs.org/A/HRC/38/35">promoted</a> it in&nbsp;2018.</p><p>However, adopting international human rights law might not lead to more legitimate content moderation rules. First, international human rights law is not a set of universally accepted rules. The framework favors some speech standards over other reasonable alternatives. The choice for those standards should itself be subject to a legitimate rule-making process. Second, international human rights law is in many areas highly indeterminate. It offers guidance but no precise answers to many challenging questions. In those cases, human rights law might not constrain the power of tech firms but instead only create the appearance of legitimacy. In other words, the proposal could mean business as usual with the added ‘legitimacy-aura’ of human rights&nbsp;law.</p> International Human Rights Law Is Not&nbsp;Neutral <p>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the Covenant) offers the primary international guidance for free expression standards. The Covenant puts a priority on some normative options over others in areas in which reasonable disagreement between legal systems, experts, and communities exists. Two current controversies illustrate this&nbsp;point.</p><p>In July, the <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">Stop Hate for Profit</a> campaign brought together hundreds of companies. For one month, they withheld advertisement from Facebook demanding that the tech giant curb the spread of hate on the platform. Among other demands, the campaign requests the removal of groups focused on Holocaust denial. Although sensible and understandable, the request is in tension with Articles 19 and 20 of the Covenant. The Human Rights Committee, the body that authoritatively interprets this international treaty, <a href="https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/gc34.pdf">has said</a>, “Laws that penalize the expression of opinions about historical facts are incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant imposes.” Indeed, in 2019, Kaye explicitly <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25174&amp;LangID=E">used</a> the bans on Holocaust denial as an example of a law that breaches states’ international obligation to protect freedom of expression.</p><p>In other areas, human rights law sides with the campaign’s demands. Stop Hate for Profit also asks that platforms apply their rules equally to politicians and other users. Twitter and Facebook, however, see things differently. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they decided not to delete President Trump’s posts violating their rules on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274323/trump-twitter-glorifying-violence-minneapolis-shooting-looting-notice-restriction">glorification of violence</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/technology/twitter-trump-tweet-warning.html">election integrity</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/08/05/trump-post-removed-facebook/">COVID misinformation</a>. They reasoned that the public interest of citizens in learning what their representatives think in these cases outweighed the harmful effects of such speech. In other instances, Facebook did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/technology/trump-facebook-coronavirus-video.html">remove</a> a video posted by Trump’s campaign for spreading COVID-19 misleading information, and both firms <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199845/twitter-tweets-brazil-venezuela-presidents-covid-19-coronavirus-jair-bolsonaro-maduro">took down</a> content that Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro had posted in violation of their&nbsp;rules.</p><p>In this contentious debate, international law falls much closer on the side of the Stop Hate for Profit campaign. Kaye’s 2019 report (see para. 47) explains that even though exceptions to protect political speech could in exceptional cases be acceptable, in principle politicians and the public ought to be subject to the same rules. According to the report, harmful speech can even be more dangerous when uttered by political leaders. Therefore, there are even stronger reasons to apply speech rules to these&nbsp;figures.</p><p>The main point is that reasonable disagreement exists about how to balance these different considerations when governing politicians’ speech. And the choices that international law (or the Human Rights Committee) makes in these debates are not obvious and not universally accepted. They should themselves be subject to the control of the people. Rather than shifting decision-making power from tech companies to the UN (although certainly a step forward), it is urgent to focus on building processes that can actually involve the public in the deliberation over speech&nbsp;rules.</p> Lending Legitimacy to Unconstrained Power <p>At the same time, international human rights law leaves many speech questions unanswered. I have written about the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/why-international-human-rights-law-cannot-replace-content-moderation-d3fc8dd4344c">contradictions</a> between regional human rights systems that the UN framework does not solve. A more fundamental open question is how to apply the legitimacy requirement of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to content moderation.</p><p>According to Article 19, all restrictions to freedom of expression must have a legitimate end. Legitimate ends for governmental restrictions on speech are the protection of national security or of public order or of public health or morals. Evelyn Aswad <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3250950">asks</a> the right questions: Which ends would be legitimate for content moderation rules set by private companies? Could tech companies claim a business interest as a legitimate purpose? And even if they were not entitled to rely on the most explicit commercial interests such as advertisers’ preferences, could these companies claim that a specific content moderation rule helps them shape the type of community they want to&nbsp;foster?</p><p>Most supporters of the proposal would acknowledge that it is necessary to let companies disallow content for the purpose of meeting the preferences and expectations of different users. This appears sensible. Otherwise, all the speech that international human rights law protects — including adult nudity, pornography, and many graphic depictions of violence — would likely have to be allowed on platforms such as Facebook. This would render platforms nearly useless to a large set of users that does not want to navigate through all forms of legal, but perhaps undesirable, speech. But the line between permissible and impermissible ends becomes blurry, and the Covenant, designed to be applied to states, definitely does not draw such a&nbsp;line.</p><p>As long as no line exists, international human rights law poses few constraints on what companies can do. For any rule a company might wish to set, it could articulate a public interest end that the rule advances. For instance, for nudity rules, tech firms could claim they are trying to avoid all possible non-consensual distribution of intimate images. For hate speech that does not incite violence, they could posit that they are creating a “safe” environment for communities that are disproportionately the target of such speech. And the list goes on. Susan Benesch has <a href="https://www.yalejreg.com/bulletin/but-facebooks-not-a-country-how-to-interpret-human-rights-law-for-social-media-companies/">proposed</a> helpful guidance to translate the requirements of Article 19 to content moderation. But unless broad consensus can be built around the meaning of terms such as “the protection of moral,” human rights law will lend its legitimate framework and vocabulary without meaningfully constraining private regulatory power.</p> International Human Rights Law as a Framework <p>Adopting human rights law as default content moderation rules can be a project of translation, meaning: take international law standards that already exist and translate them into implementable content moderation rules. For the reasons I discussed earlier, I have little faith in that&nbsp;project.</p><p>However, another proclaimed virtue of international human rights law is that it offers a common framework and vocabulary to guide the discussion between multiple actors on how to come up with a new language, a new rulebook specifically designed for online speech. Indeed, it may still be valuable to rely on the human rights framework not to answer all questions but to agree on what questions need to be asked (does the rule have a legitimate end? is the rule necessary to meet that end? are less intrusive measures available?). Tech companies (or anyone making the rules) can contribute to public reasoning and deliberation by being transparent about the lack of unequivocal answers. They should explain, instead, why they prefer certain rules and how they think about them through the lens of the standards set forth in Article 19 of the Covenant. That type of transparent reasoning could be the start of a dialogue with other actors in a shared language.</p><p>Such an approach resembles what Larry Lessig refers to as “latent ambiguities.” Lessig tried to imagine how judges would react to novel legal questions posed by the development of technology. In some cases, translation of already existing rules would be easy: for example, extending the protection of mail to electronic communications. In other cases, however, there is no unequivocal answer, and there is a need to decide anew how to regulate. For those situations, Lessig imagined that judges could promote democratic deliberation by identifying those “ambiguous” areas, proposing possible paths forward, and explaining how their own decisions would advance constitutional values.</p><p>There is one fundamental difference between Lessig’s work on judicial adjudication and content governance. In the case of judicial decision-making, legislatures could later contest the judges’ decisions. Lawmakers can debate and vote for a different rule. In the governance of online content, although civil society may well play a role in contesting the reasoning and choices tech firms offer, no institution has the authority equivalent to that of a legislature to move the dialogue forward. In that sense, the transparent reasoning of companies can be the beginning of a conversation, but it remains unclear who can “speak”&nbsp;next.</p><p>As Jonathan Zittrain <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3458435">argues</a>, the current era of content moderation requires experimentation with processes and institutions that can reconstruct legitimacy and open opportunities for people’s participation in online governance. Looking at international human rights law, to the extent that it offers a common framework to enable conversations, might be a step in that direction. I have tried to begin exploring which positions that framework gives priority to and to emphasize the need for finding other actors that have the capacity to contest the public reasoning of tech companies. Only then will international law be able to foster an actual conversation rather than a monologue uttered by tech firms in the guise of human rights language.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/international-human-rights-law-is-not-enough-to-fix-content-moderations-legitimacy-crisis-a80e3ed9abbd">International Human Rights Law Is Not Enough to Fix Content Moderation’s Legitimacy Crisis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Anei mātou te hāpori o Digital Identity NZ e mihi ana ki a koutou i tēnei wiki hirahira, ko te wiki o Te Reo Māori. Arohatia te reo, kia kaha te reo Māori! Warmest greetings to you all during te wiki o Te Reo Māori. Toku ingoa ko, my name is Janelle Riki-Waaka, Pouherenga Waka, Relationships Manager and Kaihuawaere, Consultant Core Education and Digital Identity member.<br><br>Ko te kai a te rangatira, he kōrero – the substance of chiefs is to engage in kōrero. We, here at DINZ, have been engaging in lots of kōrero recently about how we can give mana to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and be tiriti-honouring in our intent and actions. We’ve been on a learning journey together and we are in the process of formalising our thinking into a Te Tiriti o Waitangi Action Plan that will guide our DINZ mahi ensuring we are striving for equity in Aotearoa. Our statement of intent is: “Digital Identity New Zealand is committed to being tiriti honouring by giving mana to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and upholding our responsibilities as effective treaty partners with Māori (Tāngata Tiriti).”<br><br>In thinking about how the articles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi relate to digital identity, here are just a few examples of our recent whakaaro: Article 1 – Kāwanatanga (Honourable Governance): DINZ understands our position as tangata tiriti and we affirm Māori as tangata whenua. Article 2 – Rangatiratanga (Māori Self-determination): We will seek to work alongside tangata whenua to support their aspirations and ensure their needs are addressed in the digital identity space. Article 3 – Ōritetanga (Equity): DINZ will work alongside iwi/hapū to ensure their voices are represented in kōrero about digital identity and their aspirations are realised in terms of digital identity solutions and developments. Article 4 – The Spoke Promise: Te Reo Māori will be celebrated in the digital identity ecosystem in Aotearoa and participating organisations will demonstrate and act on an understanding of their role as Tangata Tiriti. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital Identity New Zealand is on a journey and we are firmly in the waka with hoe (paddle) in hand! We understand the need for us to ensure Māori perspectives relating to identity are leading our hearts, minds and actions. Identity is a taonga (precious possession) and as such must be protected. The connection our tamariki (children) have with their language, culture and identity will shape our future in Aotearoa.<br><br>He tina ki runga, he tāmore ki raro. ‘Contentment above, firmly rooted below.’&nbsp; A good connection to your identity, culture and heritage will find contentment in life.</p>



<p>Janelle Riki-Waaka<br>DINZ Executive Council</p>



 



<p>Kia ora, thank you, Janelle. It is wonderful to have such a skilled and passionate kaiārahi (guide) in our DINZ Executive Council whanau, especially during te wiki o Te Reo Maori.&nbsp;<br><br>We’re pleased to announce our first two DINZ Discussion Forum events: A legal analysis of AML Reliance (members only) 7 October – join us as we share a report commissioned by DINZ members on the challenges and opportunities in the sharing and re-use of identity information used for customer due diligence in AML&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/online-event-dinz-report-aml-reliance-and-re-use/">Register here</a>.

 Governments and Businesses to Begin Testing Across Canada 



<p>TORONTO, September 15, 2020 – The<a href="https://diacc.ca/"> Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada</a> (“DIACC”) today announced the launch of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>TM (“PCTF”), a set of digital ID and authentication industry standards that will define how digital ID will roll out across Canada. Its launch marks the shift from the framework’s development into official operation and will begin alpha testing by public and private sector members in Canada. The alpha testing will inform the launch of DIACC’s <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">PCTF Voila Verified Trustmark Assurance Program</a>&nbsp; (“Voila Verified”), set to launch next year.</p>



<p>“The pandemic has pushed digital adoption five years into the future. Without the proper infrastructure for digital ID and authentication in place, we’ve seen firsthand how Canadians have been left vulnerable and with limited access to essential services” said Eros Spodotto, Executive Vice-President, Technology Strategy and Business Transformation at <a href="https://www.telus.com/en/">TELUS</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“Trust and security are the foundations of the digital economy. The key to unlocking a true digital experience comes from having a digital ID ecosystem that extends beyond any one sector.”<br> – Franklin Garrigues, VP Digital Channels at <a href="https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/">TD Bank</a>, and DIACC Board Vice-Chair</p></blockquote>



<p>From open banking to e-health, digital ID is a key enabler in unlocking the next frontier of our digital economy. Banks and telcos fortunately have been able to leverage existing digital ID services to support Canadians. “Digital identity verification has helped countless Canadians receive financial aid during the pandemic,” notes Andre Boysen, Chief Identity Officer at <a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey,</a> “but it’s not enough. Now, we need to leverage that momentum, and push out a solution for digital ID in all levels of society. The PCTF is that answer.”</p>



<p>“The PCTF launch marks an important milestone in Canada’s digital transformation initiatives,” exclaims Dave Nikolejsin, Board Chair at DIACC, “Canadians have had to deal with identity theft and fraud, high anxiety in accessing services that they were in dire need of while facing social distancing measures, and attempting to go about their lives as normally as possible. Digital ID minimizes all of those pain points, and elevates the livelihoods of Canadians everywhere.” Joni Brennan, President of DIACC, adds, “Our economy has also been heavily impacted by all this, and we know digital identity has the potential to add at least 3 percent of GDP, which is <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=33&amp;pr.y=15&amp;sy=2016&amp;ey=2021&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=156&amp;s=NGDP_RPCH%2CNGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPPC%2CPCPIPCH&amp;grp=0&amp;a=">potentially almost $100 billion</a> back into our Canadian economy. This is why we’ve accelerated the launch of the PCTF. The time for digital ID is now.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“The Digital ID Laboratory of Canada is a proud partner of the DIACC, with a strong community that is ready to support the launch of the PCTF and ensure that together, we can accelerate the adoption of user-centric and interoperable digital ID solutions across the country.”<br> – Pierre Roberge, General Manager of the <a href="https://digidlab.ca/">Digital ID Laboratory of Canada</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Alpha testing of the PCTF will be carried out by over 20 Canadian public and private sector <a href="https://diacc.ca/membership/">DIACC member organizations</a> during the next two quarters with the purpose of operationalizing the framework as fast as possible. Organizations that have volunteered to take part in the alpha test seek to gain strategic and operational insights to become demonstrated leaders in digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learnings taken from the alpha testing will help DIACC identify what is needed to scale up a digital identity infrastructure across Canada, and help Canada secure international digital interoperability and accreditation by working with international and third party partners such as <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/trust-services-and-eid">eIDAS</a> and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/what-we-do/">Kantara Initiative IAF</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Digital ID Trademark You Can Trust</p>



<p>The alpha testing will also inform the launch of the DIACC <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">PCTF Voila Verified Trustmark Assurance Program</a> (“Voila Verified”). The program is set to launch in fall 2021, and will issue a PCTF Voila Verified Trustmark to organizations who demonstrate compliance with PCTF components. Voila Verified will enable solutions and service providers to leverage the trustmark to elevate their market leadership and allow them to collaborate securely with assurance, providing their customers with the digital-first experience that they demand.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“We’re pleased to work with the DIACC to help recognize the Voila Verified Program on an international scale. It is through secure global credentials that we can transform the state of digital identity, and progress the digital economy worldwide.” <br>– Colin Wallis, Executive Director of <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/">Kantara Initiative</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Multijurisdictional Collaboration: Enabling Trusted Digital Inclusion for All</p>



<p>The launch of the PCTF comes at a time when having a strong digital economy is no longer a ‘nice-to have’; rather, it is imperative for Canadians. More than 70 per cent of Canadians want to see the government and private sector collaborate on a joint identity framework in Canada. “We’ve seen the benefits and advantages of digital ID for people in British Columbia during this pandemic,”, said CJ Ritchie, Associate Deputy Minister and Government Chief Information Officer for the Province of British Columbia, “From government to healthcare, commerce, and financial services, the entire provincial economy is being impacted by COVID-19. Having a robust digital identity/trust ecosystem allows all Canadians to do more online, in a safer, more secure and confident way.”</p>



<p>The PCTF was developed collaboratively between public and private sector stakeholders, with contributions from a broad array of individuals and organizations around the world. Over 3,400 public comments were provided over four years that helped progress the framework to its launch today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The framework released today was created through an incredible collaboration involving hundreds of people who worked to contribute, comment, and lend their ideas,” noted Peter Watkins, Program Executive for the Pan-Canadian Digital ID at the Institute for Citizen-Centred Service, “we’re committed to continuing our multi-jurisdictional collaboration as we move into the next stages for this important work.”</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CMO&nbsp;</p>



<p>The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Insights_Actions_to_Counter_Email-Based_Attacks_on_Election-Related_S508C.pdf">&nbsp;issued an advisory</a> Thursday recommending cyber attack remedies for election-related activities&nbsp; including the use of FIDO authentication to thwart phishing&nbsp; attempts and account takeover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advisory, entitled “ACTIONS TO COUNTER EMAIL-BASED ATTACKS ON ELECTION RELATED ENTITIES” noted that 78 percent of cyber-espionage incidents are enabled by phishing. CISA makes specific recommendations on protecting against cyber attacks to aid organizations involved in election-related activities.</p>



<p>Among other recommendations, FIDO Authentication was highlighted to thwart phishing attempts and protect against account takeover for cloud email and other high-value services. Specifically, CISA cites <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a> Security Keys as a tool that campaigns and organizations can, and should, use to protect themselves. The advisory also recommends that, when available, campaigns and organizations should enroll users in advanced protection services such as <a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/">Google Advanced Protection</a>, which leverages FIDO Security Keys as a best practice over other 2FA methodologies to protect workforces from account takeovers related to malicious attacks.</p>



<p>FIDO security keys offer protection against phishing attacks by working as a second, physical factor of authentication and only authenticating when a user is on the correct website. Thus, even if a user is tricked into supplying their password to a phishing website, the physical security key will still block attackers from accessing their account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phishing continues to be a problem and remains one of the most popular means by which cybercriminals obtain data. Embracing FIDO technology is smart politics, and smart policy for those who understand the gravity of the cyber threat. As the election draws near, we’re increasingly seeing foreign agents <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/biden-campaign-firm-hit-by-suspected-kremlin-hacking-attack">attempting</a> to infiltrate, influence and disrupt our elections.</p>



<p>As the CISA advisory implies, phishing and other cyber attacks are a critical issue with widespread and damaging implications to U.S. national security. The CISA advisory highlights the importance of locking down email systems, which have become a preferred vector for malicious activity. The CISA recommendations are intended as a preferred method for protecting the 2020 and future political campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In June, NIST put out a call for comments on the next iteration of its Digital Identity Guidelines, SP 800-63-4. We welcomed the opportunity to comment; read our full comments in the <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FIDO-ALLIANCE-Response-to-NIST-800-63-3-call-for-comments.pdf">Government &amp; Public Policy area of the website</a>.</p>



<p>Up front, we note that SP 800-63-3 represented a significant improvement in NIST’s Digital Identity Guidelines, taking a more modern approach to identity proofing, authentication, and federation. That said, technology and threat are both never static, and we are encouraged to see that NIST is embarking on another revision of the document.</p>



<p>In our comments, we make three recommendations for SP 800-63-4:</p>



<p>1. NIST should adjust its approach to AALs to help implementers clearly differentiate between tools that are phishing resistant and those that are not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, a variety of authenticators based on shared secrets – including Look-Up Secrets, Out-of-Band Devices (i.e., Push), and OTP apps and tokens – are given the same weight in AAL2 as authenticators based on asymmetric public key cryptography, such as FIDO. Given how attackers have caught up with the former, it no longer makes sense to combine&nbsp; these two types of authenticators under a single designation. Doing so misleads implementers into thinking these two categories of authenticators are equivalent in strength or resiliency. In our comments, we provide NIST with several ideas for how it can adjust the AALs to provide more differentiation between tools that are phishing resistant and those that are not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. NIST should engage with FIDO Alliance to explore other alternatives to enable FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 requirements</p>



<p>When SP 800-63-3 was first published, it created a path for some FIPS 140 validated FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 – if those authenticators were deployed in concert with Token Binding to deliver Verifier Impersonation Resistance. Since that time, most major browser vendors have withdrawn support for token binding. Per discussions with NIST, we understand that this means that FIDO authenticators can no longer meet AAL3 without implementing other approaches to mitigate the loss of token binding. As NIST embarks on the next revision of SP 800-63, we urge NIST to engage with FIDO Alliance to explore other alternatives to enable FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 requirements.</p>



<p>3. Provide more direct references to FIDO</p>



<p>SP 800-63B describes Requirements by Authenticator Type but is inconsistent in how it points to standards that support that type. This has created some confusion in the marketplace when implementers consult SP 800-63B and see reference to standards like OTP and PKI but do not see any specific reference to FIDO. In our comments, we offer three suggestions for how the guidance can directly reference FIDO so that implementers have a clearer understanding of where FIDO fits in and supports the requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We greatly appreciate NIST’s consideration of our comments and look forward to ongoing dialogue and collaboration as they seek to update the Digital Identity Guidance.</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Celero?</p>



<p>Our vision is to be a leading provider of technology solutions to the financial industry that…</p>



  Others aspire to be  People want to work for  Clients know they can rely upon.  



<p><a href="https://www.celero.ca/about-celero/">Celero</a> is realizing this vision is by delivering a digital technology, integration and payments ecosystem to credit unions and financial institutions across Canada. This is accomplished through an innovative mindset, commitment to delivery, strong external partnerships and an unrelenting focus on reliability and security.</p>



 <a href="https://www.celero.ca/"></a> 



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>As a provider of technology solutions to credit unions, we recognize the growing expectation our clients face from their members who demand convenience, innovation and robust security in every financial experience.</p>



<p>Digital identity is the mechanism to enable our clients to secure their members’ trust as they serve them in an increasingly digital world. Beyond that, digital identity can be an enabling force for Canadians who are unbanked or underbanked. We believe in supporting the financial health of our customers’ customers and recognize that authentication of identity is a means for a more financially inclusive Canada.</p>



<p>Overall, Celero recognizes we have a critical role to play in enabling our clients to build trusted and lasting relationships with their current and future members through a trusted digital identity framework.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does Celero address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>To protect consumers, organizations put safety measures in place that can also cause constraints on convenience. This has been an ongoing challenge for financial institutions, and today’s ‘on-demand’ culture has served to spotlight these issues.</p>



<p>A trusted digital identity framework for Canada will provide a backbone of security in convenient transactions – removing barriers, streamlining service delivery, and strengthening national and global economies.</p>



<p>Celero can help shape the framework with a&nbsp; credit union perspective and can seek out the potential use cases and applications that can benefit our clients and their members and contribute to the DIACC’s goals through our expertise in financial technology and cyber security.</p>



<p>For instance, the Celero Xchange™ digital integration ecosystem platform enables financial institutions to seamlessly connect their secure platforms, such as their core banking system, to fintech applications – without the complexity of managing different standards for sharing data between products and partners.</p>



<p>Authenticating and authorizing a credit union member without compromising the security while maintaining a seamless member user experience is a key component of our platform and value proposition.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>Canada has a growing fintech industry that is constantly seeking new ways to address digital innovation challenges and better serve consumers. The industry is becoming internationally recognized, and that expertise can serve Canada well in shaping a world-class digital identity framework that sets the standard for other countries to follow.</p>



<p>5. Why did Celero Solutions join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Our goal in joining the DIACC is to participate in driving forward solutions for digital identity trust in Canada, while obtaining new insights to apply with our clients in offering their members security, flexibility and convenience in a digital first society.</p>

			<p>By Joshua Gaul, Executive Director, <a href="https://njedge.net/solutions/edgelearn/">EdgeLearn</a></p>
<p>Online learning has been thrust to the forefront of the conversation in higher education, with current circumstances necessitating shifts to remote, hybrid, and other online learning models. As institutions work to make the most of the situation with resources currently at their disposal, it’s worth taking some time to consider a more strategic approach to online learning. All institutions can benefit from developing instructional and operational methods focused specifically on online learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news for colleges and universities who are reenvisioning or launching online learning and having a difficult go of it, is that many already have the building blocks for success in place. At Edge, we consider online learning readiness as part of a continuum of capabilities that lead to success. Below, we’ll explore three broad categories of online learning readiness, and common characteristics shared by institutions in each category.</p>
<p>Category 1: Novice</p>
<p>Institutions in this category most often recognize how online learning could strengthen their courses and programs as well reach more students, but are wholly unprepared to build and launch a course or program successfully. This is typically due to a lack of resources, such as time, staff, and money.&nbsp; Sometimes, “Novice” institutions are doubtful that they have stayed ahead of the curve in instructional design and technology expertise.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Online Learning “Novice” Institutions:</p>
 
 
 
 Minimal or no presence as an online teaching institution 
 No learning management system or an inconsistently used one 
 Lack of institutional dedication to online instruction 
 Limited or no staff dedicated to instructional design and technology 
 Lack of technology systems thinking necessary for scalability for online courses and programs 
 
 
 
<p>Category 2: Intermediate</p>
<p>Institutions in the “Intermediate” category have most of the pieces they need to succeed in the online learning, but more often than not are missing a 1-3 year strategy to standardize processes and systems to reach the next step of maturity. These institutions may also believe that the discrete tools and parts they have in place would land them in or close to the “Expert” category, but don’t realize how essential a unified vision, and course development and evaluation management, is for online learning.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Online Learning “Intermediate” Institutions</p>
 
 
 
 Enterprise LMS and related educational technology tools 
 Scattered staffing across the institution dedicated to instructional design and technology 
 Elements of IT infrastructure which can operate in support of online learning 
 Pockets of support across the institution for generating excellent online teaching and learning&nbsp; 
 Functional systems in place to achieve success, but lacking strategic management across the institution 
 
 
 
<p>Category 3: Expert</p>
<p>“Expert” institutions have it “figured out.” Schools in this category can not only provide online learning smoothly and successfully, but can also transform how they achieve that success quickly. These schools understand and document all the processes involved in online learning, program development, and business processes, while eliminating unnecessary obstacles with strategic planning from the top level and proliferating execution across the institution.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Online Learning “Expert” Institutions</p>
 
 
 
 Robust IT infrastructure and educational technology system support, including LMS, integrated applications, and student services support 
 Transparent, connected processes that tie all pieces of the student lifecycle together in a strategic and logical manner 
 Top level strategic support for online learning initiatives and growth 
 Repeatable processes to enable continuous improvement and manage changes in courses, programs, and platforms facilitating real results in quality, scalability, and marketability of online courses and programs 
 Environment of academic innovation that not only encourages faculty to professionally develop, but recognizes and provides them with an intake process for emerging ideas and technologies 
 
 
 
<p>“Novice” and “Expert” institutions may seem to have a world of difference between them, but with strategic institutional focus and a dedication to online learning maturity, it’s likely the institution will advance its online learning maturity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For schools ready to gain a better understanding of where their online learning capabilities lie, and develop more robust online learning courses and programs, Edge can conduct an <a href="https://njedge.net/solutions/edgepro/online-program-readiness-assessment/">Online Program Readiness Assessment</a>. Assessment findings can be used to identify areas of improvement and build goals for strategic advancement of online learning across the institution.</p>

<p>1. What’s your organization’s mission and vision?</p>



<p>Based in the United States and India, <a href="https://www.vlinder.io/">Vlinder’s</a> vision is to enable an inclusive and sustainable ecosystem, with trust as the underpinning foundation.</p>



<p>Vlinder platforms are built harnessing new-gen technologies including blockchain, IoT and artificial intelligence to foster inclusion and sustainability within the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vlinder platform offerings are focused on helping private and public enterprises working towards the seventeen <a href="http://un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy?</p>



 <a href="https://www.vlinder.io/"></a> 



<p>Globally, there are 1 billion people without proper identification,  which equates to roughly one seventh of the world’s population. This population typically includes low income and vulnerable groups including women and girls, migrants, refugees, individuals with disabilities, and indigenous populations.</p>



<p>Not having access to proper ID restricts these vulnerable populations in obtaining basic essential services such as health, education, and financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ID is a foundational element that is a direct and indirect enabler of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including:</p>



  Access to finance  Gender equality and empowerment  Access to basic health and education  Child protection  Social protection  Labour Markets  



<p>Building an inclusive sustainable ecosystem will not only better the lives of vulnerable populations, but will also help improve the global economy as more people will be contributing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. How does your organization address the needs of this transformation?</p>



<p>Vlinder has built a decentralized ID platform, Klefki, which enables citizens to:</p>



  Own their identity.  Accept credentials from issuers and store them securely in mobile wallets.  Share credentials with verifiers using consent on demand.  Disclose selective details of credentials, as opposed to sensitive data.  



<p>Enables issuers to:</p>



  Issue credentials directly to the users wallet.  View all the credentials issued.  



<p>Enables verifiers to:</p>



  Verify credentials with citizens directly.  



<p>Our platform is being piloted in various countries, and is focused on bringing trust and inclusion to the broader population, while enabling the existing system to be more efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>All countries have a role to play in accelerating progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Canada is a leader in technology and with a progressive mindset is well positioned not only to transform the ID (and peripheral) ecosystem within the country, but to bring change and transformation to the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any transformation led by Canada will be seen by the world and developing economies as a reference model for adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join DIACC and what else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Vlinder joined DIACC to participate and contribute to an important initiative, which is not only transformational for the Canadian population, but to the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>By <a href="https://njedge.net/executive-team#cmarkham">Christopher Markham</a></p>
<p>Delivering online education is difficult and complex, as the conversation among experts in the field has evolved to refer to online learning itself as having traditional and nontraditional modalities. The evolving approach to online learning, in both theory and practice, often collides with the philosophies and personalities of faculty and academic leaders on the ground, and necessitates the development of thoughtful strategy and collaboration within the institution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the course of my career, I’ve been fortunate to lead and collaborate in the planning and launch of fully formed online learning programs at multiple institutions, spanning 6 states in both public and private environments. This hands-on and highly collaborative experience has afforded and informed my perspective on key areas of focus, particularly the necessity for all schools to approach their online learning needs with unabashed honesty to cultural challenges and courage to make decisions promoting necessary organizational change.&nbsp; </p>
<p>1. Strong Leadership is Key<br>
Institutional culture may be dictated at the top, but it is controlled at the bottom. While at Georgia Military College (GMC), we faced intense scrutiny from faculty and academic leadership in the early stages of the online campus startup. They were looking for any cracks in our commitment to the idea of a fully formed online campus. The decision to remain resolute, end to end, was critical to our success and our professional response to the scrutiny. It’s essential for leadership to listen to all stakeholders involved – to address criticism candidly, publicly, and respond with confidence. This approach provided overwhelming success in GMC’s online campus startup administratively, and also helped to develop partners and evangelists among even those who had been skeptical, some of whom became the most ardent champions of the online campus.</p>
<p>2. Trust the Process, Not the Shortcut to Change<br>
A detailed process map following the student lifecycle and a pro forma model for revenue based on headcount (to include expenses), informed by an honest reckoning of how your institution currently does business, are vital to building a successful online campus. When you understand the challenges your institution currently faces, you’ll be able to lay out a process your team can execute to reach your goals.&nbsp; At SUNY Empire State College, our institution served as the incubator for SUNY Online, a consortium of online learning shared among 64 separate institutions of higher education. Through collective effort and agreement to establish a student lifecycle that could accommodate each and all institutional business processes, technologies, and academic programs, we were able to build a fully formed and marketed online campus from the ground up, in the largest comprehensive system in the world at SUNY.</p>
<p>3. Investment vs. Cost Center ⎼ the Value in IT<br>
Technology value-add exists along the entire student lifecycle. Technology, or rather digital literacy and fluency, is best leveraged when each functional administrative office, such as registration, advising, financial aid, enrollment management, and more, adopt the tools provided. Technology strategy should map to, and be informed by, the institutional mission and vision, as opposed to driving it. For these reasons, technology leadership should not only have a seat at the executive table, but also know how to translate tech strategy into the principles of digital literacy and fluency that add value to strategy. In collaborating closely with leadership and functional offices, technology teams can also accelerate buy in and adoption for the online campus by illustrating the added value that technology can bring to bear for students and staff along the student lifecycle.</p>
<p>Turning Insights into Action</p>
<p>If you’re ready to position your institution for successful online education, you may be interested in Edge’s <a href="https://njedge.net/solutions/edgepro/online-program-readiness-assessment/">Online Program Readiness Assessment</a> (OPRA). OPRA is a comprehensive evaluation that equips two-and-four-year institutions with a roadmap for sustainable, institution-owned online learning programs.&nbsp;</p>

There are a growing number of interpretations and implementations of various decentralized standards. These standards are at different stages in their development lifecycles, harmonizing gradually. As a result, there are lots of data, from lots of sources, that, without a little planning, won’t play nicely with other data. It is exciting to see the enthusiasm around the standards we know and love and to watch the proliferation of verifiable and portable data. With implementation boundaries as a hindrance, data interoperability will continue to be difficult. We could lose much utility and portability of the data. Luckily, in the midst of this excitement, a great opportunity presents itself: to forge bridges between data islands and promote the cross-pollination of methodologies for generating and exchanging verifiable data. Enter: the Presentation Exchange specification.</p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">Claims &amp; Credentials working group</a> has been hard at work on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange specification</a> for months. The effort, starting in January 2020, began to provide a solution to the question, “How should we request and exchange credentials across implementations and systems?” Though <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">a few solutions</a> <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0037-present-proof">have been proposed</a> <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">before</a>, none have been as inclusive in the data model and transport agnosticism, or able to attract broad adoption, as Presentation Exchange. The working group is working towards the first release — at the time of writing, we have made over 100 commits and closed 37 GitHub&nbsp;issues.</p><p>The specification prides itself on its adaptability, aiming to be “both credential format and transport envelope agnostic, meaning an implementer can use JWTs, VCs, JWT-VCs, or any other credential format, and convey them via OIDC, DIDComm, CHAPI, or any other transport envelope.” At the same time, Presentation Exchange has garnered the interest and support of many key-players throughout the ecosystem, a step crucial to fulfilling the ambitions of the specification.</p><p>You may be wondering, what’s up with the title? Isn’t interoperability much broader than sharing credentials? Yes! Absolutely. Sharing credentials is only part of interoperability. Universal wallets, secure data storage, transports, identifiers, DIDComm, and so many more pieces are paramount to thriving in an interoperable, decentralized ecosystem. At the heart of many of these interactions, we find ourselves exchanging verifiable data. By driving a standardized method for requesting and returning verifiable data, which adapts to many data models and functional use cases, we cross an important threshold in making interoperability possible. Without working software to back up the specification, it is merely an interesting idea. We need to go further — to make it an interesting reality.</p><p>Recognizing how important the Presentation Exchange spec and reference implementations could be for accelerating real interoperability and healthy competition, we, on the <a href="http://credentials.workday.com">Workday Credentials</a> team, are involved in the specification’s development and are investing significantly in one of its first demonstrable implementations. Workday has been a very active member of DIF since 2019. Our interests lie across the DIF stack, with a focus on standards compliance, affording us opportunities to interoperate with community members and standards adopters alike. Towards that end, we have <a href="https://github.com/workdaycredentials">open-sourced much of our code and specifications</a> relating to decentralized identity. For Presentation Exchange, we have <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange-implementations">recently pushed a Golang representation</a> of the object model that can be useful in building and validating presentation definitions, submissions, and verifiable presentations (as defined by the W3C standards). We are building out more Presentation Exchange logic that we plan to open source in the coming months. We intend to adopt Presentation Exchange at Workday as we gain confidence in the specification and its other implementations. We are considering different ways Presentation Exchange can be useful in interoperating with verifiable data that does not originate on our platform.</p><p>We are looking forward to seeing others contribute reference implementations in other languages and we encourage you to consider contributing to Presentation Exchange and DIF! For more information, please <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">reach out to DIF</a>, or jump in on the <a href="http://decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange:%20Specification%20that%20codifies%20an%20inter-related%20pair%20of%20data%20formats%20for%20defining%20proof%20presentations%20(Presentation%20Definition)%20and%20subsequent%20proof%20submissions%20(Presentation%20Submission)">public GitHub</a>.

 Silpa Mukherjee, Ankita Deb &amp; Rahul&nbsp;Kumar  Session <p>We propose to design the panel as a workshop with three paper presentations followed by an open discussion with the house exploring the key question of media objects‟ (in the form of film/film music/memes/gifs/trolls) changing relations with law; copyright and piracy having attained newer connotations in the age of media convergence. While we deal with the materiality of cinema in the new media moment, the session will open out debates on the mutability of media objects in a networked digital terrain ushered in by fast growing and cost-effective internet culture in urban&nbsp;India.</p><p>In terms of methodology the panel deploys media archaeology to trace the mutations that film culture has undergone in the digital age. The coexistence of the obsolete media copyright with its meme and its digitally re-mastered copy on torrent informs the research that the three papers involve. A certain engagement with the logic of informed/fan-cinephilic digital labour that unwittingly maintains and updates the algorithmic database of Web 2.0 services will run through the presentations. Along with archival research and interviews with professionals involved with online media companies and “users” who are now the “pirate/prosumer-cinephiles” of media objects, we will carry out extensive digital ethnography to map the chimera of digital territory that user traffic based internet culture in India helped&nbsp;produce.</p><p>The digital is a space of intervention: a space for the users to intervene and play with the material online. It is a constant form of participation underscoring a potential for democratic authorship. The definitive notion of authorship voices the overarching body of the state through its legal status. Thus copyright as a legal entity produces a discourse of power through this form of authorship. The contemporary medium or rather the multi-media constellation driven by internet culture in India produces an alternative discourse on authorship, complicating the notion of copyright and piracy at the same time. This charged terrain of (il)legality is also due to the nature of piracy in the digital domain, which does not exist in isolation but have now created bodies or spheres where it has been appropriated as a sub-cultural practice. The figure of the “pirate”/ the “troll”/ the “fan” and the “cinephile” now merges with the technologically enabled body of the user of new media who negotiates with the medium in multiple ways (and morphs it) and thereby touches all kinds of spaces within and outside the webspace. It has changed the physical scope of cinephilia as addressed in the paper “A Laptop and a Pen-drive: Cinephiles of Mukherjee Nagar,” where the culture of networked sharing evolves from and further complicates physical stations. It has permeated into the body of film music in the paper “Licensed, Remixed and Pirated: Item numbers and the web”, which interrogates the layers of user-based morphs that the text of a dance number in Bollywood undergoes in the culture of web based remixing and hacking. It changes the way protected materials like films circulate in the space designated as YouTube, marked by its ability to reproduce copyright materials without violating the law as the third paper titled “Online Streaming in the Era of Digital Cinephilia” points out; the logic of the obsolete license of old Hindi films which gains a new viral life on YouTube with its official upload vying with the multiple hacker-user uploads.</p><p>Thus the panel intends to explore the dizzying overlaps that produce this internet induced distinct zone of ambiguity that neither the law nor the state or the author can claim ownership over. The very embodiment of the material in the digital is in transition i.e. in a state of being morphedby the blurring of the identities of the multiple bodies at work at each moment. Through the three papers we intend to chart this transitional aesthetic sometimes contained and sometimes flowing out of the body of the media text onto the physical, technological and extra textual objects as well. The panel seeks to position this new world of media objects that overlap and form an uncontainable entity, seeking newer forms of negotiations with the older existing order. We seek to explore then what happens to the very essence of author(ity)ship when digital enters its&nbsp;domain.</p> Plan <p>A Laptop and a Pen-drive: Cinephiles of Mukherjee Nagar</p><p>With the changes technology has brought to contemporary life, cinephiles — for whom movies are a way of life, films and how they are experienced have undergone major changes. The classic cinephile, as the term was adopted in the 1960s has undergone a major change in the era of internet piracy. I will look at the way pirated films via torrent downloads are consumed by students in certain pockets in New Delhi especially around Mukherjee Nagar area. These students who come from the upwardly mobile Indian middle class families are engaged inpreparations of competitive exams to land a lucrative government job. Circumstances dictate that these students own a laptop to watch films but not a high speed internet connection. To fuel their cinephilic urge, they are dependent upon soft copy vendors of pirated films. These vendors are like a video library, the repository here being a laptop and a storage drive. These professional film pirates depend upon the p2p file sharing commonly referred as “torrent.” DVD and Blu Rays released by official sources are ripped at a bigger size by certain uploaderswhich are downloaded by another one who rips it to an even smaller size, fit enough to be downloaded by pirates with a slower broadband till it reaches places like Mukherjee Nagar. Using this particular case study, where the world of online film piracy merges with a third world piracy domain, I plan to interrogate the logistics of a new kind of cinephilia and try and frame this particular form of informal circuit of media production and consumption into a coherent perspective.</p><p>Relevant websites: <a href="https://kat.cr/">https://kat.cr</a>, <a href="https://yts.la/">https://yts.la/</a>, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/">https://torrentfreak.com</a>.</p><p>Relevant software: Handbrake, uTorrent / Deluge /&nbsp;Vuze.</p><p>Relevant reading: Treske, Andreas. The Inner Life of Video Spheres: Theory for the YouTube Generation. Institute of Network Cultures, Amsterdam, 2013</p><p>Licensed, Remixed and Pirated: Item Numbers and the&nbsp;Web</p><p>The coming of new digital technologies has rendered the relationship of media objects’ with law extremely malleable and volatile. It urges us to rethink certain categories we have been working with, viz. piracy and copyright. The specific focus of the paper will be on item numbers’ relationship with changing technology and the law. The proprioceptive body being the central node of enquiry here: the law that affects the body that moves on screen and the body that is moved by the screen is made flexible in the digital age with Web 2.0’s unique design that spawns hackability and remixability. Through the registers of music licensing to YouTube, circulation of content offline as MP3 downloads in cheap mass storage devices, user generated morphed content related to item numbers (in the form of memes, GIFs, trolls, posters, tumblr blogs and listicles) spawned by amateur digital culture and remixing videos of film content the paper traces the gray zone between web based music piracy and its copyright rules. It will interrogate the moment when the entertainment industry has recognized the clear shift of its spectatorship from the older media to the more digital platforms and appropriates the contingency brought in by the algorithmic anxiety of Web 2.0 and its unique relationship with law and hence censorship regulations to innovate newer means of mass circulation and bypassing censorship.</p><p>Relevant content: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2O2dBonBok">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2O2dBonBok</a>.</p><p>Relevant user-traffic-oriented platforms: <a href="http://www.memegenerator.com/">http://www.memegenerator.com</a>, <a href="http://www.trolldekho.com/">http://www.trolldekho.com</a>, <a href="https://www.imgur.com/">http://www.imgur.com</a>, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">https://www.tumblr.com/</a>.</p><p>Relevant curated online media platforms: <a href="http://scoopwhoop.com/">ScoopWhoop</a>, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/india">Buzzfeed India</a>, <a href="http://blog.erosnow.com/">blog.erosnow.com</a>.</p><p>Online Streaming in the era of Digital Cinephilia</p><p>Digital piracy has allowed for certain democratization of film distribution and consumption through a parallel economy of piracy. The lack of control over these channels of distribution produces a blatant threat to the copyright and intellectual property rights that are quintessential to the mainstream culture of commercial film distribution. This paper will focus on the intersection of these two dichotomous cultures through the experience of watching old films via online streaming. The resurfacing of old films hosted by big corporations like Shemaroo, Venus and Ultra who began as film rights and video rights owners at one point host their old video content in a user generated space called youtube. The video content is a very specific form here. It is an obsolete entity, defined by its ambiguity with copyright that is able to make a legal transgression in order to circulate.</p><p>The circulation of the feature films in a web space that is primarily known for its clip culture also provides an interesting paradigm for the copyright material. The big corporate copyright floats in a culture of pirated experiences where the legal domain becomes a dizzying site of contradictions. Through this paper I will draw parallels between the history of these companies and their work in the field of film circulation and to the creation of a new form of cinephilia and its complicated relationship to the law. I will use a variety of archival sources, legal documents and discourses on online streaming to contextualize my argument.</p><p>Relevant websites: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ShemarooEnt">https://www.youtube.com/user/ShemarooEnt</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/VenusMovies">https://www.youtube.com/user/VenusMovies</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/UltraMovieParlour">https://www.youtube.com/user/UltraMovieParlour</a></p> Readings <p>None.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day1.DigitalDesires">IRC 2016: Day 1 #Digital Desires : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Silpa Mukherjee is a Delhi based research scholar.

<p>Just before the age of COVID began in earnest, The New York Times ran a feature on “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/education/learning/education-technology.html">How Technology Is Changing the Future of Higher Education</a>.” The rise of remote learning and other pandemic-related changes and challenges have added to the need and opportunity for technology-driven advances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Hyperledger community is doing its part to help the higher education market adapt to an increasingly digital world. Below we look at five Hyperledger-powered solutions that are at work now in the education market. They are helping colleges and universities modernize how they tackle a number of core tasks, including issuing and verifying academic credits, automating on-campus payments and managing students’ identity and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on for more about these #HyperledgerEdu solutions, built using a mix of Hyperledger technologies:</p>



<p>Byacco, an on-campus payment system</p>



<p>Soramitsu has officially released <a href="https://soramitsu.co.jp/byacco">Byacco</a>, a payment system based on Hyperledger Iroha, for the University of Aizu, Japan. Byacco is a system that allows students and staff of the University of Aizu to use an application on their phones to pay for goods in the cafeteria and university store and to transfer funds within the campus. To make a transaction, all they need is to scan or to provide a QR code, depending on the operation. Byacco’s technology also has high standards for transfers: it follows the EMV® QR Code specification and has bank application level financial security protocols. The keys that are used to authorise transactions on the blockchain are stored only on the device, in a secure storage, so that no one except the owner can access the funds. Students of the university can join the development of the system, thus acquiring skills in creating financial systems based on Hyperledger technologies.</p>



<p>DoDream, a “Study Abroad Platform”</p>



<p><a href="http://www.dainleaders.com/view/en.php">Dain Leaders</a> is an education solution provider for universities in Korea. It serves more than 45 Korean universities by providing services for students’ career path development. As part of that effort, Dain Leader is introducing its “Study Abroad Platform,” called DoDream, to support the extended education ecosystem of the universities, accreditation and related agencies, and prospective employers. Based on Oracle Blockchain Platform Cloud Service (which is powered by Hyperledger Fabric), the platform is an O2O service that provides foreign students with information on studying in Korea and a matching service with Korean universities.</p>



<p>Oracle Digital Certificates Solution</p>



<p>In the face of fast-changing demographic and economic drivers and student expectations, the current processes for issuing and verifying student certificates are too inefficient and time consuming. They can also lead to fraudulent or counterfeit certifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Oracle Digital Certificates Solution, built on the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/blockchain">Oracle Blockchain Platform</a> (based on Hyperledger Fabric), provides a complete, end-to-end solution for educational institutions to issue verifiable tamper-proof and secure credential certification that improves the student experience after graduation and improves operational efficiency. The solution enables institutions to issue digital certificates along with transcripts and provide self-sovereign capability to the students who can share them securely with third parties through an access token.</p>



<p>This solution has been successfully deployed in production by customers like China Distance Education Holdings Limited (CDEL) and Taibah Valley University. CDEL uses Oracle Blockchain to share educational records and professional certifications across many educational institutions to help employers and recruiters verify the educational credentials claimed by individuals.<a href="https://www.theblockchaindomain.info/topics/apps-and-use-cases/articles/441270-oracle-adds-functionality-blockcha-platform-drive-development.htm">&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Many other institutions like national universities, employment agencies, government organizations, professional skills academies and universities that provide student grants/scholarships are using this solution as part of ongoing or planned pilots.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data is the new gravity in the world today and organisations are gravitating to and concentrating around trust as the ultimate currency in this data driven world. This trust is crucial for people to exchange information, especially in this digital age when trust is often violated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that premise, PwC developed <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/blockchain/smart-credentials.html">Smart Credentials</a>, a credential issuance, sharing, reviewing and revocation platform levegering the inherent core benefits of blockchain technology such as immutability, tamper-proof nature, transparency, authenticity and security.</p>



<p>Built using Hyperleder Indy and Hyperledger Aries to support the verification process, Smart Credentials has two key pillars: Authentication (you are who you say you are) and Authorization (genuine claim). Both are crucial ingredients of building trust in any ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smart Credentials recently won a “Bronze” medal for the Best Global Blockchain Innovation 2019 at the Reimagine Innovation awards (Backed by Wharton and QS) and is a finalist in the DataIQ 2020 awards “Best data product/ service” of the year category.</p>



<p>Verified.Me</p>



<p>As higher education moves deeper into online and remote learning for traditional and non-traditional students, colleges and universities are now offering a broader array of services that extend the campus experience to the digital realm. Beyond the advent of digital programming, educational institutions are also privy to sensitive personal student, faculty and alumni data from income and payment information to disciplinary records, healthcare and insurance information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SecureKey Technologies’ <a href="https://verified.me/education/">Verified.Me service</a> is one approach that supports education’s new digital and data privacy demands. This new digital identity verification service can help verify students, alumni and faculty in a timely and secure manner, strengthening educational institutions’ ability to expand their digital offerings with confidence – while also providing much-needed cost savings. Verified.Me is built using the IBM Blockchain Platform, which is based on Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Fabric.</p>

<p>August 26, 2020 – Today, the <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/">Baseline Protocol</a>, an <a href="https://oasis-open-projects.org/projects/">OASIS</a> open source initiative, published the first major dot-release of its reference implementation, clearing the way for standards development.</p>



<p><a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/">Launched in March</a> of this year, the Baseline Protocol uses advances in peer-to-peer messaging, zero-knowledge cryptography and blockchain technology to coordinate complex, confidential workflows between enterprises without moving company data out of traditional systems of record.&nbsp; Today, over 600 companies and individuals are actively participating in the initiative, which coordinates with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance’s Mainnet Working Group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several proofs of concept have been released to showcase how to ‘baseline’ systems such as <a href="https://oasis-open-projects.org/open-source-proof-of-concept-ethereum-mainnet">SAP, Microsoft Dynamics</a> and <a href="https://oasis-open-projects.org/baseline-protocol-initiative-integrates-google-sheets-and-microsoft-dynamics-365-using-public-ethereum-blockchain">Google Sheets</a>. Recently, major brands have announced projects using the protocol, and more are known to be in private development.</p>



<p>Today’s release of Baseline Protocol v0.1 represents a significant milestone, because it provides a set of standard interfaces for developers to implement solutions easily and for vendors to provide their own modules that comply with the specification. Official OASIS standards development based on the v0.1 reference implementation will commence in September.</p>



<p>Today at 12pm US-ET, the development team will host an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BaselineProtocol/live">open walk-through</a> of the system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more information go to <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/releases/v01/">https://www.baseline-protocol.org/releases/v01/</a>.</p>



<p>Support for Baseline Protocol v0.1</p>



<p>Ethereum OASIS is sponsored by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Ethereum Foundation, ConsenSys, Chainlink, Nethermind, Provide, and Unibright.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stefan Schmidt, CTO and Co-Founder of Unibright:</p>



<p>Congratulations to all the contributors of release v.01, especially Kyle Thomas of Provide, Kartheek Solipuram of EY and Tomasz Stanczak of Nethermind. V.01 is defining a milestone for all those who aim to build products around the Baseline Protocol, as we at Unibright do. V0.1 will drive adoption for enterprise blockchain use cases on Ethereum.<br></p>



<p>Kyle Thomas, CEO and Founder of Provide:</p>



<p>Building v0.1 of the Baseline Protocol with the community has been a humbling experience. As of today’s release, contributing to this initiative means contributing to a new set of state-of-the-art business process automation standards that have the attention of some of the biggest brands in the world! I am looking forward to continued collaboration with all the talented individuals and organizations working on the Baseline Protocol and OASIS standard.<br></p>



<p>Thomasz Stanczak, CTO and Founder of Nethermind:</p>



<p>Baseline v0.1 is a big milestone – it combines great tools and guidance for data reconciliation in the world of integrated enterprise systems. At Nethermind we are excited that our solutions support the baseline protocol specification and help companies prevent delays and outages caused by mismatched data.<br></p>



<p>Johann Eid, Chainlink Product Manager:</p>



<p>“Congratulations to Baseline for completing a major milestone by launching v0.1, showcasing that blockchain can serve as a valuable way of keeping systems of record in sync without the common concerns around data and business logic privacy. We look forward to helping Baseline continue to expand its capabilities by providing a framework for Baseline contracts to maintain synchronization when obtaining external data.”</p>



<p>Andrei Semenov, Coke One North America Services, Director of Innovation – Supply Chain</p>



<p>“The release v0.1 is a great achievement for the Baseline community and a step towards building a steady foundation for the enterprise application on mainnet. My sincere congratulations to Provide, Unibright and other teams who contributed to the protocol. ”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paul Brody, EY Global Blockchain Leader, says:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As a founding contributor to this program, EY is very pleased to see continued progress. EY teams&nbsp;will be implementing and tracking Baseline Protocol through the EY OpsChain and EY Blockchain Analyzer solutions as it evolves. We see this as critical infrastructure to enable secure, private, enterprise transactions going forward.”</p>

<p>MadHATTERs Weekly is taking some time out. The MadHATTERs Editorial, 26 August&nbsp;2020</p><p>Nearly four years ago in Nov 2016, MadHATTERs was born. Launched as HATs went public for the first time ­– the first 500 HAT accounts were deployed into the world that day. What a long way we’ve come since then.<br> <br>MadHATTERs began with the aim of providing a weekly dose of curated tech news but with a HAT perspective: the world as seen through our bias towards personal data and digital empowerment, greater control, privacy, security, confidentiality and freedom. And through our pro-innovation and pro-economy stance. <br> <br>We believe we’ve done just that over the past few years, and in the process we’ve built a community of people who care about the same issues that matter to us, informing each other as we learnt together. Through HAT News we’ve also strived to keep you in touch with what’s going on in this community of developers and makers, researchers and innovators, start-ups and funders. <br> <br>But today’s world of tech is a different place from when we first brought MadHATTERs — and HATs — into the world. Notably, personal data is now a huge thing and so is the data economy. Specifically, what we call the <a href="https://www.dataswift.io/concepts/data-economy-2">Data Economy 2.0</a>: where the value of data benefits individuals, organisations and society (<a href="https://www.dataswift.io/concepts/data-economy-2">Dataswift CEO Irene Ng explains further here</a>). <br> <br>The sheer volume of news about data today has necessitated a daily newsletter to cover the pace of information exchange online. Launched last month, Dataswift’s <a href="https://www.dataswift.io/news/a-matter-of-life-and-death">Data News</a> is now your go-to for the latest in the data economy, so make sure you’re <a href="https://dataswift.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=bf49285ca77275f68a5263b83&amp;id=113f789c74">subscribed to receive it in your inbox on weekday mornings</a>. <br> <br>As for MadHATTERs, we’re saying so long for now with Issue 188. But it’s not farewell as we’re taking some time out to refocus our role in the HAT community and fine-tune our voice on furthering the mission and vision of Data Economy 2.0. Onwards and upwards, as they say. <br> <br>Do keep watching this space as the next chapter of MadHATTERs will begin in a month’s&nbsp;time.</p><p>Yours in&nbsp;HAT,</p> Leila Trilby, Editor-in-Chief <p>MadHATTERs is a weekly newsletter covering technology, personal data, and the Internet. Its perspective championing decentralised personal data is led by <a href="https://dataswift.io">Dataswift </a>with the Hub of All Things (HAT) technology. If you like what you read, <a href="https://hubofallthings.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=bf49285ca77275f68a5263b83&amp;id=3ca9558266">subscribe to receive MadHATTERs in your inbox</a>.

<p>Members of the <a href="http://id2020.org">ID2020</a> Alliance are united in the belief that identity is a fundamental and universal human right and that we all deserve better ways to prove who we are — both in the physical world and&nbsp;online.</p><p>As a community of technologists, advocates, implementers, and funders, we also believe that ethically implemented, privacy-protecting, user-managed, and portable digital ID solutions offer a better alternative to the current “data as a commodity” paradigm.</p><p>A new report from KPMG entitled, <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2020/new-imperative-corporate-data-responsibility.html">The New Imperative for Corporate Data Responsibility</a>, suggests that the American public increasingly agrees with this perspective. Based on a survey of 1,000 respondents, the report concludes that consumers expect corporations to “take significant steps to better protect, manage, and ethically use their&nbsp;data.”</p><blockquote>“The findings are unmistakable,” says Orson Lucas, Principal, KPMG Cyber Security Services. “Data privacy and protection are clear priorities for consumers. Close attention to customer data handling, management, and protection practices are key, foundational elements of establishing and maintaining digital&nbsp;trust.”</blockquote><p>The report outlines valuable findings regarding how the public feels about the security of their data, the issues that concern them, and who they believe bears responsibility for creating a more secure and trustworthy digital ecosystem.</p><p>Key Findings: Beliefs</p>  97 percent of respondents say that data privacy is important to&nbsp;them  87 percent believe that data privacy is a human&nbsp;right  86 percent believe that data privacy is a growing&nbsp;concern  68 percent don’t trust companies to ethically sell their private&nbsp;data  54 percent don’t trust companies to use their personal data in an ethical&nbsp;way  53 percent don’t trust companies to collect data in an ethical&nbsp;way  50 percent don’t trust companies to protect their personal&nbsp;data  <p>These insights should not surprise us. After all, a majority of Americans have, at one time or another, been personally affected by a data breach. On the one hand, it is encouraging to see that public opinion is shifting; our experiences have made us all more cognizant of how our identity and personal data are being misused and mismanaged. On the other hand, these experiences are also contributing to a growing mistrust of all forms of digital ID. For those who work in this space, this is a timely reminder that, as we develop and deploy new forms of digital ID, we must do so with an intentional focus and abiding commitment to rebuild and maintain public&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Key Findings: Concerns</p>  83 percent of respondents worry most about the theft of their Social Security Number, followed by their credit card number (69 percent), and their passwords (49&nbsp;percent)  Only 16 percent are worried about their medical records being stolen. Medical records are the most commonly cited example of data that consumers trust companies to protect (57&nbsp;percent)  <p>Given these rapidly changing consumer opinions, and with our vision of good digital ID for all as our guiding star, we at ID2020 regularly revisit the question: how do we get&nbsp;there?</p><p>The data suggest what we have long believed: that, in the coming years, market forces (i.e. consumer demands) will drive tectonic shifts in the data economy. But will market forces be&nbsp;enough?</p><p>Most telling in the data is that the public is most likely to trust healthcare companies to protect the privacy of their medical records. Laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) establish robust data protections and stiff penalties for companies that mishandle data. These offer the public a degree of confidence that their health information will be held sacrosanct.</p><p>The house is on fire and that the public is finally smelling the smoke when it comes to data security. Market forces can be extremely powerful, but we expect that governments will play an equally important, catalytic role by establishing the regulatory frameworks and consumer protections necessary to rebuild trust and encourage the broad adoption of safe and secure digital ID applications.</p><p>Here as well, the KPMG data provides some valuable insights for policymakers.</p><p>Key Findings: Who is Responsible</p>  91 percent of respondents say that corporations should take the lead in establishing corporate data responsibility  56 percent say that companies should prioritize giving consumers more control over their data in&nbsp;2020  84 percent are open to state legislatures giving consumers more control over their&nbsp;data  <blockquote>“Data privacy issues are not going to go away,” says KPMG Cyber Security Services Principle, Steve Stein. “In fact, consumer protections around data privacy, like the ones provided by the CCPA, are very likely to be codified in other states and eventually at the federal level. Simply put, privacy laws are only going to increase in volume and rigor. That’s why visibility, protection, and trust is gaining such momentum in the marketplace and also why leading-edge companies are not looking at data privacy as just another compliance or check-the-box exercise. They see privacy as one of the pathways to growing their business by improving trust with their customers.”</blockquote><p>So…How DO We Get&nbsp;There?</p><p>Identity systems rely on trust to function; trust between issuers of identity and relying parties and, critically, that of those who use the system to prove their identity to access various goods, services, and privileges.</p><p>ID2020 was established in 2016 to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions. To achieve this vision, we are working simultaneously along three&nbsp;tracks.</p><p>We are helping shape the market through the ID2020 Certification, which applies 41 rigorous, outcome-based Technical Requirements to certify best-in-class digital ID solutions. We are working with policymakers in the United States and internationally to advocate for the ethical implementation of better forms of digital ID. And, as the technologies continue to evolve, we are implementing programs in the field to test and apply what we learn as these systems are replicated and brought to&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Fully realizing the potential of digital ID will require businesses, technology providers, policymakers, and civil society to collaborate — and quickly — to build and implement functional, privacy-preserving, user-managed ID systems, and work to overcome the mistrust which could impede their broad adoption. We developed the ID2020 Alliance model to foster this collaboration.</p><p>The road to good ID for all is riddled with potholes…and we have one chance to get this&nbsp;right.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implementation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights, while ensuring data remains private and in the hands of the individual.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/new-report-highlights-public-concerns-about-data-privacy-6cfd1e248d49">New Report Highlights Public Concerns About Data Privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 “Covid State of Play” examines sick buildings, planning lags, and reopening <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/carolyn-schmitt">Carolyn&nbsp;Schmitt</a></p>A tent hospital in Central Park. Photo: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Central_Park_tent_hospital_(2)_jeh.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a><p>In the absence of leadership guidelines for mitigating COVID-19, creative solutions — in concert with established public health recommendations — are&nbsp;key.</p><p>Low-cost air quality sensors, rethinking what schools look like, and identifying new modes of collaboration are a few of the creative approaches discussed during a recent discussion hosted by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a> and <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/margaret-bourdeaux">Magaret Bourdeaux</a> of the Berkman Klein Center’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/bkc-policy-practice-digital-pandemic-response">Digital Pandemic Response</a>&nbsp;program.</p><p>The talk examined the current “Covid State of Play,” and covered COVID-19 testing, school reopenings, and ventilation. Their guest, <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/joseph-allen/">Joseph Allen</a>, is an Assistant Professor of Exposure Assessment Science at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public&nbsp;Health.</p><p>Bourdeaux, also of the Harvard Medical School’s Global Public Policy and Social Change program and the Harvard Kennedy School’s Security and Global Health Project, outlined the current testing situation in the United States, urging for more action and implementation.</p><p>“I think this is all about hard work. It is about systematic planning. It is about leadership and not counting [on] that there’s going to be some miracle cure, some miracle intervention that is going to save us. We are going to have to actually do the work that is required to control this outbreak and we just have to grow up and do it,” she&nbsp;said.</p><p>Allen added that there ongoing work on a rapid saliva-based at-home test, which needs to be reviewed by the FDA but has the potential to be a quick, accessible, low-cost test. “There is the technology available for at-home rapid tests. To Margaret’s point, we need it now,” he said, noting that the test isn’t the same as the PCR tests currently in use. “It takes a different mentality. It’s not a diagnostic test like we expect at the doctor’s office. It’s a tool to control the pandemic or help control the pandemic, so we need a mindset shift here and think about how we think about testing.”</p><p>School reopenings without testing infrastructure and public health implementations are also a pressing concern. Atop the testing challenges, many schools and universities have buildings with poor ventilation, Zittrain pointed out. Bourdeaux and Allen emphasized how being outside is safer than being indoors, but buildings with good ventilation are important for mitigating the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>“We are in the sick building era,” Allen said, meaning many buildings meet only minimum air quality standards to save energy. “So we’re paying the consequence right now for our choices that we’ve stopped designing buildings for&nbsp;people.”</p><p>Zittrain inquired about the use of carbon dioxide sensors in indoor spaces to monitor the air quality, a tool Allen said is already in use, and that his lab has also built. “Some of these can connect to the building information system, so in real-time it can, to your point, ‘hey, your CO2 hit a certain level. Let’s open up the dampers in here.’ In fact, it’s called demand control ventilation,” Allen explained.</p><p>But the availability of low-cost carbon dioxide sensors means employees can also raise red flags about air quality. “It’s democratized this healthy buildings idea and people are sharing that data. They are sharing that. Buildings are getting labeled sick buildings,” he said. “People can finally make the invisible visible with these cheap sensors.”</p><p>With “sick buildings” as a backdrop, the conversation shifted to whether schools should reopen. Allen, a <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/harvard-expert-outlines-recommendations-for-school-reopenings/">proponent </a>for reopening schools, argued there should be prerequisites to opening: “One, you have to control the spread and two, you have to make enhancements to your risk reduction strategies within the school. So it’s the when and the what. When to open and what has to be done, and so that’s where I’ve been bullish to say hey, if you do those things, sure, schools should&nbsp;open.”</p><p>Allen cited recent reopening failures in states like Georgia as examples of when these conditions were not met and should not have opened. “I am confident if we meet those metrics you’ll have low community spread and the probability of entering into the school and your new cases lower, that’s obvious as a numbers game. And then if you put these other strategies in place which we know work in hospitals and elsewhere, including and beyond airborne transmission, it’s mask-wearing, it’s de-identification, it’s managing flows of people and queues of people,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Bourdeaux echoed Allen’s concerns, emphasizing the importance of controlling community transmission, including case counts, and “understanding how robust your public health measures to end community transmission are.”</p><p>She compared the current response to the virus to the way people experience a hurricane, where the storm blows over and the perceived danger subsides. Instead, she said, there is more work to do from a public health perspective before having the reopening conversation. Bourdeaux said having a national plan and for having the important conversations to help stop the spread of the virus should be part of this action&nbsp;plan.</p><p>“We’re not having a very intelligent conversation about really what we’re dealing with to date, and so that’s not related to schools and whether schools could be made safe,” she said. “They absolutely can be made safe. We’ve seen buildings like hospitals, as Dr. Allen has pointed out. We can make places safe but I think that it’s asking a lot to say okay, let’s reopen schools when we’re not having a smart conversation about where we stand with community transmission in general.”</p><p>While children have lower infection and mortality rates, Allen countered that schools play an important function for many students, and other risks — such as access to food and virtual dropout — should be factored in as well. “If we don’t think there are consequences to keeping tens of millions of kids outside of school, they’re at higher risk of abuse and neglect, exploitation. The loss of learning. The loss of socialization. Over 30 million kids rely on schools for meals. These are massive costs and it’s horrifying to recognize that our country hasn’t prioritized this,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Along similar lines, Zittrain asked whether any official guidelines for reopening might further intensify the inequalities between wealthier communities — who have access to more resources — and marginalized communities, who are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.</p><p>These inequalities will still exist with virtual schooling, Allen said. “This virus is exposing deep fissures within our society, the structural racism that’s in our society that exists within these schools. If we keep kids all at home that’s going to exist for the exact same reason and if you bring back some, well that inequality, inequity is going to exist and be exacerbated as well. There’s no simple answer here other than honestly it’s a systemic issue that needs to be fixed and fixed&nbsp;fast.”</p><p>To address these myriad challenges presented by COVID-19, Zittrain asked about best practices for sharing information and working together. Both Allen and Bourdeaux underscored the great opportunities and responses they have seen. Allen described the past few months as a period of great collaboration and camaraderie with “the whole world, every scientist and medical professional is focused on the same problem.” As an illustration of such new collaboration, he cited <a href="https://schools.forhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2020/06/Harvard-Healthy-Buildings-Program-Schools-For-Health-Reopening-Covid19-June2020.pdf">a report</a> he worked on to advise school superintendents. Bourdeaux similarly emphasized how so many people are trying to take action to help and support during the pandemic, and referred to a <a href="https://apnews.com/9126a38ef22c244f9ca18f9584061f8d">recent poll</a> that says most Americans support a mask&nbsp;mandate.</p><p>The trio also explored creative ways to host schools, such as makeshift schools outside, similar to how hospitals made tented spaces in parks. Allen pointed to an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/27/we-can-must-reopen-schools-heres-how/">op-ed he wrote </a>outlining steps to reopen, which includes temporary school&nbsp;spaces.</p><p>“Let’s put some tents. Let’s use the ball field. Let’s get creative. Look at what the medical community did…There were tents in Central Park,” he said. “We should turn convention centers into schools. Let’s put tents in every park. We can get real creative here instead of saying well, we have this old crumbling infrastructure, what are we going to do? Let’s just jam a thousand kids back into it and do everything the same way. Instead, I think there are some creative solutions out&nbsp;there.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/no-simple-answer-99085ffd0623">“No simple answer”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>In the last month we have shared with you our latest research findings on&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2020/07/27/new-nz-research-highlights-work-needed-to-improve-care-of-personal-information/">Digital Identity and Trust</a>, and just last week the DIA’s DITP team shared with us their exciting news on the formal development of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/news/development-of-digital-identity-trust-framework-confirmed/">Digital Identity Trust Framework</a>,&nbsp;see the webinar recording&nbsp;<a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/play/78Z4d7r--z43HdycswSDBad4W43rf_6s0XAWq6BfmE_kUHZROwGjYbBBNrBmqGFQWxHai3IAv3KyDKzt?continueMode=true">here</a>&nbsp;for Aotearoa/New Zealand.<br><br>Both are important foundations that collectively give us the confidence to take definitive action.</p>



<p>The overriding theme of the Trust and Identity research was one of the organisations and their technology partners taking on a greater share of responsibility when it comes to trustworthy management of personal information and data.&nbsp;This involved recognising that Identity is a Taonga, and understanding (and acting upon) their role as kaitiaki (custodians) of that precious information.&nbsp;Digital Identity NZ has an important role to play&nbsp;in helping organisations on that journey.</p>



<p>The news from the DIA that the Government will introduce a Digital Identity Bill in 2021 is a huge boost to those of us committed to developing a trustworthy digital identity ecosystem in Aotearoa.&nbsp;A definitive trajectory embracing collaboration allows organisations to develop new and innovative technologies and business models that enhance privacy, security and trust while reducing complexity and cost.&nbsp;We welcome and applaud the announcement, and acknowledge the amazing efforts of the DITP team in making it happen.</p>



<p>The research and Trust Framework announcements happily coincide with a new phase of community activity in Digital Identity NZ.&nbsp;From this week we will be forming a number of member-led projects around a number of action-oriented initiatives:</p>



<p>1: Development of an Aotearoa Digital Identity Ecosystem Map (this kicked off on Monday with a pilot survey to member organisations)</p>



<p>2: Further analysis and followup following the high-level findings from our 2020 Research, including a deeper analysis of Māori, Pacifika, and Senior communities, as well as those who may experience accessibility challenges</p>



<p>3: Release of a piece of legal and technical analysis of digital identity’s role in enabling customer onboarding for organisations with AML/CFT responsibilities, and formation of one or more project teams to discuss and explore options for furthering reuse and/or reliance of identity credentials</p>



<p>4: Development of a Digital Identity education roadmap incorporating the principles of Kāwanatanga (Honourable Governance), Rangatiratanga (Self Determination &amp; Agency), Ōritetanga (Equity &amp; Partnership) and freedom of choice.</p>



<p>We will be working closely with the DIPT team as they develop the Interim Trust Framework for the remainder of 2020.&nbsp;Further initiative-based project teams will be formed as we move through that progress.&nbsp;Similarly, we will be&nbsp;gauging&nbsp;member interest in&nbsp;developing a community submission on&nbsp;the Consumer Data Right, in response to MBIE’s request for feedback on their discussion document ‘<a href="https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/11625-discussion-document-options-for-establishing-a-consumer-data-right-in-new-zealand">Options for establishing a consumer data right in New&nbsp;Zealand</a>’.</p>



<p>We will be communicating with you to gather expressions of interest and to invite you to initial exploratory Zoom sessions as each of the initiatives kicks off.&nbsp;In the meantime please feel free to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:andrew.weaver@digitalidentity.nz">contact me</a>&nbsp;directly.</p>



<p>Now more than ever is a great time for you to&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/join/">join DINZ</a>&nbsp;if you are not yet a member.&nbsp;Participating in the project teams and some of our research material is limited to member organisations only, and joining now will also allow you to consider nominating for a role on our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council</a>&nbsp;elections towards the end of the year.&nbsp;Join us as we shift into this exciting phase of action.</p>

It is decentralized in its processes as well as its topography. Learning the “lay of the land” entails bouncing around a network more than surveying a city from a high vantage point. But that’s ok! We recommend starting from the least familiar of these links and bouncing around, rather than reading start to&nbsp;finish.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@benjaminjohnelliott">Benjamin&nbsp;Elliot</a> —Video Introductions to&nbsp;SSI   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djhYZZ3CkuM">An Introduction to Self-Sovereign Identity</a> 9min<br>This presentation by the “SSI Ambassador” (Adrian Doerk of the LISSI project, headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany) touches on the psychology and sociology of identity definitions. It highlights why digital identity offers many different ways to present ourselves and walks through the basics of how ID today is dominated by mega-IdPs (identity providers). It gets to the conceptual heart of what SSI is about. It also shows a real live demonstration of a scooter-authorization project spearheaded by T-Mobile&nbsp;Germany.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81GkdBRmsbE&amp;t=9s">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Foam Figure Explainer v2</a> 9min<br>John Phillips from 460 Degrees, a consulting firm from Sydney, AU, updated his earlier video in January of 2020. This level-setting and first-introduction was designed to help Phillips’ clients understand what SSI looks like from a business-process perspective, which is the key perspective from which large enterprises are mostly likely to decide how much to invest in researching and considering SSI solutions. For more guidance on B2B sales and education, see his longer <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/explaining-ssi-c-suite-executives-anyone-else-john-phillips-webinar-48/">February presentation</a> at SSI Meetup about how to explain SSI to C-Level executives.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AydQmOTcECk">The True Meaning of Identity </a>38 min<br>In September 2019, Kaliya Young presented to SIBOS (the conference of the SWIFT settlement network central to global banking) in their Innovation Track. The video introduces the concept of identity and how it has evolved over time, before sharing at a high level how Self-Sovereign Identity works and why it solves widespread business problems.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfi11GZjbWM">Domains of Identity</a> — 33 min<br>In July of 2018, Kaliya Young presented to the MyData Conference and tied together her research work developing the <a href="https://www.anthempress.com/the-domains-of-identity-hb">Domains of Identity</a> and how the various domains connects to the usage of decentralized identity technology — decentralized identifier and verifiable credentials.  <p>The <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/">SSIMeetup</a> series run out of Madrid, Spain by the indefatigable Alex Preukchat has been assembling a video archive of their live webinar series for years. For these, they invite leaders of influential SSI projects from around the world. These events have a loyal following of regular attendees, making for a spirited Q&amp;A session at the end of each video. While most of the videos tend towards deep dives in specific technical, governance, business, or regional topics, some of them can be useful, accessible, and inspiring for novices. Here are a few we recommend in particular as “novice-friendlier deep&nbsp;dives”:</p>  At the Core of SSI is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcfy9wd5bZI">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> 50min by Drummond&nbsp;Reed  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/self-sovereign-identity-explained-cios-steve-manning-webinar-44/">CIO Brief: Why SSI is Important</a> 65min by Steve&nbsp;Magennis  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/hyperledger-aries-open-source-interoperable-identity-solutions-nathan-george-webinar-30/">Introduction to Hyperledger Aries</a> 71min by Nathan&nbsp;George  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/sovereignty-historical-context-self-sovereign-identity-natalie-smolenski-webinar-18/">Sovereignty in Historical Context</a> 55min by Natalie Smolenski  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/self-sovereign-identity-healthcare-dr-manreet-nijjar-webinar-21/">SSI In Healthcare</a> 63min by Manreet&nbsp;Nijjar   — Organizational Centers of Gravity in&nbsp;SSI  <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (you are&nbsp;here) <p>This organization was formed as a Joint Development Foundation project in 2017 and has grown to be a major venue for IPR-protected co-development among large and small industry players. It has historically focused on the development of both working open-source code and pre-standard specifications for decentralized identity, but it is starting to branch out into non-technical forms of cooperation for the purposes of market-building and to promote all open decentralized identity technology, whether created in DIF or elsewhere.</p> <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">The W3C Credentials Community Group</a> <p>This public discussion group is affiliated with the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), a standards organization for web technologies supported by membership dues and responsible for the management of core protocols like HTML and TLS. The Credential Community Group (CCG) is not an official working group of the W3C, but is still protected under a version of W3C’s IPR regime. <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/community/work_items.html">Work items</a> can be proposed by W3C non-members, and these often include specifications that go on to be standardized. CCG meets every week and is a hub for coordinating activity. Their meetings are recorded and minuted, often including <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/presentations/">presentations</a>. They also have coordinate other discussion groups open to non-members, such as the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">Education Credentials Task Force</a> (“vc-ed”).</p> <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com">The Internet Identity&nbsp;Workshop</a> <p>This biannual event has been the convening at the heart of the decentralized identity community for 15 years, held at the Computer History Museum in the heart of Silicon Valley. It is uniquely co-created by its participants in a mostly-organic and community-driven way, with no pre-picked speakers, keynotes, or commercial presentations aside from a demo hour. True to its name, workshopping, whiteboarding, and open (but detailed and concrete!) discussion on a massive scale are the core of the event. The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">books of proceedings</a> organize and refine all of the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Session_Notes">notes</a> taken live during all the sessions convened at each&nbsp;event.</p> <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData Global</a> <p>This influential and egalitarian global organization grew out of a series of <a href="https://online2020.mydata.org">conferences</a> first held in 2016. They advocate for a human-centric and rights-driven vision where individuals can get digital services that support them to collect their data, not just safeguarding and well serving but even empowering the data subject. Organizational members and individual members come together to create an ongoing dialogue between “consumers” and ethical businesses to shape new types of markets for digital services. Rooted in the values of the <a href="https://mydata.org/declaration/">MyData Declaration</a>, they focus primarily on elaborating refined, nuance, and bottoms-up models for data governance; only from a solid governance foundation do they begin to make policy, business, and technology decisions. They recently published the <a href="https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/Understanding-Mydata-Operators-pages.pdf">MyData Operators paper</a>, bringing their policy, business, and technological goals more squarely into the realm of decentralized identity.</p> <a href="https://sovrin.org/">The Sovrin Foundation</a> <p>Since the early days of decentralized identity, Sovrin has been one of the major hubs of innovation and entrepreneurship, serving as a kind of all-in-one community, codebase, blockchain, and better business bureau. They have also published many canonical educational and marketing texts that have been foundational to the development of “self-sovereign identity” as a sector of the software industry. The Aries project (housed in the Hyperledger Foundation) and the Trust-over-IP foundation are, in a sense, spin-outs of the Sovrin foundation, and both remain loosely based (sometimes by design, sometimes by momentum) on the Sovrin community’s codebase, ledger, and design principles. The fastest way to familiarize yourself with these is the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/">whitepaper library</a> on the Foundation’s website.</p> Standards organizations <p>These centers of gravity are where ideas and business models evolve in broad conversation. Inevitably, structuring ground rules and governance models for these eventually have to be negotiated between technical experts and standards adopted before major investments (of capital, but also of legislation and public good will) can be approved. See Nader Helmy’s great <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/overview-of-decentralized-identity-standards-f82efd9ab6c7">tour</a> of standards organizations relevant to these centers of&nbsp;gravity.</p> — Government Initiatives:  United States Federal Government <p>Anil John, head of the Silicon Valley Innovation Program run under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology directorate has been funding the development of standards and business models in the nascent field for years. Their website hosts an <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/blockchain-portfolio">overview</a> of related projects <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/blockchain-portfolio">articles by them</a>, as well as guidance documents such as the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/white-paper/2020/01/14/a-taxonomic-approach-to-understanding-emerging-blockchain-idms/final">Taxonomic Approach</a> to Understanding Emerging Blockchain Identity Management Systems. Anil’s blog hosted by CyberForge includes many thoughtful pieces, such as Anil’s recent thoughts on interoperability or his article on the role of government in free-market technology, <a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/can-less-be-more/">Can LESS be&nbsp;more</a>?</p> The British Columbia Provincial Government <p>“BCGov” has invested significantly in the SSI IT management model and has pioneered an approach to verifiable public data represented by the <a href="https://vonx.io">Verifiable Organizations Network</a> (“VON”). This network provides public-record credentials about registered business in a publicly accessible repository of Verifiable Credentials, bringing the traditional “orgBook” into the decentralized era. By directing much of their IT budgets towards open-source development and participating heavily in the emerging open-source community around this project, they have provided invaluable leadership, particularly within the Aries community, including such major contributions as the core of the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-plugin-toolbox">Aca-Py Codebase</a>.</p> The European&nbsp;Union <p>ESSIF (European SSI Framework) is an ongoing open-source initiative to seed and accelerate the role of SSI in the EU digital “single market” strategy. It is housed jointly between the directorate-generals responsible for IT planning and policy in Brussels and the independent European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Get+Started+EBSI">EBSI</a>), a 30-country collaboration of EU and EU-affiliated countries working together to build a shared infrastructure for government blockchain projects. SSI Meetups are the best way to learn more about ESSIF and its role in the EU’s broader digital initiatives:</p>  An <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/understanding-european-self-sovereign-identity-framework-essif-daniel-du-seuil-carlos-pastor-webinar-32/">overview</a> by ESSIF Convenors Daniel du Seuil and Carlos Pastor (July&nbsp;2019)  ESSIF Chief Legal Counsel Nacho Alamillo gave an introduction to ESSIF’s approach to eIDAS in <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/eidas-regulation-anchoring-trust-self-sovereign-identity-systems-ignacio-alamillo-webinar-49/">February 2020</a> and a more detailed overview of the official report of the legal review based on that approach in <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/introducing-ssi-eidas-legal-report-ignacio-alamillo-webinar-55/">May of&nbsp;2020</a>  ESSIF-LAB program coordinators Oskar van Deventer and Rieks Joosten (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMVyLARr-4">TNO</a>, the Hague) gave an <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/essif-lab-creating-funding-interoperable-ssi-infrastructure-europe-webinar-52/">overview</a> of how their program incentivizes interoperability and European contributions to the broader SSI landscape (March&nbsp;2020)  Interested parties are encouraged to check the ec.europa.eu website for current <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-identity-and-trust-commission-launches-public-consultation-eidas-regulation">public consultations</a> and calls for&nbsp;comment.

 ID2020 Announces Certification of BLOK Pass from BLOK Bioscience <p>ID2020 is proud to announce the certification of BLOK Pass from BLOK Bioscience, a digital ID-based solution for COVID health status certificates. BLOK Pass is the first COVID-focused solution to be certified by&nbsp;ID2020.</p><p>BLOK Pass offers individuals a self-sovereign record of their testing, antibody and, ultimately, vaccination status. Initially envisioned as a means to help businesses and governments manage the safe and incremental return to public life in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the solution is expected to be applied more broadly in the future to support immunization certificates and the transmission of other medical test&nbsp;results.</p><blockquote>“The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust digital credentials into the global spotlight,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “As we consider digital ID-based solutions for public health applications, getting the technology right is not negotiable. We intentionally set a high bar for certification and are delighted to recognize the BLOK Pass solution for meeting our high standards for privacy protection, user-management, portability, and&nbsp;more.”</blockquote><p>To be eligible for certification, solutions must adhere to 41 functional, outcomes-based<a href="https://id2020.org/uploads/files/Technical-Requirements.pdf"> Technical Requirements</a>. In addition to providing a roadmap to help developers create better products, the ID2020 Certification also provides a “third-party seal of approval” so that implementers — and ultimately, end-users — can trust that the technology was developed in accordance with the highest ethical and technical standards.</p><blockquote>“Pandemic management is essentially an entirely new solution domain,” said BLOK Solutions Chief Technology Officer, Areiel Wolanow. “The precedents we set now will set the standard for how the future unfolds, so we have a duty to get things right. By starting with the principle that individuals should always be the sole owner of their data, it is our hope at BLOK that this a standard that others will find it exceedingly difficult to deviate&nbsp;from.”</blockquote><p>The ID2020 Certification is already impacting the technical landscape for digital ID and technology providers of all sizes are increasingly aligning their technical approaches to comport with ID2020’s requirements. To date, more than 30 technology providers from every corner of the globe have submitted applications and worked with the ID2020 staff and advisory committees to complete the application process.</p><p>Today, BLOK Pass joins Kiva Protocol, Gravity.earth, and ZAKA as part of a small, but rapidly growing, cadre of ID2020 certified digital ID solutions.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p><a href="http://www.id2020.org/">www.ID2020.org</a></p><p>About BLOK BioScience, Ltd.</p><p>BLOK BioScience is part of the BLOK Group. With a network of global experts and a robust and far-reaching supply chain, we provide trusted and authentic solutions to help respond to the rapidly changing population wellness landscape.</p><p>Our unique combination of medical and strategic expertise and technical knowledge results in secure and compliant solutions for tracking and verifying immunity, and we use rapid antibody testing and recording to enable governments and industry to manage viral outbreaks and mitigate the economic and social effects of pandemics</p><p><a href="http://www.blokbioscience.com/">www.blokbioscience.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-announces-certification-of-blok-bioscience-immunity-passport-1f86013e9da5">ID2020 Announces Certification of BLOK Bioscience Immunity Passport</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">Support for FIDO in browsers and operating systems</a> is widespread and growing fast. Enterprises now have better tools to replace easily compromised passwords with simpler, stronger FIDO Authentication and eliminate phishing, man-in-the-middle and other security attacks. But, if you want to deploy FIDO in your enterprise, what are the first steps? Do you need to explain “why FIDO?” to your CISO? What do the timelines look like? Should you build your own server or work with a vendor? What FIDO authenticators should you accept? How do you manage&nbsp; them?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance Enterprise Deployment Working Group (EDWG) will answer these questions, and more, in its new white paper series. The series aims to educate corporate management and IT security on the improvements available for authentication today and how to leverage them within their own organizations. This work is dedicated to eliminating passwords and securing the simple act of logging into company systems and applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First up in the series is the primer “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/">CXO Explanation: Why Use FIDO for Passwordless Employee Logins</a>?” This document is the guide for you and/or the executive leaders in your organization as to why you should invest in FIDO2 deployment for your employees.</p>



<p>It addresses all of the common questions from CXOs on the value proposition of FIDO Authentication and how the FIDO2 passwordless framework addresses the authentication needs and challenges of companies for the modern workforce. Read it now at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/">https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/</a> and pass it along to colleagues.</p>



<p>Subsequent entries in this educational series will focus on server deployment, authenticator choices, authenticator life-cycle management, and credential acceptance in the enterprise. This series is part of the Alliance’s strategy to provide expert deployment guidance to our community in order to support the rapidly growing number of FIDO implementations across a variety of use cases. Please watch this space as we publish more in this Enterprise Series over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

Lots of speculation about why the private equity giant wants to sink good money — USD4.7 billion — into a business that’s more Long Lost Family than profit-maximisation growth, especially given how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126360/23andme-ancestry-layoffs-genetics-dna-market-privacy">saturated the consumer DNA testing market</a> is. <br> <br>Blackstone’s no doubt eyeing Ancestry’s DNA database of over 18 million people, even though it insists it won’t have access to it. But we’ve heard that one before. Blackstone’s not paying the equivalent of USD250 per person for nothing. Our genetic code has immense value beyond unearthing family history, whether as a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-meteoric-rise-of-family-tree-forensics-to-fight-crimes/">powerful forensic tool to help solve crime</a> or as part of new drug-discovering pharma and medical research.<br> <br>But this most private of our personal data can also be badly misused: by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20896075/trump-administration-dna-testing-immigrants-detention-homeland-security">governments tracking and surveilling immigrants</a>, by insurers using <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/04/4--risks-consumer-face-with-dna-testing-and-buying-life-insurance.html">predictions of genetic illnesses</a> to reject policy applications. And safe to say you’d rather <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/theres-no-such-thing-as-family-secrets-in-the-age-of-23andme/">find out about that long-lost sibling</a> yourself than from a stranger using hacked data as blackmail. Little surprise the <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-era-of-dna-database-hacks-is-here-85a860190622">recent data breach exposing GEDmatch’s</a> 1 million user database got many het up about the possibility of more hacks. <br> <br>Privacy advocates have long questioned the wisdom of handing our DNA data to commercial firms, given the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health-privacy/your-genetic-data-isnt-safe-direct-to-consumer-genetic-testing/">lack of adequate privacy laws that protect genetic data. </a>And the story of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/06/25/can-the-immortal-cells-of-henrietta-lacks-sue-for-their-own-rights/">Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells</a> is a cautionary tale of how easily institutions can harvest something so personal without consent, commercialise and monetise its potential without benefiting its original source. <br> <br>Ultimately, whatever Blackstone intends to do with Ancestry.com and its DNA database must involve the consent of those who contributed to it, and with respect for their rights to its value, economic or otherwise.</p><p>MadHATTERs is a weekly newsletter covering technology, personal data, and the Internet.

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Editor’s note: For the background information on the 2020 Hackathon in Korea, see the April blog post: “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-hackathon-goodbye-password-challenge-in-korea/">2020 FIDO Hackathon: Goodbye Password Challenge in Korea</a>.”&nbsp; To learn more about examples of proposed development ideas, please read the June blog post: “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-hackathon-in-korea-learn-implement-phase/">2020 FIDO Hackathon in Korea: Learn &amp; Implement Phase</a>.”</p>



<p>In the afternoon of July 1st, 2020, a Mid-Term Meetup Event for FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge was held at Telecommunication Technology Association (TTA). Originally, the Hackathon Steering Committee had planned a full-day onsite final implementation and evaluation day, followed by a month and a half online training phase.&nbsp; Due to the global pandemic, we had to change our schedules in accordance with school calendar disruptions and summer holidays. We decided to have a half-day mid-term meetup event for participants. This allowed us to help the teams to stay on course while providing a safe environment for people to learn from each other face-to-face.</p>







<p>Nineteen different teams participated in the event, half of them face-to-face with strict public health guidance applied, and the other half virtually. The meeting gave opportunities for teams to share their FIDO protocol-based online service development ideas and current development status, learn from each other and receive valuable feedback from FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group members.</p>







<p>In addition to sharing their projects’ current development status, the teams had the opportunity to present the “homework” they have completed after online training.&nbsp; The homework was writing a simple article on the web, with answers to the following questions:</p>



  What is FIDO Alliance?  What are the FIDO protocols?  What are the benefits of implementing FIDO protocols?  (Option) What services/products are you developing for the 2020 FIDO Hackathon and what would be the value of adopting FIDO protocols for online authentication?  



<p>We were very pleased with the articles we received. You can read examples (mostly in Korean) by visiting these following links:</p>



  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/yeocw3/222029532562">No matter how passwords are complicated, they are not safe!&nbsp; Learn FIDO concepts</a>  <a href="https://pongdang-pooh.tistory.com/9">FIDO Authentication: Good security knowledge to learn while you are quarantined at home</a>  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/owjs3901/222030081852">2020 FIDO Hackathon Homework – My Plan to Develop FIDO Based IoT Solution for Home</a>  <a href="https://blog.naver.com/lcwlyw/222032889174">FIDO – New technology standard to solve problems with IDs and Passwords&nbsp;</a>  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/woojim11/222011830343">Let’s learn about FIDO Alliance and FIDO Specs</a>  <a href="https://codstice.tistory.com/78">Summary on FIDO Alliance and FIDO Specs</a>  



<p>We hope this short blog gives you a better understanding of the current status of the 2020 FIDO Hackathon in Korea.&nbsp; We will be back soon with more updates after the final evaluation — scheduled for this week.&nbsp;</p>

The MadHATTERs Editorial, 5 August&nbsp;2020</p><p>MadHATTERs Weekly<br>Like what you read? <a href="http://eepurl.com/den42v?source=post_page---------------------------">Subscribe here</a>.</p><p>Meaningful regulation was one of the main takeaways from last week’s theatrics aka the Big Tech antitrust hearings. In closing Wednesday’s over-five-hours-long session, subcommittee chair David Cicilline stated that US <a href="https://tech.newstatesman.com/business/antitrust-hearing-concludes-with-a-call-to-break-up-big-tech-here-are-the-highlights">antitrust laws, written over a century ago, need to work in today’s digital age</a>. And to achieve this Congress will have to <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-broken-up-antitrust-6e62ce57-e465-4bab-b55c-82254b100f55.html">‘think outside the box’</a>, his fellow Democrat Joe Neguse said to Axios.<br> <br>We can’t wait to see what this’ll look like. They’re not new, these calls for anti-competition regulation that’s fit for the 21st century. Back in Nov 2018, digital civil rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation called for <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/antitrust-enforcement-needs-evolve-21st-century">stronger antitrust enforcement</a> to better protect competition, markets and consumers. One of the main contentions (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c19dba72-7635-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab">also argued by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes</a>): it’s no longer relevant to use price to measure consumer welfare, given the free-services-for-your-data practices of today’s digital economy. <br> <br>But US regulations still lag behind Europe, whose efforts to modernise its antitrust laws are now entering what its competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager calls a ‘new phase’: potentially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/technology/europe-new-phase-tech-amazon-apple-facebook-google.html?">a major overhaul of the EU’s digital economy</a> where tech companies could be regulated like the telco and finance industries. That said, it is still an economic craft to know how to balance regulation and markets. Digital economy markets are still young, and the adtech hegemony is strong. There is a risk that regulation can kill fledgling business and economic models if regulators get it wrong.<br> <br>Also, having regulation in place is one thing; enforcement is another. The GDPR for instance, has been critiqued for <a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things/happy-birthday-gdpr-4479973d22b">not really showing its teeth</a> despite being around for two years now. Execution of enforcement is also another issue, as Vestager discovered recently when her 2016 decision to make Apple pay €13 billion in back taxes <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/defeat-on-13b-apple-tax-bill-delivers-big-blow-to-eu-margrethe-vestager-ireland/">was overturned</a>. <br> <br>Still much more work to be done to properly regulate these tech companies and rein in their monopolistic power, while ensuring the societal benefits are not killed off. One thing’s for sure: we’re in for a long&nbsp;haul.</p><p>MadHATTERs is a weekly newsletter covering technology, personal data, and the Internet.

<p>Cabinet has confirmed that a Digital Identity Trust Framework based in legislation will be developed. The Trust Framework will be a regulatory regime that ensures that identity service providers meet the required rules.</p>



<p>The Trust Framework will also ensure that citizens and businesses can have trust and confidence that their identity information is being handled appropriately.</p>



 Developing an Interim Trust Framework 



<p>The Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) will develop an Interim Trust Framework, which will enable the Trust Framework rules to be developed and tested with digital identity providers, while the legislation is being drafted.</p>



<p>The legislation is scheduled to be introduced to the House in 2021. The legislation will enable providers to be legally accredited against the Trust Framework rules, which will be based on existing and developing standards.</p>



<p>The Trust Framework will support the development of security, privacy-enhancing and interoperable approaches to digital identity services, to maximise benefits for citizens, the economy and society. To inform this process, DIA will be testing a range of approaches through pilot programmes with public and private sector organisations.</p>

The questions we raise in this specific context may be extended to understand the current conceptual as well as practical deployment of many ICT4D programmes as envisioned by both government and non-government actors. The idea of digital literacy is central to both the conceptualization and the execution of such programmes, and the actors in charge work with their own understanding of the context and needs of the people they aim to empower. There have been very few attempts to systematically understand the concept of digital literacy which leave much scope for either lenient contextual interpretations or context insensitive one-size-fits-all approach towards technological interventions. This session is an effort to begin one such discussion which we hope will refine the prevalent understanding of digital literacy/literacies in&nbsp;India.</p><p>From a glance at the structure of Digital India programme, it is apparent that the programme is designed to achieve digital inclusion and is primarily directed towards the digitally marginalized in spite of having a more comprehensive agenda. The schemes such as National Digital Literacy Mission (NDLM) and the way they are conceived are indexical of the kind of target groups which the programme plans to address. A key concern for us is to think through the mismatches between the frameworks of the digital literacy initiatives and the local socio-technical contexts which we observed in our field sites. The objective of the session is not as much to arrive at the definitional fixity of the concept of digital literacy as it is to complicate and problematize the prevalent definitions of digital literacy implicit in both visualization and execution of such initiatives. We plan to meet this objective through empirical insights we have on three different field&nbsp;sites.</p><p>The session will also focus on certain methodological questions that might help us better understand digital literacy. This part of the session addresses questions such as: how can we conceptually define digital literacy/literacies? What parameters should go into the measuring of digital literacy? How should we theoretically understand it — as technical skills or knowledge or some higher cognitive ability? How can we best pedagogically achieve it given the complexity of ground reality? The questions will be directed towards encouraging thought in this area rather than providing answers. The session will also try and discuss various kinds of policy and pedagogical documentation available on digital literacy and critically debate their conceptualization and execution by juxtaposing them against various uses of ICTs on the ground by specific groups of users. This part of the discussion will draw upon scholarly and other kinds of documentation available on the topic and use them to evaluate various government and corporate initiatives to achieve digital literacy in&nbsp;India.</p> Plan <p>In keeping with the spirit of the conference, the three discussants’ will try to put forth empirical insights from their respective field situations and frame nuanced research and discussion questions on digital literacies at the margins of techno-cultural capital and/or access. Further the discussion will be aided by specific readings and the insights drawn from them. The idea is to have a symmetrical, reciprocatory and anthropologically comparative conversation on questions of technology, materiality, access, meaning making, development and literacy, by moving back and forth between different fieldsites and interpretive frameworks.</p><p>Field Note&nbsp;I</p><p>The first discussant’s work on social media use in rural Rajasthan discusses socio-technical changes instituted by the introduction of ICTs despite their developmental failures. He claims that these changes have been often viewed from technologically or socially deterministic positions and that there are significant empirical gaps between such technocratic discourses and the grassroots experiences of technology. There is a growing usage of social and digital media in rural areas where ICT4D and e-Governance pilot projects have failed to meet their goals. Based on an ethnographic study of ICTs in two villages of Rajasthan, his work aims to situate social and digital media in a complex rural society and media ecology using co-constructivist approach. Focusing on context sensitive meaning making of ICTs, it will seek to contribute to an empirically sound discourse on media, technology and rural society in&nbsp;India.</p><p>Field Note&nbsp;II</p><p>The second discussant’s work on mobile phones and multimedia consumption among the digitally marginalized users in Bangalore brings into focus the popular usage of ICTs, specifically mobile phones, among the subaltern users. While such popular usage indicates a certain level of literacy already achieved by the digitally marginal groups by mere exposure and peer learning, it is not sufficient to do away with all kinds of guided training required to make such users participate in informationalized environments. Her observations on the mobile phone usage among the subaltern users in Bangalore problematize the notion of digital literacy and invite us to think about it as a more layered and stratified concept. They raise questions such as ‘what constitutes digital literacy?’ — some complex use of gadgets learnt by mere exposure and peer knowledge or an awareness about the social relevance of the technologies and knowledge about their appropriate deployment in different social contexts? While mere access and some nominal training might be helpful in equipping people with some knowledge about gadget-use, her study points out that such initiatives are far from achieving the right degree of digital literacy needed to make these people participate in new media ecologies. Thus it contends the claims of 1. Organic literacy attained by mere exposure and peer sharing of technological knowledge and 2. Literacy attained by current training programmes which might equip the digitally marginalized with knowledge of technological use but not necessarily inform them about the context relevant knowledge needed for their appropriate deployment.</p><p>Field Note&nbsp;III</p><p>The third discussant’s work on e-governance initiatives in an Indian state plans to return the gaze on to the bureaucracy itself and takes the conversation from the margins back to the centre. His work moves away from the target groups generally alluded to in programs such as the NDLM. It takes into accounts the struggles, anxieties, hopes and promises of/for a bureaucracy in coming to terms with a gradual but seemingly eventual shift from paper work to digital paper work. The users in this case are staff members tasked by the higher-level bureaucracy-who have little or no clue about it themselves- to learn a new tool and migrate all paper work to the digital domain. Many of e-governance projects are spearheaded by corporate organizations, which in turn dictate the terms of the conversation on Digital Literacy even within the government. What impact does this have on how Digital Literacy is understood, articulated and executed in ICT4D programs within and without the government.</p> Readings <p>Terranova, Tiziana. 2004.

 A DIF-hosted resource for community development  Introduction <p>It has been almost three years since DIF began working on the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">Universal Resolver</a> (GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver) </a>— a foundational piece of infrastructure for the Decentralized Identity ecosystem (see the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">original announcement</a>). Since then, our vision of being interoperable across ledgers and DID methods has seen a lot of support. Thanks to community contributions, the Universal Resolver now supports around 30 different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>Today, we are happy to announce an updated set of instances where the Universal Resolver is deployed. One stable and one experimental version will be iterated, maintained, and hosted by DIF as a service to the community!🎉</p><p>While this is undoubtedly a useful resource for research, experimentation, testing, and development, it is important that it not be mistaken for a production-grade universal resolver. It should be pointed out&nbsp;that:</p>  This infrastructure is neither intended or approved for production use cases and that nobody should rely on it for anything other than for development and testing purposes.  These two specific deployments are not production-ready. The preferred scenario continues to be that all DID-based information systems, run by a method operator or otherwise, production or otherwise, host their own instance of the Universal Resolver (or other DID Resolution tools).  DIF withholds the right to limit or modify the performance of this free service in case usage for production, commercial, and/or malicious purposes is detected.   Two Deployments <p>The following two deployments are now available as a community service:</p><p>* <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> — Hosted on IBM Cloud by DIF (thanks IBM!). While not considered production-ready, this instance is expected to be relatively stable. It will be tested before and after manual updates from time to time, with versioned releases.<br>* <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a> — Hosted on AWS by DIF. This instance is more experimental, will be updated frequently, and is connected to CI/CD processes. It may be down from time to time or have unexpected functionality changes.</p><p>Note: For backward compatibility, the original URL <a href="https://uniresolver.io/">https://uniresolver.io/</a> will now redirect to <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a>.</p> Documentation <p>See the following links for more information about testing, release, and deployment processes of the Universal Resolver:</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@polarmermaid">Anne&nbsp;Nygård</a>  AWS Architecture: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md</a>  CI/CD Process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md</a>  Branching Strategy: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md</a>  Release process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md</a>  Periodically, this standing work item is discussed in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>, so that group’s recorded meetings and discussions on Slack and <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/id-wg">mailing list</a> may contain further insight on the above&nbsp;topics.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540">The Universal Resolver Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The MadHATTERs Editorial, 29 July&nbsp;2020</p><p>MadHATTERs Weekly<br>Like what you read? <a href="http://eepurl.com/den42v?source=post_page---------------------------">Subscribe here</a>.</p><p>Wednesday: big day for Big Tech as their head honchos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/25/21338238/antitrust-hearing-ceos-facebook-amazon-google-apple-rescheduled">face the US House Judiciary Committee.</a> The much-anticipated antitrust hearing is the first time that four of them — Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos — will be testifying in one hearing. A quick recap of why they’re there: Amazon for its handling of third-party sellers, Apple for its App Store policies, Facebook for its WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions, and Google for its hold over the digital ad market. But other issues including misinformation and content moderation will probably get some airtime too. <a href="https://www.axios.com/the-one-big-thing-each-tech-ceo-will-tell-congress-687f55de-8fdd-4c95-a3dd-ec1cdadb7b60.html">Here’s what each of them’s expected</a> to tell Congress as they try to convince lawmakers that big is still beautiful. <br> <br>But the <a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things/doing-the-right-thing-finally-e17795d5137d">working-together-to-fight-COVID-19 honeymoon</a> is over. The current pandemic has only increased our reliance on Big Tech, further strengthening their dominance. And these tech companies continue to use their unparalleled access to data to consolidate their power. Two cases in point will come up at the hearing: whether Amazon used data <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015">from individual third-party sellers (£)</a>, as well as its <a href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/amazon-accused-of-meeting-with-start-ups-and-stealing-ideas/">investments in startups</a>, to develop competing products. And if Google’s been doing something similar with <a href="https://mashable.com/article/google-android-lockbox-antitrust/?europe=true">‘sensitive’ data collected from Android phones</a> on how people are using rival apps. <br> <br>Wednesday’s event will be the most high-profile antitrust hearing since Bill Gates’ 1998 appearance before Congress to testify on Microsoft’s uncompetitive practices. And we all know what happened next: a landmark lawsuit, the end of Microsoft’s computing monopoly, and Gates shifting his world dominance ambitions to philanthropy.</p><p>We’ll be tuning in (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVvv3JRCVQAl6ovogDum4hA">watch the livestream here</a>) to see if this week’s Congressional hearings will be similarly pivotal for today’s internet&nbsp;economy.</p><p>MadHATTERs is a weekly newsletter covering technology, personal data, and the Internet.

Unless you are familiar with the terminology of the OpenID community, knowing what the acronym stands for doesn’t illuminate much, but rest assured, this is one of the most exciting developments to support the widespread adoption of Verifiable Credentials across the&nbsp;web.</p><p>This post will explain how it’s exciting and what kinds of adoption it could galvanize. First, we will cover OpenID &amp; OpenID Connect, then touch on how decentralized identity (or “self-sovereign identity”) relates to “authentication” and “user accounts,” and finally how they can work together, with two educational videos along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>While there is substantial and sophisticated <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/blob/master/docs/README.md">prior art</a>, particularly in the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Aries</a> community, for integrating verifiable credentials with OpenID Connect, using DIDs for OIDC is still emerging and approaching its first stable specification in the coming months. This is the culmination of substantial collaborative work to develop this bridge between the DID Authentication Working Group at DIF and various interlocutors at the OpenID Foundation. This post breaks down key elements of this development and shares more resources if you want to explore it&nbsp;further.</p> What is OpenID &amp; OpenID&nbsp;Connect <p>The first seeds of OpenID were sprouted at the very first Internet Identity Workshop in 2005. All the companies interested in URL-based protocols got together and collaborated together on their various models for designing authentication for users against URLs they controlled, like their personal blogs. This protocol has evolved and the latest iteration is based on sophisticated OAuth (Open Authorization) standards and&nbsp;tooling.</p><p>The basic and most typical flow used by OpenID Connect can be described as follows: an individual, which in this context can be called a “user” of the identity system, first gets a fresh proof of authenticity of their digital identity. This unique proof is minted in the course of an interaction with a service called an “Identity Provider” (IP), i.e. Google or Facebook. This proof usually takes the form of a “token,” a single-use cryptographic access code linked to the corresponding identity record at the IP. The user then takes that token to a second site that they are going to login to, with is called the “Relying Party” or RP, which can then trust they are dealing with the same person identified (usually very strongly) by the Identity provider.</p>OpenID Login&nbsp;Flow<p>The teams of professionals that created OpenID Connect had enough imagination to anticipate more complex use-cases that weren’t immediately needed by the commercialized web of 2005, but for which the technical foundations were still worth laying. Among there, there was a clear idea that users would, in some cases, prefer or need to bring their own identity with them rather than a pointer to a record on an IP’s server. This identity would thus be “self-issued,” a capability they designed into the OpenID core specification.</p><p>The vision of DID-SIOP is a way of bringing decentralized identity concepts into alignment with the ideas of “self-issued” portable identity that the original OpenID innovators had. It was good that they included and preserved this underutilized capability in their immensely popular and internet-powering framework, which is the basis of modern social login (i.e., “Sign on with Google/Facebook/etc”). After all, it would have been simpler not to, but enough of designers and thinkers involved anticipated much of what has developed in parallel, the decentralized identity technology that the DIF serves to&nbsp;support.</p> How do decentralized identity systems&nbsp;work? <p>In this conceptual framework, the “Identity Provider” has been cut down a notch, and is instead referred to as a mere “Issuer” (of credentials and information, perhaps of identities over which it has less control).Similarly, the “user” is defined less by borrowed tools and more by owned ones, assuming the title of “Holder” of information and identity, whether issued or self-issued.. The “verifier” relies less on the identity provider, choosing instead to verify information and identities presented by their holder on their own terms (with some cryptographic assurances about the&nbsp;issuer).</p><p>One interesting difference between traditional OIDC and decentralized systems is that in the latter, all parties have identifiers that make it possible to verify signatures; it is hard to tell from a DID whether it corresponds to an institution, an individual, or an inanimate object, because it could be any or all of those. Whatever it represents, it points to ways of verifying signatures with so-called “key material” (public keys, hints to how to classify and use them). Most often, this happens by looking up the material on a distributed ledger, but this is not, strictly speaking, definitive of the framework..</p><p>The key material from an OIDC issuer proves the veracity of whatever information or identity is being presented in a way that is tied back to that issue by similar key-material guarantees, and a self-issued OIDC token works the same way. (In a self-issued OIDC credential, the holder’s key material is used in the place of an institutional issuer’s).</p> How OpenID and Decentralized ID can fit&nbsp;together <p>One of the big challenges for any new technology that needs an identity system is getting adoption of the needed components so the system can actually work at a sustainable scale. This usually required buy-in from various kinds of actors in an ecosystem: at the very least, it needs critical mass of users/holders, IPs/issuers, and RPs/verifiers, each maintaining their end of the infrastructure and “keeping the lights on,” as it&nbsp;were.</p><p>This is exactly where the two systems can really help each other: achieving and maintaining critical mass of all three, as the distribution of more and less centralized solutions changes, and self-issued credentials come to be accepted in theory and in practice. OpenID Connect has a large “install base”: there are literally millions of websites running OpenID Connect tooling as the authentication mechanism at their “front door” for users. Indeed, while a vanishingly small portion of internet users have ever heard of OIDC, it is the nuts and bolts of the most universal and familiar UX and user flow of the contemporary commercial web, including online banking and government services.</p><p>OIDC-SIOP leverages the code that OpenID Connect relying parties already have in place across all these millions of sites, and the lion’s share of the 10,000 most used websites. Think of the screen that reads, “Log in with Google / Facebook / Twitter / Github / etc.” OIDC-SIOP enables organizations to ask for Verifiable Credentials that an individual holds in their wallet instead of a token from Google / Facebook / Twitter / Github. These can be single-use access codes with cryptography built in, or more reusable credentials, or richer credentials containing various kinds of information otherwise requested from an IP. This mechanism is provided by the Self-Issued OpenID Provider flow described by the core specification:</p><p>If successful, this will be a huge win for decentralized identity, because it addresses the perennial “Relying Party” problem of adoption: how do you get relying parties to adopt a new technology, install and trust a new “doorway,” adapt their security and business processes to a new set of strengths and weaknesses? In the popular imagination and even in much of the technology press, scaling a business or a technology is often imagined as a quest for users, but they are often the easiest shareholder to get on board, particularly for something convenient and powerful. The relying parties (or, in economic terms, the “demand side” of identity) is often a much harder business problem, and in this case, no “big lift” is required of the verifiers or “relying party” consuming a new kind of authentication credentials because they only have to make minor adjustments to the nearly universal OIDC tooling they already&nbsp;have.</p> Further Reading <p>The purpose of the DID Authentication <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html">Working Group</a> at DIF is to design, recommend, and implement authentication protocols that rely on open standards and cryptographic protocols tailored to today’s and tomorrow’s systems for handling DIDs and DID documents, the primitives of decentralized identities. In last six months, the group has been actively working on the OIDC bridge, and they presented their latest work at DIF’s June 2020 virtual “face to face”&nbsp;meeting:</p><p>Here is a link to their draft specification, nearing stability and ratification at time of press: <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">https://identity.foundation/did-siop/</a>.

<p>MEDIA RELEASE</p>



 ‘When you know better, do better.’ New Digital Identity NZ research highlights the work required by organisations to improve the care of personal information and identity data. 



 <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2020/07/DINZ-Scrolling-Infographic-July-2020-FINAL.pdf"></a> 



<p>Two thirds of New Zealanders are now more likely to go online rather than face to face, yet a staggering 90% find it difficult or are unsure how to protect their personal information and identity data.&nbsp; A new research survey has found that there is a growing awareness of the way in which our personal information is harvested and used by organisations and technology providers, coupled with a high degree of anger and disappointment about the widespread sale and sharing of that information.</p>



<p>The 2020 Trust and Identity research was conducted by Yabble and commissioned by Digital Identity NZ, in partnership with InternetNZ and the Digital Council of Aotearoa, with support from Middleware NZ, ASB, Department of Internal Affairs, Payments NZ, P^werFinance, Tradewindow and 2Shakes.</p>



<p>Marianne Elliott is one of seven members of the Digital Council.&nbsp; She says, “the goal of the Digital Council is to help us all use digital and data-driven technologies in ways that increase equity, inclusion and well-being in New Zealand. We do this by advising government, drawing on research evidence and other data. This latest digital identity research will make a significant contribution to our work and what we do.”</p>



<p>People in Aotearoa are taking a stronger stance on businesses being responsible for protecting personal data and using it responsibly, in addition to taking personal ownership themselves. 34% of respondents believe that businesses must take greater responsibility, up from 29% in 2019.</p>



<p>There is begrudging acceptance of the collection of our personal data online, “It’s like there is no point to change too much – it is what it is – when I go online I am automatically giving something away – I don’t like it… but it happens .”</p>



<p>Andrew Weaver, Executive Director of Digital Identity NZ, states that “as organisations we have done an excellent job in raising awareness of some of the risks and challenges associated with our highly connected world, yet we are placing too heavy a burden on people to protect themselves without adjusting our systems and processes to make it easier for them to understand and take action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He quotes Maya Angelou to put the challenge to organisations and technology providers, “Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.” He goes on to say, “Identity is taonga, it is a treasure worthy of dignity, respect and care. This places a great deal of responsibility on organisations as kaitiaki/custodians of identity and personal information, and as this research shows our call to action is to ‘do better’ when it comes to how that information is cared for.&nbsp; One participant said, ‘I don’t know where to start when it comes to protecting myself…it is just too hard.’ We must increase transparency, provide meaningful privacy controls and simple, straightforward policies and technology that make it easier for people to take meaningful action.”</p>



<p>As part of Techweek2020, Digital Identity NZ will discuss this research and the concept of Identity as Taonga in an episode of Techweek TV on Thursday 30 July at 4:30pm. &nbsp;A further episode will present additional findings on digital equality on Friday 31July at 12:00pm The episodes can be streamed online at&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://techweek.co.nz/techweek-tv/">https://techweek.co.nz/techweek-tv/</a></p>

<p>Machine learning helps when we’re drowning in data but proactive AI ethics is needed. The MadHATTERs Editorial, 15 July&nbsp;2020</p><p>MadHATTERs Weekly<br>Like what you read? <a href="http://eepurl.com/den42v?source=post_page---------------------------">Subscribe here</a>.</p><p>A UNESCO-backed collaboration is turning to AI to help policymakers beat COVID-19. Launched last week, the Collective and Augmented Intelligence Against Covid-19 (CAIAC) wants to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-global-coalition-aims-to-help-policymakers-leverage-ai-against-covid-19/">use machine learning and human expertise</a> to make sense of the pandemic-related health, social and economic data that’s being generated globally. Expect a <a href="https://www.axios.com/artificial-intelligence-data-tool-coronavirus-6f1dcdff-3f52-49fc-9dbd-361710cdd00a.html">decision-making tool</a> within two months that focuses on three initial areas: digital contact tracing, misinformation and the second- and third-order effects of COVID-19 on marginalised communities.<br> <br>Too much data, too little time. That’s the driving force behind the CAIAC and several other initiatives trying to organise and analyse a ‘vast’ amount of raw data for use in policymaking. No surprise they’re turning to machine learning for help: speed is crucial to make sense of all this data, given the urgent need for evidence-backed policies. <br> <br>But many issues abound. If the quality of the data doesn’t measure up like in <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-the-inside-story-of-how-uks-chaotic-testing-regime-broke-all-the-rules-12022566">the case of the UK’s coronavirus testing data</a>, this would certainly impact decisions. And we all know how facial recognition tech is only as effective as the (biased) machine learning training behind it. The lack of ‘robust’ ethics for AI also makes things more difficult in a crisis scenario like the current pandemic. Cambridge University researchers are calling for an <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/24/1004432/ai-help-crisis-new-kind-ethics-machine-learning-pandemic/?">‘ethics for urgency</a>’ — a new, faster and more proactive way of doing AI ethics. For AI to be really useful in a crisis, they say, the ethics need to be already built into these systems instead of seen as an afterthought. <br> <br>Putting ethics first when it comes to AI, or with anything we do in tech, is the only way we can trust the decisions that are made using&nbsp;them.</p><p>MadHATTERs is a weekly newsletter covering technology, personal data, and the Internet.

<p>Trust is fundamental and foundational to the success of digital identity.&nbsp;It cannot operate without trust between individuals, communities and organisations in the traditional two-party sense (think customer/service provider, buyer/seller), and equally it cannot operate without trust between the various stakeholder organisations in an identity ecosystem.<br><br>Trust is interesting in that it is a product of experience and design – and for digital identity, this points to some fundamental ‘bottom lines’ such as security, privacy and interoperability (design), and then the ability of organisations to act in a way that builds trust over time (experience).<br><br>Experience<br>During&nbsp;<a href="https://techweek.co.nz/whats-on/">Techweek</a>&nbsp;later this month we will be releasing our second annual research report on Digital Identity and Trust.&nbsp;You can view last year’s findings&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2019/05/Digital-Identity-Yabble-Benchmark-Research-Infographic-May-2019.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;The 2020 report is being produced with the generous support of Internet NZ and the Digital Council of Aotearoa, along with a number of DINZ members (DIA, Middleware NZ, ASB, Payments NZ, PowerFinance , 2 Shakes and Tradewindow).&nbsp;Both Internet NZ and the Digital Council (and indeed DINZ) are committed to closing the ‘digital divide’&nbsp;and removing barriers for those communities who are not served well by our online products and services.&nbsp;In light of this, the 2020 research includes some focussed interviews and analysis in Maori, Pacifika and Senior communities.&nbsp;<br><br>Join us for these research-related events during Techweek:</p>



  3pm Monday 27th&nbsp;July –&nbsp;<a href="https://techweek.co.nz/whats-on/2020/trust-and-identity-digital-identity-nz-2020-research-findings-984/">Trust and Identity: Digital Identity NZ 2020 research findings</a>  4:30pm Thursday 30th July –&nbsp;<a href="https://techweek.co.nz/whats-on/2020/identity-as-taonga-795/">Techweek TV – Identity as taonga – trustworthy care of our identity</a>  12:00pm Friday 31st July –&nbsp;<a href="https://techweek.co.nz/whats-on/2020/diversity-in-identity-building-identity-solutions-for-everyone-1033/">Techweek TV – Building identity solutions for everyone</a>  



<p>Design</p>



<p>Also during Techweek we’re excited to be showcasing the mahi of Digital Identity NZ members in three spotlight sessions.&nbsp;Each organisation will share a three minute presentation, after which we’ll facilitate a live Q&amp;A.&nbsp;This is a great opportunity to hear more from some very talented and clever teams, and especially to connect and collaborate.&nbsp;The three sessions are:</p>



  9am Tuesday&nbsp;<a href="https://techweek.co.nz/whats-on/2020/digital-identity-nz-techweek-member-showcase-1-980/">28th July</a>  3pm Wednesday&nbsp;<a href="https://techweek.co.nz/whats-on/2020/digital-identity-nz-member-showcase-2-981/">29th July</a>  2pm Thursday&nbsp;<a href="https://techweek.co.nz/whats-on/2020/digital-identity-nz-member-showcase-3-982/">30th July</a>  



<p>There are still a few slots open for DINZ members to participate and present.&nbsp;Please register your interest and date preference&nbsp;<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/8WWSF9H">here</a>.<br><br>Further strengthening the Design element of our work, we are delighted to have signed an MoU with the&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, tapping into their collaborative standards and best practice knowledge banks.&nbsp;You can read more about the agreement&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2020/07/14/digital-identity-media-release/">here</a>.<br><br>Lastly, to warm us up for Techweek, we are excited to be hosting the Digital Identity Transition Programme team for our next Webinar on 23rd July.&nbsp;You can register for that event&nbsp;<a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Xpf_8gDiQL-eXFDLVWzxdQ">here</a>.</p>

<p>Kantara To Share Its Digital Identity Assurance Program Learnings, Schemes, Specifications, Best Practice Guidelines To Support Digital Identity New Zealand’s Mission&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>WAKEFIELD, Mass., USA and WELLINGTON, New Zealand – <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> and Digital Identity New Zealand announced today that they have agreed a Memorandum of Understanding to support the goal of energizing New Zealand’s digital identity ecosystem development, where everyone can prove who they are digitally to organizations in a secure and trusted way.&nbsp; Kantara will share its digital identity assurance program learnings, schemes, specifications and best practice guidelines with DINZ in support of its mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With headquarters in the United States and the European Union, Kantara is the leading global consortium improving trustworthy use of identity and personal data through innovation, standardization and good practice.&nbsp; Kantara has similar collaboration agreements in Canada and Europe as well as being <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/800-63-3/">the only organization providing third party assessment and assurance against the US National Institute of Standards and Technology SP 800-63-3 for identity</a> and authentication.</p>



<p>DINZ is a purpose driven, inclusive, membership funded organization, whose members have a shared passion for the opportunities that digital identity can offer. DINZ supports a sustainable, inclusive and trustworthy digital future for all New Zealanders.</p>



<p>Kantara Executive Director and Native New Zealander Colin Wallis said, “For a decade, Kantara has worked with governments and standards-bodies internationally sharing its assurance program knowledge, schemes, specifications and best practices in the digital identity and privacy space with the goal of building trustworthy networks and ensuring people have agency over their data. We’ve worked hard to align these programs for multi-jurisdictional adoption and believe that Kantara’s global mission and DINZ’s national goals are mutually supportive.&nbsp; We look forward to working together and sharing knowledge, not only to drive forward ecosystem development in New Zealand but also to support improved global interoperability of digital identity. The effort will work hand in hand with the public sector digital identity initiatives – the Department of Internal Affairs in New Zealand, the Digital Transformation Agency in Australia and the US Postal Service – all of whom support the Kantara Initiative.”</p>



<p>Andrew Weaver, Digital Identity New Zealand’s Executive Director, said, “Collaboration is at the heart of our work here at Digital Identity New Zealand. We are excited to be working with the Kantara Initiative, drawing from the depth of wisdom and experience they have built up over the last ten years.&nbsp; In return we hope to share some of our digital identity journey here in Aotearoa/New Zealand with the wider Kantara community.&nbsp; Since our establishment late in 2018 we have been introduced to and explored the concept of ‘Identity as Taonga’, Taonga being a Maori word that describes something precious and treasured, worthy of the highest levels of dignity, care and respect.&nbsp; We look forward to exploring these ideas with other communities around the world, learning together what it means to build truly inclusive and diverse identity ecosystems”&nbsp;</p>



<p>About Kantara Initiative</p>



<p>The Kantara Initiative is the leading global consortium improving trustworthy use of digital identity and personal data through innovation, standardization and good practice. Kantara provides real-world innovation through its development of specifications, applied R&amp;D and operational conformity assessment programs for the digital identity and personal data ecosystems.

 Today, ID2020 announced its newest Alliance partner, the National Cybersecurity Center&nbsp;(NCC). <p>ID2020 was founded in 2016 to ensure that all people have access to better forms of digital ID, bringing together nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>Founded in 2016 by the former Governor of Colorado, John Hickenlooper, the National Cybersecurity Center (NCC) is a Colorado Springs-based nonprofit committed to promoting cyber innovation and awareness.</p><blockquote>“We are delighted to welcome the National Cybersecurity Center to the ID2020 Alliance,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “Because technology is evolving so quickly, many of the transactions that once took place in person and required traditional forms of ID are today being conducted digitally. Cyber threats, whether criminal or state-state sponsored, underscore the urgency and importance of ID2020 and the NCC’s collective efforts. We look forward to sharing our expertise and learning from their world-class team of cybersecurity experts.”</blockquote><p>With a mission to “secure the world”, the NCC has four main initiatives:</p><p>● Secure the Vote seeks to increase voter confidence in the U.S. on the accuracy of vote-counting, and to generate greater awareness of possible solutions to critical gaps in the voting infrastructure. Secure the Vote supports jurisdictions’ efforts to offer a secure, auditable mobile voting option for overseas voters through coordinating, and evaluating pilots across the&nbsp;country.</p><p>● Secure Smart Cities: Hyper-connectivity amongst smart devices and urbanization drive the need for cities to become more efficient in their operations as they continue to grow, but the concern of security impedes the overall advancement of several cities with “Smart”&nbsp;agendas.</p><p>● The NCC’s Cyber Education Program provides cybersecurity leadership, and one of the main pillars is K-12 education. As our nation addresses the critical gap in skilled cybersecurity talent, NCC addresses the importance of cyber education through programs and partnerships that invite students to participate in an ecosystem that encourages them to learn, explore, and build their&nbsp;skills.</p><p>○ The NCC’s K-12 initiative, the National Cybersecurity Center Student Alliance (NCCSA) offers opportunities for middle and high school students to improve technical literacy through fun, interactive, and challenging camps, field trips, workshops, and events. NCC encourages STEM education for all students, with special attention towards creating inviting and collaborative opportunities for girls and other underrepresented groups in the cyber ecosystem.</p><p>● The Space Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), a separate nonprofit organization, has the mission to facilitate collaboration across the global space industry to enhance our ability to prepare for and respond to vulnerabilities, incidents, and threats; to disseminate timely and actionable information among member entities; and to serve as the primary communications channel for the sector with respect to this information.</p><blockquote>“Digital citizenship is an increasingly critical space as more of our identity is online,” said NCC Director of Business and Government Initiatives, Forrest Senti. “The NCC’s work to secure cyberspace intersects directly with ID2020’s work to protect individuals’ online identity and to ensure that policies created around that protection are fair and equitable and ensure the utmost security for citizens around the world. We look forward to working with ID2020 to pioneer new ways to secure the future of identity.”</blockquote><p>The future of digital ID is at an important crossroads. As policymakers in the US and around the world struggle to confront the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, some are considering plans for digital identity-based health credentials to facilitate a return to work, school, and other social activities. The risks to privacy and security are high, as are the rewards of doing it right. ID2020 is working urgently with its partners and other stakeholders to ensure that privacy and data security are built into the technical architecture of these systems and that the appropriate legislative and regulatory are developed to guide their implementation.</p><p>ID2020 and the National Cybersecurity Center share a common mission to secure our individual and collective privacy and security. We welcome them to the Alliance and look forward to working collaboratively to advance our shared&nbsp;goals.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions. By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p><a href="http://www.ID2020.org">www.ID2020.org</a></p><p>About National Cybersecurity Center</p><p>Established in 2016, The National Cybersecurity Center exists to help secure the world using knowledge, connections, and resources to solve global cybersecurity challenges and develop a protected cyber ecosystem. An independent and non-profit think tank based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the NCC provides cyber innovation and awareness and is a leader in cyber education, workforce development, and informing public&nbsp;policy.</p><p><a href="http://www.cyber-center.org">www.cyber-center.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-welcomes-the-national-cybersecurity-center-to-the-alliance-a8af0261e69f">ID2020 Welcomes the National Cybersecurity Center to the Alliance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The FIDO Alliance has launched a new microsite, LoginWithFIDO.com, for high level, non-technical information about FIDO for consumers and service providers. As part of this project, we wanted to learn more about consumer attitudes and habits around authentication. What are their password habits? What do they think about the FIDO approach? Do they want to see FIDO at login?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To find out, we conducted a survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers – the results of which we’ll be sharing on this webinar. Join us to see the findings from our research and to learn how you may be able to utilize the data for your own FIDO offerings and/or deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join this webinar to hear:&nbsp;</p>



  How many different passwords consumers really use for their online accounts  What tactics they use for password management and how often they are resetting passwords and&nbsp;  Their familiarity with various types of authentication technologies including SMS OTPs, biometrics and others  The types of apps and services where consumers most want to use FIDO  How consumers want to be communicated with about FIDO at enrollment and login  



<p>We will also give the audience a detailed look at LoginWithFIDO.com and how you can consider using it for your own educational initiatives around FIDO. You’ll learn:</p>



  How to navigate through the microsite and its two landing pages  How you can reference the site and its materials for your own offerings and deployments  Added insights into how to utilize FIDO’s consumer-facing marks

<p>Google and Facebook’s dominance of the digital ad market is worrisome. The MadHATTERs Editorial, 8 July&nbsp;2020</p><p>MadHATTERs Weekly<br>Like what you read? <a href="http://eepurl.com/den42v?source=post_page---------------------------">Subscribe here</a>.</p><p>Google and Facebook are too powerful in the digital ad market, so the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/01/ministers-urged-to-limit-facebook-and-google-power-over-uk-ad-market">wants to force competition</a>. Make personalised ads optional on Facebook, make Google share its search engine usage data with rivals, it says. And stop the big platforms <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-regime-needed-to-take-on-tech-giants">exploiting privacy regulation like the GDPR to favour their business models</a>. <br> <br>Google and Facebook earned around 80% of the £14 billion spent on UK digital advertising last year. But their market dominance is also evident in their actions. Like how Google <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-google-focus/google-stymies-media-companies-from-chipping-away-at-its-data-dominance-idUSKBN24110K">threatened to cut off European publishers from lucrative ads </a>if they curbed the search engine’s data collection. Or Mark Zuckerberg’s confidence that the Facebook-boycotting advertisers — reportedly more than 600 brands now — will <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53262860">all be back soon enough</a>. The sense is that the ‘unparalleled’ advertising reach these internet giants offer make them indispensable. Even US presidential candidate Joe Biden still advertises on Facebook despite his many grievances with it, ‘cos his campaign <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/01/politics/biden-ads-facebook-boycott/index.html?">‘cannot afford to cede these platforms’</a> to the incumbent president. This level of market power is worrisome.<br> <br>The CMA’s calling for a new <a href="https://www.cbronline.com/news/cma-report-google-facebook">‘pro-competition regulatory regime’</a> to challenge this dominance. This, along with the ‘highly intrusive interventions’ it has recommended, couldn’t be more timely. Spending on digital ads will overtake traditional media this year to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d8aaf886-d1f0-40fb-abff-2945629b68c0?">account for more than half of the USD530 billion global ad industry</a>. Great, if this also benefits the consumer with better innovation and choice and control over their data. Something that more — and much overdue — competition can help&nbsp;achieve.</p><p>MadHATTERs is a weekly newsletter covering technology, personal data, and the Internet.

<p>Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CMO, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>At its WWDC, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10670/">detailed</a> that its upcoming release of Safari in iOS and MacOS 14 will enable users to use Touch ID and Face ID for web logins, and we couldn’t be happier. It marks a giant step forward in the industry’s quest to move beyond passwords in favor of cryptographically secure authentication based on FIDO standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The functionality, based on the WebAuthn API in the FIDO2 standard, will make logging in to a website as easy as it is to unlock your iPhone or iPad using whichever biometric option is available. Apple’s built-in support in its stock web browser means that every modern device platform now has built-in FIDO support, which furthers our aim of making FIDO Authentication as ubiquitous as other critical internet protocols.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To that end, we’ve recently provided a resource that shows the latest progress for FIDO support across browsers and platforms.&nbsp; This image (shown below) is permanently hosted on our <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">WebAuthn resources page</a>.&nbsp;</p>







<p>It’s been really cool to watch this diagram grow both wider&nbsp; (adding in the Apple operating systems) and greener over the past 12 months or so since Apple ramped up its FIDO support. This rapid maturation and support for WebAuthn is accelerating adoption; with over 85 percent of today’s browsers now supporting FIDO Authentication, many service providers are now actively working to deploy FIDO to their customers worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance was founded on a singular mission: To eliminate dependence on passwords by creating and driving adoption of open standards for simpler, stronger user authentication. Today, we’re closer to reaching that audacious goal that the FIDO ecosystem has been working on for the past several years. Thanks, Apple!</p>

 Becca Savory, Sarah McKeever &amp; Shaunak&nbsp;Sen  Session <p>Since its early days the Internet has been conceived in terms of both movement and landscape — from “cyberspace” to the “Information Superhighway” — and in popular perception is often viewed as a boundless space imagined in terms of limitless possibilities. Indeed, across our research fields, from digital media to performance and social activism, we find that the Internet is frequently perceived as a space of mobilisation: where moving bodies are remediated within online content; where the movement of images, ideas and bodies can occur freely, with the rapid transmission of the “viral”; and where movement(s) frequently spill over into physical geographies.</p><p>Yet increasingly the Internet is also a space of fractured and fragmented movement(s): of blockages and blockades, discontinuities and disappearances. Landscapes become territorialized and movement(s) confined or obstructed. On this basis, we propose an interdisciplinary discussion session around the theme of “#InternetMovement(s)”. We ask how we can conceive of movement(s) in relation to the Internet in India, in terms of both mobility and immobility, fissure and&nbsp;flow.</p><p>To encourage fluidity, we propose to structure the session around three “nodes” rather than three separate research papers. Our nodes are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  How can we conceive of movement(s) in relation to Internet research in&nbsp;India?  What are the forms that movement(s) take in our respective fields?  What “stop” or blocks” movement in these&nbsp;cases?  <p>The three co-conveners will each prepare a 5-minute response to each of these nodes, based on our specific areas of research. At each nodal point we will then allow time for wider discussion, enabling inter-disciplinary discussion and flow to underpin the&nbsp;session.</p><p>We perceive the session to speak to the first of the conference’s core questions: “How do we conceptualise, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India?”</p><p>Each of the three co-convenors is approaching this question in their own research, asking how online media and communications mediate, remediate and transform the fields of film-media, social activism, and performance. We also ask the corollary: what are the limits and impediments to those transformations or mediations? The following section outlines the co-convenors’ approaches in more&nbsp;detail.</p> Plan  Statement of Intent&nbsp;I <p>The internet increasingly impresses traces on nearly all media technologies everyday. The once stable film body, gets disaggregated into various new forms of loop videos, GIFS, photo-memes, as clips and stills from disparate films get extracted, re-edited, patched and re-moulded into new user-generated media material. Solitary moments and gestures from films (a menacing wink by Jack Nicholson from The Shining, a clap from Charles Kane, a tear from the Tin-Man in The Wizard of Oz) get completely unchained from the original narrative context and used as discrete independent communicative units (Kane’s a popular Birthday wish gesture, while Nicholson’s Is a common linguistic unit signifying playful flirtation.) One of the primary ontological pegs of cinema — movement, today becomes the center of urgent debate around the status of photographs, movement-image forms like GIFs, and traditional moving images as the basic configuring elements of contemporary cinema. Using the film-GIF form as its primary vector this paper opens up the category of ‘movement’ philosophically as well as a constituent form to understand cinema today within the context of&nbsp;India.</p><p>As the cinematic object disperses into thousands of fragments hurtling through innumerable new online contexts, questions related to stardom also get radically transformed. I will be investigating a particular site of cinematic re-instansiation — the recent Alok Nath meme phenomenon. Long relegated to the margins of films as the venerable Hindu middle class father, the ‘’Alok Nath is so sanskaari..’’ set off a viral maelstrom that suddenly recast his cinematic body and the memory of a whole host of films (the Suraj Barjatya Hindu joint-family films). The paper focus on questions around movement as a philosophical arena as well as radical new form re-inscribing the cinematic in hitherto unprecedented shapes&nbsp;today.</p> Statement of Intent&nbsp;II <p>An examination of social movements with digital components in India begs several questions: What forms do social movements take in the digital world? How do we conceptualise social movements using digital and physical evidence? How does the context of India — as a functioning democracy — allow or restrict digital and physical social movements and define what is an “acceptable” protest movement? Engaging with these questions demands an interdisciplinary perspective, and exploring the interplays between the physical and the digital in regard to social issue protest movements.</p><p>Movement in my particular research area is understood in two aspects: the physical mobilisation of individuals to protest against perceived grievances and the movement of information around specific issue areas. The physical movement of bodies in public places is intimately connected to flow of information throughout digital networks, generating entangled and complex interfaces between the digital and the physical and creating new imagined possibilities of the efficacy of social protest (Castells 2012; Gerbaudo 2012). Examining recent social movements in New Delhi allows us to explore the linkages and disjuncture between the physical and digital, using theoretical developments in social movement theory to anchor the study (Earl, Hunt, and Garrett 2014; Krinsky and Crossley&nbsp;2014).</p><p>Examining the repercussions and strategies of physical/digital mobilisation can lead to a confrontation between the “imagined” possibilities of digital mobilisation and the realities of technological and physical blockages. These blockages can exist at the level of the network — both in digital and physical limitations — but also at the level of digital informational flow and who is allowed to view data? Confronting the “imagined” capabilities with the reality of entrenched power networks contests the notion of the digital as a free superhighway of information into a series of blocks and stoppages, restricting what is possible and feasible. By exploring question of movement(s) in New Delhi, I will explore the disjuncture between the imagined possibilities and the restriction of information — by nature of the algorithms that govern our capabilities and our own social networks — and complicate the triumphal narrative of the affordances of digital mediums on protest movements.</p><p>References</p><p>Castells, M.

Pgs.&nbsp;1–21</p><p>Statement of Intent&nbsp;III</p><p>My research centres on the recent history of flash mob performance in India and analyses the transformations that have taken place within the genre: firstly, as an initially American, then “global,” performance form becomes re-situated and adapted within an Indian context; and secondly, as the form has evolved over time in relation to the transitioning of the Internet from a predominantly text-based medium to a predominantly image- and video-based one (see Strangelove 2010).</p><p>In the field of flash mob performance, we see moving bodies becoming re-mediated as moving images, and mobilised into the flow of global circuits of online reception. My underlying concern when approaching this research is: who is mobile in these contexts? Who becomes visible through movement, and by extension, who may disappear in these same&nbsp;moments?</p><p>I intend to approach this session by examining what is enacted through the movements of flash mob performance, focusing on the more recent phase of the genre in which flash mobs become mobilised through online video-sharing practices. I argue that they perform mediated representations of “New India” for an online national and international audience, valorising the new “non-places” (Augé 1992) of Indian supermodernity, through the acts of a mobilised “digerati” (Keniston 2004). If we consider that performance can play a role in the construction of cultural memory (Roach 1996; Taylor 2003), and that the Internet as an archive can become a repository of performances and thus memories(Gehl 2009), I ask if online performance in these contexts may be seen as an aspect of the processes that structure a “politics of forgetting” (Fernandes 2006) in globalising India. Which narratives are rendered visible and which invisible through these performances? Who appears and who disappears? Movement on the Internet thus becomes a political question concerned with comparative mobilities, visibilities, and participation in the narratives of “India” that are constructed for global circulation.</p><p>References</p><p>Augé, M., 1992.

<p>Banks in Europe have deployed customer authentication solutions for several years. These solutions have served their purpose well and enabled customers to safely log in to their bank accounts. In the world of e-commerce, these solutions, when used, have been successful in combating online payment fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and its associated Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) dramatically change the payment landscape, considering:</p>



  The mandate for strong, multi-factor authentication,&nbsp;  The emergence of Third Party Providers (TPP) accessing accounts via open APIs  



<p>The success of PSD2 will ultimately be determined by how well banks can balance user convenience with security obligations, while maximizing reach. As such, they may want to evaluate how well their legacy authentication solutions meet this new need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO authentication standards have been proposed as a way for banks to meet all requirements in a PSD2 world — but is the change from a legacy method to FIDO worthwhile?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join this webinar to learn more about FIDO Authentication standards and how they compare with legacy authentication methods used to access an account or secure an online payment. The methods compared are SMS OTPs, hardware OTP generators, CAP readers, and proprietary smartphone and biometrics-based solutions in terms of PSD2 compliance, security, usability and scalability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pressure continues to build on how digital platforms handle content. The MadHATTERs Editorial, 1 July&nbsp;2020</p><p>MadHATTERs Weekly<br>Like what you read? <a href="http://eepurl.com/den42v?source=post_page---------------------------">Subscribe here</a>.</p><p>Time to get tough with the ‘pandemic of misinformation’ that’s corroding democracy. So says the UK Parliament’s Democracy and Digital Technologies committee as it calls for stronger regulation, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-ministers-digital-age-report-uk-democracy-a9590121.html">including penalties of up to 4% of tech giants’ global turnover</a>, to reign in the ‘unchecked power’ of digital platforms. <br> <br>The committee’s report, which also recommends regulating political advertising, is the latest tightening of screws on social media’s content moderation practices. In recent weeks the US Senate has seen a flurry of bills looking to reform the Communications Decency Act’s Section 230, which protects these platforms from legal liability over third-party content. For instance, the bipartisan PACT Act introduced last week will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302170/facebook-google-brian-schatz-john-thune-section-230-content-moderation">open them up to federal civil lawsuits and state enforcement</a>. <br> <br>Those seeking more immediate results have turned to the power of the advertising dollar. The <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/?">ad-boycott campaign</a> to protest Facebook’s handling of misinformation and hate speech <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/27/the-facebook-ad-boycotts-have-entered-the-big-leagues-now-what.html?">gained momentum last week</a> as big names like Verizon and Unilever halted their social media advertising. Last Friday, without referencing the boycotts — nor the resulting <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-worth-craters-coca-cola-boycott-ads-2020-6?r=US&amp;IR=T">plunge in Facebook’s share price</a> — Mark Zuckerberg announced some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/as-advertisers-revolt-facebook-commits-to-flagging-newsworthy-political-speech-that-violates-policy/?">new measures to tackle misinformation</a>. <br> <br>But waiting for new laws or public pressure on platforms to govern a centralised Internet are not the only ways towards a better Internet.

 Shared vision and combined resources extend both organizations’ ability to advance open source through standards 



<p>Palo Alto, CA, USA, 30 June 2020 —&nbsp;The <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative®</a>&nbsp;(OSI), the internationally recognized steward of the Open Source Definition and open source licenses, is excited to announce the Affiliate Membership of OASIS Open, a global nonprofit consortium managing a broad technical agenda encompassing cybersecurity, blockchain, privacy, cryptography, cloud computing, IoT, urban mobility, emergency management, and other content technologies.</p>



<blockquote><p>“OASIS Open and OSI have been informal collaborators on licensing and other topics from the early days of the OpenDocument Format to our recent Open Projects Program,” noted Guy Martin, Executive Director of OASIS Open. “We are delighted to formalize our relationship as a sign of our mutual commitment to expanding the role of open source in the standards definition process and look forward to an exciting future for this combined open ecosystem.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Founded in 1993, the OASIS Open community is committed to advancing work that lowers cost, improves efficiency, stimulates innovation, grows global markets, and promotes interoperability. Each project operates independently under OASIS’s industry-leading process and clear Intellectual Property Rights.<br><br>Begun in 2019, the OASIS Open Projects program provides open source communities with foundation-level support—for governance, intellectual property (IP) management, collaboration tools, outreach and events—with an optional path to standardization and de jure approval for reference in international policy and procurement. Open Projects lets communities choose from seven currently-supported, OSI-approved licenses.<br><br>OASIS Open and OSI have been consultative partners helping shape open source and open standards work in many technology domains, including ensuring that OASIS Open programs satisfy the criteria defined by OSI’s Open Standards Requirements (OSR), which mandates standards must not prohibit conforming implementations in open source software. OASIS Open also enjoys productive liaison and peer relationships with several of OSI’s other Affiliate Members.<br></p>



<blockquote><p>“OASIS Open has been the most important pioneer of approaches to bridging the gap between open standards and open source, and we are excited to have a new basis on which to collaborate going forward,” said Pam Chestek, OSI Board Director and Chair, OSI Standards Committee.</p></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>The OSI Affiliate Member Program allows non-profit organizations—unequivocally independent groups with a commitment to open source—to join the OSI in support of our work to promote and protect open source software. As the steward of the Open Source Definition certifying Open Source Software Licenses, by establishing such certification as the standard for open source software development and distribution, and with the support of our Affiliate Membership, the OSI has become a cornerstone of software freedom.</p>



 About OASIS Open 



<p>One of the most respected, member-driven standards bodies in the world, OASIS Open offers projects—including open source projects—a path to standardization and de jure approval for reference in international policy and procurement. Their members include major multinational companies, SMEs, government agencies, universities, research institutions, consulting groups, and individuals are represented. Please see&nbsp;<a href="https://oasis-open-projects.org/">https://oasis-open-projects.org</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>



 About The Open Source Initiative 



<p>Founded in 1998, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) protects and promotes open source software, development and communities, championing software freedom in society through education, collaboration, and infrastructure, stewarding the Open Source Definition, and preventing abuse of the ideals and ethos inherent to the open source movement. The OSI is a public charity with global vision based in California. For more information about the OSI, please see&nbsp;<a href="https://opensource.org/">https://opensource.org</a>.</p>

<p>The global movement in support of “good ID” advanced another step today as ID2020 announced ZAKA as its third “certified” digital ID solution.</p><p>Most of us take the ability to prove our identity for granted. But for one in seven people globally, the lack of a widely recognized form of ID means being unable to access basic legal protections and social services and being unable to participate fully as citizens and voters. Worldwide, more than one billion people are systematically excluded from the modern economy because they lack any form of formal&nbsp;ID.</p><p>In 2019, ID2020 announced plans to launch the first certification mark for digital ID at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The<a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-launches-technical-certification-mark-e6743d3f70fd"> Certification </a>recognizes solutions that adhere to ID2020’s stringent standards for user-management, privacy-protection, portability, and interoperability and offers technology companies a roadmap for the development of ethical, inclusive digital&nbsp;ID.</p><p>To be eligible for certification, applicants must adhere to 41 functional, outcomes-based<a href="https://id2020.org/uploads/files/Technical-Requirements.pdf"> Technical Requirements</a>. To date, 29 technology providers from every corner of the globe have submitted applications and worked with our staff and advisory committees to complete the process. In March, ID2020 announced its first two certified solutions, Kiva Protocol and Gravity. Today, ZAKA joins this esteemed community of technology providers.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust digital ID technology into the headlines as countries around the world consider plans for digital health credentials and technology-assisted contact tracing. There has never been more urgency to “get the technology right”.</p><blockquote>“Digital ID can be a powerful force multiplier for global social and economic development, but it can also be used to exclude people or even persecute vulnerable populations like refugees, children, and the homeless,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “As governments and businesses rush to adopt digital ID solutions, the ID2020 Certification is proving a valuable tool for those who are developing user-centric, privacy-protecting solutions to meet the needs of all&nbsp;people.”</blockquote><p>The Certification also provides a third-part seal of approval so that those implementing and using these technologies know that they were developed according to the highest ethical and technical standards and with full consideration of both the benefits and&nbsp;risks.</p><p>This market-based approach is already shifting the technical landscape and several multinational technology providers have adapted their technical approaches to comply with ID2020’s Technical Requirements.</p><p>About ZAKA</p><p>Based in the UK, ZAKA is committed to the idea that any person, with any phone, should be able to access any service, at any time. Like ID2020, ZAKA shares the perspective that, in an increasingly connected world, digital trust is an essential enabler of thriving economies.</p><p>ZAKA’s mobile app and software development kit (available in Android, iOS and USSD) helps individuals to build a set of verifiable digital credentials that are private, secure and portable, allowing them to connect with services such as mobile health, financial services, and education. And for service providers, ZAKA’s web dashboard allows them to configure their digital trust requirements and roll-out the solution to remotely verify and onboard customers. This allows services to concentrate on developing and distributing high-quality services, rather than be held back by high distribution and customer acquisition costs. ZAKA has also developed proprietary voice biometric technology which can be deployed together with, or separately from, it’s&nbsp;Apps.</p><p>In recent months, ZAKA has also extended its solution to support the response to, and recovery from, COVID-19. Their NewNorm™️ service is now being used by universities, employers, and event organizers to support a safe return to the “new&nbsp;normal”.</p><blockquote>“We are delighted to receive the ID2020 Certification,” said ZAKA CEO and Co-Founder Nick Mason. “We expect a great return on our investment of time and resources in this process and look forward to using the ID2020 certification to set ZAKA apart from our competition. The rigorous evaluation of our company by ID2020 should give prospective partners confidence that our solution is meeting global standards and advancing the vital mission of bringing “good ID” to&nbsp;all.”</blockquote><p>ZAKA is already implementing their its technology in Turkey, Rwanda, and the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>In partnership with the United Nations Development Program and led by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ZAKA is helping refugees obtain verifiable digital ID credentials that are portable and owned by them. Refugees can use these credentials to connect with services in a dedicated marketplace for services that support their self-sufficiency. Through the app, refugees can also receive promotional information from their chosen services about beneficial opportunities.</p><p>In Rwanda, ZAKA is working in partnership with the utility regulator, Airtel, and other private and public partners to implement a solution that leverages voice biometrics for remote customer verification. This can be used by banks, telcos, and healthcare providers to serve rural customers, whether they own a smartphone or feature&nbsp;phone.</p><p>Here in the United States, ZAKA’s COVID-19 status tracking solution, NewNorm™️, is helping employees and customers be safe in the “new normal”. This is being used by two New York University departments that have returned students, staff, and faculty to on-site instruction.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>Based in San Francisco, ID2020 harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of responsibly implemented, user-managed, privacy-protected, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>Through its advocacy, project funding, technical support, and now by certifying best-in-class identity solutions, ID2020 is helping build the infrastructure needed to strengthen social and economic development and ensure that all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-announces-certification-of-zaka-group-ltd-de019220362d">ID2020 Announces Certification of ZAKA Group Ltd.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Digital Identity to help reduce fraud for credit unions and members&nbsp;</p>
<p>June XX,&nbsp;2020 (DENVER, Colo.) –&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://mwcua.com/">Mountain West Credit Union Association</a>&nbsp;(MWCUA) has finalized a strategic partnership agreement with&nbsp;CULedger to help jump-start the implementation of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass</a>, a digital&nbsp;ID&nbsp;held by credit union members. MWCUA will help secure credit unions to participate in the Digital Trust Registry, the registration component of the program. MWCUA currently has 123 credit unions, 3.8 million members and $51 billion in assets in three states, Colorado, Arizona, and Wyoming. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In MemberPass, credit unions have a turnkey, affordable digital identity solution that will safeguard members’ personal information and provide a touch-free member experience across all channels.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is a simple and secure replacement for identity verification questions, like the member’s birthday or social security number, making members’ experience convenient and stress-free.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also presents an opportunity for your credit union to reduce identity theft by giving control and ownership of personal data back in the hands of your members allowing them the right to share information, how, and where they choose. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“MemberPass,&nbsp;from&nbsp;CULedger, creates for credit unions a contactless and secure environment that members now need and want in the face of the pandemic and other challenges,” said Scott Earl, President, and CEO of the Mountain West Credit Union Association. “We are thrilled to help bring this incredibly valuable solution that provides a secure digital ID to members and protects credit unions from fraud to market.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Digital Trust Registry allows credit unions access to MemberPass technology. Credit unions receive their own public digital ID that is written to the Sovrin&nbsp;Global Identity Network (www.sovrin.org).&nbsp;Sovrin&nbsp;is a global distributed ledger (or blockchain) designed exclusively to support digital trust networks and verifiable digital credentials, which is why&nbsp;Sovrin&nbsp;is&nbsp;CULedger’s&nbsp;partner in building the MemberPass Trust Network. Once registered with the Digital Trust Registry, credit unions can issue MemberPass credentials to their members, and the enhanced security and privacy elements are activated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MWCUA will join other partners in engaging credit unions in joining the Digital Trust Registry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unique privacy-first design creates a competitive advantage for credit unions by allowing members to have one single digital credential that is both portable and interoperable.&nbsp;CULedger’s&nbsp;long-term goal is to enable members to use their MemberPass identification to verify who they are with other highly regulated institutions, including in government and healthcare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Last April, the FIDO Korea Working Group announced our initiative to distribute FIDO Security Keys to Korean citizens to help better secure their identities, data and systems while working remotely due to the Coronavirus outbreak. We were able to do this thanks to FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group Deployment &amp; Marketing Sub-Group’s efforts and in-kind sponsorship by FIDO Security Key vendors like TrustKey (previously known as eWBM), AirCuve (Yubico’s local partner) and Octatco. Today, we are happy to share the results of this initiative, which ended with positive impacts and pleasant surprises.&nbsp;</p>



[Screen capture of campaign task force team member online meeting]



<p>In short, the outcome can be summarized as following:</p>



  The campaign was covered by 15+ local online media, spreading positive awareness of FIDO Authentication  We reached out to 52 organizations and individuals exposed to greater cyber risk by working at home and distributed 156 FIDO Security Keys  70% of them were new relationships that we had not previously had through previous on/offline events (e.g. hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare centers, patent offices, online game developers, ecommerce owners, retail shop owners, architects, hospitality industries, financial institutes, financial investors, school teachers, semiconductor industries, sports video analyst, advertisement agency, etc.)  25% of them had potential to be business partners or relying parties  



[Pictures of task force team members preparing the packages to be shipped out]



<p>Here are some remarks by recipients of free FIDO Security Keys who agreed to disclose their identities:</p>



<p>“We are a group of 5 university hospitals working together on a suicide prevention project.&nbsp; Securing personal and medical information of these patients are very important, especially when we are working remotely.&nbsp; We hope to try out the FIDO Security Key through this giveaway campaign and find out how to adopt it into our database protection system.” – Mr. Dohyun Kwon, Seoul National University Hospital</p>



<p>“It is a shame but we have been writing passwords on a wall thus far, so we do not have to ask each other when logging into shared computers.&nbsp; It is scary that these passwords can be exposed to others with bad intentions.&nbsp; We have a great hope that FIDO Security Keys would eliminate these worries and even enable architects to work at home while feeling secured and safe.” – Mr. Taehoon Hur, Ruha Architectural Design Firm</p>



<p>“I operate over 10 healthcare and fitness centers in Seoul and always felt uncomfortable about having all these members’ personal information sitting on our computer where any staff with passwords can access it , not to mention some staff with such privileges kept on forgetting these long and hard-to-remember passwords.&nbsp; It would be interesting experiments for us to test out these FIDO Security Keys in practice.” – Ms. Jaehee Yoon, STAR Health Care and Fitness</p>



<p>“We are food product wholesalers mainly doing businesses online.&nbsp; Due to the Coronavirus outbreak, we would have to have our staff work at home with much of our purchasing and customer information in their laptops.&nbsp; Hope our staff would not have to expose the passwords by using these FIDO Security Keys.&nbsp;Thank you!” – Mr. Hoyoon Jung, NongGa Food Products</p>



<p>“WIPS is the number one patent database related services and consulting firm in Korea.&nbsp; We are used to working under Bring Your Own Device environment but have struggled managing passwords.&nbsp; Happy to take part in this experiment program and hope to see positive results.” – Mr. Taewoo Kwon, WIPS</p>







<p>Once again, we truly appreciate the undivided attention and efforts given by all FKWG members on this campaign, and especially recognize TTA (Telecommunications Technology Association) and Dr. Heung Youl Youm, for their extra efforts in the early stage of ideation and promotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Dr. Stephen Oh, the Co-Leader of FKWG Deployment &amp; Marketing Sub-Group said, “It was an amazing experience not just because we have learned a lot from the market where we could not usually reach through conventional approaches, but also it only took less than a month from ideation to full execution.”</p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Editor’s note: For background on the 2020 Hackathon in Korea, see the April blog post: “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-hackathon-goodbye-password-challenge-in-korea/">2020 FIDO Hackathon: Goodbye Password Challenge in Korea</a>.”</p>



<p>These are the faces of 2020 FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge participants, captured during online interviews which took place in the first two weeks of May.</p>







<p>A little over 40 applications were received by the end of proposal submission deadline, and 25 teams were given the opportunity to have online interviews, which helped them to crystalize their ideas and understand the full details of the Goodbye Password Challenge Program. About 100 people from 22 teams are now at the Learn and Implement Phase, which is being delivered through a specialized designated online communication platform.</p>



<p>We will not be sharing full details of the participating teams until they reach the final evaluation date the first week of August, but we would like to share some examples of proposed development ideas:</p>



Type of TeamDevelopment IdeasVentureThe specialists from 5 university hospitals got together on a suicide prevention project.&nbsp; They are going to develop an application that would enable sharing of patients’ personal and medical information, with FIDO implemented as a means for strong and simpler authentication.&nbsp; The unique aspect about this team is that the leader of the team got to know about the FIDO Hackathon after receiving free FIDO Security Keys, which FKWG supported for those who were recently forced to work at home due to public health issues.StudentsFour students from different universities got together and aim to develop a FIDO protocol-based smart home environment.&nbsp; They plan to come up with a miniature model which can demonstrate control of home temperature, curtains, windows, appliances, etc. The leader of the team did participate in the 2019 FIDO Hackathon, yet was not able to reach the top 3. This year, he aims to reach the top 5.Study GroupFour experts (entrepreneur, engineers, healthcare specialist) are aiming to develop a FIDO + DID-based electronic healthcare card system. There are reports of fraud use in local healthcare card systems, and the team wishes to eliminate it by implementing a FIDO protocol based biometric authentication system.StudentsFour university students work at their school’s IT helpdesk and they want to change how they work through developing a new application. As of today, they receive a phone call requesting a repair or replacement, and write down the log on paper.&nbsp; They plan to develop an application that can not only manage these helpdesk support requests but also verify the caller’s identity.StudentsTwo teams submitted similar ideas on developing innovative door locks by implementing a FIDO authentication system. Most current smart door locks in Korea are password-based and cause lots of trouble because they are easy to forget, vulnerable to exposure, etc. It is also noted by these students that currently fingerprint smart door locks in Korea share the secrets to servers, which raises high risk for hacking. It would be quite interesting how these two teams would be able to differentiate themselves with final results.StudentsThree university students have an idea to develop an innovative voting system by implementing FIDO protocols. They hope this novel voting system will lower costs, bring up voting rates and verify actual voters in a speedy manner.StudentsThese two university students are high school alumni and they have been working on various projects in the past. For 2020 FIDO Hackathon, they proposed an idea to manage different levels of security zones by implementing various levels of FIDO authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;Study GroupFive experts (university student, engineers, high school student) are committed to developing a FIDO protocol based Single Sign On System (SSO).&nbsp; They claim that they can differentiate themselves from existing SSOs, so let’s see how things unfold. This is the only team with a high school student.StudentsSix university students have an idea to prevent minors from purchasing alcohol and tobacco by developing a FIDO protocol based application. The local government is pushing the Mobile ID system, thus this would be an interesting proof of concept.StudentsTwo students from two different universities have an idea to develop a Blockchain + FIDO based online ticket purchase application, so they can eliminate black-market activities.StudentsFour students from the same university have an idea to develop a FIDO-based kiosk that can provide school documents for students. The school they attend already has such a kiosk that can print out their records but the system requests too much personal information and they are based on IDs and passwords.



<p>On July 1, we will have the mid-term meet-up event to share each team’s current development status and plans for the rest of the implementation phase.</p>



<p>Please stay tuned and we will come back with more updates on 2020 FIDO Hackathon in Korea.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Identity is an explicit target in the UN’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/peace-justice/">Sustainable Development Goals</a>&nbsp;(Target 16.9: By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration).&nbsp;Exclusion for people means ‘depriving them of a proof of legal identity crucial for the protection of their rights and for access to justice and social services’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what does this mean for us in Aotearoa, and how does it relate to digital identity?&nbsp;As businesses, government departments, community groups and charities increase their reliance on digital services (and in particular the acceleration of digital transformation triggered by COVID-19), it is more important than ever to recognise how easy it is to exclude those already marginalised by ‘designing for the 80%’.&nbsp;As more and more of our interactions are online, how do we protect the rights and access to justice and social services for those who are unable, or perhaps reluctant to use the digital services&nbsp;we offer?</p>



<p>As the events of the past weeks have highlighted, society is recognising more and more that systemic racism, disempowerment and marginalisation is an insidious force that we cannot with good conscience ignore or sideline.</p>



<p>This is a complex and multifaceted issue, and is one that must be approached with empathy and a relentless commitment to understand and address the barriers that exist; be they access to internet and technology, trust and transparency, bias and laziness in design, or education and support.&nbsp;How do we restore and enhance mana for people and communities?</p>



<p>This is where Diversity is such a powerful force.&nbsp;A homogeneous product design/UX/app development team is not well equipped to design for the challenges of the vision impaired, or the dyslexic, or the person of colour who is poorly serviced by facial recognition technology, or for the strong family-based groups who may identify as a community as much as they do as an individual.&nbsp;So how can we welcome more diversity in our teams, and what steps do we need to take to diversify our education and recruitment ‘pipelines’?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our next webinar is designed to explore the challenges and opportunities of both inclusion and diversity in technology, and the role identity plays in that.&nbsp;We are delighted and excited to be co-hosting the launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/launching-women-in-identity-in-new-zealand-and-australia-hosted-by-dinz/">Women in Identity in Aotearoa and Australia</a>, and to meet the four incredible ambassadors in our region.&nbsp;Women in Identity beautifully articulate the power and potential of diversity in their motto ‘Digital identity solutions built for everyone are built by everyone’.&nbsp;Following the introductions we have a panel of experts talking through some of the challenges of Inclusivity in Aotearoa, and exploring the tangible steps we can take to ensure we are making a positive impact and not further widening the digital divide.</p>



<p><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/launching-women-in-identity-in-new-zealand-and-australia-hosted-by-dinz/">Join us</a>&nbsp;on Thursday 25th June for this important discussion.</p>

Research has proven that facial recognition systems <a href="http://gendershades.org/overview.html">misidentify women and people of colour</a>, highlighting AI’s human bias and prompting activists to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/15/20965325/facial-recognition-ban-congress-activism">fight for a ban</a>. The EU even considered a five-year moratorium on its use in public spaces (read <a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things/face-off-recognition-e7ebe1439417">MadHATTERs’ editorial</a> on this). The US has talked a lot about federal legislation to keep surveillance software in check, something that’s been <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90516450/ibm-microsoft-and-amazons-face-recognition-bans-dont-go-far-enough">resisted by the very same companies</a> now calling for stronger regulations to ensure facial recognition tech is used ethically.<br> <br>It’s tempting to see this U-turn as the tech industry’s big awakening to the dangers of facial recognition. Cynics however view Amazon and Microsoft’s one-year ban as <a href="https://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/620576816951918592/amazon-and-microsoft-facial-recognition">a PR stunt</a> and their calls for better laws as Big Tech wanting <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/13/tech/facial-recognition-policy/index.html?">a hand in how the legislation will be drawn up</a>, to protect their own financial turfs. <br> <br>But the careful handling of what’s been termed <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3313129">the plutonium of AI</a> goes beyond virtue signalling. It requires clear regulations and strong enforcement measures, but also governments as well as all firms involved in facial recognition, not just the big guns, to <a href="https://medium.com/@Joy.Buolamwini/ibm-leads-more-should-follow-racial-justice-requires-algorithmic-justice-and-funding-da47e07e5b58">commit to equitable and accountable AI</a>.</p><p>We need to keep fighting for ethical&nbsp;tech.</p><p>MadHATTERs is a weekly newsletter covering technology, personal data, and the Internet.
