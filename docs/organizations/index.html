<p>Authors: OriginTrail Core Developers<br>Version: 1<br>GitHub discussion link: <a href="https://bit.ly/3MyGesn">Discussion for OT-RFC-14 · Issue #21 · OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository · GitHub</a><br>Date: 2022–10–14</p> From data to assets — gateway to the knowledge economy <p>The upcoming new version 6 of OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) is introducing a paradigm shift to the OriginTrail ecosystem and marks the beginning of a new era. Until now, OriginTrail network delivered key enhancements to the world of decentralized data (such as integrity, interoperability and interconnectedness). With the new version, we are making the leap from exchanging data to creating assets from the data. This is possible with features of discoverability, verifiability and ownership of assets on the DKG representing anything in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsCUigu39Hw">physical and digital&nbsp;world</a>.</p><p>The new paradigm enables anyone to create DKG assets and own their connected “real estate” in the global Web3 graph, enabling a plethora of applications previously impossible due to lack of true data ownership primitives on the internet. The new functionality takes nothing away from the original value propositions but rather upgrades them with ownership, the OriginTrail technology and TRAC tokenomics need to be upgraded as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Before jumping into the tokenomics, let’s take a closer look at what the core building blocks — DKG assets — are from the perspective of DKG and how they influence the TRAC tokenomics. Assets consist of 4 components implemented across two network&nbsp;layers:</p>  The DKG layer hosts the asset graph state (1) in semantic form (RDF), identified by a new Web3 primitive — the Uniform Asset Locator (UAL) (2). Similar to how Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) made it possible to reference an object (e.g. a website or document) in Web2, UALs make it possible to reference anything physical or digital, in Web3. UALs extend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">existing web URI standards</a>, revolutionizing URLs as their counterparts in Web2. A UAL also inherits capabilities described in the W3C recommendation on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The UAL format (to be formally specified in further documents) therefore is in the following standardized form:<br> <br>dkg: [// DID] / UAI [“?” query] [“#” fragment]  The Blockchain layer is responsible for maintaining asset ownership record and asset graph state verifiability proofs. Information about ownership is kept in the form of an ERC 721 compatible Non Fungible Token (3). This allows us to tie DKG and blockchain layers even more closely together and enable ownership to be transferable in the form of NFT token transfer. State commit proofs (4) are used to verify that the asset graphs DKG nodes persist are available, haven’t been deleted or in any form tampered with, as well as enabling complex verifiable presentation implementations (according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a>)   Moving from data bundles to unique&nbsp;assets <p>The introduction of DKG assets is expected to induce an update of existing applications built on OriginTrail significantly, as previously bundled publishings (being just “data”) now get “unbundled” and packaged into unique assets, each published with their own asset graphs and UALs for referencing. In versions prior to v6, publishers would publish bundled “data dumps” in consolidated form actually containing information on sometimes hundreds or even thousands of actual physical objects — each of which in v6 is expected to become a uniquely published DKG asset with its own UAL as a verifiable, ownable identifier. Bundling can still be performed if needed by the asset publisher however — builders and developers now have more freedom to create different solutions on the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>Assets can be continuously updated by their owners with new (immutable) assertions, allowing assets to increase their asset graph and their value. Assets also act as building blocks — they can be connected to other assets,be indexed in various ways (for search) and extended in many ways to improve the discoverability of the&nbsp;asset.</p> DKG as a Multi-chain Decentralized Knowledge Graph <p>OriginTrail technology is a system of 3 logical layers. The top layer is the application layer where web and mobile applications reside with their interfaces, backends and connectors to the DKG. Sitting below the applications we find OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph as layer 2. It consists of OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN), a permissionless network of nodes that are maintaining a distributed knowledge graph of assets. Finally the consensus layer (layer 1) is implemented via blockchain enabling trusted interactions needed for the OriginTrail protocol. Since inception, the DKG was designed to enable multiple blockchains to support a single DKG. This design was for the first time implemented in 2021 when the DKG became multichain and leveraged the many efficiency gains this unlocked which led to over 10-fold jump in its adoption. After the initial Ethereum deployment, we have seen both Gnosis and Polygon blockchains get integrated with the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>After successfully obtaining <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/google-for-web3-specific-blockchain-origintrail-parachain-launches-today-heres-what-s-next-9a0d92bb72ef?source=collection_home---4------6-----------------------">the parachain slot on the Polkadot network earlier this year</a>, OriginTrail will now also receive a tailored blockchain layer network in OriginTrail Parachain, allowing for yet another jump in its overall capabilities. This is particularly important for the OT-RFC-14 as the DKG v6 will have its inaugural launch on the OriginTrail Parachain. The OriginTrail Parachain and OriginTrail v6 DKG integration is effectively starting with the <a href="https://teleport.origintrail.io/">Teleporting process</a> to bring TRAC tokens from Ethereum to OriginTrail Parachain (explained in OT-RFC-12 and OT-RFC-13). The TRAC holders participating in the Teleport will also be the first to engage with the OriginTrail v6 and its new tokenomics presented below.</p> Guidelines to TRAC tokenomics <p>The OT-RFC-14 document is serving as a foundational piece upon which the first implementation of TRAC tokenomics in the v6 of OriginTrail DKG will be done. As with all TRAC tokenomics so far, the latest version is equally molded to support the adoption of the OriginTrail DKG, however this is the first time it takes full advantage of the upcoming OriginTrail DKG v6. When assessing the various aspects of TRAC tokenomics it’s important to keep a few high-level goals in mind, as they guide us to growing the ecosystem:</p>  Ease of use — asset publishers are the core users of the OriginTrail DKG and in order to allow them to engage with OriginTrail technology, it should be reasonably easy to&nbsp;use.  Cost efficiency — allow the market to achieve attractive prices by not wasting resources.  DKG node rewards — allow DKG nodes to get compensated for providing useful services to the network. By enabling an efficient market for the “supply side” of the DKG network, infrastructure runners can get fairly compensated.  Quality of service — ensure that applications querying the DKG (asset consumers) benefit from a high quality&nbsp;service.  Scalability of network activity — implement a system that has capacity to support the rising levels of adoption.  Decentralization — as a core consideration in any implementation and tokenomics decision, avoiding system control by any single&nbsp;party   TRAC tokenomics stakeholders <p>The TRAC tokenomics stakeholders can be described through 4 system&nbsp;roles:</p>  DKG asset publishers are agents which create and manage knowledge graph entities (assets) by publishing asset graphs to the DKG according to the OriginTrail Protocol  DKG asset consumers are agents who discover, query and consume the DKG asset graphs created and owned by DKG asset publishers  DKG node runners, who run and maintain the DKG infrastructure nodes, providing the DKG&nbsp;services  TRAC Token holders, who participate in the ecosystem by providing economic support for system activities  <p>The roles indicated above however do not need to be distinct — one ecosystem actor can hold different roles at the same time. For example, DKG node runners are by definition also TRAC token holders as TRAC tokens are necessary for running DKG&nbsp;nodes.</p> DKG node&nbsp;services <p>The OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) natively operates on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN) which represents a permissionless decentralized system of nodes communicating according to OriginTrail protocol. Anyone with sufficient technical knowledge is able to run an OriginTrail DKG node and contribute to the system by doing so. By design, the DKG nodes receive compensation for the network services provided in the form of TRAC&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The DKG nodes are able to perform various different activities, specified by OriginTrail core protocol operations or through extensions. On the network level we can categorize these activities into two&nbsp;groups:</p>  Publishing protocols, which introduce additional asset graphs into the DKG (equivalent to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_publishing">semantic web publishing</a>, or a database insert operations)  Querying protocols, which enable asset discovery through network queries (equivalent to database query operations)  <p>In OriginTrail v6 we distinguish two generic types of DKG network&nbsp;nodes:</p>  full or service nodes which provide network services implementing full DKG protocol choreographies. Full nodes persist the public DKG state, make it available and execute semantic queries, in return for getting compensated in TRAC&nbsp;tokens.  light nodes which do not provide network services, rather act as network gateways. They are not responsible for persisting the public DKG state as they do not have such capability (don’t respond to publish requests, therefore don’t qualify for rewards). Light nodes are analogous to the notion of light clients in blockchain networks, eliminating the need for gateways such as RPC services with having direct access to the DKG&nbsp;.  <p>Full DKG nodes implement services to facilitate the publishing and querying choreographies. Nodes can generally implement a variety of such protocols, building on the core components: assertions, shards and service agreements.</p><p>Assertions present graph data entries into the system. They constitute asset (data) graphs coupled with corresponding on-chain state commit proofs. In a general sense, assertions are “data building blocks’’ which represent asset graph state, search index entries or any such data structure implemented on the OriginTrail DKG. In OriginTrail v6 graph assertions are natively modeled in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/">RDF (Resource Description Framework)</a>, therefore all tooling of the Semantic Web stack is interoperable with OriginTrail on the core level. Assertions can be versioned, and are expected to be further aligned with standards and recommendations, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/07/rch-wg-charter/#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20RDF,defining%20RDF%20Dataset%20Canonicalization%20algorithms.">the latest initiative led by Phil Archer of&nbsp;GS1</a>.</p><p>Assertion shards or replicas represent DKG entries positioned in the DKG index space (the index space is formed by all full nodes in the network), centered around a replica key, hosted by a number of DKG nodes. Specific groups of nodes in a replica are subsets of the DKG index space node “neighborhoods” (similar to distributed database shard concept), formed according to service agreements facilitated by the protocol. At any moment, one full node hosts a number of logical shards, and due to node id difference (different positions in the index space), different nodes are intended to host different pieces of the DKG. This mechanism achieves a randomized, yet highly organized, distribution of shards and data over the decentralized network.</p><p>Service agreements are defined on assertion level and incentivise availability for a particular set of assertion shards over a period of time. When service agreements no longer require assertion replicas or expire, the assertion replicas availability is no longer incentivized. For ease of implementation, service agreements are defined in terms of space quants, represented in bytes, and time quants called&nbsp;epochs.</p><p>Full DKG nodes receive assertions from asset publishers, form shards in qualifying neighborhoods hosting assertion replicas, which make assertion graphs available for querying during the service period. For these services, (full) nodes receive compensation in TRAC tokens. “Light” nodes enable interacting with the DKG (publishing, querying) without the capability of providing above mentioned services.</p> Publishing protocol choreography <p>The publishing protocol choreography is a coordinated activity between the publishers and DKG nodes whose goal is to form service agreements and establish assertion replicas on the DKG. Due to the decentralized nature of the system, the DKG nodes receive compensation for their services according to their defined service asks, expressed in TRAC tokens required for kb-epoch units. Using the publishing choreography of the DKG one can publish various different data structures on the DKG (assets, index entries for keyword search, vector search in the future&nbsp;etc).</p><p>A publishing choreography initiates a service agreement and is successful if a service bid provided by the publisher satisfies the required service asks posted by DKG nodes for the assertion replication in the given neighborhood. Service asks are posted by DKG nodes on-chain and updated on a regular basis, forming the service&nbsp;price.</p><p>An asset publishing choreography consists of 4&nbsp;phases:</p>  Preparation phase: the asset publisher prepares an assertion in the format expected by the&nbsp;protocol  Feature phase: initiates the appropriate functionality of the desired feature (e.g. updating an asset state) on the blockchain  Store phase: invokes the store protocol to create an assertion replica on the&nbsp;DKG  Commit phase: used to finalize the choreography and initiate the service&nbsp;period   Service market mechanics <p>The DKG service market is formed between asset publishers &amp; consumers on the demand side, and DKG node runners on the supply side. As the DKG is a decentralized environment no entity controls the market and each participant in the DKG gets to act based on their economic preferences.</p><p>For ease of use in OriginTrail v6, the asset publisher client derives a suggested bid for a service based on the price (according to on-chain asks provided by DKG nodes). Once a publisher creates a bid for their asset on chain (feature phase) and successfully creates required assertion replicas on the DKG (store phase), the nodes from the assertion replica submit commit proofs to the blockchain (commit phase). Once the commit phase is completed, the publisher tokens are locked in the system (in the bid amount, to be collected by DKG nodes), the publishing choreography is completed and the service period&nbsp;starts.</p><p>Assertion replicas are hosted by groups of DKG nodes forming shards, based on the following 3 criteria in order of importance:</p>  Key-space proximity criteria: assertions need to be replicated to nodes and maintained in a specific “neighborhood” of the DKG index space, specifically around the key where an assertion is to be kept. Nodes form neighborhoods based on the XOR distance of the assertion key to the node IDs, similar to how distance is determined <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf">in Kademlia DHT</a>. This criteria needs to satisfy efficient data discovery in the decentralized network environment by deterministically locating assertion replicas in querying choreographies. Additionally, due to assertion keys being consistently hashed, assertion replicas are evenly and randomly distributed across the network key-space. A neighborhood is formed by the R2 number of nodes (neighborhood size) which is a protocol parameter.  Node compensation asks: once the appropriate neighborhood is determined (satisfying the first criterion), the second requirement is to ensure that there are enough nodes willing to provide the service in that neighborhood, indicated by their compensation ask. A bid satisfying a minimum number of R1 nodes (R1 being the minimum set of “willing” nodes within an R2 neighborhood, R1 &lt;= R2) is considered a valid bid in terms of the second criterion, where R1 is a protocol parameter.  Security signal criterion: after both previous criteria have been satisfied, finally R0 nodes get chosen (R0 being the minimum replication factor) out of the R1 set, based on the amount of provided TRAC token stake. A higher stake of TRAC tokens in the system indicates higher quality of service guarantees by nodes, as the stake represents a collateral guarantee for nodes providing expected services and acting according to service agreements.  <p>An illustration of the publishing choreography criteria with regards to R0, R1 and R2 is provided below as an example for R2 = 8 and R0 =&nbsp;3.</p> Service period <p>During the service period, nodes involved in the service agreement need to provide service proofs during each epoch of the service to the blockchain. Providing service proofs consists of answering randomly generated cryptographic challenges for hosted assertions and submitting appropriate answers to the blockchain for verification. Successful proof generation and submission to DKG smart contracts in the designated period of time guarantees that a node indeed hosts the assertions required by the service agreement. Once a successful proof submission is performed on a blockchain integrated with the DKG, a portion of the locked tokens (during the publishing choreography) is released and designated for the hosting&nbsp;node.</p><p>In case a service node fails to provide a proof in an epoch, replacement nodes from the candidate node group can replace it in the service group by submitting service proofs (in case they host the required assertions) during the replacement period. The same criteria (as indicated above) apply for the replacement process (self-healing). Therefore by design, the entire network neighborhood is incentivised to host assertions opportunistically in order to be able to perform “self-healing” of replicas.</p><p>In the case of a node failing to provide services (and submit proofs), it is subject to stake slashing. Slashing is no way intended to punish nodes for reasonable latency in submitting proofs (such as short downtimes for updates, or while under load) but rather acts as a deterrent to longer service outages. Slashing is implemented as a lockup system, where a designated percentage S (S being a protocol parameter, suggested value being 5%) is being locked from the available amount of stake for a period T (T also as protocol parameter, suggested value being 2 years). In this way the node’s stake isn’t lost or redestributed among other stakeholders (which could drive malicious targeting of nodes), but rather incapacitated to be utilised in network activities for a significant time&nbsp;period.</p><p>Additionally, node replacements are possible in case when new (full) nodes join the DKG network. Since new joining (full) nodes will inevitably increase the coverage of the DKG index key space and become part of neighborhoods adjacent to their Node IDs, in order to provide high quality discoverability services (via the querying choreography) new nodes are incentivised to provision assertion replicas expected in those neighborhoods. Therefore all DKG v6 nodes joining the network for the first time will perform an opportunistic synchronization sequence loading the assertions in their immediate neighborhoods, enlarging replicas and making assertions available, with the aim to compete for the available compensation via replacement. The DKG tokenomics are designed therefore to incentivise the maintaining of healthy assertion replicas even with network growth as neighborhoods are changing. Replacements due to better positioning in the DKG index key space (and not due to lack of proof submission) do not initiate stake slashing.</p> Querying protocol choreography <p>We consider querying protocols as any protocols that enable discovery and information retrieval from the DKG. They present coordinated activities between asset consumers and the DKG node runners, aimed at finding and querying assets on the DKG, by leveraging the core protocol querying choreography and the DKG&nbsp;index.</p><p>The querying choreography on the DKG directs a generic query (such as a request for an asset by its identifier — the UAL, a SPARQL query or similar) to one or more assertion shards, effectively querying the appropriate “neighborhood” as designated by the publishing choreography. The query routing is equivalent to the Kademlia protocol among full nodes of the DKG. Light clients are not part of the routing protocol, however can invoke queries and publish assets through the network. (It is the responsibility of clients to implement publishing and querying specifics on the application layer to utilize the DKG sharded nature when designing information retrieval systems).</p><p>An asset querying choreography consists of 4&nbsp;phases:</p>  Preparation phase: the asset consumer client prepares a query in some way (e.g. taking input from a search&nbsp;box)  Feature phase: initiates the query prepared in the previous phase on the DKG, on the appropriate DKG shard, and performs necessary URI resolution if&nbsp;needed  Verification phase: verifies the obtained results from the feature phase using on-chain verifiability proofs (verifying immutability, state consistency, issuer or&nbsp;other)  Presentation phase: presenting the query result to the client in requested form  <p>Note that no global SPARQL endpoint in the system exists, due to its decentralized nature. Each of the nodes can however freely decide to build and expose their own SPARQL endpoints, having all implications of such a decision in mind (e.g. availability). The DKG enables queries on its shards via asset graph traversal facilitated by UALs. DKG nodes also implement local graphs (for storing private asset assertions, in their local triple stores) for which they can perform local SPARQL queries of any sort, on both the local asset graph and the loaded assets from the public DKG. More information on querying capabilities will be provided in the official documentation.</p> DKG Node service&nbsp;market <p>Nodes providing services to the DKG network are subject to the market forces (supply and demand), driven by the choreographies explained above. With the updated implementation in version 6, it is expected that DKG node runners obtain an easier and clearer way of determining the optimal market value of compensation for their services, enabling them to achieve profitability easier. Nodes are expected to maintain their asks on-chain, enabling the asset publisher applications to obtain the current market price for DKG services.</p><p>In unison, the market becomes more efficient due to an improved ability of DKG node runners to differentiate their services based on service quality (through availability, throughput, capacity) and security (proxied through the amount of TRAC collateral posted).</p><p>We envision a set of tools to enable easy management of service parameters for DKG node runners to achieve the best possible market return. Such tools would indicate the fluctuations in supply and demand, for example indicating network load increase (due to higher demand) which would have an impact on the service price in the positive direction, until the service supply is increased (via additional nodes joining the network).</p> Tokenomics role in system&nbsp;security <p>In order to reach the necessary system security level the OriginTrail network requires all full nodes to post an amount of TRAC tokens as security deposit in the system. With the new implementation of tokenomics as proposed above, the stake provided by nodes has a function also in the publishing choreography, as described by the third criterion. As nodes compete in the market based on prices and deployed stake in the network, it is expected from nodes to attract a higher amount of stake (either by directly depositing more TRAC by the node runner, or accepting delegated TRAC from the community) to position themselves better in the market. Delegated node staking becomes one of the additional features in OriginTrail v6 and will allow TRAC token holders to participate even further in the TRAC economy by delegating their tokens to nodes they pick, being eligible for sharing the compensation for services by those nodes. This new component of the tokenomics not only introduces new ways for ecosystem stakeholders to participate, but also motivates them to act as “quality signal providers”, as token holders need to carefully assess who to delegate their TRAC to to minimize the probability of slashing. DKG node runners are expected to become further specialized in capabilities needed to provide a high quality service to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>As stake slashing needs to be a meaningful deterrent to potential service outages, given the proposed slashing implementation above, the minimum required amount of posted stake for a full node will be increased to 50 000 TRAC in order to be eligible for operation. Nodes can achieve this minimum both through direct staking or by collecting delegated TRAC tokens from the community. (Note: delegated TRAC tokens cannot be controlled by node runners, only by delegators). Being a stake delegator is therefore similar to the notion of <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking">nominators in the Polkadot&nbsp;network</a>.</p><p>Detailed delegation and staking mechanics are to be presented in the coming&nbsp;RFCs.</p> OriginTrail v6 scalability considerations <p>The implementation of OriginTrail v6 introduces, as already mentioned, the notion of full and light nodes. It also clearly separates the functionalities to be implemented by clients and network nodes (which were previously one monolithic structure).</p><p>The responsibility of the dkg-client is therefore to implement the preparation and feature phases of both publishing and querying choreographies. DKG nodes implement all the network communication related phases and incentivisation functionalities, however are “relieved” of e.g. the preparation phase complexities and load, which are moved towards the network “edge” (clients). With the separation of concerns between the clients and nodes, as well as the new implementations choreographies illustrated above the DKG implementation becomes far more scalable.</p><p>Furthermore, with the new indexing logic and deterministic shard resolution, the nodes need to communicate significantly less, making the load of publishing even less strenuous on nodes, making them able to run more operations at the same time than previously. In this way the ODN becomes “less chatty” and achieves an order of magnitude scalability improvement in the DKG layer&nbsp;2.</p><p>Another consideration in scalability is the OriginTrail Layer 1 (blockchain), which in the system illustrated above is expected to handle a number of transactions per specific epoch. The limit of scalability in terms of blockchain can be calculated by the following equation:</p><p>Number of assets secured on DKG in one epoch = Epoch_length * block_size / number of proof transactions in an&nbsp;epoch.</p><p>The epoch_length is a system parameter that, based on the equation above, essentially determines the number of assets that can be supported by one blockchain in OriginTrail layer 1. We conclude that architecturally the blockchain layer doesn’t present an immediate bottleneck for the growth of the DKG. Iterative deployments and optimizations on the blockchain level, such as through more efficient smart contract code, or direct implementation of components in Substrate, are also expected over the course of OriginTrail evolution.</p> Conclusion <p>This RFC presents the updates to the TRAC tokenomics in the sixth version of OriginTrail protocol with details of the proposed implementation and activities the system needs to incentivise, grouped around publishing and querying choreographies.

<p>In April we kicked off new research on the use of biometrics within the Humanitarian sector, in partnership with the Open Society Foundation’s migration initiative&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following on from our previous <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Engine-Room-Oxfam-Biometrics-Review.pdf" title="">2018 report with Oxfam</a> that looked at the risks, harms and challenges of using biometric data for humanitarian purposes, this new research explores what’s changed (and what’s stayed the same) in the sector in the last four years, and takes a deeper look at organisational policies on biometrics, and the benefits risks and potential harms of using biometric systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we wrap up our research and writing, we are keen to share our initial findings and have a broader discussion about what changes are needed when it comes to the use of biometric technologies in the humanitarian sector.</p>



 Register for our second community call on 27 October, 9-10AM EST/ 3-4 PM CET 



<p>All are welcome! Whether you’re a practitioner, a civil society organisation working with impacted communities, or just keen to learn more, join us in our Community Call. Along with presenting our findings, we will create space for dialogue and reflection around the complexities of using biometric technologies within humanitarian contexts.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



 What will we be talking about? 



<p>Our focus in this call will be to think through what needs to change in order to encourage a more responsible use of biometrics within the humanitarian sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the key questions that will be guiding our discussions are:&nbsp;</p>



  How do we think about necessity when it comes to using biometric systems? (e.g how do we compare biometrics to alternatives, what kind of evidence exists on risks and benefits, and what kind of evidence is lacking?)  What sort of policy-making practices and standards are important for creating a more cohesive approach to biometric use?  What kind of changes need to take place within the larger humanitarian landscape to facilitate the responsible and thoughtful use of biometric systems?  



<p>You can find more background on our last community call and this project <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/upcoming-community-call-new-research-biometrics-in-the-humanitarian-sector/" title="">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See you on October 27!</p>

  Justin Sun, the Permanent Representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization and founder of TRON blockchain confirmed that he holds more than “tens of millions” of Huobi Tokens (HT).  “I would see myself as one of the biggest holders [of the Huobi Token],” said the crypto businessman in an interview with Bloomberg TV.  Total Management Capital recently acquired Huobi crypto exchange and Sun made a huge contribution to the M&amp;A fund, ending up as an advisor at the exchange.  



 



<p>Justin Sun, the founder of the <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/tron-price-prediction/">Tron blockchain</a>, one of the most used blockchains, which is known for its low gas fees and scalability features, confirmed that he holds more than “tens of millions” of Huobi Tokens (HT), the official cryptocurrency of prominent crypto exchange Huobi, which was recently acquired by About Capital Management, but it is known that Sun played an important role in the deal. </p>



<p>In a Bloomberg Television <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/crypto-s-justin-sun-says-he-owns-tens-of-millions-huobi-tokens-1.1832337#:~:text=Crypto's%20Justin%20Sun%20Says%20He%20Owns%20'Tens%20of%20Millions'%20Huobi%20Tokens,-Olga%20Kharif%2C%20Bloomberg&amp;text=(Bloomberg)%20%2D%2D%20Tron%20founder%20Justin,to%20its%20linked%20crypto%20exchange.">interview</a> with Emily Chang on Thursday, the Tron founder said “I would see myself as one of the biggest holders” of the Huobi Token (HT) as now he holds a special advisory position with the crypto exchange following its acquision by About Capital using funds in which Justin Sun contributed as well. </p>



<p>Additionally, the crypto entreprenuer confirmed that he has been accumulating the said tokens since 2013 and has created a very heavy bag of HT tokens which means that he can be called a HT coin whale that holds a huge number of the said cryptocurrency. Interestingly, the price of 1 HT token at the time of writing is $7.8 and so, the price of 1 million HT would be $7.8 million while the price of tens of millions of HT would be towards the $70 million to $100 million mark. </p>



<p>While Justin Sun did not reveal the actual amount of HT tokens he held, it is also crucial to note that the crypto entrepreneur left the Tron blockchain recently and decided to embark on a journey far greater than blockchain developement. He took the position of Permanent Representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization in an attempt to spread the word about blockchain. </p>



<p>Interesting Justin Sun owning HT tokens does not come as a surprise as he recently contributed to the M&amp;A fund that was use to acquire the full shares of Huobi crypto exchange which ranks among the top 10 biggest crypto exchanges by spot trading volumes. </p>



<p>Following the acquisition by About Capital Management, the exchange will “embrace a series of new international brand promotion and business expansion initiatives, including a global strategic advisory board led by leading industry figures, the injection of sufficient capital in margin and risk provision fund, as well as measures to further enhance competitiveness.”</p>



<p>On the other hand, TRON has also been making huge milestones as recently the Ethereum killer was declared as the <a href="https://bitnation.co/tron-becomes-the-national-blockchain-of-dominica/">official blockchain of the Commonwealth of Dominica</a>, which passed the Virtual Asset Business Act earlier in 2022.</p>



<blockquote><p>“The TRON team and myself are delighted that Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit trusts TRON to develop the blockchain infrastructure that will empower their participation in the decentralized financial future,” </p>said Justin Sun.</blockquote>

				 <p>Danube Tech&nbsp;is building the Universal DID Saas, a hosted platform that allows developers to create, update, resolve, and deactivate Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs), as well as to perform several other advanced DID-related operations.</p>
<p>This company has participated in two of the the eSSIF-Lab Open Calls_ the Business-oriented Open Call and the Infrastructured-oriented Open Call.</p>
<p>We’ve had the pleasure to interview,&nbsp;Markus Sabadello,&nbsp;Danube Tech CEO, who has talked to us about what they have been able to achieve so far in his company since its participation in eSSIF-Lab project and what goals they want to accomplish in the medium or long term.</p>
 1. Please introduce yourself and tell us what your company is about. 
<p>My name is Markus Sabadello, I have a relatively large background of working on decentralised identity ideas and technologies. At Danube Tech,&nbsp;we are working on open-source software and commercial products that make it easy for others to build decentralised identity applications and services.&nbsp;Our priorities lie in implementing lower-level infrastructure components in the area of Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). What makes us special is that we put a strong emphasis on interoperability.</p>
<p>To be specific, we try to build technical components that work with different decentralised identity networks, different credential and proof formats, and different protocols.&nbsp;We focus less on building a single, isolated product that we can sell, and more on being part of a larger community and collaborating with others.</p>
 2. What services or products do you offer? 
<p>On the open-source side, we offer Java libraries that implement DIDs, VCs, Linked Data Proofs, CBOR-LD, and others. These libraries are generic and can be used by developers to build higher-level applications and services. Work on these software libraries has been supported by an ESSIF-Lab IOC2 grant. Two additional open-source projects, which are closely related to this, are the Universal Resolver (see&nbsp;<a href="https://uniresolver.io/">https://uniresolver.io/</a>) and Universal Registrar (see&nbsp;<a href="https://uniregistrar.io/">https://uniregistrar.io/</a>). These projects are quite well-known in the decentralised identity community and have received many contributions. Together, these tools provide an abstraction layer on top of different decentralized identity networks, such as Sovrin, EBSI, IDunion, Indicio, ION, Cheqd, Veres One, and many more. We see this work as an important contribution to building a globally interoperable ecosystem, and to avoid fragmentation of different efforts. As I mentioned before, with our work we are primarily focusing on low-level, foundational infrastructure.</p>
<p>On the commercial side, we are building production-grade enterprise products around the open-source projects. This is sometimes called an “open core” model. The products we are building can be used by companies and governments that want to adopt DIDs, VCs, and related technologies. One of these products is a Software-as-a-Software (SaaS) offering called Godiddy (<a href="https://godiddy.com/">https://godiddy.com/</a>). This has been supported by an ESSIF-Lab Business Oriente Open Call grant and was originally called “Universal DID SaaS”. Godiddy is a hosted platform that makes it easy for developers and solution providers to work with DIDs.</p>
 3. What milestones have you achieved so far since your project launch? 
<p>In our eSSI-Lab IOC2 project, we managed to release “complete” versions of most of our open-source libraries, and to continuously maintain them, since some of the underlying standards are also still evolving. We actively maintain these libraries, since we use them in our own products, and many others in the decentralised identity community use them as well. We also frequently participate in community activities such as developing test suites, or participating in interoperability events (plugfests).</p>
<p>In our BOC1 project, we have by now launched our Godiddy service as a working product, and we have paying customers. We also continuously maintain and expand the functionality of this product, for example by adding support for additional decentralised identity networks.</p>
 4. What have you achieved with your idea thanks to eSSIF_Lab project? 
<p>As mentioned in the previous answer, we managed to significantly advance both our open-source libraries and our Godiddy product to the point where both are actively used by other members of the decentralised identity community, as well as by important customers who are building their own applications and services for solving real-life use cases. You could say that eSSIF-Lab has really helped our company to evolve from merely building experimental tools, to a serious and ambitious actor that plays its part within a larger ecosystem, and hopefully helps SSI become successful on a large scale. During eSSIF-Lab, we were able to expand our team and grow the company.</p>
<p>ESSIF-Lab has also helped us to generate additional visibility for our work. And of course another important benefit of eSSIF-Lab (besides the funding and visibility) was the interaction and collaboration with other eSSIF-Lab subgrantees, and the support of the eSSIF-Lab consortium itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. What are your goals for the middle/long-time future?  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>We believe that DIDs will become as important on the Internet as IP addresses or domain names are today. Our goal is to further improve and expand our products in this area of foundational decentralised identity infrastructure. We want to contribute to interoperability in a global ecosystem and avoid isolated solutions that don’t work with each other.&nbsp;</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>We will continue to play an active role in standardization and community groups such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Decentralised Identity Foundation (DIF), to make sure SSI is built on solid technical specifications. Our goal is also to further grow the company and become a leading provider of solutions for DID and VC technologies.</p>
 6. Any piece of advice for those who are looking for public funding? 
<p>I’m not an expert on this, but I would say:</p>
 
 Be optimistic&nbsp;– try again if an application doesn’t succeed at first, since rejection can happen for various reasons and doesn’t mean that your idea is bad. 
 Be honest&nbsp;– I have seen grant applications that contain outright lies, which is not fair towards the rest of the applicants, and ultimately not good for yourself. 
 Be grateful&nbsp;– I have heard people complain about the bureaucracy associated with public funding, but I think it’s not too much to ask to make an effort to get support for your project.

  Uniswap has attained a valuation of $1.66 billion after a new Series C funding round in which it had raised around $165 million from existing and new investors.   The funding round was led by Polychain Capital, a crypto investment firm, along with existing shareholders and investors Paradigm, SV Angel, and Variant.  The funding comes at a time when investments declined 37% year-on-year in the quarter that ended at $4.44 billion in September.  



 



<p>The world’s largest decentralized finance application, Uniswap, has attained a valuation of $1.66 billion after a new Series C funding round and has successfully raised close to $165 million. The funding round was led by Polychain Capital, one of the biggest crypto investment firms. Along with Polychain, existing shareholders and investors a16z crypto, Paradigm, SV Angel, and Variant also participated in the round. </p>



<p>The chief executive officer of Uniswap Labs, Hayden Adams, confirmed the news of the new funding round which was first reported by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/30/uniswap-labs-eyes-over-100-million-in-new-funding/">TechCruch</a> in a report wherein it stated that the parent firm of the world’s biggest decentralized exchange, Uniswap Labs is set to raise an amount in the range of $100 million and $200 million. The report also confirmed that the DEX was in talks with Polychain and the deal was yet to be finalized at the time of writing.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Now, Uniswap Labs is bringing the powerful simplicity and security that has defined the Uniswap Protocol to even more people across the world by investing in our web app and developer tools, launching NFTs, moving into mobile — and more!” </p>Adams wrote.</blockquote>



<p>Adams also noted that the exchange has crossed the $1.2 trillion milestone in terms of trading volume and is probably one of the largest crypto firms in the current bearish market. The $165 million raise from Polychain and other investors marks one of the biggest raise in the current period as there has been a significant fall in the venture capital investments in the crypto market recently. </p>



<p>Before this, the firm raised money in August 2020, as per data from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.web3signals.xyz/">Web3 Signals</a> from the above mentioned existing shareholders. </p>



<blockquote><p>“As Uniswap Labs focuses on products, a much broader ecosystem continues to grow and thrive beyond what any one company can do on their own. As an example, the governance community recently voted to create the Uniswap Foundation, which will contribute to the Protocol’s decentralized development and give at least $60 million in grants to community projects over the next few years,”</p>confirmed Adams. </blockquote>



<p>The funding round for Uniswap comes at a time when the investments declined 37% year-on-year in the quarter that ended at $4.44 billion in September according to a recent report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/crypto-startup-funding-q3-plunges-alongside-bitcoin">Bloomberg</a>. </p>



<p>Following the announcement from the executive, the <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/uniswap-price-prediction/">UNI token</a>, the native token of the decentralized exchange that is put to use in the ecosystem of Uniswap, rose more than 8% and is on the way to break the $7 price level as per our data. </p>

  Samsung intends to protect users against hacks while keeping login easy.  The phone company has already made a series of high-profile investments in Web3 since 2021.  



 



<p>Samsung, a smartphone producer, has <a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/samsung-knox-matrix-a-revolutionary-security-solution-for-samsung-cross-device-experiences/">announced </a>that it would leverage blockchain technology to build a security service for its devices. The tech company revealed that the Samsung Knox Matrix, a security platform, would provide top-notch security features used by leading agencies. Samsung confirmed that all of its devices would have access to Knox Matrix and receive a unified SDK, even if they are based on any OS, including Android or Tizen.</p>



<p>The Knox Matrix will not be limited to smartphones but will instead extend to other Samsung products, including its home appliances such as air conditioners, smart TVs, and refrigerators. According to the company, the security service will serve as a private blockchain for each user, giving them a renewed sense of safety.</p>



<p>Speaking on the importance of the new security feature, an official statement said,</p>



<blockquote><p>With Samsung Knox Matrix, we envision that users need not compromise on their connectivity in order to stay protected. Samsung Knox Matrix is set to provide the devices within a user’s ecosystem with fewer vulnerabilities through strong, diverse security practices</p></blockquote>



<p>Although modern phones have made communication easier, the internet remains a great risk to information and personal data. So, Samsung has made it a priority to provide safety for its users. As a result, the Knox Matrix will protect users’ credentials from hacks while keeping the login experience simple.</p>



<p>The appliance maker has not yet provided any details about the operation of the security protocol leveraging blockchain technology. However, the company’s&nbsp;community believes the development is worth the attention.&nbsp;They also&nbsp;anticipate how other smartphone manufacturers will apply blockchain technology for security.</p>



<p>Samsung joins the list of many popular brands seeking to increase their use of blockchain technology. The phone manufacturer has been growing its presence on <a href="https://bitnation.co/web3-platform-built-by-ex-google-engineers-nxyz-raises-40m/">Web3 </a>and announced the launch of its “Samsung Wallet” at&nbsp;its “Unpacked 2022” virtual event earlier this year. Samsung already has a location in Decentraland, showing how intent it is on keeping up with the industry.</p>



<p>In addition, Samsung’s latest series of smart TVs support NFT. The tech company reportedly incorporated the South Korean Central Bank’s digital currency into its flagship smartphone in August 2021. Officials at Samsung Next have in the past spoken about the importance of blockchain technology and Samsung’s commitment to leverage it for its products.</p>

 What Is Biticodes? 



<p>A well-known bitcoin automated trading platform called BitiCodes was created to provide both novice and seasoned traders with a smooth trading experience. The program’s creators claim that in order to conduct winning transactions on your behalf, it makes use of artificial intelligence (AI), complex algorithms, and trading strategies. In other words, by assisting you in automating tedious and time-consuming processes like market research, chart analysis, price forecasting, and trend analysis, the BitiCodes platform makes cryptocurrency trading simple.</p>



<p>We think BitiCodes is the best trading programme for both new and seasoned traders based on our own experience using it. With this platform, you don’t need to worry about learning how to trade or spend a lot of time trading every day. If you choose to trade manually on the site, BitiCodes also provides handy tools and data, like charts, to help you with your transactions.</p>



<p>With a 90% success rate, BitiCodes will likely execute winning trades for you nine out of 10 times. The platform can also execute numerous deals per second, a feat that is beyond the capabilities of even the most seasoned cryptocurrency trader. This software also enables you to trade other popular cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Cardano, Bitcoin Cash, and more, in contrast to other automated cryptocurrency trading systems that only handle Bitcoin.</p>



 How Does Biticodes Work? 







<p>As was previously said, to execute deals, this bitcoin trading platform uses top-notch algorithms, artificial intelligence, and robotics. When you press the trade button, it immediately begins automatically scanning the bitcoin market and analysing charts to find profitable trading chances. AI technology and cutting-edge algorithms are used to accomplish this. When it sees a chance, it immediately sends out its trading bots to carry it out.</p>



<p>This method enables the automated trading program to accurately complete more than ten trades in a single second. So, you can anticipate BitiCodes to complete 1000+ transactions for you in less than an hour. Additionally, the software has a 90% success rate, meaning 900 out of the 1000+ trades will probably be lucrative.</p>



<p>Both desktop and mobile devices are compatible with the official BitiCodes website. We have confirmed that the website functions flawlessly on every type of laptop, tablet, and smartphone that we tested it on. You should also be aware that using the platform to register is free. Setting up your trading account on BitiCodes won’t cost you a dime. However, in order to begin trading on the platform and making money, you must deposit $250 as the minimum trading amount.</p>

<p>The program for the crypto trading robot, which is most significant, asserts to have a very high success rate. The software’s algorithm is able to make potentially successful transactions because it uses cutting-edge technology to scan the markets and start deals when it is most advantageous to do so.</p>



<p>According to the BitiCodes website, the AI system has a 96% success rate. We haven’t independently verified this, though.</p>



 Leverage 



<p>The platform’s ability to leverage up to 5000:1 is another benefit of BitiCodes. However, if you are a newbie, we do not advise choosing this choice. It is quite profitable, but there is a danger you could lose everything.</p>



 How to Use Biticodes – Step-by-Step Guide 



 Step 1: Open an account 



<p>You can sign up for the platform using the form above. You can also do so through their website, but the form above presents an easier way to do this without running the risk of ending up on a duplicate or fraudulent platform.</p>



 Step 2: Verify your Account 



<p>You must submit the completed form to the website. BitiCodes will create your free account and give you a verification email in a matter of seconds. You will have access to your account after the verification procedure is finished.</p>



 Step 3: Make a Deposit 



<p>Funding your account with the required minimum trading capital is the next step after completing the BitiCodes registration and verification process. Before customers can begin trading, the platform asks all users to deposit a minimum of $250. You can deposit money using a few different methods on the BitiCodes website. Debit cards, credit cards, bank transfers, and e-wallets are all options for funding your account.</p>



<p>As previously stated, BitiCodes does not charge for registration. Therefore, this amount is your trading capital rather than your registration fee. The site does not impose deposit fees, which is another benefit worth mentioning. Therefore, the trading capital you receive will be equal to the amount you put in your trading account.</p>



 Step 4: Monitor Trading Bot 



<p>Before trading with your hard-earned money, you can utilize BitiCodes’ demo account to get acquainted with the platform. You receive monies through this feature—not actual cash—that you may use to test the software and learn how it functions.</p>



<p>Once you are certain that you comprehend how the BitiCodes platform functions, click the start trading option to begin the transaction. The window for the trade parameters will open after this operation. The crypto asset you want to trade must be chosen here, along with additional settings like risk level, stop loss and more. Click the live trading button when finished to watch the program trade and earn money for you.</p>

 Biticodes vs other Trading Robots 



<p>Minimum Deposit: $250 (in line with other platforms)</p>



<p>Success Rate: 90% (lower than other platforms like Yuan Pay Group with 99% success rate)</p>



 Can you make money with Biticodes? 



<p>After carefully examining the website, our specialists have concluded that BitiCodes is both legitimate and profitable. Furthermore, we found no evidence to support the claim that it is a hoax. In order to learn more about BitiCodes, we first looked at user reviews on TrustPilot, Yelp, Facebook, and other reliable review sites.</p>



<p>Many people assert that since the platform’s introduction, they have been using BitiCodes to generate passive revenue. We must warn you, nevertheless, that some customers claim they lost money using the site because they were unable to understand how it operated. Not content, we continued our research by registering for a BitiCodes account to gain first-hand experience.</p>



<p>We think BitiCodes is 100 percent genuine based on our experience and other considerations. We take the founders’ assertion that even a novice trader with no prior experience can increase their money by using BitiCodes seriously. Please be aware, though, that no automatic trading programme in the world has a success record of 100 percent. Therefore, when you invest in these automated trading systems, there is still a danger that you could lose your money.</p>



<p>So, we suggest that you only invest money that you can afford to lose. Ideally, you should start with the smallest amount of money possible and only expand your investment after you begin to profit from the platform.</p>

 Tips for new traders 



<p>The following advice can help you maximise your profits on BitiCodes while lowering your risk of financial loss.</p>



  <p>Only invest what you can afford to lose. Because of the cryptocurrency market’s extreme volatility and unpredictability, anything can happen while you are trading. Never invest money you’ve borrowed or used for necessities like rent or food in cryptocurrency.</p>  <p>Always routinely cash out your platform gains. You won’t be at a loss if the unexpected occurs if you do it this way.</p>  <p>Try to set aside 20 to 30 minutes every day to check on your account to make sure the program is functioning properly. Additionally, monitoring will enable you to identify any anomaly in your account before it worsens.</p>

 Bitcoin 360 AI Pros and Cons 



 Pros 



  <p>User-friendly interface</p>  <p>Quick signup process</p>  <p>Multi-currency support</p>  <p>Auto trading available</p>  



 Cons 



  <p>Unregulated trading tool</p>  <p>No Bitcoin 360 AI mobile app</p>  



 Is Bitcoin 360 AI a Scam? 



<p>It is impossible to know for sure whether a proprietary crypto bot software platform performs as claimed because creators hardly ever make their tools available for public backtesting, making it impossible for rivals to copy them.</p>



<p>Do not over-invest in a single trading bot; instead, maintain a diverse portfolio. Automated copy trading is available on several authorized crypto exchanges. Take into account employing them in addition to standalone Bitcoin bots or cryptocurrency bots, as they are sometimes unlicensed or unregulated.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin 360 Ai website makes a number of promises, including that it is the “most profitable auto trader,” although these could just be for marketing purposes. Knowing the actual potential of any auto trader is different because it can also depend on how effectively the end user calibrates it and how much profit they decide to take out or reinvest for compound returns.</p>



<p>Some real Bitcoin robots have their websites scraped or pictures reused to create phony scam bot websites with “celebrity endorsements” from people like Martin Lewis or MoneySavingExpert, Elon Musk or Tesla, Jeff Bezos or Amazon, etc. These scams are simple to recognize and are not real crypto bots.</p>



 What Is Bitcoin 360 AI Trading Platform? 



<p>In contrast to equities, the cryptocurrency markets, including Bitcoin, trade continuously throughout the year, making it challenging for day traders and regular investors to consistently outperform them.</p>



<p>This led to a market for crypto trading bots that may act as “robot advisers” or “investment advisors” to automate the procedure.</p>



<p>One of the newest automated trading platforms in that market, Bitcoin 360 Ai, makes the promise that it may assist investors to increase their win rate per trade and creating more sustainable profits. However, because the software is proprietary, there isn’t much information online. According to a self-reported review of Bitcoin 360 Ai:</p>



<blockquote><p>The creative and user-friendly, yet strong enough to satisfy your demands, Bitcoin 360 AI platform is a high-tech environment to help you maximize your cryptocurrency and Bitcoin profits. New individuals join our elite and prosperous community of investors every day in order to reach their financial freedom milestones and live a carefree lifestyle.</p></blockquote>



 How Does Bitcoin 360 AI App Work? 







<p>The “AI” in “BTC 360 Ai” stands for artificial intelligence, which as a general term covers all the features of Bitcoin robots, cryptocurrency trading bots, etc., such as their automatic trading strategy, setting a TP/SL order in advance (take profit and stop loss), determining the optimal R:R (risk to reward ratio for trades), and being able to layer bids and asks to scale into a position gradually.</p>



<p>Human traders frequently become impatient with going through all of these steps, enter a long or short position in the middle of a trading range, and then get chopped up. Bitcoin 360 Ai asserts that it is more accurate than most retail investors at navigating price volatility in the cryptocurrency markets.</p>



 Bitcoin 360 AI Overview 



<p>Platform type: Bitcoin and crypto trading platform<br>Supported cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, BCH, BNB, LTC, DASH, BT, and more<br>Withdrawal time: Instant via cryptocurrency, 12-24 hours by fiat<br>Minimum deposit: $250</p>



 Key Features of Bitcoin 360 AI 



 Automated Multi-Asset Trading 



<p>According to Bitcoin 360 Ai, it is possible to trade Bitcoin and several of the best altcoins, including Ethereum, automatically. Notably, this Bitcoin bot platform also supports Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, two further forks of the cryptocurrency.</p>



 Simple to Use 



<p>The ease of use of the software is a frequent theme in online Bitcoin 360 Ai evaluations; yet, like with any crypto bot, these comments may be paid for, fabricated, or overstated. Be careful as you go.</p>



 Quick Withdrawal 



<p>BTC 360 Ai, which accepts deposits in both fiat money and cryptocurrency, promises a 1-2 business day turnaround for withdrawals of fiat money and fast payouts of cryptocurrency on its website. We advise trying out the Bitcoin 360 Ai withdrawal procedure as soon as possible.</p>



 Demo Account 



<p>Supposedly, after making the initial deposit and registering on the Bitcoin 360 Ai website (there is no free trial version accessible), a demo account is made available. That is beneficial because practicing with paper trading first reduces risk to nothing until you are certain that Bitcoin 360 Ai is real and effective.</p>



 Customer Service 



<p>The creators of the tool claim that users can get assistance from a trustworthy and useful customer support system on Bitcoin 360 AI if they run into any problems. They haven’t yet provided any information regarding the effectiveness of the customer care channels, though. Trading professionals must exercise considerable caution when using this instrument.</p>



 How to Use Bitcoin 360 AI – Step-by-Step Guide 



 Step 1: Open an account 



<p>Fill out the form above with the correct information, including your full name, phone number, and email address.</p>



<p>The trader will then be connected by Bitcoin 360 AI to a broker in their area.</p>

<p>Investors can finally access the typical trading account. By selecting their risk parameters, traders can personalize their trading settings. Additionally, according to the site, investors can choose how much autonomy they want the AI system to have.</p>



<p>Traders have the option of setting an automatic function that will enable the software to go live and execute trades on their behalf, or they can choose to invest manually. We were unable to independently confirm any of these allegations, though.</p>



 Bitcoin 360 AI vs other Trading Robots 



<p>Minimum Deposit: $250 (in-line with other trading bots and platforms)</p>



<p>Success Rate: 90% (much lower than other platforms like Bitcoin Code with 99.4%)</p>



 Can you make money with Bitcoin 360 AI? 



<p>According to Bitcoin 360 AI, the platform offers a demo account. By doing this, you can get premium software without paying cash.</p>



<p>Finally, investors have access to the standard trading account. Traders can customise their trading settings by choosing their risk parameters. Additionally, investors can select how much autonomy they want the AI system to have, according to the website.</p>



<p>Traders have the choice of investing manually or creating an automatic feature that will allow the software to go live and execute trades on their behalf. However, we were unable to independently verify any of these claims.</p>



<p>In order to assist you in managing your account and navigating trading in the volatile cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin 360 Ai has worked with CySEC-licensed brokers. Bitcoin 360 Ai values your privacy greatly, so your data is protected by an SSL certificate.</p>



<p>For a novice, trading can be incredibly frightening even when it is being done on your behalf.</p>



<p>It makes logical that you would have many concerns or inquiries, which is why Bitcoin 360 Ai has a customer service team that is staffed and available around-the-clock to make sure your needs are met at all times and you are never in the dark.</p>



<p>Customers of Bitcoin 360 Ai have left a tonne of positive internet reviews of the programme and the revenue it has brought in for them.</p>



 Tips for new traders

 Spend 20 minutes on your account every day. 



<p>Although Bitcoin 360 Ai requires really minimal upkeep, it functions best when you log in to your account once or twice daily to monitor activities and keep track of what’s going on.</p>



 Invest Prudently 



<p>You must trade cautiously and only with extra money that you have accessible because the bitcoin market is unpredictable. This is crucial while utilizing Bitcoin 360 Ai.</p>



 Keep an eye on your transactions 



<p>Account statements can be downloaded directly from your Bitcoin 360 Ai account. You should regularly download your transactions because you might need to pay taxes on your income as soon as you start making money. You’ll need these records in order to achieve it.</p>

 Bitcoin Bank Pros and Cons 



 Pros 



  <p>According to the website there are no transaction or hidden fees</p>  <p>Offers a demo account for testing and training</p>  <p>No lengthy identity checks</p>  



 Cons 



  <p>No Bitcoin Bank app</p>  



 Is Bitcoin Bank a Scam? 



<p>Bitcoin Bank’s software seems to operate as intended. However, the lavish claims made on its website are simply too good to be true. Your money is always at danger while trading in the bitcoin or forex markets, even though Bitcoin Bank’s software seems to work as advertised. There are no guarantees in the financial markets, and the website’s assertion that novice traders may make $1,000 per day in profit is simply too good to be true. The robot also asserts that it has won honors from US trading organisations, but we were unable to locate any evidence to support such claims.</p>



<p>Before investing in the cryptocurrency or FX markets, a trader must perform exhaustive due research. The price of an asset can vary in a matter of seconds due to the extreme volatility of the markets.</p>



 What Is Bitcoin Bank? 



<p>One of the several cryptocurrency robots that work in the sector, Bitcoin Bank guarantees earnings to account holders who put money into Bitcoin. With the money you deposit into your account, the auto trading platform allegedly executes deals using trading bots that are driven by AI technology. According to reports, this system searches cryptocurrency exchanges and keeps an eye on market movements to identify wise bets.</p>



<p>The purpose of cryptocurrency trading applications like Bitcoin Bank is to purchase Bitcoin for a bargain and subsequently sell it for a profit.</p>



<p>To establish a brand-new market of investing opportunities, Bitcoin Bank advises you to attempt auto-trading while the cryptocurrency is still in its infancy and the market is still extremely volatile.</p>



<p>The idea behind the platform is rather straightforward. On the surface, you can start investing in the market without having any prior knowledge of Bitcoin. While the company implies that a Bitcoin investment can change your life, the reality is far more nuanced, especially when it comes to auto trading. To begin with, this form of trading carries a very high risk, especially if you are unable to confirm the legitimacy of the brokers that Bitcoin Bank has associated with.</p>



 How Does Bitcoin Bank Work? 







<p>The Bitcoin Bank robot uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to manage trades throughout its platform. The goal of the bot is to find trends in market data and make recommendations on when to enter and exit trades.</p>



<p>It is significant to note that when trading, Bitcoin Bank utilizes contracts for difference (CFDs). You have the choice to purchase particular assets, such as Bitcoin, at a future date and at a defined price with the use of these financial derivative instruments. However, always keep in mind that all trading entails risk.</p>



<p>The difference between the asset’s current price and its price at the time the contract expires will decide your profit or loss. You trade CFDs when you utilize Bitcoin Bank. One cannot buy the cryptocurrency itself.</p>



<p>When using this bot to day trade cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Bank works with a network of cryptocurrency brokers. These brokers are in charge of, among other things, position size, trade management, and trade execution.</p>



<p>Do you wish to learn how to invest in cryptocurrencies without putting in a lot of effort? The Bitcoin Bank robot is a thought-provoking instrument. The partner brokers of the robots will carry out the trades on your behalf once you have made the minimal deposit into your Bitcoin Bank account.</p>



<p>The website claims that this trading robot has a 60% success rate. The staff of the Bitcoin Bank claims that this sum. We advise exercising caution because trading cryptocurrency is risky and the market is extremely volatile.</p>



 Bitcoin Bank Overview 



<p>Minimum Deposit: €250<br>Claimed Success Rate: 99%<br>Supported Cryptocurrencies: BTC<br>Mobile App?: No<br>Fees: None</p>



 Key Features of Bitcoin Bank 



 Low-cost Trading Bot 



<p>Bitcoin Bank does not charge extra fees to customers for trading. This means that even on profitable deals, they don’t get any commissions. Bitcoin Bank stands out as one of the best Bitcoin robots for traders given that many trading bots take a cut of profitable trades.</p>



<p>The affiliate brokers of the bot may demand a fee for their services, so you should be informed of that. These costs may include trading commissions or account management fees. Make sure you comprehend these costs completely before working with a broker.</p>



 Brokers 



<p>Bitcoin Bank collaborates with a network of brokers or bitcoin platforms. Your funds will be under the management of these brokers, who will also be in charge of managing and executing trades. We were unable to find any information on registration details or even the identities of the brokers on the robot’s website.</p>



 Demo Account Access 



<p>The demo account is accessible to Bitcoin Bank users. Using the demo account, you can test out your strategies and learn more about how the trading bot works. This is quite beneficial because you may test out the service using fictitious money.</p>



 Appropriate for beginners 



<p>Because it is flexible, Bitcoin Bank helps both new and seasoned traders. Even for beginners, it is simple to develop and operate the trading bot thanks to the platform’s user-friendly interface.</p>



 Customer Service 



<p>There are numerous dedicated support organizations for crypto robots. The same applies to Bitcoin Bank. The team behind the robot claims to be able to do this because they have a reliable customer service portal.</p>



 How to Use Bitcoin Bank – Step-by-Step Guide 



 Step 1: Open an account 



<p>You must register on the robot’s platform in order to use its services using the form above. You can log in to the Bitcoin Bank website once verification is finished. In order to familiarize yourself with the robot’s interface, you can try out the demo version before being requested to deposit money.</p>



 Step 2: Make a Deposit 



<p>You must deposit $250 or more in order to start auto trading. You can start auto trading after the money has been deposited by swiping the sidebar to “On.”</p>



 Step 3: Monitor Trading Bot 



<p>If you have autotrading enabled, the robot will look for prospective trades on your behalf and carry them out through the broker’s interface. A trader may also choose manual trading and define the criteria for initiating or terminating a deal.</p>



 Bitcoin Bank vs other Trading Robots 



<p>Minimum Deposit: $250 (in-line with other trading bots and platforms)</p>



<p>Success Rate: 99.4% (much higher than other platforms like Immediate Edge with 90%)</p>



 Can you make money with Bitcoin Bank? 



<p>The goal of Bitcoin Bank’s automated trades and investments is to increase your chances of success. The bot does not, however, assure earnings, and precautions must be taken to lessen dangers in the cryptocurrency market. If you’re a newcomer to the industry, do extensive market research and create sound plans that you are confident in and that let you keep your spending under control. This is done so you can simply monitor the bot’s performance and profit from any profitable tendencies the robot might have missed.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that the Bitcoin Bank profits you receive are based on your contributions. Due to the robot’s leverage of 1000:1, you can earn up to $1,000 per day more than the money you invested. Therefore, before you start trading or investing, carefully estimate your possible profits and take into account your tax deductions from the IRS or HMRC.</p>



 Tips for new traders 



<p>Knowledge is everything while investing. Before actually starting to trade, even a seasoned trader will need to do some market research and analysis on the forex and cryptocurrency markets. Avoid trading using leverage while you’re just getting started because it can result in significant losses and is best avoided until you have more experience. Before choosing to deal with Bitcoin Bank, traders can take into account the following advice.</p>



  <p>Discover trading first. The features of the forex and cryptocurrency markets may not resemble those of the stock market to a novice. In order to reduce trading risk, it is always advisable to learn about trading on these markets and be familiar with strategic tools.</p>  <p>Recognize the cryptocurrency and forex markets. The main operations of cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange differ differently from each other and from other marketplaces. You will be obliged to store virtual money in wallets or on the platform if you are not working with a CFD broker. Therefore, find out how to establish security for your crypto assets.</p>  <p>Utilize a demo account to practice. Even if you have experience with forex or cryptocurrency trading, you should practice and open a demo account. This enables you to become familiar with the robot’s features.</p>  <p>Begin modestly. Always begin modest and expand your portfolio over time. Long-term investment plans are consistently the best ones.</p>  <p>If you can afford to lose money, invest it. Both the forex and cryptocurrency markets are risky and prone to volatility. As a result, the first and most important trading guideline is to only invest money that you can afford to lose.</p>  



 Has Bitcoin Bank Been Endorsed by Celebrities? 



 Dragons Den – Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden 



<p>No. A TV reality program called Dragons Den connects aspiring businesspeople with well-known ones throughout the world for finance and partnerships. There have been numerous episodes of the show so far, but none of them are focused on Bitcoin Bank. Although Bitcoin Bank and Dragons Den have not been specifically mentioned as of the time of writing, we have included them nonetheless because this is a program that is frequently mistakenly linked to cryptocurrency trading robots.</p>



 Elon Musk 



<p>No. Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX as well as a Bitcoin investor. Because of this, many people think he is connected to Bitcoin Bank. According to our study, there is no evidence that Musk supported or employed this robot to automate his investments.</p>



 Jeremy Clarkson 



<p>Despite claims and assertions, our research could not find a single shred of evidence backing up the fact that Jeremy Clarkson may have endorsed the Bitcoin Bank website.</p>



 Holly Marie Willoughby 



<p>Despite claims and assertions, our research could not find a single shred of evidence backing up the fact that Holly Marie Willoughby may have endorsed the Bitcoin Bank account.</p>



 Idris Elba 



<p>Despite claims and assertions, our research could not find a single shred of evidence backing up the fact that Idris Elba may have endorsed the Bitcoin Bank website.</p>



 Ant McPartlin 



<p>Despite claims and assertions, our research could not find a single shred of evidence backing up the fact that Ant McPartlin may have endorsed the Bitcoin Bank app.</p>



 Nicole Kidman 



<p>Despite claims and assertions, our research could not find a single shred of evidence backing up the fact that Nicole Kidman may have endorsed the Bitcoin Bank app.</p>



 Trevor Noah 



<p>Despite claims and assertions, our research could not find a single shred of evidence backing up the fact that Trevor Noah may have endorsed the Bitcoin Bank crypto trading platform.</p>



 Gordon Ramsey 



<p>No. Gordon Ramsay is a well-known British television presenter and celebrity chef. He has a fascination with cryptocurrencies, and there have been reports linking him to Bitcoin Bank. According to what we have discovered, he has neither sponsored Bitcoin Bank nor is he affiliated to the robot.</p>



 Is It Possible to Withdraw Earnings? 



<p>Your assets and earnings cannot be stored in a bitcoin wallet provided by Bitcoin Bank. Your funds can only be accessed through the brokers because it is linked to them and stores them there. The steps for taking your money out after it has been earned through automated trades and investments at Bitcoin Bank are listed below.</p>



  <p>Log into your trading or investment account on the platform of a broker that is connected to Bitcoin Bank.</p>  <p>Go to your wallet and select withdraw to begin the withdrawal procedure.</p>  <p>Choose your preferred payment option—PayPal or a bank—and enter it.</p>  <p>Enter the desired withdrawal amount.</p>  <p>The withdrawal procedure, which could take up to 24 hours to complete, can be started by clicking proceed.</p>  



<p>Remember that the majority of cryptocurrency brokers do not accept settlements in crypto assets, hence Bitcoin Bank accepts a number of fiat currencies to make the withdrawal process as simple as possible. Choose your favorite fiat currency as a result to make a successful withdrawal.</p>



 What are the fees for Bitcoin Bank? 



<p>Charges play a significant role in cryptocurrency trading. Here is a summary of the cryptocurrency robot’s fees structure from the website for our Bitcoin Bank review:</p>



<p>According to the Bitcoin Bank website, there are no costs associated with using the service. Profits earned are entirely yours. What is actually yours, though, is what’s left after your brokers’ fees are subtracted. Beyond the initial $250 deposit, you are under no obligation to hold onto or give Bitcoin Bank any additional funds.</p>



<p>Transaction Fees: None <br>Trading Commissions: None <br>Account Maintenance Fees: None <br>Hidden charges: None</p>



 FAQs 



  Is the Bitcoin Bank regulated? <p>It’s difficult to express this. On the Bitcoin Bank website, we couldn’t find much information about brokers and exchanges that are subject to regulation. However, as we have already indicated, we advise you to stay away from any brokers who offer absurdly high leverage on your deposit because they are almost certainly unregulated. CySec, FCA, ASIC, and FSB are the top regulators of cryptocurrency traders; seek any of these organizations before doing business with any dealer.</p>    Is Bitcoin Bank safe? <p>Your personal information is technically safe at Bitcoin Bank because SSL encryption is used to protect it. We cannot, however, ensure that your money will be secure and that you will benefit due to the problems with the difficult withdrawal process and the high level of risk associated with leveraged transactions.</p>    How user-friendly is Bitcoin Bank? <p>The navigation of the app itself, Bitcoin Bank, is simple. The user interface is elegant and rather simple. Fast account creation is likely a result of the company’s desire for you to deposit money and start trading. Use a demo account to practice trading without using real money if the Bitcoin Bank site is confusing you.</p>

<p>The Tesler trading system, sometimes known as 7Tesler, is promoted as an automated trading platform that seeks out winning trading setups and executes them on traders’ behalf.</p>



<p>The trading platform, which is also known as the Tesler trading app, states that it can trade a number of well-known cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin. Although 7Tesler doesn’t give much information regarding its historical performance, the trading platform’s website features good comments and endorsements from both present and former users.</p>



<p>However, phony reviews do exist. So, is the Tesler trading app real? We’ll examine this trading platform in depth in our 7Tesler review to assist traders in determining whether it’s appropriate for them.</p>



 Our Verdict 



<p>According to its description, 7Tesler is a cryptocurrency trading platform that can execute deals on users’ behalf and send out crypto signals. The site includes positive testimonials from previous and present users, but traders may wish to be skeptical of them since they were provided by the platform.</p>



<p>If you do decide to try 7Tesler trading out, be sure to test out a withdrawal as soon as possible because there are several warning signs that could indicate if the company is a scam or authentic circulating on Google and social media platforms.</p>



<p>Use the demo account first before making a larger real money deposit, as is the case with most crypto trade bot programs. This enables traders to test the platform and judge it for themselves.</p>

 Is 7Tesler a Scam? 



<p>Our 7Tesler review’s major objective is to provide a response to the question, “Is 7Tesler a scam or legitimate? We discovered that the 7Tesler trading platform utilizes an algorithm to trade Bitcoin and a number of well-known altcoins on behalf of traders. Additionally, we discovered that the site provides a demo trading account, allowing consumers to try out 7Tesler for free.</p>



<p>We also discovered that positive reviews for 7Tesler that are posted on the trading platform’s website are very positive. These positive reviews, which originate from previous and present customers, were chosen by 7Tesler.</p>



<p>The validity of these reviews cannot be determined, and it is unknown whether traders have profited from using 7Tesler. The risk involved in trading should never be underestimated, and past performance is no guarantee of future success.</p>



 What Is 7Tesler? 



<p>A trading program called 7Tesler finds possible trading opportunities in the prices of well-known cryptocurrencies. This is a platform for algorithmic or automated crypto trading.</p>



<p>The 7Tesler algorithm is able to recognise situations that could result in cryptocurrency trading profits. The platform can also execute trades on behalf of traders by funding trades with funds from their accounts. However, there is no assurance that traders will make money, and they should be aware that all trading involves risk.</p>



<p>Both experienced traders and those who are new to the cryptocurrency market can use 7Tesler’s platform, the company claims. The cryptocurrency trading platform is easy to use and quick to get started with.</p>



<p>The 7Tesler cryptocurrency software can currently trade four of the most well-known cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin. The platform is free to use, and there are no commissions taken from traders’ earnings. The sole financial need to begin utilising 7Tesler is to open a new account and deposit a minimum of $250.</p>



 How Does 7Tesler Work? 







<p>As the prices of cryptocurrencies rise and fall, the 7Tesler trading platform uses a complex algorithm to produce trade recommendations. Regarding this proprietary methodology, the platform does not give much information.</p>



<p>However, it might have been built to spot price patterns that have previously preceded successful price movements after being trained on several years’ worth of crypto market data. Since the 2017 cryptocurrency bull run, bitcoin robots have gained popularity.</p>



<p>When certain price patterns are identified, 7Tesler sends traders notifications. Additionally, the platform opens trades on its own, using funds from traders’ accounts to take positions in line with the coin signal. The 7Tesler algorithm monitors a trade’s development and closes the position when a stop loss or take profit level is reached.</p>



<p>All transaction proceeds, including any winnings, are then transferred back to traders’ accounts. The funds can then be withdrawn or utilised for another trade.</p>



<p>While 7Tesler is capable of identifying setups and trading on behalf of customers to generate profits, traders should keep in mind that there is no assurance that its signals are reliable. Trading is risky by nature.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Circuit is fully automated, much like other BTC trading robots, so you don’t need to do any preliminary study or keep an eye on the charts. Since no prior trading knowledge is necessary, Bitcoin Circuit is excellent for novices.</p>



<p>A number of AI-powered algorithms are supposed to form the backbone of Bitcoin Circuit’s software, each of which uses quantitative analysis methods to study the market and identify trading possibilities. All of this, according to the robot, is done in the background throughout the day to make sure you never miss a potentially profitable trade. After the transaction has been initiated, Bitcoin Circuit will keep track of it and close the position when it is most advantageous to do so.</p>



<p>The fact that this Bitcoin robot is absolutely free to download and operate might surprise you given the useful features it offers.

Finally, the robot only needs a $250 minimum deposit to start trading, but you can choose to use a demo account first to try out its features before trading with real money.</p>



 How Does Bitcoin Circuit Work? 



<p>According to rumours, Bitcoin Circuit functions by enabling entirely passive cryptocurrency investment. The robot itself is a piece of software that has been specially created, which you download and then configure using movable factors like your risk tolerance and trading frequency. The robot will start working and seeking possibilities as soon as you’ve done this and made a deposit.</p>



<p>With the aid of AI-powered algorithms, Bitcoin Circuit scans the market to unbiasedly identify opportunities. Since these algorithms are created to recognise trades regardless of the state of the market, Bitcoin Circuit is suitable for usage all year long.</p>



<p>The robot asserts that it will automatically open a position utilising the investment capital money in your account once a trade opportunity has been identified. Although the website doesn’t disclose which platforms are used by the proprietary Bitcoin Circuit software, the position is opened by one of Bitcoin Circuit’s partner brokers.</p>



<p>The algorithms running on Bitcoin Circuit will keep track of the trade once it has been opened and determine when it is best to close it out by putting take profit and stop loss orders.</p>



<p>At that point, Bitcoin Circuit will immediately close the position and add any accumulated gains to your trading balance. After that, the robot will return to the market and start looking for possibilities. This indicates that you have the option of taking a profit or investing it in more opportunities.</p>

 Key Features of Bitcoin Circuit Trading Account 



 Modern Trading Technologies 



<p>Bitcoin Circuit’s system is powered by cutting-edge technology, which enables it to purchase cryptocurrencies on your behalf. The technology’s specifics are a secret, although the website does state that it is AI-powered and uses a number of techniques. In the end, this makes trading less emotional and improves the procedure.</p>



 No cost demo account 



<p>The fact that Bitcoin Circuit offers a free demo account that you can try before trading for real will please new traders. The only difference between this account and the real one is that you’ll be utilising paper money rather than genuine cash. Overall, if traders are worried about safety or the usability of the platform, this feature can make them feel more at peace.</p>



 Adjustable Trading Options 



<p>Before trading, individuals with a higher risk tolerance who want to profit from cryptocurrency may choose to change the robot’s parameters. These settings, which affect the overall risk of the robot’s operations, include the number of trades executed each day and the risk-reward level.</p>



 No prior trading experience is necessary 



<p>The fact that the platform doesn’t require any prior trading knowledge to function was one of the most crucial aspects we noticed during our research of Bitcoin Circuit. Users do not even need to have a thorough understanding of the workings of the market to take advantage of Bitcoin Circuit because it does all the research and analysis for them.</p>



 Quick Registration Process 



<p>The Bitcoin Circuit sign-up procedure is highly simplified and can be finished in a matter of minutes. The complete procedure can be started online at the Bitcoin Circuit website. Users can immediately make a deposit to start trading after signing up, with both credit/debit card and PayPal deposits being accepted.</p>



 Feature for Manual Trading 



<p>Last but not least, Bitcoin Circuit even includes a manual trading feature that enables seasoned traders to adopt a more “hands-on” trading style. Although trade opportunities will still be presented by this function, they won’t be taken advantage of until the trader actually executes the trade. Choosing this strategy offers an enticing level of discretion, but it also requires traders to be available all day to execute deals.</p>

 Step 1: Open an account 



<p>Enter your name, email address, and phone number in the sign-up box at the top of this page. Following that, click “Open Your Account Now” to get an email with a link to confirm your account.</p>

 Step 3: Monitor Trading Bot 



<p>If you’d prefer, you can choose to use the demo account first after making a deposit. The only difference between this account and the live-trading account is that you will be using paper money to test out the robot’s functionality before trading with real money.</p>



<p>When you’re prepared to utilise Bitcoin Circuit, navigate to the account settings section and modify the settings to match your particular trading approach. Among the variables that can be altered are the risk-reward ratio and trade frequency.

 Is It Possible to Withdraw Earnings? 



<p>Money can be withdrawn from Bitcoin Circuit in the same manner that it is deposited. But keep in mind that your funds are held by the brokers to which they are linked, not by the bitcoin trading robot. Below are the procedures for money withdrawal from brokers who have collaborated with Bitcoin Circuit.</p>



  <p>Visit the broker’s website and log into your trading account.</p>  <p>In your wallet, select “withdraw” and then the preferred payment method.</p>  <p>Put in the desired withdrawal amount.</p>  <p>Once the process is finished, the money will be transferred to the specified account within 24 hours.</p>  



<p>Due to the fact that cryptocurrencies are not typically recognised as legal cash, Bitcoin Profit only pays out in fiat money. This implies that you must exchange your crypto assets into the fiat currency of your choice in order to execute a withdrawal, which takes 24 hours to accomplish.</p>



 What are the fees for Bitcoin Circuit? 



<p>As said previously, downloading and using Bitcoin Circuit’s proprietary technology is totally free. The method is really affordable because there aren’t any recurring subscription fees or deposit costs.</p>



<p>However, since Bitcoin Circuit uses a number of partner brokers to process trades, these companies might levy transaction costs and commissions. It’s a good idea to be aware of these fees before continuing since they are not levied by Bitcoin Circuit directly and can change.</p>

<p>Trusona, NEC, and Others Advance Open Standard to Improve QR Code Security in Passwordless Authentication</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 13 October, 2022 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced the approval of Secure QR Code Authentication v1.0 as an OASIS Standard. Developed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=esat">Electronic Secure Authentication (ESAT) Technical Committee</a>, the standard supports trusted online transactions by establishing a general framework for using QR Codes for “no password” authentication. The new standard is based on an initiative spearheaded by Trusona in order to democratize the mass adoption of passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>“QR codes are popular for fast, simple scanning using a smartphone camera, but privacy and security concerns are growing as QR code adoption has increased during the pandemic,” said OASIS ESAT co-chair, Bojan Simic, of HYPR. “Secure QR Code Authentication shows that passwordless authentication is possible without compromising on security.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The standard provides the layers of security needed to protect against account take-over and identity theft while decreasing the likelihood of potential phishing,” said Trusona’s David Kopack, co-chair of the ESAT TC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“NEC congratulates the ESAT TC on the approval of Secure QR Code Authentication Protocol v1.0 as an OASIS Standard and is pleased to be part of the ESAT TC and has contributed to its release,” said Shinichi Fuchigami, General Manager, Cyber Security Strategy Department at NEC Corporation. “NEC believes that “no password” authentication standards are critical for trusted online transactions and drive its adoption with industry partnerships to benefit customers.“</p>



<p>Vendors involved in authenticating electronic identities, passwordless authentication providers, identity service providers, local and national governments, businesses, and individuals engaged in eGovernment and eCommerce are welcome to participate in the ESAT community.</p>

<p>Crypto Genius is touted as a cryptocurrency trading tool that searches the market for potentially profitable trade signals using powerful algorithms. The platform’s software, according to its website, analyses information from various sources and automatically suggests new trades to consumers.</p>



<p>Because popular algorithmic trading platforms are very competitive, our guide will undertake a full examination of Crypto Genius. We investigate the essential aspects of this cryptocurrency trading platform to determine whether Crypto Genius is a legitimate trade bot or a fraud, as some comparable auto trading systems might be.</p>



 Our Verdict 



<p>The Crypto Genius trading bot provides for automated and manual trading in cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange, commodities, and indices, however, it has gotten varied evaluations from third parties. While the robot offers automated trading services, you should not count on it to generate thousands of dollars in profits.</p>



<p>The bot also employs false marketing strategies. Claims of celebrity connections or winning investment accolades are completely false. Furthermore, testimonials from customers who have made fortunes in a short period of time are difficult to accept and should be viewed as such.</p>



<p>Experts can use Crypto Genius’ manual trading option. This allows them to execute deals more quickly and without having to constantly watch market circumstances. Even experienced traders, however, are urged to invest wisely and thoroughly examine the many aspects of the robot before selecting it. Overall, do not rely exclusively on the cryptocurrency robot and instead conduct your own research.</p>

 Crypto Genius Pros and Cons 



 Pros: 



  <p>Multiple trading instruments are available</p>  <p>Offers a demo account</p>  <p>SSL encryption and security measures</p>  <p>24/7 customer service</p>  <p>Partners with reputable and regulated broker platforms</p>  



 Cons: 



  <p>Misleading marketing claims</p>  <p>Unverified testimonials</p>  <p>Multiple websites exist under the same name and provide similar services</p>  <p>Over-the-top claims about robot’s efficiency</p>  



 Is Crypto Genius a Scam? 



<p>Before registering, Crypto Genius discloses the majority of the account restrictions, features, and fees. According to the website, consumers can customise their trading preferences and give the software as much autonomy as they like.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Crypto Genius offers demo trading services that enable users to access account functions using fictitious money. Investors have complete access to their accounts and can withdraw their money whenever they choose.</p>



<p>Additionally, SSL encryption is supported by Crypto Genius, ensuring that security safeguards are in place to protect user data and money.</p>



<p>Because cryptocurrency trade bots are unregulated and some are scams, users can conduct their own due diligence on Crypto Genius and evaluate the site before investing. Only invest what you can afford to lose and test a withdrawal before committing to a bigger sum.</p>



 What Is Crypto Genius? 



<p>Crypto Genius has been trending on social media as a trading algorithm that might present investors with potentially winning transactions. According to the Crypto Genius website, the platforms’ software is meant to constantly analyse and scan volatile cryptocurrency markets.</p>



<p>The new cryptocurrency robot can then uncover new trade ideas and lead consumers through the investing process. Although we have not been able to verify the site’s claims.</p>



<p>Crypto Genius can also be used to diversify the funds of users. To begin, users can purchase BTC and other prominent cryptocurrencies using the digital asset signals provided by this software.</p>



<p>Additionally, according to Crypto Genius, trading is supported for FX currency pairs as well as commodities like gold and indices like the Dow Jones. Users can read our how to trade Gold guide and analysis for more details on this asset class.</p>



<p>Before investing with Crypto Genius, investors must go through a fast registration and verification process. The minimum deposit amount on this cryptocurrency platform is $250. The Crypto Genius website, on the other hand, states that there are no hidden fees or expenses when depositing cash.</p>



 How Does Crypto Genius Work? 



<p>After registration, users are given free access to the exclusive trading platform offered by Crypto Genius. The cryptocurrency markets are monitored by this novel trading algorithm, which locates potential trade opportunities. By combining analysis of 22 technical and fundamental variables, Crypto Genius asserts to be able to forecast price movement in real-time. As a result, the software can now detect when cryptocurrency is being sold for less money.</p>



<p>Notably, consumers have the option to customise how much autonomy they wish to grant the software from Crypto Genius. On one hand, traders manually compile real-time market information and choose whether to make new trades.</p>



<p>Crypto Genius, on the other hand, searches the markets 24 hours a day, seven days a week and executes deals on the user’s behalf. When funds are deposited into the trading account, the software begins to work and assigns the funds to several trades.</p>



<p>Crypto Genius claims to have collaborated with various brokers to facilitate transactions. When the software gathers market information, it uses API keys to provide it to the brokers. Without requiring any human interaction, the brokers quickly carry out these orders.</p>



 Crypto Genius Overview 



<p>Supported Cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP &amp; BAT</p>



<p>Withdrawal Time: 24 – 48 hours</p>



<p>Minimum Deposit: $250</p>



 Key Features of Crypto Genius Trading Platform 



<p>The Crypto Genius trading platform includes various tools that help investors with their trading. The sections that follow showcase and discuss some of the most important features that Crypto Genius offers.</p>



 Trading with Leverage 



<p>Leverage trading is a high-risk, high-reward operation that Crypto Genius says it supports. By boosting their leverage on the trading platform by a factor of 1:100, consumers can raise the value of their transactions without investing more funds.</p>



<p>Contrarily, leveraged trading is a double-edged sword. The likelihood of making money is the same as the likelihood of losing money. Users with low risk tolerance might wish to stay away from using this feature as a result.</p>



 Opportunities for Diversification 



<p>It enables investment in a range of asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, commodities, indices, and FX trading pairs, claims Crypto Genius. As a result, unlike the other automated trading systems we looked at, it is not just a Bitcoin robot.</p>



<p>Customers can first access some of the biggest cryptos and altcoins on the market. Through Crypto Genius, users may buy ETH, BTC, LTC, and other digital assets. Contrarily, investing in deflationary assets like gold enables people to diversify their portfolios.</p>



<p>Finally, long-term investors can access forex currency trading pairs and trade on national exchange rates using Crypto Genius.</p>



 Account for demo trading 



<p>On their website, Crypto Genius claims to have a demo mode. Users can invest in virtual currency through a demo trading account to have a better grasp of the features and tools that this platform offers.</p>



<p>Due to the sample account’s accurate simulation of current market conditions, investors will be able to inspect the Crypto Genius schematics firsthand. Traders can go back to traditional mode and start trading right away after analysing the platform.</p>



 Customer Support 



<p>All traders, according to Crypto Genius, receive 24-hour customer care. You can speak with the customer chat service prior to enrolling. By phone, email, or live chat, the customer care team helps traders with all of their trading-related needs and questions.</p>



<p>Additionally, Crypto Genius offers users the chance to submit input on the operation and functioning of the platform.</p>



 How to Use Crypto Genius – Step-by-Step Guide 



 Step 1: Open an account 



<p>To begin, users can utilise the above signup form. To create an account, enter your full name, email address, and phone number.</p>



<p>When a user’s registration is confirmed, they become a new member of the Crypto Genius community. Its trading robot programme is now available.</p>



 Step 2: Verify your Account 



<p>Following the sign-up process, Crypto Genius will send verification links to the user’s phone number and email address. Within 30 minutes, traders can access the trading dashboard after successfully authenticating their identities.</p>



<p>The associated broker platforms connected to Crypto Genius will also complete a quick KYC and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) process.</p>



 Step 3: Make a Deposit 



<p>Traders are required to fund their accounts once verification is finished. A $250 or EUR 250 minimum deposit is needed to start playing on Crypto Genius.</p>



<p>The site accepts a variety of payment methods, including VISA, MasterCard, PayPal, and Neteller, to mention a few. Select your preferred payment option and complete the transaction.</p>



 Step4: Monitor Trading Bot 



<p>On Crypto Genius, users may now customise their desired settings. By selecting the auto trading option, the software will begin making transactions on the user’s behalf. The software discovers prospective trades and creates new positions based on the funds available.</p>



<p>On the other side, users can set their settings such that they can use the account manually. In this case, traders can take use of the software’s data-driven insights and trade signals. Investors have the option to manually open fresh trades as needed.</p>



 Crypto Genius vs other Trading Robots 



<p>$250 minimum initial investment&nbsp;(compared to other platforms with higher deposit requirements)</p>



<p>Easy KYC procedure (compared to other platforms with massive amounts of information required).</p>



 Can you make money with Crypto Genius? 



<p>Our research on The Crypto Genius revealed that the trading robot looks to be safe to utilise. To safeguard users, it has extensive security features such as SSL encryption, anti-virus, and anti-phishing methods.</p>



<p>However, The Crypto Genius claims to have a 99.4% success record, which our investigators were unable to verify. While the automated trading software is safe to use, you should be cautious about its capacity to regularly create winning trades.</p>



<p>The Crypto Genius software is not governed by any authority. It is basically a tool that may be linked to a trading account to execute deals automatically. However, the platforms and cryptocurrency brokers with which it collaborates are all regulated. CySEC, one of Europe’s largest and most respected regulatory agencies, has licenced several of its partners.</p>



<p>When using The Crypto Genius trading tool, there is no need to make any financial deposits with the website. Instead, you deposit money with one of its partner brokers, all of whom, as mentioned above, hold CySEC licences. Many brokers participate in compensation systems under regulation, which offer some amount of protection.</p>



 Tips for new traders 



<p>Before trading, even with a robot, beginners need to comprehend the bitcoin trading space. You should also not rely on the robot’s claims and instead, conduct your own research and due diligence before beginning to trade. Here are some things to think about before utilising a cryptocurrency trading robot.</p>



  <p>Learn the basics of trading. A novice should be aware of how bitcoin investments work. You must investigate various risk-mitigation tactics, such as how to set stop losses and daily trades to minimise losses.</p>  <p>Understand the bitcoin market. Never invest in a market that you are unfamiliar with. Trading in the cryptocurrency market is still in its early stages. Prices are volatile, and even minor price differences can result in massive losses when trading with leverage.</p>  <p>Begin with a trial account. It is best to begin trading on a demo account first. This way, you may become acquainted with crypto trading and the robot without putting your money at danger.</p>  <p>Begin small and progressively expand. Begin trading with tiny quantities rather than large ones. Step by step, build your trading portfolio.</p>  <p>Invest just what you can afford to lose. Remember that the claims that Crypto Genius users make $1,000s each day are absolutely unsubstantiated. When it comes to trading, there are no guarantees. Trade slowly and carefully.</p>  



 Has Crypto Genius Been Endorsed by Celebrities? 



 Dragons Den – Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden 



 Elon Musk 



<p>Elon Musk is an entrepreneur who founded SpaceX, Tesla Motors, and Solar City. He’s also a powerful celebrity, capable of having a massive impact on markets all across the world with a single comment. If he came out in support of Bitcoin, for example, headlines would scream, “Elon Supports Crypto Genius platform!” Despite intensive online searches, our team was unable to find any evidence or clue that this had occurred!</p>



 Jeremy Clarkson 



<p>We were unable to locate proof of Jeremey Clarkson’s sponsorship of the Crypto Genius software after analysing rumours of the same.</p>



 Holly Marie Willoughby 



<p>Holly Marie Willoughby, a well-known and popular TV presenter in the United Kingdom, is claimed to have created a campaign for an unnamed bitcoin trading platform. However, there is no evidence to support this assertion.</p>



 Idris Elba 



<p>Idris Elba is a multi-award-winning actor, singer, and entrepreneur. He’s also the star of “Luther,” a new Netflix series in which he plays Detective John Luther; but how does Idris feel about investing? Our team sought for evidence that this man was involved with Crypto Genius crypto trading platform but couldn’t find any.</p>



 Ant McPartlin 



<p>According to a recent rumour, TV star Ant McPartlin may have made a Bitcoin crypto trading platform investment. He is believed to be an actor, producer/host of one of Britain’s most popular television programmes, and occasional musician. Is this a true story? We don’t know for sure, but given his interests outside of Hollywood, it wouldn’t be surprising—he might find value in investing early in such innovative technology before any major setbacks are observed or experienced by others who do invest later down the line.</p>



 Nicole Kidman 



<p>Nicole Kidman, the Oscar-winning actress well known for her appearances in films including as Moulin Rouge!, has recently been linked to a possible investment in Crypto Genius software. Our team was unable to find any evidence that she is actively involved in this endeavour, but we are not ruling anything out!</p>



 Trevor Noah 



<p>The Daily Show’s Trevor Noah has been linked to Crypto Genius. Many people believe he became wealthy as a result of his involvement with bitcoin, but the truth is that he became wealthy as a result of his humorous experience and job on The Daily Show, for which he was paid substantially more than most comedians. As far as we know, there is no evidence that Trevor invested in Crypto Genius, so there is nothing more to say about him using it!</p>



 Gordon Ramsey 



<p>Gordon Ramsay is a global culinary and entertainment success story. His work as an author and chef on television shows such as Hell’s Kitchen has gained him international renown during the last decade or so. However, given his experience in these areas, there are suspicions that he may be supporting Crypto Genius software; however, no real evidence of this assertion has been revealed, thus it remains merely a rumour.</p>



 Is It Possible to Withdraw Earnings? 



<p>The money you deposit is retained by the broker you enrolled with, not by your Crypto Genius account. Take the following steps to exit the platform:</p>



  <p>Log in to your account on the brokerage platform’s website.</p>  <p>After you’ve selected your preferred payment method, click withdraw money.</p>  <p>After inputting the desired withdrawal amount, click the confirm button.</p>  <p>Once that is completed, the funds should begin to show in your bank account immediately.</p>  



<p>Keep in mind that most brokers who have incorporated the Crypto Genius crypto trading platform only allow withdrawals in fiat currencies such as USD. Crypto Genius does not offer prizes in the form of digital wallets or cryptocurrencies.</p>



 What are the fees for Crypto Genius? 



<p>In comparison to its competitors, Crypto Genius platform promises to have relatively low platform fees. To begin, there are no registration or software fees with Crypto Genius.</p>



<p>Deposits on this cryptocurrency trading platform are cost-free. Additionally, the platform has no unstated costs. Only successful trades generate commissions for the Crypto Genius platform. The user receives the balance back.</p>



<p>Withdrawals are made using the trading dashboard. Users must complete a form in order to seek a withdrawal amount. To access this trading dashboard, you must first click on a verification link in your email.</p>



 FAQs 



  Is Crypto Genius legit? <p>Crypto Genius offers trading services in bitcoin and other markets, however it employs deceptive marketing tactics and makes unsubstantiated promises on its website. Its testimonials indicate that users have reaped significant benefits from the trading bot, however reviews from third-party sources show that the robot’s performance falls short of these aggressive claims.<br><br>The robot is said to have new inventions to anticipate and complete transactions, however even with cutting-edge technology, a success rate of 99.4% seems impractical (as claimed by Crypto Genius). It appears from the video on the company’s website that the robot may be connected to important investors. That’s incorrect.</p>    Can I withdraw cryptocurrency from Crypto Genius? <p>No. Because the brokers with whom Crypto Genius has collaborated allow CFD trading in crypto assets, all withdrawals are made in fiat money. This sum will be deposited directly into your bank account.</p>    How much does it cost to use Crypto Genius? <p>According to its official website, Crypto Genius does not impose any fees or commissions. This is a little misleading, though, as broker fees will be charged. The trader is required to make a payment for each transaction made through the affiliated broker. Even if the trade does not go in your favour, the price is still charged.</p>

<p>Mountain View, Calif., October 13, 2022- The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> today announced the latest addition to its range of certification programs to address the rising need for stronger, simpler online identity verification: the Document Authenticity (DocAuth) Certification Program. The program allows vendors to certify that their mobile document verification solutions accurately determine if a government-issued identity document is authentic, matches the presented user, and complies with the performance criteria set forth in FIDO Alliance’s Document Authenticity (DocAuth) Requirements. Multiple vendors have started the certification process and the first FIDO DocAuth Certified products are anticipated to be available in early 2023.</p>



<p>As high-value services increasingly move online – from banking applications to government services – demand is rising for more robust verification solutions to validate user identities remotely by leveraging trusted government-issued ID documents. Accurate remote identity verification is also critical at the point of account creation, prior to FIDO authentication, and during the account recovery process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DocAuth Certification Program provides a standard testing process for organizations to prove their products can validate different government-issued ID document types across multiple geographies, and that they are fit for commercial use. For service providers, the program provides a benchmark when evaluating multiple vendors to ensure they meet global performance standards and can assist in stopping bad actors from creating accounts using fake or stolen documentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“FIDO Alliance was pleased to collaborate with our FIDO Accredited laboratory partners on this important program, as accurately verifying a user’s identity during initial account creation is a critical step in the overall integrity of the account – and also strengthens the security of subsequent FIDO-based sign-ins,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewshikiar/">Andrew Shikiar</a>, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “The launch of FIDO’s Document Authenticity Certification Program gives service providers a FIDO Certified mark to ensure the mobile document verification solutions they choose have met globally-recognized standards and can assist them in providing greater security across the entire account lifecycle. We look forward to seeing the first FIDO DocAuth Certified products early next year.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Program Details&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DocAuth Certification Program provides certification performance criteria for vendors, and sets test procedures that FIDO Accredited Laboratories use for evaluating mobile document verification solution capabilities. A full list of FIDO Accredited Document Authenticity Laboratories can be found <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/docauth">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program is open to vendors seeking certification for their mobile document verification solutions. Vendors who achieve certification receive a Document Authenticity Certificate, as well as granted use of the FIDO Certified mark, to demonstrate they have passed the well-defined testing administered by the FIDO Alliance and Accredited Laboratories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO Document Authenticity Certification is independent of other FIDO certification programs. There are no FIDO Certification prerequisites to apply for Document Authenticity Certification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance plans to expand its identity verification program in 2023 with the launch of a face verification certification, including performance criteria requirements that address liveness and selfie-match.</p>



<p>About the FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://www.fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we’re raising awareness of the most frightening social engineering attacks and how we can banish these monsters to the past…</p>



<p>Megan Shamas, senior director of marketing, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Cybercriminals are like trick or treaters – knocking on doors and helping themselves to your freely-given credentials. Whether traditional phishing emails or more sophisticated deepfake-bolstered attacks, our digital lives and the proliferation of passwords are making us increasingly vulnerable to the cyber threat.</p>



<p>Awareness is a core part of FIDO Alliance’s mission to move the world away from passwords to simpler, stronger authentication. Standards and technology is just one half of solving cybersecurity challenges – we have a duty to educate and provide the best information and resources to help everyone make smart decisions in whatever online environment they’re in – whether you’re at work, studying, or in your personal life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why we love working with CISA and NCSAM and their efforts around Cybersecurity Awareness Month, as it gets to the ‘people’ part of cybersecurity. And undoubtedly, when we think of that ‘people’ part, phishing and social engineering attacks are top of the list.</p>



<p>To promote this year’s Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we’ve taken inspiration from the impending spooky season to unmask the scariest techniques and technologies criminals are using to steal your sweet candy credentials – and, how to stop them.</p>



<p>The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing&nbsp;</p>


 
 


<p>The online world can be a great space for finding friends, work, and romance. But wolves can be lurking behind friendly chats and interactions. These types of attacks are quite sophisticated, and usually take place over an extended period while the attacker wins the trust of their unsuspecting victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plenty of Fish can quickly become Plenty of Phish, catching consumers when they have their guard down and least expect anything. The recent Netflix documentary ‘Tinder Swindler’ is a great example of how convincing and persistent these fraudsters can be. When forming relationships online, remember that those on the other end of apps might not always be who they seem before sharing any sensitive information that could help them take over your online accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ghosts of Phishmas Past&nbsp;</p>



<p>An email from the bank wanting to confirm your details. A text from couriers asking you to reschedule your delivery. The cheery retailer message to say you’ve won $100 to spend if you register a new account.</p>



<p>You might think you’ve seen and heard it all before, but these older, tried and tested phishing techniques are haunting us and are still by far the most effective. Take the <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/royal-mail-delivery-text-scam-exposed-how-a-scammer-tried-to-take-4000-aZMlt5B41mXN">Royal Mail SMS scam</a> that blew up last Christmas time in the UK, or the recent global attack on <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/catches-of-the-month-phishing-scams-for-september-2022">Facebook Business/ad users</a>. An estimated <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/three-in-five-people-have-received-a-scam-delivery-text-in-the-last-year-aA3fF1B3qT81">three in five were targeted by fake delivery text messages</a> in 2021. As both the volume and quality of attacks continue to rise, the simplest of phishing and smishing could catch any of us out.</p>



<p>The Shapeshifter</p>



<p>You’ve no doubt seen funny viral videos of deepfakes, like Tom Cruise singing, or heard of the fake videos created of Ukranian President Zelensky earlier this year. But deepfake technology isn’t just limited to comedy and political attacks – this technology is becoming both more readily available and more convincing, bringing to the fore even more effective attacks on everyday consumers. Back in June, the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/29/fbi_deepfake_job_applicant_warning/">FBI even issued a warning to employers about fake employees using the technology to apply for jobs under false pretences</a> to defraud organisations.</p>



<p>Deepfake video and audio is now being used to bolster more standard phishing attacks and convince victims they’re engaging with those closest to them to pressure them into giving away sensitive information and details.</p>



<p>The Terminator</p>



<p>This is one type of social engineering attack that should send shivers down your spine. Recent advances in AI and machine learning are enabling attackers to automate highly targeted attacks – known as spear-phishing – by data scraping and integrating convincing details like name, date of birth and employer details, into attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By revealing just enough legitimate information, consumers are lured into a false sense of security and even more likely to share credentials. Now automated at an alarming rate and level of sophistication, this is one attack that will keep coming back… that is, if we don’t find a strong enough defence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boo, Passwords!</p>



<p>The only way we can truly protect ourselves from sharing our most precious credentials online is to not have credentials we can share in the first place. If passwords are like Halloween candy at our doors, moving to something we simply can’t share like FIDO cryptographic-based signs ins and on-device biometrics means even if you fall for the trick, fraudsters are going hungry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO authentication, created by global collaboration of the world’s biggest tech companies, numerous service providers and security stakeholders, is the only widely available phishing-resistant authentication method. Increasingly, governments like the US and the UK are citing FIDO as the ‘gold standard’ for organisations to implement and access robust cybersecurity. FIDO technology is readily available for companies big and small to implement and, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-implemented-fido2-and-zero-trust/">as Cloudflare’s recent thwarted cyberattacks shows</a>, it’s effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO technology is about to become more readily available and ubiquitous among consumers too. Earlier this year, the world’s biggest platforms – <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">Apple, Google and Microsoft – committed to supporting our new security key standards, FIDO multi-device credentials, also known as ‘passkeys’</a>. This means, across our most favoured browsers and devices, we’ll soon be able to access FIDO-based passwordless sign-in technology with the same gestures we use every day on mobile devices, using biometrics or PIN.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we’re urging service providers to get phishing-resistant passwordless authentication on their roadmap so consumers can make the move to passwordless – or at the very least, using passwords less – so we can leave these social engineering monsters toothless.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Earlier this year we started a new <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/">project to examine and strengthen our digital resilience</a>, in an effort to further integrate social justice principles into our tech choices and practices and deepen our capacity to support our partners.</p>



<p>We use the term “digital resilience” to refer to a set of practices that enable an organisation to protect itself from — and respond to — digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its people, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to ever-changing needs and contexts.</p>



<p>As part of this project, we have been <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/">reflecting on our own practices</a> in order to better understand our digital resilience needs and also mapping digital resilience issues that social justice organisations we work with are facing, as well as strategies to approach them.</p>



<p>For this mapping process, we are gathering data from our support programmes and research projects to identify common challenges our partners are grappling with, ranging from organisational security and technical concerns, to tool selection and values alignment, and accessibility issues. In this blog post, we share an overview of the main challenges we’ve mapped so far. Given the complex and intricate nature of digital resilience, many of the themes intersect with one another.</p>



 Tool selection: a balancing act 



<p>Tool selection, one of the most pressing challenges cited by organisations, involves two key aspects: 1) a practical aspect, related to selecting tools that meet organisational needs and technical capacities and 2) a principle aspect, related to ensuring the tools align with organisational values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, selecting the right tool is about simultaneously addressing technical needs and aligning with mission and advocacy goals. But addressing both can be difficult. Social justice organisations we work with mentioned limited knowledge about existing tools and an absence of internal expertise to support tool selection as some of the obstacles they face while trying to make tech decisions they feel confident about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Tech choices in low-tech environments 



<p>Tool selection can also be difficult when working in a low-tech or limited-connectivity context. For many social justice organisations — especially those in the Majority World — navigating between selecting tools according to values and facing context-specific limitations can be a delicate and demanding balancing act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organisations frequently ask us questions about managing data responsibly when working within a low-tech environment, or when there are limitations on tools due to organisational capacity. For example, some organisations that had chosen to work with open-source, privacy-respecting tools for video conferencing due to organisational security concerns ended up having to move back to proprietary platforms after facing severe connectivity issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their efforts to improve digital resilience, some of our partners frequently found themselves confronting hard decisions between ease of use and familiarity versus security and privacy concerns. Partners noted that, in choosing to continue to communicate sensitive information across social media platforms, they needed to prioritise convenience and accessibility. While many are interested in finding more secure ways to communicate, they fear that switching from popular platforms could decrease their impact and ability to communicate with audiences/partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making justice-focused tech decisions isn’t always a straightforward process, and it can take a lot of trial and error (like our colleague Steffania explained in this <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/">post about our new video conferencing tools</a>!) and many organisations described feeling frustrated and confused on how to move forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’d like support identifying tools that fit your needs, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">schedule a call with our team!</a> You can also take a look at <a href="https://alidade.tech/">Alidade</a>, an interactive tool that explains what to look for when using technology for social change.</p>



 Pathways to digital resilience: access to information&nbsp; 



<p>Being able to access knowledge about tech and data, including information about digital security, tool selection and responsible data is another important aspect of digital resilience we identified during this first phase of the project. Factors with a negative impact on digital resilience decision-making include:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/takeaways-from-our-community-call-on-intersections-between-data-digital-rights-and-social-justice/">Barriers to information about tech and data</a>.  Lack of language diversity of existing resources for digital resilience.&nbsp;  Insufficient level of context-relevance of existing resources.&nbsp;  



<p>Even when organisations know where to find information to help them navigate conversations about digital resilience, most resources are published in English and aren’t necessarily focused on the realities of social justice organisations in resource-constrained environments.</p>



 Digital rights threats and their impact on civil society organisations&nbsp; 



<p>We also heard repeated concerns regarding government surveillance and internet shutdowns. These are key areas within the digital resilience conversation and they fundamentally influence the way organisations go about their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Internet shutdowns are <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/internet-shutdowns-and-elections-handbook/">“intentional disruptions of internet or electronic communications</a>, rendering them inaccessible or effectively unusable, for a specific population or within a location, often to exert control over the flow of information.” The <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/ending-internet-shutdowns-path-forward-report-special-rapporteur-rights-freedom">number of governments imposing internet shutdowns is growing and t</a>he practice is not limited to authoritarian regimes: it has been observed in <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/07/1095142">long-established democracies and more recent democracies</a> alike. At the same time, digital security is being increasingly criminalised and politicised by repressive states, with <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2022/04/2021-KeepItOn-Report-1.pdf">some countries also targeting internet shutdown circumvention tools</a>, such as browsers and tools based on Tor technology, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and proxies that use encryption.<br><br>Government surveillance is one <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/petition/targeted-surveillance-human-rights-defenders/">major cause for concern for human rights defenders</a> and civil society organisations, as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/freedom-of-expression/">many states have been using technologies</a> to surveil: to read activists and journalists’ private emails and remotely turn on their computers’ camera or microphone to secretly record their activities. <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2021/06/Helpline-10000-cases-report.pdf">Governments around the world are investing in their capacity to silence dissent</a>, through tools for both mass and targeted surveillance.&nbsp;Journalists, workers for non-governmental organisations defending human rights, and <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/for-rights-defenders-cyber-is-the-new-battleground/">women’s rights organisations are particularly at risk of government surveillance</a>. In many countries, <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/disparate-impact-surveillance/?agreed=1">communities of colour are subject to disproportionate levels of surveillance.</a></p>



<p>These digital rights threats need to be taken into account when designing security support interventions, and when thinking about digital resilience of civil society organisations more broadly. Despite the level of concern, we heard that organisations found it difficult to plan for threats or predict impacts. Addressing concerns about government surveillance, for instance, could look very different from one organisation to the next, depending on what they do and where they’re based.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our team offers pro-bono support to social justice organisations interested in improving their digital resilience: <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">schedule a call with us to learn more!</a> And if you/your organisation are facing a digital security emergency, <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/help/">Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline</a> offers real-time, direct technical assistance and advice to civil society groups &amp; activists, media organisations, journalists &amp; bloggers, and human rights defenders.</p>



 Access to resources: digital resilience doesn’t just happen! 



<p>Many social justice organisations we work with face challenges related to digital security and tech infrastructure, and some are unable to fully address these <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/social-justice-digital-rights-during-covid-19-barriers-to-collaboration/">without access to dedicated funding, resources and relevant networks</a>. Through our work with social justice organisations, we’ve seen how difficult it can be for them to focus on digital resilience, since most are overworked and tending to pressing needs from the communities they serve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even when there are financial resources available, seeking out support (and information!) about&nbsp; digital security and tech infrastructure — from knowing how to find trusted support and networks in the first place, to being able to stay up to date with a shifting landscape for digital threats, to figuring out what tech is right for the organisation – is a process that can consume a significant amount of time, energy and resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">How to think about tech when you don’t have time to think about tech:</a> We know that rethinking an organisation’s use of tech and data does take quite a bit of time (and resources!). So we wrote a short blog post with ideas for low(ish) hanging fruits that organisations can start tackling to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">slowly improve their tech and data landscape</a>.</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, October 12, 2022  –Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Edge’s Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, will be joining fellow thought leaders at the New Jersey Equity in Commercialization Collective (NJECC) Annual Conference, “Innovation for Impact: Commercializing Academic Discovery,” on October 27, 2022. This event aims to create sustainable connections between various innovation ecosystem participants and increase equity within the innovation community to fuel more opportunities for female inventors and commercialization gatekeepers.</p>
<p>Dr. Ghahramani will be a panelist and moderator of the Engaging More Women in Academic Innovation panel with speakers Kimberly Foster, Dean of Engineering, Tulane University; Joanne Wong, Chair, IEEE Entrepreneurship; Wayne Embree, Executive Vice President, Investments &amp; Venture Development, Rev1 Ventures, Inc.; and Elizabeth L. Dougherty, Eastern Regional Outreach Director, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
<p>Published earlier this year, Dr. Ghahramani was one of the co-authors of the “Engaging More Women in Academic Innovation,”in the National Academy of Inventors: Technology &amp; Innovation, This paper outlines the key findings from a survey of academic women from public and private research institutions who are involved in innovation, invention, and/or entrepreneurship. “I look forward to sharing the insights revealed from this study with conference participants and leading a discussion with thought leaders and innovation champions on what actions could be taken to address barriers and ensure systemic change to support greater engagement of academic women and other under-represented populations in innovation,” noted Dr. Ghahramani.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://www.njeccadvance.com/njecc-annual-conference">NJECC Annual Conference</a> page to learn more about this event and this year’s speakers. You can also <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/nai/ti/pre-prints/content-22.32wisig">download</a> the Engaging More Women in Academic Innovation report to explore the important themes that emerged from the survey and the suggested strategies for fostering inclusion of all inventors in the innovation lifecycle.</p>
 
<p>ABOUT NJECC:</p>
<p>NJECC, an NSF ADVANCE Partnership, addresses gender equity issues in academic technology commercialization (patenting, licensing, and startup creation) by focusing on the elimination of systemic institutional and entrepreneurial ecosystem barriers. NJECC partners with universities and institutions throughout New Jersey as part of its systemic change initiative to increase the diversity of STEM faculty researchers who participate in New Jersey’s entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/inclusive-and-ethical-uses-of-digital-identity/">Inclusive and Ethical Use of Digital Identity Working Group (IEUDI)</a> have written a research and discussion paper report looking into inclusivity and ethics in digital identity.</p>



<p>Purpose of this paper</p>



<p>The purpose of this paper is to research existing mahi in the areas of inclusivity and ethics in digital identity. Once we have this understanding, we can identify any gaps and consider how we might address them, consider developing a Code of Practice and make overall recommendations to the Executive Council for DINZ.</p>



<p>Paper Overview</p>



<p>The paper has looked at work happening in Aotearoa and Overseas.</p>



<p>The specific scope of this work is:</p>



  Help ensure inclusive, ethical and responsible use of digital identity technologies that enable equitable digital identity outcomes for all New Zealanders.  Build an understanding of the views and roles of relevant advocacy groups (for example but not limited to Citizens Advice Bureau, NZ Council for Civil Liberties etc) in the adoption of digital identity technologies – inclusive of and accessible&nbsp;to all – with optional alternatives, especially for public services.  Provide constructive forums for discourse with groups that are either clearly disadvantaged in relation to digital identity or have concerns about the potential future uses of digital identity.

<p>A useful way to think about the<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/"> DID standard</a> is as a mechanism to bootstrap trust in an identifier. Implementers can define DID Methods that define how to resolve a DID Document from a DID URL. The most widely used DID method today is the Key DID. </p><p>This method is extremely simple and doesn’t have some of the more advanced features, such as key rotation, that the DID standard enables. However, there are still big challenges with using DIDs. Privacy being a big one. A<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods"> wide range of different DID methods</a> that are not compatible is another. This article explores how to build a DID method that is both<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/upgradeable-decentralized-identity/"> composable</a> (i.e. it builds on existing DID methods) while also adding privacy.</p> 3ID and Its Limitations <p>While Ceramic supports multiple different DID methods, 3ID is the main DID method that leverages the network directly. 3ID has gone through two iterations so far. Let’s take a brief look at them, their limitations, and consider potential future iterations.</p> The static 3IDv0 <p>The first iteration of 3ID kept things super simple and worked similarly to a Key DID in that it was immutable. However, it added some flexibility by allowing the use of a variety of different key types in one DID document. For example, a secp256k1 key for signature verification and a x25519 key for receiving encrypted messages. These keys were simply stored in an IPLD object, the CID of which is used as the DID<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#a-simple-example"> identifier</a>. To resolve a 3IDv0 one simply needs to resolve the IPLD object from its CID, e.g. using IPFS.</p><p>The main limitation of 3IDv0 was that it was not possible to do any sort of key rotation. Once the DID is created the public keys provided up front are the keys for this DID forever.</p> More Flexibility With 3IDv1 <p>The first version of 3ID was designed to enable key rotation and multi-account identity. By using the built-in conflict resolution of Ceramic’s streams, updating the DID document of a 3ID became straight forward. In this case, a<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/advanced/standards/stream-programs/tile-document/"> Tile stream type</a> represented the 3ID by storing the public keys in the JSON content of the Tile document. The StreamID of the Tile is then used as the DID identifier. By combining this updatable 3ID with another Ceramic stream type, caip10-links, multiple wallet accounts from different blockchains could be linked to a single 3ID.</p><p>While 3IDv1 is more flexible than its predecessor, there are still some significant limitations, primarily around privacy. All verification methods (e.g. public keys) in the DID document are public. There is no way to add a verification method that is unknown to the public observer. Furthermore, the caip10-links necessitated doxxing of the wallet account, creating a permanent link between the account and the 3ID, that even if removed would leave a trace in the caip10-link event log. Finally, UX for actually using a 3IDv1 was not optimal because the keys referenced in the DID Document were long lived. This led to weak security in a browser context and the reliance on an iframe for key management.</p> Desired properties of 3IDv2 <p>One of the most difficult things to achieve in a publicly verifiable, permissionless system is privacy. This is true for blockchains, and it’s also true for data networks like Ceramic. In blockchains, zero-knowledge proofs are being utilized to provide various sorts of privacy enhancements. Could the 3ID DID method utilize zkp and other techniques to achieve greater privacy as well? First, let’s start by defining what functionality would be desired in a privacy-focused 3ID:</p>  Ability to add and remove verification methods without publicly disclosing their public keys  Selective disclosure of verification methods  Ability to generate a signature issued by the 3ID without revealing which verification method was invoked  Ability to privately graft (i.e. upgrade) existing DIDs to a 3ID (e.g. a caip10-link but private)  Selective disclosure of grafted DIDs   Primitives for Composable Identity <p>Let’s have a look at what primitives we have available to us, or can construct, in order to achieve the properties described above.</p> Generative DID Methods <p>A generative DID method can be defined as a DID where the DID Document can be statically generated from the DID URL. This means that there is no need to look up state from a blockchain or do any other sort of network requests. It also means that it’s not possible to update or remove the DID Document since it is deterministically generated from the DID URL. There are two prominent examples of generative DID methods:</p><p><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a> - every DID URL is a public key with an associated multicode to uniquely identify the key type. In order to generate the DID Document, the public key is simply translated into the appropriate verification method.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md">DID PKH</a> - short for public key hash, this method essentially makes all blockchain accounts into DIDs. This is achieved by relying on the CAIP-10 account ID standard to identify a specific account on a specific blockchain. The DID URL gets translated to the DID Document using the special blockchain account verification method, which also relies on CAIP-10.</p><p>The stream type caip10-link in Ceramic was created before DID PKH existed in order to have a simple stream type controlled by a blockchain account. This functionality can now easily be replaced by any stream type, such as Tile Document or Model Instance Document by using DID PKH.</p> Object-Capabilities <p>Signing every data transaction with your DID PKH (e.g. your crypto wallet) makes for less than ideal UX. In order to address this problem, object-capabilities (OCAP) and session keys can be used. The<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/capability-based-data-security-on-ceramic/"> article on CACAO</a> explains how this works in detail, but for context let’s have a look at how OCAPs can be used.</p>  A session key (DID Key) is randomly generated  An authorization message (e.g.<a href="https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361"> SIWE</a>) is generated which contains the DID Key URL and an array of resources being authorized  A signature request over this message is sent to the wallet (DID PKH)  The message + signature can now be used as an OCAP, that together with the session key, can be used to invoke actions on the authorized resources  <p>Important to note that these OCAPs can also be chained, e.g. Key A → Key B → Key C, where → implies a delegation.</p> Revocation Registry <p>Delegation using capabilities is powerful, but we don’t necessarily want delegations to be valid forever. A possible mitigation is to add an expiry time to the capability as it is issued. Time based revocation is simple but still quite limited and in the case of a compromised key, damage can still be caused before the capability expires. We need a way to check if a particular capability has been revoked by the issuer. Ideally without leaking information about which capabilities have existed over time—here a revocation registry can be useful. The capability itself can include a caveat that states that it is only valid if and only if the capability has not been added to the revocation registry.</p><p>On Ceramic the revocation registry could be implemented as follows:</p>  An event stream is created where revocation events can be published  The revocation event is a multihash of the CID of the capability (an extra hash is added for privacy)  Once a revocation event has been anchored it is considered valid and is enforceable starting from the anchor timestamp  When a capability is issued it contains a caveat that references the revocation registry using its StreamID  When the capability is verified, the revocation registry must be loaded from the Ceramic network; if the capability was revoked before it was invoked it is considered invalid  <p>The lookup time of this revocation registry would be O(n). However, a Ceramic node could build a merkle tree where OCAP hashes are keys and revocation times are values to reduce lookup time to O(log n). In theory this could also make the revocations verifiable on-chain.</p> Private Capability Invocation <p>When a capability is invoked to perform some action it will generally be publicly disclosed. Up until the point of invocation it can be kept in secret, but if we want our system to remain publicly verifiable an observer must be able to validate the full delegation chain—from the owner of the resource to the key that performed the invocation. A keen reader might, however, realize that we don’t actually need to disclose the delegation chain if we use a ZKP to hide certain information.</p><p>publicInputs = (rootDID, sessionKey, ocapHashes, resources, actions)</p><p>privateInputs = (ocapChain)</p><p>The ZKP from above can be verified to ensure that the session key is indeed authorized to take certain actions on the given resources. The revocation registry can be referenced to make sure none of the capabilities are revoked since the ocapHashes are part of the public input.</p><p>Note that by including the ocapHashes in the public input some metadata is leaked. An observer will be able to see which capabilities have been frequently used, but they won’t learn anything about the content of the capability. A possible improvement could be to include the entire revocation registry stream in the public input. An outside observer could simply compare the included registry with a registry loaded locally. As long as the action performed by the invoker was anchored before any change to the registry was anchored the entire capability chain could still be considered valid. This means of course that the ZKP would need to be regenerated every time the revocation registry is updated.</p> 3IDv2: Composable Identity <p>Combining the primitives above, we can create a composable DID method where verification methods can be added privately using capabilities and revoked using the revocation registry. Similarly to 3IDv0 the first verification method would be added to the initial (public) state of the DID document. After this point, adding a verification method is actually done by using a capability that gives the delegate DID full control to take any action on behalf of the 3ID.</p><p>A cool feature is that the revocation registry includes timestamp information (from Ceramic anchors) so that we can see when revocations happen. This makes it easy to validate signatures done in the past, since we can see that the signature was done by the verification method before it was revoked. However, in the case of a delegation chain this might not be enough. Imagine we have Key A delegating to Key B at time T0; then at time T1, Key A gets revoked. From the perspective of the 3ID, Key B should still be valid since it was added by a verification method that was valid at the time. In order to solve this dilemma we can simply add a timestamp for when Key B was added in the revocation registry. This would allow us to keep using Key B even if Key A is revoked.</p> Grafting DIDs <p>There is a need to publicly or privately link existing DIDs, such as PKH DIDs, to a 3ID. This can now be done rather simply in Ceramic by creating a deterministic stream that is controlled by the DID in question and include an attestation that this DID is grafted to a particular 3ID. The attestation could be public or encrypted. If it is encrypted it could be selectively disclosed to any third party. For example, to check if an ethereum address (PKH DID) has been grafted to a 3ID, one would simply load the Ceramic stream and check the content of the resolved document. For a private link, a decryption key for the encrypted link would also be required to read to which DID the link points to.</p> Implementation <p>An implementation of 3IDv2 might seem daunting at first. It’s worth noting that it can be done in stages, since each primitive builds upon the previous ones. A prototype could easily be built with only support for capabilities for adding new verification methods. The revocation registry could be built after adding the ability to actually do proper key management and would result in a usable version of the system. Finally, private capability invocation could be added on top, providing a layer of privacy when actually using the identity.</p>

		<p>Exploring the innovative ways technology and game mechanics can be used to enhance education and learning, Game Research and Immersive Design (GRID) at Rutgers University creates various custom games and virtual experiences for online learning across the institution. As part of the Teaching and Learning with Technology game department, GRID works with members across the Rutgers community to build games, immersive technologies, and engaging experiences that can be accessed directly from the university’s main learning management system, Canvas. In a recent collaboration with Edge, GRID developed an education game design project for the School of Social Work where the player can alter the outcome of the story by making choices along the way.</p>
<p>Educating through Storytelling<br>
Michael Gradin, or Maka, Assistant Director of GRID at Rutgers Division of Continuing Studies, helped head up this project and brought over 20 years of knowledge in game development, IT support, and education to the development of this learning object. “I’ve always been interested in the intersection between playing and learning, and have worked at a couple of EdTech startups, as well as working as a game designer and developer for a local game design studio, Quixotic Games, which has thirty published board games,” shares Maka. “Most narrative-type games are linear, where you start at the beginning, get to the middle, and end with a conclusion. We set out to create a branching story game, where the learner can make choices for the character along the way that affect the game’s output or ending. There are three main stories, each requiring an initial choice by the user. Then each of those choices has a new branch extending from there, where each story has the possibility of nine different endings.”</p>
<p>The learning object presents the user with a conflict where he or she must choose either side. “While these games are often used to tell many kinds of stories in entertainment, most of those I’ve seen used in education have been designed to help build empathy for the people students will face in their eventual careers,” shares Maka. “The purpose here is to build empathy for the main character featured in each of the three initial stories. For example, when confronted with the idea of someone in an abusive situation or relationship, some student’s instincts may be to blame the victim because ‘they should just leave.’ Or as a nurse or social worker, understanding why a person might be struggling with their health instead of seeing them as a symptom that just needs to be ‘fixed’ allows that person to be more compassionate and effective in their role. Stories like these are designed to help the learners understand why people might find themselves in undesirable situations and how even when they make choices to try to improve their lives, they don’t always work out. By showing these scenarios, we help students build empathy for the people in these types of situations.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				       
	 
		 
		 
			
 
	 
		<p>“With stories like these, it is very easy to get confused about what has happened in the story so far,” explains Maka. “I help keep track of the branches and after editing and converting their work, I hand over those notes to Aaron who builds the information into an interactive story using Articulate Storyline. Aaron also helped design the scenes and scenarios that meet certain minimum art requirements and met the approval of all stakeholders.” Yorchak adds, “As development has progressed, some content revisions were necessary to address challenges in the storytelling process, such as realism and sensitivity to stereotypes and difficult content. As a collaborative partner, Edge will work with an organization to customize a solution to fit their needs, not try to force a cookie-cutter idea to work.”</p>

		<p>Learning Object Development<br>
Prior to development, the stakeholders at Rutgers had a rough concept for this learning object, but lacked the resources needed to achieve the project’s goals. “GRID is a very small unit and we did not have the bandwidth to work on this project during the timeframe the clients were requesting,” explains Maka. “Our parent unit, Teaching and Learning with Technology, had already met with Edge to discuss the possibility of helping with other projects, so we reached out to them to see if they could take this project on as well.” Aaron Yorchak, an instructional designer and technologist at Edge, teamed up with Maka to help get the project to the finish line.</p>
<p>Upon joining the project, Yorchak received a rough outline of the script for each scene, the goals of the project, and what the learning object was set out to accomplish. “I took the initial script and built out a skeleton where I have a number of slide placeholders for each scene in the story,” explains Yorchak. “I would drop in the textual parts from the script, and once that skeleton was in place, I would start from the beginning to review each scene and determine what images will help illustrate each scenario, including the scene, number of characters, and the actions depicted by the characters. I would then share a prototype version with Maka and the stakeholders so they could see each story in action and identify any issues with the script that needed to be revised. Maka is an excellent conduit between Edge and the stakeholders, helping communicate our needs to them and helping us understand what the stakeholders’ goals and expectations are as we move through the project.”</p>
<p>Working closely with stakeholders, Maka helped structure their story and keep track of each separate path. “With stories like these, it is very easy to get confused about what has happened in the story so far,” explains Maka. “I help keep track of the branches and after editing and converting their work, I hand over those notes to Aaron who builds the information into an interactive story using Articulate Storyline. Aaron also helped design the scenes and scenarios that meet certain minimum art requirements and met the approval of all stakeholders.” Yorchak adds, “As development has progressed, some content revisions were necessary to address challenges in the storytelling process, such as realism and sensitivity to stereotypes and difficult content. As a collaborative partner, Edge will work with an organization to customize a solution to fit their needs, not try to force a cookie-cutter idea to work.”</p>
<p>Partnering for Success<br>
As the project enters its final stages and reaches deployment, Maka says he gained important insight into the process and which steps could be improved upon in the future. “Now that I’ve had the experience of working with Edge and the stakeholders, the only thing I would do differently is to ask Aaron to build out the text of all the stories first, before asking him to work on graphics and settings. This would have allowed the stakeholders to see the flow of the stories and review the text more easily and earlier in the process. As far as teaming up with Aaron and Edge’s Associate Vice President &amp; Chief Digital Learning Office, Josh Gaul, they have been very professional and it’s been a pleasure working with them on this project. Aaron is not only building the story, but has been working with me to make the editing and review process smoother for the stakeholders.”</p>
<p>In reflecting upon this project that is near completion, Yorchak says this experience is another great example of Edge’s commitment to member institutions and helping them achieve their goals. “We’re very proud of the work we’ve accomplished with Maka and GRID and building an innovative game that helps increase engagement and enhances the learner experience. Edge prides itself on adapting to the needs of the individual organization and offering our combined expertise and experience to turn an institution’s ideas into reality.”</p>

		<p>Fast Track to Technology Procurement<br>
Technology’s role in the success of public sector organizations has never been more essential. To help the community keep pace with technological change and more readily access solutions that will drive organizational success, Edge created EdgeMarket to provide safe, simple, and smart procurements that deliver positive outcomes. Among these solutions is the Technology Catalog for Hardware, Software &amp; Services (TeCHS) through SHI, providing one of the most comprehensive and forward-thinking technology hardware, software, and services procurement vehicles available in the U.S.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2021, Edge conducted a competitive request for proposal process (RFP) for a technology and services catalog provider with two main goals in mind. The first was to deliver massive scope, scale, and unsurpassed value in technology and service purchasing to Edge members and co-op participants everywhere in the country. The second goal was to harness the innovative capabilities and global capacity of an IT solutions partner who could deliver truly transformative solutions, built upon their extensive catalog, deep talent, scalable logistics, and state-of-the-art facilities. “Our awarded partner, SHI, did a fantastic job presenting capabilities to facilitate ease of purchasing with scope, scale, and value, but also some really outstanding strategies and delivery capabilities for truly transformative solutions,” shares Dan Miller, AVP, EdgeMarket. “The EdgeMarket TeCHS contract offers SHI’s full line of products, services, and solutions, and it’s no surprise that this solution is one of our most popular master contract vehicles in our co-op.”</p>
<p>A Smarter Approach to Technology Deployment<br>
Before issuing the RFP, Edge spoke with member institutions, including Rutgers University, about the frustrations of state contracts and the procurement challenges they were facing. Sue Ryan, Strategic Sourcing Manager, Information Technology Services, Rutgers, was an important source of information as Edge began to develop the RFP. “Sue provided valuable insight into the process, where organizations would commonly have to self-assemble the sourcing of elements for a strategic move,” explains Miller. “We learned through COVID that our members and Edge needed to move on a dime, making key decisions and activating on those decisions effectively. We knew the criteria for the contract would be breadth, scope, and scale of solution; including hardware, software and services. We also wanted a partner that had a vision for the future pathways, and who was making investments to deliver transformative solutions. They needed the ability to adapt to any new adverse reality or take advantage of any new opportunity. Edge was so impressed with the SHI proposal, as they far exceeded our expectations.”</p>
<p>The TeCHS contract provides quick and easy access to hundreds of hardware, software, and service categories and groups that are conveniently organized into categories. “SHI has a great catalog, deep talent, scalable logistics that are extremely impressive, and state-of-the-art facilities that they continue to invest in and grow from,” shares Miller. “All of these assets help our members gain access to tools that can fundamentally alter how they do business and enhance their day-to-day operations.”</p>
<p>Partnering with their customers, SHI helps organizations take a smarter approach to technology deployment and running efficient and effective IT operations. “When this bid was released, SHI was very excited to respond because we felt very strongly and passionate about the value we could provide to Edge members, our customers, and New Jersey as a whole” shares Dom Fama, District Manager, NY/NJ Higher Education, SHI. “We work with our customers to strategically understand what they’re trying to solve. We then determine how to address those challenges through the use of IT and how we can help them streamline the acquisition of those goods and services in a cost-effective manner. SHI helps pinpoint what technologies our customers need and then we transform their approach. Whether an institution needs esports capabilities, hybrid classroom solutions, to modernize their data centers, or create collective classroom spaces, we can create a holistic approach to achieve those goals.”</p>

		<p>Unifying Technology Procurement<br>
The TeCHS catalog was designed to provide an all-encompassing solution that makes thousands of trusted technology partners and solutions available for streamlined cooperative procurement. Rutgers is using the TeCHS contract to simplify and unify technology procurement across their institution. “TeCHS affords Rutgers the ability to develop IT strategies and then use one contract to source all elements required to support those strategies at lower cost and greater ease than any other contract, including State contracts—which we walked away from,” explains Ryan. “The TeCHS contract also allows us to avoid all the terms and conditions that you constantly have to negotiate. Additionally, Rutgers has a catalog through our marketplace system and TeCHS affords us better pricing. Because of this contract, we were able to receive an additional layer of discounts on top of the normal discount that SHI would put on our catalog. As my RFPs become much more complicated, we need to have a contract where we can approach the design more holistically and have access to a wider breadth of technology partners.”</p>
<p>For organizations who are looking to bid a complex strategy, Ryan says you can leverage this type of contract with multiple components to help create a comprehensive approach. “For us, the Edge TeCHS contract afforded us the ability to have a vehicle that we can build a strategy design, rather than just buying software and hardware.&nbsp; The software is always the easy piece, but this allows us to look holistically at what avenue we can use to combine all these components and successfully build out strategies. With this contract, we’ve been able to develop some of our bigger projects.”</p>
<p>To help make the procurement process successful for institutions, SHI also offers professional services, adding expertise and support to each stage of the technology life cycle. “Oftentimes you have to bid out the professional service or consulting piece apart from where you are buying the products,” explains Ryan. “As you build strategic projects, having a contract like TeCHS where professional services are included, makes the process much easier and more streamlined.”</p>

		<p>Efficiently Meeting Technology Needs<br>
SHI’s Customer Innovation Center (CIC) is located at the company’s New Jersey headquarters and allows organizations to plan, design, explore, and validate their technology needs. Along with product and integrated solution demonstrations, the CIC offers workshops and events where individuals can explore new ideas, gain insights on the latest trends, obtain hands-on experience with new technologies, and receive guidance from SHI experts. In addition, SHI operates two IT integration centers which combine hardware and software components from multiple manufacturers into ready-to-deploy rack systems. Faced with datacenters that were becoming increasingly complex, Rutgers now utilizes the SHI Ridge Integration Center to access scalable and cost-effective services, including rack and stack services, pre-installation testing, and installation activities.</p>
<p>SHI has been working with Rutgers on a 10-year master network refresh project and has utilized the SHI Ridge Integration Center to bundle services and put them under one SKU in Rutgers’ e-procurement catalog. “Rutgers is in the middle of a large network master plan, where lots of pieces to the puzzle are involved,” explains Lou Malvasi, Account Executive, NY/NJ Higher Education-R1 Universities &amp; Academic Medical Centers, SHI. “Cisco is one piece, but there are also UPS data-center racks that they are refreshing across New Jersey. At the SHI Ridge Integration Center, we procure all the data-center equipment and bring it into our warehouse. We have quality-control experts that will actually rack and stack, and we send configuration files to the Rutgers team. Upon Rutgers’ review and approval, we rack, stack, and cable the equipment under the TeCHS contract and deliver the equipment to locations across New Jersey.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				       
	 
		 
		 
			
 
	 
		<p>To meet the procurement needs of a greater number of institutions, Edge architected the agreement to allow for adjusted terms and customization. “We want to help our members get the solutions they need, not just another component-based contract, hence the services dimension,” says Miller. “We also wanted to introduce any additional terms and conditions that can help an organization improve upon the baseline agreement so they can move forward with clarity and confidence.”</p>

<p>The TeCHS contract is available to all institutions, large or small, and SHI will gladly help any organization build out a catalog. “Even if you do not have an e-procurement platform like Rutgers, we can still set up a SHI.com website for you to purchase from using a username and login,” says Fama. “We can publish quotes, create landing pages, and work with facilities to understand the equipment you are buying from year to year.”&nbsp; Malvasi adds, “SHI already has TeCHS pricing integrated within our catalog team, so once this is set up for the customer, the pricing will feed into that automatically. Integration with eCommerce platforms like ServiceNow and Jaeger is a little more work on the backend, but if you want a simple SHI.com catalog, you can benefit from the TeCHS pricing almost immediately.”</p>

<p>Earlier this year we started a new <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/">project to examine and strengthen our digital resilience</a>. Through this work we hope to further integrate social justice principles into our tech choices and practices and deepen our capacity to support our partners&nbsp;</p>



<p>After conducting a deeper needs assessment within the team, the first set of changes we made focused on our video conferencing infrastructure. In this blog post, we’re sharing some reflections about the new tools our team is testing out and how our experience has been so far.</p>



<p>We are using the term “digital resilience” to refer to a set of practices that support the ability of an organisation to protect itself from — and respond to — digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its members/individuals, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to the ever-changing needs and contexts of the organisation and its members. </p>



 Deciding which video conferencing tools fit our needs and values 



<p>At The Engine Room, we aim for a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/technology-in-the-service-of-justice/">justice-based approach to our technical choices</a>. This means we prioritise choosing technology solutions that intentionally weave anti-oppression strategies into all stages of their creation, maintenance and uptake. As a remote organisation, video conferencing is integral to our day-to-day operations. After conducting a deeper needs assessment within the team, it became clear that adopting tools that are privacy-respecting and strengthen our organisational security was a priority for us. For this reason, we decided to set up our own instances of <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/">BigBlueButton</a> (BBB) and <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">Jitsi Meet</a>. Both tools are encrypted, open source, and incorporate privacy by design.&nbsp;</p>



 
 
 BigBlueButton (BBB) 



<p>BigBlueButton is an open source online learning and video conferencing platform.All traffic from the users’ web browsers to the server goes over standard security protocols when audio, video or screens are being shared.</p>



<p>BBB is<a href="https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/#designed-for-online-learning"> designed specifically for educational applications</a>, with features like whiteboards, break-out rooms, and polling. It also <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/integrations/">integrates</a> with various learning management systems (e.g. Canvas, Moodle). Everything happens in users’ web browsers, so there’s no need for any additional software.BigBlueButton users don’t need to create an account to join a call: all they need is the meeting link, which can be opened with a browser. Access to <a href="https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/greenlight/gl-overview.html#manage-access">meetings can be limited through a code</a> and joining the room can be dependent on moderator approval.</p>



<p>To use <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/teachers/features/">all the functionalities of the tool</a> it is necessary to have a server to install it on. BBB’s website offers the possibility of <a href="https://demo.bigbluebutton.org/gl/signup">creating an account to access a “demo” version of the tool.</a> Using this version you can make calls of up to 60 minutes.</p>
 



 
 Jitsi Meet 



<p>Jitsi Meet (also referred to as meet.jit.si) is a free and open source video conference service maintained by parent company <a href="https://www.8x8.com/">8×8</a>. By default, Jitsi Meet provides transport-layer encryption between the browser and the Jitsi Meet server of your choice; an end-to-end encryption feature is also available.</p>



<p>Jitsi Meet users don’t need to create an account to join a call: all they need is the meeting link, which can be opened with a browser or through Jitsi’s mobile app.</p>



<p>Meetings can also be password-protected.</p>



<p>Jitsi Meet offers the option of self-hosting and there is a <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">public version</a> of the tool for free use.</p>
 
 



<p>Some of the factors that we took into account while selecting video conferencing tools are included in the list below (which takes inspiration from many resources, such as this “<a href="https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/resource-publication/guide-secure-group-chat-and-conferencing-tools">Guide to Secure Group Chat and Conferencing Tools</a>”):&nbsp;</p>



  Maturity and maintenance: We took into account how mature the platforms are, including the amount of time they’ve been running for and whether or not they are still being actively developed. We also considered the existence of active communities of developers and users for both tools.  Privacy: A variety of factors went into consideration: whether or not user data is shared or sold to third parties, if the tools provide encryption (and what type of encryption: end-to-end or to-server), if it’s possible to self-host, what data is stored on platforms’ servers and what data platforms’ owners have access to, if users need to install a dedicated app or software and what data this app or software would have access to.  Reputation: We prioritised tools that are used and respected by social justice organisations and peers we work with, as well as recommended by security experts.&nbsp;  Ownership: We considered whether tools were open source and if the companies provided the source code openly, as well as the history of development and ownership of the platform and potential security challenges (including how owners and developers reacted to those challenges).  Features and affordances: We mapped the platforms according to how well their features would respond to our needs: easiness to connect to these platforms, usage of tools for internal and external calls and more.&nbsp;  Associated costs: We also considered the costs related to each of the tools, including potential subscription fees, learning and implementing, possible IT support needed and hosting costs  



 A brief overview of our experience so far 



  
<p>Hosting and infrastructure details<br>– For BigBlueButton, we hired <a href="https://maadix.net/">Maadix</a>‘s hosting service, who are maintaining both the tool and the servers where it’s hosted. We use a <a href="https://maadix.net/en/big-blue-button-privacy-security-optimizations">version customised by Maadix with performance and privacy improvements.</a><br>– For Jitsi Meet, we are using the <a href="https://open.greenhost.net/greenhost/cloud-init/-/tree/main/jitsimeet">pre-installed stable version</a> that <a href="https://greenhost.net/">Greenhost</a> – with whom we have been already working – offers to their clients.</p>
  



<p>After implementation, we asked our team to use BigBlueButton and Jitsi Meet as much as possible. After two months of piloting the tools, we conducted an internal survey and received mostly positive feedback—overall the team appreciated using tools that are aligned with our organisational values. We also identified areas for improvement, which we will work on over the next few months, including user friendliness and video instability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to note that while we try to default to using our own internal platforms, there are occasions where we have a need for features that these platforms do not yet have. For example, we often use webinar registration pages and waiting rooms to ensure that our community calls are safe for participants; however, BigBlueButton and Jitsi Meet do not currently possess these features. Additionally, although both platforms aim to be low resource, they often struggle in low bandwidth situations. Lastly, there’s the learning curve of the team for adapting new tools. We often crave for the familiar when it’s not immediately clear how to perform a certain task. We recognize that adapting to the workflow of these tools will take time as is the case with most technological changes.</p>



<p>Here is a summary of some of the benefits and challenges of installing and maintaining these tools on our own servers.&nbsp;</p>



 
 
 Advantages 



  Authonomy: More control over the tools we use, since we are responsible for the installation and can check all code that runs in the application.  Values: Tools that are aligned with our values and principles.  Transparency: Transparency of the open software code—we can inspect every line of code used to build the tools.  Security:&nbsp; With open source tools, more people are inspecting the code, which enables more issues to be found – and fixed. Vulnerabilities are fixed much faster and updates are more frequent.&nbsp;  Cost: Open-source software is very often free or cheaper than proprietary software. Therefore, we save on licensing and maintenance fees.&nbsp;  Open source ecosystem: We are contributing to a community of developers committed to making the internet a fairer place.  Customisation and Flexibility: Using services customised for our use and having exclusive domains.  
 



 
 Challenges 



  Resources: Self-hosted tools require more maintenance time and investment in servers.  Tech expertise: Self-hosted tools require knowledge and availability (internal or external) to troubleshoot issues the team or our partners experience.  Documentation: Using tools that are less widespread or familiar demands an effort to produce technical and user-facing documentation. For example, we developed internal user guides for both platforms containing FAQs, and we also created an external guide that explains our decisions behind specific platform use in community calls.  Adapting to new tools: Functionality is not always the same between tools and even when it is, the user experience may differ. Adopting new tools can take time (as we wrote in <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/adopting-new-tech-how-to-give-your-team-the-best-chances-of-success/">this blog post</a>) and can impact the day-to-day work of the organisation.  Stability and availability: Ensuring that self-hosted tools are stable and have high availability (or the ability of a system to operate continuously without failing) is a challenge. Constant monitoring,&nbsp; maintenance, and server redundancy (storing information in more than one server) are steps required to make sure information can be restored in case of problems.  
 
 



<p>This overview represents a snapshot of where we currently are in our journey with these tools: these observations will likely evolve and change over time, as we work on this project and mature our own digital resilience practices.</p>



 Next steps 



<p>During this process, we were reminded of how adopting free and open-source software tools (and self-hosting them!) is a process that takes quite some time and planning, but that ultimately contributes greatly to our digital resilience. Over the next months, we will continue to work on our video conferencing tools, including improving on the tools’ overall performance and stability, refining user documentation and addressing connectivity issues.</p>



<p>If your organisation is interested in going through a similar process, we’d be happy to support you (even if your end result is different!). <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Schedule a call with us</a>!</p>

<p>The Council has identified a number of areas where diversity, as well as expertise in the digital identity space, might help us better serve the community. Nominations from those organisations involved in kaupapa Māori, civil liberties and business and service sectors are especially encouraged. We also encourage suggestions from young people within your organisations, as the viewpoint of young people is extremely essential and relevant to the work we perform. As an NZTech Association, Digital Identity NZ adopts its Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy which you can read <a href="https://nztech.org.nz/about/board-diversity-inclusion-policy/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Once elected in December, one of the first responsibilities of the new Council will be to elect a new chair for the EC Council or consider re-electing the current chair. The current chair is Paul Platen (SSS – Security Specialists), supported by deputy chair (and past-chair) Ben Tairea (Āhau). Both are excellent kaiārahi (guides/counsellors/leaders) currently and serving their terms on the Executive Council through to the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2023 is set to be another pivotal year for digital identity with the delayed introduction of the Digital Identity Bill and further development of the ecosystem. We look forward to stellar nominations to identify, explore and pursue the best opportunities for Digital Identity NZ to make a positive difference for people in 2023 and beyond.</p>

 Firm Foundations 

<p>Much of our work in Q3 has been forward-thinking, focused on creating the next generation of specifications for blockchain interoperability.</p>

<p>Hello to the Identity Community. Being able to create the next generation of specifications depends on having a wide-spanning community, and we’ve been thrilled to see the Blockchain Commons community continue to grow. That includes not just cryptocurrency nowadays, but also digital identity thanks to sustaining sponsor Proxy. We also reached out to more digital-identity companies at this year’s Rebooting the Web of Trust event, and hope to see that pay out in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/tQ9SPek0mnI"></a></p>

<p>Gordian Envelope. Our specification work is intended to build firm foundations. Our newest foundational work of this sort has been on Gordian Envelope, a new sort of “Smart Container” that can be used to hold secrets and metadata of an arbitrary size and that can be opened by a variety of “permits”, including SSKR shares and public-key cryptography keypairs. Extensive <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/tree/master/Docs">docs</a> are now available as part of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents">BCSwiftSecureCompanents package</a>. Also see our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ9SPek0mnI">Gordian Envelope videos</a> on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPQ9LtDWZAkfItMF4B5tztw">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>MVA Algorithm Suite. The appendix of the Gordian Envelope docs contains our first <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/blob/master/Docs/09-A-ALGORITHMS.md">MVA ALgorithm Suite</a>. This refers to the algorithmic suite we’ve decided to use in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0deyIHXukk&amp;t=7s">Minimal Viable Architecture</a>: effectively a future-proofed Minimal Viable Product. It overviews current cryptographic algorithms and discusses our decisions about which to use. Gordian Envelope uses BLAKE3, IETF ChaChaPoly, the secp256k1 curve, and more. Our Appendix talks about why we think they’re the best practices for this project.</p>

<p>Collaborative Seed Recovery. This new foundational work is largely in service to Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR): we intend it to add independence, resilience, and openness to seed storage by allowing digital-asset holders to shard their seed and then store it with a variety of different steward services, making recovery painless and resilient. We are currently working with a companies such as Bitmark, Foundation, and Proxy in regular biweekly meetings to make CSR a reality this fall. For more, please see our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md">CSR Overview</a>. Our Gordian Envelope videos also lay out the whole foundation, so take a look at the combined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aciTNh402Co&amp;list=PLCkrqxOY1Fbp-P1Yv-7gmu75i2QS2Z6vk">CSR playlist</a>.</p>

<p>CSR Use Cases. Why is CSR needed? We’ve written several sequences of <a href="https://hackmd.io/ZbRiwvUfQSy-1RKM15bM8Q#CSR-Focused-Use-Cases">progressive use cases</a> in a preliminary document that discusses options both for CSR and its 2023 successor, Collaborative Key Management (CKM). It covers everything from simple protection of keys to future possibilities where no one actually holds a complete seed, despite its keys being in active use.</p>

 Community Events 

<p>Preventing vendor lock-in via interoperability has been a Blockchain Commons goal from the beginning, but that requires bringing together multiple parties to buy into interoperable specifications. The growth of Blockchain Commons’ community of developers, sponsors, and other interested parties in 2022 has truly made that possible, with those parties coming together in community events such as the biweekly CSR meetings and others.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/"></a></p>

<p>Silicon Salon 2. Our other ongoing get-together this year has been the <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salon</a>, where we’ve facilitated wallet makers and semiconductor makers talking about the creation of the next generation of silicon design that is specialized for cryptography. Our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/">second Silicon Salon</a> was held on September 14th. Presenters included Bunnie Studios, Cramium Labs, Proxy Labs, Foundation, and the VLS team.</p>

<p>RWOT11. Blockchain Commons got its start with <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, where Christopher Allen first brought community members together to support the future of decentralized and self-sovereign technologies. Unfortunately, Rebooting the Web of Trust went on hiatus shortly after the foundation of Blockchain Commons, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it was back <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague">this September</a>.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons submitted two papers for RWOT11, to bring some of our topics into the conversation in the Netherlands: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/collaborative-seed-recovery-csr.md">an introduction to CSR</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/elision-redaction-correlation-smart-documents.md">Elision, Redaction, and Non-Correlation in Smart Documents</a>. The elision topic paper led to a discussion of <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/selective-correlation.md">Selection Disclosure</a> that we’re looking forward to finishing in the coming months. We also participated in an article on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/identity-threats.md">Identity Threats</a>, which returns to some of our early identity work in the field!</p>

<p>Congrats to DIDs. We can’t talk about RWOT without congratulating everyone who worked on turning <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/specifications/DIDs-Ratified/">DIDs into a standard</a>. This has been a long-running goal for both RWOT and Blockchain Commons, so we were thrilled to see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> become a W3C Recommendation this July.</p>

 New &amp; Updated Projects 

<p>We have also continued work on some of our smaller projects:</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit/master/static/images/spotbit-screen.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Beancount. Beancount is a <a href="https://github.com/beancount/beancount">simple program</a> that allows double-entry accounting from text files. Because of its textual foundation, it’s very convenient to use in conjunction with command-line Bitcoin tools. As it happens, this type of tool is also crucial to Bitcoin because of regulatory decisions in the US treating Bitcoin as property, not currency, meaning that capital gains need to be calculated for every transaction(!). This requires careful accounting of your Bitcoin, and to support that, we’ve updated our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit">SpotBit server</a> to also include a script called <code>beancounter.py</code> that will take a descriptor, look up historical prices via SpotBit, and thus provide all of the data an accountant will need to properly report Bitcoin purchases, sales, and usages. We’ve iterated the software a few times during the quarter, and think we might have a final version; watch for some documentation on the process in the coming quarter.</p>

<p>SpotBit. We’ve actually had a few recent updates to SpotBit, primarily to improve the look, feel, and design of its <a href="https://spotbit.info/spotbit/">webpages</a>. Thanks to 2022 interns who supported in this upgrade.</p>

 Advocacy 

<p>The work that Blockchain Commons does on specifications, leading to libraries and reference apps, is bottom-up: we work with developers to incorporate specifications that meet our vision of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. However, we also do top-down work, where we advocate for this vision to lawmakers, agencies, and other organizations.</p>

<p>Law &amp; Advocacy Repo. To better highlight this work, which was also well-supported by our 2022 interns, we’ve added a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/law-and-advocacy">Law &amp; Advocacy repo</a> to GitHub, to report out much of our work. It includes a list of <a href="https://hackmd.io/Eat2gnYqT56HQStI63JCNg">Terminology &amp; Definitions</a> produced by this year’s interns, and links to other work.</p>

<p>Private Key Disclosure. That work includes our new article advocating for <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Private-Key-Disclosure/">protection for private keys in courts</a>, which was published by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/saving-bitcoin-private-keys-from-courts">Bitcoin Magazine</a>. In recent years, courts have begun to request private keys as part of pre-trial discovery motions. It’s dangerous and unnecessary and it needs to end, as is now being considered in Wyoming, where Christopher Allen continues to give regular testimony. Fortunately, the proposed law in Wyoming to protect private keys from disclosure has recently passed a select committee and moved on to others. It still has a ways to go though!</p>

 Web Site Updates 

<p>Blockchain Commons’ third birthday passed without mention this Spring. But, that span of time since our foundation is probably why we’ve been doing a bit of work cleaning up our web presence, to make sure it accurately reflects where we are today!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com"></a></p>

<p>About Page. Didn’t even know that Blockchain Commons had a birthday? It’s referenced on our brand-new <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/about.html">About Page</a> which also highlights our three principals: Founder &amp; Executive Director Christopher Allen; Lead Researcher Wolf McNally; and Lead Tech Writer Shannon Appelcline.</p>

<p>Vision Page. We’ve long known the goal of Blockchain Commons: to make it possible for people to control their own assets and information on the internet, using the decentralized power of blockchain technology. We slightly revised how we write about that vision this quarter. Our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html">newest statement</a> combines two previous statements to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Blockchain Commons advocates for the creation of open, interoperable, secure &amp; compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Projects Page. You may also want to take a look at our updated <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/projects.html">Projects Page</a>. We’ve done a lot of different work over the last three and a half years. Our updated projects page now highlights what we consider most important to our vision, beginning with the Gordian System.</p>

<p>Airgapped Community. Though we continue to believe strongly in partitioning services to encourage the Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness, that’s today much bigger than the airgaps that we were considering several years ago. As a result, we’ve transformed the Airgapped Wallet Community into the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community">Gordian Developer Community</a>. We choose the name “Gordian Developer Community” for this update because the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian">Gordian System</a> today incorporates all of our developer-focused work, from Principles and Architecture to Specifications and Libraries, plus the Apps that demonstrate them. We look forward to talking with airgapped-wallet developers and those working on other partitioning techniques alike!</p>

 Doc Updates 

<p>As part of our web updating, we’ve also done some work on our docs.</p>

<p>Revised Gordian Page. How does the whole Gordian system fit together, from our air-gap and tor-gap overview to specifications such as Gordian Envelope? Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#readme">updated Gordian page</a> walks through the whole system from top to bottom, including new pages on topics such as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md">Gordian Architecture</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Roles.md">Gordian Architecture Roles</a></p>

<p>New Test Vectors. We’ve also produced some new test vectors, to help people who are implementing our specifications. These include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-test-vector.md#256-bit-seed">SSKR test vectors based on 256-bit seeds</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-seed-test-vectors.md">crypto-seed test vectors for both 128-bit and 256-bit seeds</a>.</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>Thank you as always for your support for Blockchain Commons. In 2022, we have truly become the commons that we imagined. Moving forward, we will continue to build firm foundations with our big focus on the architectural and reference work needed to release CSR by the end of the year.</p>

<p>If you’re not already a sponsor of our work, you can become one through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">GitHub</a>. Now that we’re back from RWOT11 in the Netherlands, we’re looking forward to continuing to advance our work!</p>

 OIDF Session at Authenticate 2022 — Tuesday, October 18, 2022 
<p>1:45 – 2:40pm PT — <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/session/the-openid-foundation-strategy-a-deep-dive-on-fapi-and-the-global-open-banking-open-data-movement/">The OpenID Foundation Strategy &amp; a Deep Dive on FAPI and the Global Open Banking, Open Data Movement</a><br>
Presenters: Gail Hodges, OpenID Foundation Executive Director and Anoop Saxena, OIDF Member (Intuit) &amp; FAPI Working Group Co-Chair</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation standards are used today for consumer and enterprise login, open banking, open health, digital identity issuance and acceptance, and other federated identity use cases. We will give a brief overview of the OpenID Foundation’s strategy to serve the global community with its standards and certification capabilities. Then we will do a deep dive on the FAPI security profile in the context of Open Banking and Open Data implementations that are cascading around the world. The FAPI Security profile has been selected by public and private networks in the US, UK, Brazil, Australia, Norway and beyond. They are also a leading contender to enable cross border use cases. Background on FAPI and the global Open Banking, Open Data movement can be found in two OIDF whitepapers published this year:</p>
<p>A Primer on the global movement behind Consent-Based movement of Data “Open Banking and Open Data and the Financial Grade API.” (final) https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/03/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-Open-Data-and-Financial-Grade-APIs_2022-03-16.pdf<br>

 OIDF Sessions at FIDO Member Plenary — Wednesday, October 19, 2022 
<p>9:00-9:10 am — Welcome &amp; Opening Remarks<br>
Presenter: Gail Hodges – OpenID Foundation Executive Director</p>
<p>9:10-9:45 am — Shared Signals &amp; Events: A Secure Webhooks Framework<br>
Presenter:&nbsp; Atul Tulshibagwale – SGNL</p>
<p>Lack of interoperability between products from different vendors hampers customer adoption and results in poorer security outcomes. Interoperable standards such as the Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP) of the Shared Signals and Events (SSE) Framework provide a great way to communicate session assurance changes and other ways in which account and session related information can be conveyed interoperably and asynchronously between parties that share users. Featured by Gartner as an innovation trigger in their 2022 Digital Identity Hype Cycle, CAEP and the SSE framework it relies on is growing in adoption. Learn more about the standard and how to adopt it in your environments in this talk.</p>
<p>9:45-10:20 am — OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC): Addressing Self-Sovereign Identity, Decentralized Identity, or User-Centric Identity<br>
Presenter: Kristina Yasuda – Microsoft</p>
<p>The OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC) protocol family is facilitating significant adoption of Verifiable Credentials, empowering individuals to take control of their own identity. By using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, a cornerstone of modern Identity systems as the foundation, OpenID4VC ensures that Verifiable Credentials applications are trusted, secure, interoperable, and easy to deploy. For that reason, OpenID4VC specifications are already being adopted and deployed in a number of implementations, rapidly becoming the foundation of many Verifiable Credentials solutions. OpenID4VC consists of three specifications: Self-Issued OpenID Provider v2 (SIOP v2), OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VP), and OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OIDC4VCI). They enable existing OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect Relying Parties to receive Verifiable Presentations and existing OAuth 2.0 Authorization Servers/OpenID Connect OpenID Providers to issue Verifiable Credentials in any credential format including W3C Verifiable Credentials and ISO/IEC 18013-5 mdocs. In this session, we will discuss use cases motivating the work, how these protocols solve the problems, what challenges remain, and how they have come together to weave a web of trust.</p>
<p>10:20-10:55 am — “A Review of the Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN): One Year On”<br>
Presenter:&nbsp; Elizabeth Garber – Co-Chair GAIN Proof of Concept</p>

<p>10:55-11:30 am — OIDF Government Whitepaper Listening Session: “Citizen-Centric Identity Systems”<br>
Presenter: Elizabeth Garber – Whitepaper Co-Author</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is developing a whitepaper for governments and their associated stakeholders with the goal of supporting them in making good decisions when implementing citizen-centric digital identity systems – and to help them understand where OIDC and its extensions fit in. This session will be a facilitated discussion about the key concerns of government when thinking about digital identity:</p>
 
 The Role of Government 
 Key Stakeholders 
 Adoption 
 Balancing privacy/security/trust 
 Resilience 
 Economic Benefits 
 Technology and Interoperability 
 How existing standards fit in 
 
<p>11:30 am-12:05 pm — OIDF Privacy Whitepaper Listening Session: “Help Design a Scalable Future for Personal Privacy”<br>
Presenter: Heather Flanagan – Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting</p>
<p>Government-issued digital IDs have the potential for amazing societal impact but getting there from here means bridging the gaps in identity validation, verification, privacy, and control. In this session, we offer an open conversation to gather different perspectives on how policies and protocols need to evolve to help government-issued IDs fill their role in a global privacy-preserving infrastructure. Come join us to be a part of thinking outside the box of today so we can achieve tomorrow’s promise of government-issued IDs as a benefit to all.</p>
<p>12:05-12:30 pm — Closing Remarks, Open Q&amp;A and Networking<br>

<p>Antes de iniciarmos, o que queremos dizer com dados? E tecnologia? Provavelmente você está usando os dois!<br><br>Definimos ‘dados’ como informações que precisam ser processadas, organizadas e estruturadas para que possam ser utilizadas. Em outras palavras, com dados estamos nos referindo às informações que você possui, como os detalhes sobre as comunidades com as quais trabalha, resultados de pesquisas que fez, endereços de e-mail e informações de contato de apoiadores e assim por diante.<br><br>Entendemos ‘tecnologia’ como as ferramentas, os sistemas, métodos e processos que capitalizam o poder computacional para gerenciar, analisar e comunicar informações. Para isso, quando falamos em tecnologia, queremos dizer ferramentas digitais, em termos gerais. Qualquer coisa, desde plataformas de e-mail e apps de mensagens até hosts de sites, plataformas de newsletters por e-mail, CRMs, bancos de dados, processos algorítmicos e mais.</p>
  



  
 
 
   
 
 
  



  
 



 FAQ: perguntas frequentes sobre tecnologia e dados  
  



  
 Primeiros passos – entendendo a visão geral sobre tecnologia e dados 



  P1: <a title="Deveríamos buscar usar mais tecnologia/dados em nosso trabalho?">Deveríamos buscar usar mais tecnologia/dados em nosso trabalho?</a>   P2: <a title="">Como eu e minha equipe podemos aprender mais sobre tecnologia e como ela é relevante para o nosso trabalho?</a>  P3: <a title="Minha organização acredita que é o momento de começarmos a usar mais tecnologia e dados no nosso trabalho. Por onde começamos?">Minha organização acredita que é o momento de começarmos a usar mais tecnologia e dados no nosso trabalho. Por onde começamos?</a>&nbsp;  P4: <a title="">Como posso garantir que as ferramentas tecnológicas e os dados que estamos usando são realmente úteis para o nosso trabalho?</a>  



 Tomando decisões – certificando-se de que os dados e a tecnologia que você usa estão de acordo com seus valores e sua missão 



  P5: <a title="">Como tomamos decisões acerca de adotar novas ferramentas e/ou coletar dados?</a>  P6: <a title="">Minha organização quer integrar novas tecnologias, mas ainda não encontramos a ferramenta certa. Deveríamos criar nós mesmos uma ferramenta?</a>  P7: <a title="">Como posso usar tecnologia/dados se meu acesso à internet ou à eletricidade não é confiável?</a>  P8: <a title="">Como trabalhar com pessoas desenvolvedoras e/ou especialistas em tecnologia?</a>  P9: <a title="">Como fazer para que a colaboração online funcione melhor para minha organização?</a>  



 Segurança e cuidado em foco 



  P10: <a title="">Como posso garantir que toda minha equipe está usando as ferramentas (ou processos de dados) que escolhemos?</a>  P11: <a title="">O que podemos fazer para manter as pessoas em segurança quando começarmos a usar diferentes ferramentas tecnológicas e práticas de dados?</a>  
  



 



 Primeiros passos – entendendo a visão geral sobre tecnologia e dados 



 P1: Organizações parceiras parecem estar usando mais tecnologia/dados. Também deveríamos buscar usar mais tecnologia/dados em nosso trabalho?  



<p>A resposta para isso realmente depende do contexto. A tecnologia pode lhe auxiliar a organizar tarefas e operações diárias, permitir comunicação mais segura, coletar e gerenciar informações, cortar gastos e liberar orçamento, entre outras possibilidades. Mas, se usada de maneira ineficaz ou sem estratégia, a tecnologia também pode comprometer a sua capacidade de realizar o seu trabalho com segurança e eficácia.</p>



<p>Por exemplo, se sua organização estiver coletando relatos em primeira mão de violações aos direitos humanos em áreas com pouca conectividade à internet/rede móvel, a adoção de uma ferramenta de coleta de dados que necessite de conexão com a internet dificultará o seu trabalho e impactará negativamente a sua capacidade de cumprir a sua missão.</p>



<p>Se usada sem estratégia, a tecnologia também pode lhe expor e expor as pessoas com quem você trabalha a novas vulnerabilidades e novos riscos. Por exemplo, se você está em um contexto em que a monitoração da sociedade civil pelo governo é comum e está usando ferramentas que não protejam suas comunicações de maneira adequada, isso pode comprometer o seu trabalho e a sua segurança.</p>



<p>Para ter certeza de que você usará a tecnologia estrategicamente e com responsabilidade, separe um tempo para pensar a respeito de como implantar uma nova tecnologia ou coletar mais dados poderia fortalecer ou enfraquecer o seu trabalho. Antes de adotar quaisquer novas ferramentas ou plataformas, tente fortalecer a sua capacidade interna, conectar-se com outras organizações que você respeita.</p>

 P2: Como eu e minha equipe podemos aprender mais sobre tecnologia e como ela é relevante para o nosso trabalho?&nbsp; 



<p>Tecnologias digitais evoluem rapidamente, assim como debates e conversas sobre os potenciais benefícios e malefícios de se usar ferramentas e plataformas específicas. Quando tentamos aprender mais sobre tecnologia, achamos que o mais útil é focar em duas coisas:</p>



  Trabalhar para <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/" title="">desenvolver a intuição técnica da equipe de maneira lenta e incremental</a>, fazendo com que seja uma prioridade para toda a equipe tanto quanto possível (em vez de trabalho de uma única pessoa).  Em vez de buscar por <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/" title="">ferramentas novinhas em folha</a>, tente antes identificar como a tecnologia e os dados podem <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/" title="">fortalecer o seu trabalho principal</a>.  



<p>Quando o assunto são novas ferramentas e aplicações, há muita informação online que pode ser tentadora – mas pode ser difícil identificar o que é relevante para você e o que não é.</p>



<p>Para entender as informações relacionadas à tecnologia com mais facilidade, comece com o desafio que você está tentando entender ou resolver primeiro. Ademais, se puder, busque organizações parceiras que pensem de maneira similar e que possam estar em contextos parecidos ou ter missões semelhantes às suas e aprenda mais sobre quais ferramentas estão usando (e quais foram seus sucessos e desafios!).</p>

 P3: Minha organização acredita que é o momento de começarmos a usar mais tecnologia e dados no nosso trabalho. Por onde começamos?&nbsp; 



<p>Primeiro, tenha uma visão geral clara do que vocês já estão usando! A maioria das organizações já estão usando pelo menos algum tipo de tecnologia e dados para lhes auxiliar no trabalho – desde ferramentas do cotidiano, como e-mail e mensagens instantâneas, até ferramentas de CRM e bancos de dados. Abaixo, trouxemos uma pequena lista de perguntas que podem servir como um exercício inicial para mapear as maneiras que você está usando tecnologia e dados em seu trabalho.</p>



<p>Nota: algumas das informações que você vai reunir como parte deste exercício de mapeamento podem ser sensíveis; antes de começar, garanta que suas notas estão armazenadas em um local seguro e são compartilhadas apenas com pessoas que precisam acessá-las.</p>



  Quais ferramentas você usa atualmente para seu trabalho?&nbsp;  Quais plataformas/ferramentas você e sua equipe usam para se comunicar? Dentre elas, podem estar e-mail, mensagens instantâneas, mídias sociais, SMS e sites, para listar algumas.  Como você armazena e gerencia seus arquivos e documentos? Quais plataformas você usa? Todos na sua equipe usam as mesmas plataformas?  Você está trabalhando em campanhas públicas ou faz parte de esforços coletivos com outras organizações? Se sim, quais ferramentas usa para ativismo, organização e manter a comunidade?  Está trabalhando com algum banco de dados ou plataforma de pesquisa?    



<p></p>



  Como você está usando os dados?&nbsp;  Que tipo de dados/informações você coleta ou gera no cotidiano? Pense sobre seus fluxos de trabalho individuais e coletivos e liste os momentos em que você coleta ou gera dados. Por exemplo, coletar informações de contatos das pessoas que você entrevistou, conversar por e-mail ou WhatsApp, tomar notas de entrevistas ou reuniões ou realizar pesquisas com comunidades.  Onde você armazena os dados? Considere os dados que você já tem e liste todos os lugares onde estão (garanta que está incluindo todos os lugares remotos – e-mails, documentos compartilhados e assim por diante).  Onde e como você compartilha os dados? Pense sobre as vezes em que você precisa compartilhar os dados: quando isso normalmente acontece, com quem você compartilha essas informações e quais ferramentas utiliza? Por exemplo, você pode enviar planilhas ou PDFs por e-mail, compartilhar documentos e atas de reuniões pelo Google Docs ou compartilhar senhas através de um aplicativo de mensagens.    



<p>Essas são perguntas iniciais e exploratórias. Para uma versão completa deste exercício de mapeamento, veja <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">Becoming RAD!</a> (publicado em 2021) ou <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">entre</a> em contato com a nossa equipe.</p>



<p>Por fim, adotar novas ferramentas leva tempo e necessita de recursos. Garanta que você e sua equipe terão espaços dedicados para aprender novas ferramentas, praticar comportamentos e se atualizar com os novos dados sendo utilizados.</p>

 P4: Como posso garantir que as ferramentas tecnológicas e os dados que estamos usando são realmente úteis para o nosso trabalho? 



<p>Em nosso trabalho de apoio a organizações da sociedade civil, frequentemente nos deparamos com <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">suposições de que dig</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/" title="">i</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">tal sign</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/" title="">i</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">fica melhor</a> e que qualquer solução tecnológica levará a maior eficiência, eficácia e impacto.</p>



<p>Mas nem sempre é assim. Quando estamos trabalhando mais intensamente com um parceiro, frequentemente começamos com uma avaliação de como seu uso de tecnologia e dados são mapeados para seu trabalho e contexto. Isso pode nos ajudar a entender como, ou mesmo se, a forma com que usam a tecnologia está fortalecendo seu trabalho.</p>



<p>Depois de mapear quais ferramentas a organização está usando e quais dados são coletados, armazenados e compartilhados, vamos a uma segunda rodada de perguntas: quão útil tudo isso é (ou quão útil poderia ser) no contexto do seu trabalho:</p>



  Qual é o principal problema social ou político no qual você está trabalhando?  O seu uso de tecnologia e dados está lhe auxiliando a lidar com esse problema? Se sim, como? Se não, por que você acha que isso está acontecendo?  Seu uso cotidiano de tecnologia e dados está lhe auxiliando a se conectar com indivíduos ou instituições importantes para o seu trabalho?  A forma como você usa tecnologia e dados está impactando sua carga de trabalho? Está fazendo seu trabalho mais fácil ou está criando cargas insustentáveis de trabalho para a equipe? Você gosta de usar ferramentas organizacionais?

 Tomando decisões – certificando-se de que os dados e a tecnologia que você usa estão de acordo com seus valores e sua missão  



 P5. Como tomamos decisões acerca de adotar novas ferramentas e/ou coletar dados?&nbsp; 



<p>Há muito a se pensar na hora de escolher uma ferramenta, e há muitas opções por aí – incluindo várias que você talvez ainda não conheça. Então, como começar a reduzir (ou expandir) as suas opções?</p>



<p>Em 2017, com base em uma pesquisa que fizemos sobre escolha de ferramentas em organizações da sociedade civil, criamos um <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/alidade-interactive-guide-for-finding-technology-tools/" title="">guia interativo para escolha de ferramentas chamado Alidade</a>, que guia as organizações da sociedade civil por meio de perguntas que podem ajudá-las a decidir que tipo de ferramenta tecnológica seria adequada para seu projeto ou suas necessidades organizacionais. Recomendamos que você teste!</p>



<p>Em geral, quando organizações estão buscando novas ferramentas tecnológicas, achamos que as seguintes diretrizes são úteis:</p>



  Pesquise as pessoas, o problema e, depois, a tecnologia. Analise o problema geral para o qual você acha que alguma ferramenta tecnológica poderia ser útil. Pense no seu público-alvo. Faça uma pesquisa e considere opções diferentes em relação a quais opções tecnológicas estão disponíveis.  Pense duas vezes antes de criar. Pesquise por ferramentas já existentes que possam fazer o que você precisa. Criar uma ferramenta totalmente nova pode ser mais complexo e arriscado.  Obtenha uma segunda opinião. Outra pessoa provavelmente já tentou uma abordagem parecida antes de você. Encontre essa pessoa e peça conselhos a ela.  Sempre faça testes. Teste pelo menos duas ferramentas, com as pessoas que você quer que as usem, antes de escolher. O teste destaca problemas logo no início. Também levanta questões que você nunca imaginou que teria.  Esteja preparado para o fracasso. Você não vai acertar de primeira. Tenha orçamento separado e se planeje para fazer ajustes regulares à ferramenta ao longo do projeto.  Reflita sobre o que você está fazendo. Tenha sempre em mente o que está e o que não está funcionando. Aplique o que você aprender ao trabalho da sua organização e compartilhe com outras organizações.  



<p>Certifique-se de que as ferramentas que você escolher também se adequam às suas necessidades de segurança. Quando estiver avaliando a segurança de uma ferramenta, considere o seguinte:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Qual é a política de privacidade da ferramenta? Que tipo de dados a ferramenta coleta e com quem esses dados são compartilhados? Quem tem acesso a quaisquer dados armazenados na ferramenta?  A abordagem da ferramenta em relação à privacidade e segurança é bem documentada? O que você consegue descobrir sobre os registros de privacidade e segurança da ferramenta?  



<p>Documente e discuta suas descobertas com seus colegas antes de tomar a decisão final a respeito de uma ferramenta.</p>

 P6: Minha organização quer integrar novas tecnologias, mas ainda não encontramos a ferramenta certa. Deveríamos criar nós mesmos uma ferramenta? 



<p>Se você está familiarizado com o nosso trabalho, provavelmente sabe que muitas vezes defendemos a adaptação de ferramentas existentes para suas necessidades quando possível (chamamos isso de “reutilização de ferramenta”).</p>



<p>Nossa pesquisa nessa área ao longo dos últimos anos mostrou que reutilizar e adaptar ferramentas existentes pode ter muitas vantagens, como uso mais eficiente de recursos financeiros e aumento do acesso ao suporte para a implementação e manutenção.</p>



<p>Criar uma ferramenta do zero, por outro lado, pode ser um processo custoso e longo que pode levar à frustração: já vimos como ferramentas podem acabar sendo ineficazes ou pouco usadas, ter um custo alto inesperado ou demandar muitos recursos para serem mantidas ou atualizadas.</p>



<p>Mas se simplesmente não consegue encontrar a funcionalidade que a sua organização está buscando e você está considerando criar uma nova ferramenta, aqui estão algumas questões sobre as quais refletir:</p>



  Há uma necessidade real e identificável para esta ferramenta? Ela lhe aproximará dos seus objetivos de longo prazo? Criar uma ferramenta responderia a uma necessidade intensa que surgiu no seu trabalho ou a ideia surgiu por outros motivos?  Você tem os recursos necessários para criar a ferramenta, mantê-la a longo prazo e fornecer suporte constante para as pessoas que continuarão a usá-la?  Qual é a sua visão para a ferramenta no longo prazo? As necessidades ou problemas que a ferramenta está sendo construída para atender e resolver podem evoluir ao longo do tempo?

 P7. Como posso usar tecnologia/dados se meu acesso à internet ou à eletricidade não é confiável? 



<p>Se você tem dificuldades com acesso intermitente à internet, considere adotar ferramentas que permitam que você trabalhe tanto online como offline. Com o Google Docs, por exemplo, você pode <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375012?hl=pt-BR&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">permitir o acesso offline aos documentos</a>. Isso vai permitir que você continue seu trabalho offline e depois sincronize os documentos quando a conexão voltar. Algumas ferramentas de coleta e gerenciamento de dados, como <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo ToolBox</a>, também permitem que você colete dados nos dispositivos quando não tem conexão e depois faça o upload dos dados no servidor quando a rede estiver disponível. Para reuniões online em cenários e configurações de baixa conectividade, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> é uma opção gratuita, leve e de código aberto para ligações apenas de áudio.</p>



<p>Se o orçamento da sua organização permitir, também recomendamos investir em uma conexão de backup; por exemplo, uma conexão de rede móvel à qual conectar seus aparelhos quando sua conexão de banda larga não estiver disponível.</p>



<p>Há duas formas de fazer isso: usar um modem de internet móvel ou usar um smartphone dedicado para criar um ponto de acesso ao qual outros aparelhos podem se conectar e compartilhar a conexão móvel. Aqui está um tutorial rápido de <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915">como criar um ponto de acesso móvel em um smartphone Android</a>. Você pode limitar a quantidade de dados usados ao compartilhar a senha de acesso apenas com aparelhos ou usuários essenciais.</p>



<p>Em casos em que a conexão à internet e/ou à eletricidade é intermitente e você está trabalhando online, certifique-se de que está salvando seu trabalho com a maior frequência possível para minimizar os riscos de perder trabalho.</p>



<p>Se por quedas de energia com frequência, adquirir um gerador como backup pode ser uma opção interessante, desde que você tenha os recursos organizacionais para isso.</p>

 P8. Como trabalho com pessoas desenvolvedoras e/ou especialistas em tecnologia? 



<p>Há muitos tipos diferentes de profissionais com os quais você pode trabalhar. Tipos comuns de profissões que interagem com tecnologia ou dados incluem:</p>



  Design de user experience (UX): Trabalha tanto com clientes (neste caso, é você!) como usuários para criar um produto que satisfaça necessidades diversas e seja fácil de entender e operar.  Design gráfico: Cuida dos elementos visuais que um site, ferramenta, app ou publicação usam e é responsável por criar a identidade visual (ou branding). Frequentemente trabalha junto com o UX designer para garantir que a identidade visual também funciona bem para as pessoas que são usuárias.  Ilustração: Cria ilustrações, ícones, infográficos e mais, que vão compor a estrutura maior que o designer gráfico e o UX designer criaram.  Desenvolvimento front-end:&nbsp; Implementa o design em um site, ferramenta ou app. Em particular, é capaz de programar os aspectos que os usuários vão ver e com os quais vão interagir.  Desenvolvimento back-end: Desenvolve e conecta um banco de dados ao front-end (as partes do site, app ou ferramenta que um usuário pode ver) e faz todas as tarefas não visíveis que preencherão o front-end com conteúdo dinâmico.  Análise/Ciência de dados: Extrai padrões de grandes volumes de dados. Também pode estar equipado com as ferramentas e o conhecimento necessários para criar visualizações de dados a fim de comunicar padrões importantes.  Sysadmin/DevOps: Mantém os servidores onde ficam o site, as ferramentas ou apps. Frequentemente é responsável por coordenar a identificação e solução de problemas se as usuárias encontrarem bugs ou erros.  



<p>Às vezes, as funções podem se justapor: por exemplo, você pode contratar uma pessoa que lidera o design e desenvolvimento de um site, ou uma pessoa desenvolvedora que é capaz de trabalhar tanto em front-end como em back-end.</p>



<p>Antes de contratar desenvolvedores e especialistas em tecnologia, é útil:</p>



  Ter clareza do porquê você quer criar ou adaptar novas ferramentas.  Identificar os recursos que você tem e dos quais vai precisar.  Lembrar-se de se planejar para manutenção a longo prazo.  



<p>No início de seu trabalho juntos, é importante estabelecer pontos em comum e uma terminologia compartilhada a respeito das necessidades e expectativas. Recomendamos criar um Termo de Referência&nbsp; para documentar e compartilhar necessidades e exigências do projeto. O Termo de Referência deve abordar, no mínimo:</p>



  O orçamento disponível para o projeto&nbsp;  O prazo necessário  Seus objetivos  Suas expectativas em relação ao parceiro externo  Quaisquer informações adicionais  



<p>Vocês também devem chegar a um acordo em relação a ferramentas, canais de comunicação, funções e responsabilidades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tudo isso pode contribuir muito para o sucesso do projeto desde o início. Algumas coisas que você deve fazer ao trabalhar com consultores, uma vez que o trabalho está em andamento, são:</p>



  Focar na clareza dos objetivos, grandes processos e marcos organizacionais para melhor apoiar a equipe/o projeto.  Fornecer feedback relevante e em tempo hábil.  Dar espaço ao e ter respeito pela expertise do consultor.  Tentar ser responsivo com as comunicações.

 P9. Minha organização faz muito de seu trabalho online, mas nossa colaboração nem sempre corre tão bem. Como podemos fazer para que a colaboração online funcione melhor para nós? 



<p>Sabemos em primeira mão que, quando se trata de colaborar online, encontrar a maneira certa de se comunicar é essencial – tanto para que o trabalho corra bem como para o bem-estar geral.</p>



<p>Idealmente, sua equipe terá uma seleção de ferramentas ou canais para usar (por exemplo, um mix de apps de chat, e-mail e ferramentas de gerenciamento de projetos seguros), mas é importante que cada um deles tenha uma função clara.</p>



<p>Com frequência, as organizações com quem trabalhamos&nbsp; usam tantas ferramentas diferentes que se sentem sobrecarregados toda vez que precisam compartilhar um documento, ideia ou mensagem. Se este for o caso da sua organização, separe um tempo para listar rapidamente todas as ferramentas diferentes que as pessoas usam para se comunicar – a lista pode incluir apps como Signal e WhatsApp, plataformas de mensagens como Slack e Mattermost, CRMs online como Salesforce, ferramentas VOIP como Skype, Zoom ou Jitsi Meet, e ferramentas colaborativas como Trello, Air Table, Asana e outras. Talvez você também use mensagens SMS ou ligações por telefone.</p>



<p>Quando tiver essa lista em mãos, sugerimos que se reúna com as pessoas com as quais você mais colabora e entrem em um acordo para tentar usar menos ferramentas. Dê um propósito específico a cada ferramenta: por exemplo, talvez e-mail seja para mensagens mais longas e que não sejam tão urgentes, ou para compartilhar documentos, enquanto programas de mensagens são para questões urgentes ou conversas casuais.</p>



<p>Quando tiver identificado algumas coisas que funcionam, documente! O registro garantirá que todos estão na mesma página e será uma ótima referência para pessoas novas que entrarem na equipe ou simplesmente para servir de lembrete dos processos/projetos.</p>

 Segurança e cuidado em foco 



 P10: Como posso garantir que toda minha equipe está usando as ferramentas (ou processos de dados) que escolhemos? 



<p>Mesmo quando estamos animados com uma nova ferramenta ou processo tecnológico para usar dados, de fato adotar novos modos de trabalho é difícil. Ao mesmo tempo, garantir que estamos usando as ferramentas acordadas (e seus protocolos e segurança ou proteção relevantes) é uma maneira importante através da qual podemos praticar o cuidado um com o outro nas organizações.</p>



<p>Um passo a ser tomado para ajudar todos a adotar uma nova forma de trabalho é garantir que a nova ferramenta ou o novo protocolo respondam a uma necessidade concreta e que todos saibam qual ela é. Isso significa que todos sabem que, ao se esforçar para aprender a usar a nova ferramenta, estarão mais próximos da solução de um problema que vêm enfrentando.</p>



<p>Ao mesmo tempo, é importante gerenciar as expectativas – as mudanças podem ser sentidas pouco a pouco, ao longo do tempo, conforme mais pessoas usam uma ferramenta ou um protocolo e se familiarizam com ela/ele. Isso faz parte do processo.</p>



<p>E, porque é um processo, é bom dar espaço e tempo para aprendizado, adaptação e discussão quando uma nova ferramenta é selecionada. Dependendo do que mais estiver acontecendo, as capacidades para aprender algo novo podem variar entre as equipes, e dar espaço pode ser a melhor forma de reconhecer isso.</p>



<p>Por fim, ouvir as experiências das pessoas que estão usando a nova ferramenta pode lhe ajudar a identificar maneiras que você pode ajustar a própria ferramenta, se for possível, ou ajustar como ela vem sendo aplicada.&nbsp;</p>

 P11: O que podemos fazer para manter as pessoas em segurança quando começarmos a usar diferentes ferramentas tecnológicas e práticas de dados? 



<p>Muitas das pessoas com quem conversamos estão curiosas a respeito de como podem incorporar a segurança e o cuidado em todo o trabalho que fazem – especialmente quando se trata de novas iniciativas tecnológicas e de dados. Ao vermos nos noticiários, nas nossas comunidades e em nossas próprias experiências situações como vazamentos de dados e ferramentas hackeadas, pode parecer desafiador adotar ferramentas ou processos tecnológicos com segurança.</p>



<p>Uma abordagem que pode auxiliar a fornecer uma base é a de Responsible Data (ou “dados responsáveis”, em uma tradução livre): a ideia de que compartilhamos um “dever coletivo de prestar contas das consequências não intencionais de trabalhar com dados”.</p>



<p>Algumas áreas a serem exploradas e que estão sob o guarda-chuva dos dados responsáveis são:</p>



  Práticas como minimização de dados (apenas coletar os dados que você precisa).  Conceitos como consentimento (certificar-se de que as pessoas são capazes de concordar de maneira livre, específica, informada e revogável com como seus dados serão usados).  Espaços relacionados, como segurança organizacional (uma rica área de prática em torno da definição de protocolos que podem auxiliar a criar segurança de dados/informações e bem-estar físico e segurança).&nbsp;  



<p>Se você não está familiarizado com esses tipos de práticas, há alguns recursos que podem ajudar – desde guias online até suporte do praticante.</p>



<p>Escolher ferramentas que priorizem sua segurança pode ser outro passo a ser dado. Com frequência, essas ferramentas não são tão utilizadas como suas contrapartes menos seguras, então essa pode ser uma oportunidade para consultar colegas com pensamento similar ou contatar um especialista em tecnologia externo em quem você confie. Algumas dessas ferramentas podem incluir:</p>



  Gerenciadores de senhas: Criar senhas fortes e exclusivas é uma parte fundamental ao usar a tecnologia com mais segurança. Gerenciadores de senha podem tanto acompanhar suas senhas usadas como ajudá-lo a criar senhas fortes. <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords" title="">Saiba</a> mais aqui.  Ferramentas de comunicação mais seguras: Muitas das mensagens que enviamos digitalmente não são criptografadas, o que significa que, se alguém tentar interceptá-las, poderia ler o conteúdo. Ferramentas de comunicação mais seguras oferecem criptografia, tornando mais difícil que pessoas leiam o conteúdo de suas mensagens. Você pode <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures" title="">aprender mais aqui</a>, ou entrar em contato conosco para auxílio a respeito de adoção de novas ferramentas.  Redes privadas virtuais: Uma VPN (virtual private network, em inglês) é uma ferramenta que pode ajudar a proteger sua atividade na web contra vigilância na rede de internet que você está usando. Escolher a VPN certa – e conhecer suas limitações – é crucial, e depende do contexto no qual você está inserido (em qual país está, qual VPN escolheu etc.). Ao mesmo tempo, escolher a VPN certa para a sua situação pode ser complexo, então <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you" title="">se informe mais aqui</a> e não hesite em entrar em contato conosco para obter ajuda.  



<p>Sempre tenha em mente que segurança é uma mistura tanto de ferramentas como de práticas. É importante ter as ferramentas corretas, mas é igualmente importante usá-las do jeito correto e construir práticas internas fortes quando o assunto for segurança em geral, levando em consideração segurança física e psicológica também.</p>

<p>Antes de comenzar, ¿a qué nos referimos cuando hablamos de datos? ¿Y de tecnología? ¡Lo más probable es que estés trabajando con ambos!&nbsp;<br><br>Definimos datos como información que en aras de su usabilidad necesita ser procesada, organizada y estructurada. En otras palabras, por datos nos referimos a la información que posees, como detalles sobre las comunidades con las que trabajas, hallazgos de la investigación que has realizado, resultados de encuestas, direcciones de correo electrónico e información de contacto de personas que apoyan tu trabajo, etc.<br><br>Entendemos tecnología como las herramientas, sistemas, métodos y procesos que aprovechan el poder computacional para administrar, analizar y comunicar información. Para este recurso, cuando hablamos de tecnología, nos referimos a herramientas digitales, en general. Incluye desde plataformas de correo electrónico y aplicaciones de mensajería hasta servidores de sitios web, plataformas de boletines por correo electrónico, CRM, bases de datos, procesos algorítmicos, y más.</p>

 Exploraciones iniciales – pantallazo inicial del panorama tecnológico y de datos 



 P1: Nuestros pares parecen estar usando más tecnología/datos, ¿deberíamos considerar incrementar su uso también en nuestro trabajo? 



<p>La respuesta aquí realmente dependerá del contexto. La tecnología puede ayudarte a organizar el trabajo y las tareas diarias, permitir una comunicación más segura, recopilar y administrar información, y reducir costos y liberar recursos, entre otras cosas. Pero si la tecnología se usa de manera ineficaz o no estratégica, también puede comprometer tu capacidad para hacer el trabajo de manera segura y efectiva.</p>



<p>Por ejemplo, si tu organización está recopilando relatos de primera mano sobre violaciones de derechos humanos en áreas con poca conectividad a Internet/móvil, la adopción de una herramienta de recopilación de datos que requiera una conexión a Internet dificultará tu trabajo y afectará negativamente la capacidad para cumplir tu misión.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Usada de manera no estratégica, la tecnología también puede exponerte a ti y a tus colegas, a nuevas vulnerabilidades y riesgos. Por ejemplo, si te encuentras en un contexto donde la vigilancia gubernamental de la sociedad civil es común, y estás utilizando herramientas que no protegen adecuadamente tus comunicaciones, eso puede comprometer tu trabajo y seguridad.</p>



<p>Para asegurarte de usar la tecnología de manera estratégica y responsable, tómate un tiempo para pensar sobre el modo en que adoptar nuevas tecnologías o recopilar más datos podría fortalecer o debilitar tu trabajo. Antes de adoptar cualquier herramienta o plataforma nueva, intenta desarrollar tu capacidad interna, ponte en contacto con colegas u otras organizaciones que respetes.</p>

 P2: ¿Cómo podemos mi equipo y yo aprender más sobre tecnología y cómo ese aprendizaje es relevante para nuestro trabajo?  



<p>Las tecnologías digitales evolucionan rápidamente, al igual que los debates y las conversaciones sobre los posibles beneficios y efectos nocivos del uso de herramientas y plataformas específicas. Cuando tratamos de aprender más sobre tecnología, encontramos que es más útil enfocarse en dos aspectos:&nbsp;</p>



  Trabajar para <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">desarrollar la intuición técnica del personal de manera paulatina y progresiva</a> (inglés), y convertir ese objetivo en una prioridad de todo el equipo tanto como sea posible (a diferencia de un trabajo de una sola persona).  En lugar de buscar <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/">herramientas da moda</a> (inglés), primero tratar de identificar cómo la tecnología y los datos podría <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/">fortalecer tu trabajo principal</a> (inglés).  



<p>Cuando se trata de nuevas herramientas y aplicaciones, hay mucha información en línea que puede ser atractiva, pero puede ser difícil identificar qué es relevante para ti y qué no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Para entender más fácilmente la información relacionada con la tecnología, comienza primero con el problema que estás tratando de comprender o abordar. Además, si puedes, comunícate con profesionales de ideas afines que puedan tener contextos o misiones similares a los tuyos y aprende más sobre las herramientas que están usando (¡y cuáles han sido sus éxitos y fracasos!).</p>

 P3: Mi organización cree que es hora de comenzar a usar más tecnología y datos en nuestro trabajo. ¿Dónde empezamos?  



<p>¡Primero consigue una perspectiva general clara de lo que ya estás usando! La mayoría de las organizaciones ya están utilizando al menos algo de tecnología y datos para respaldar su trabajo, desde herramientas cotidianas como el correo electrónico o la mensajería instantánea, hasta herramientas y bases de datos de CRM. A continuación, encontrarás una breve lista de preguntas que pueden servir como ejercicio inicial para mapear las formas en que estás utilizando la tecnología y los datos en tu trabajo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nota: parte de la información recopilada mediante este ejercicio de mapeo puede ser confidencial: antes de comenzar, asegúrate de guardar tus notas en un lugar seguro y de compartirlas solo con las personas que necesitan acceso a ellas.</p>



  ¿Qué herramientas utilizas actualmente para tu trabajo?  ¿Qué plataformas/herramientas usan tú y tu equipo en sus comunicaciones? Estas podrían incluir correo electrónico, mensajería instantánea, redes sociales, SMS y sitios web, por nombrar algunos.  ¿Cómo almacenas y administras tus archivos y documentos? ¿Qué plataformas usas? ¿Todo el&nbsp; equipo usa las mismas plataformas?  ¿Estás trabajando en campañas públicas o trabajas en equipo con otras organizaciones? En caso afirmativo, ¿qué herramientas utilizas para el activismo, la organización y la construcción de la comunidad?  ¿Estás trabajando con alguna base de datos o plataforma de investigación?    



<p></p>



  ¿Cómo estás usando los datos?&nbsp;  ¿Qué tipo de datos/información recopilas o generas día a día? Piensa en tus flujos de trabajo individuales y colectivos y enumera los momentos en los que recopilas o generas datos. Por ejemplo, recopilar información de contacto de las personas que ha entrevistado, tener conversaciones por correo electrónico o Whatsapp, tomar notas de entrevistas o reuniones, o realizar encuestas con las comunidades.  ¿Dónde almacenas los datos? Considera los datos que tienes actualmente y enumera todos los lugares en los que están (asegúrate de incluir todas sus ubicaciones remotas: correos electrónicos, documentos compartidos, etc.).  ¿Cuándo y cómo compartes los datos? Piensa en los momentos en los que necesitas compartir datos: ¿cuándo suele suceder, con quién los comparte y qué herramientas utilizas? Por ejemplo, puedes enviar hojas de cálculo o archivos PDF por correo electrónico, compartir documentos y actas de reuniones a través de Google Docs o compartir contraseñas a través de una aplicación de mensajería.&nbsp;    



<p>Estas son preguntas exploratorias iniciales.

 P4: ¿Cómo puedo asegurarme de que las herramientas tecnológicas y los datos que usamos sean realmente útiles para nuestro trabajo?  



<p>En nuestro trabajo de apoyo a las organizaciones de la sociedad civil, a menudo nos enfrentamos a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">presunciones acerca de lo digital siempre es mejor</a> (inglés), y que cualquier solución tecnológica conducirá a una mayor eficiencia, efectividad e impacto.</p>



<p>Pero este no es siempre el caso. Cuando trabajamos con un socio de manera más cercana, a menudo comenzamos a evaluar cómo su uso de datos y tecnología actualmente se relacionan con su trabajo y contexto. Esto puede ayudarnos a descubrir cómo, o incluso si, la forma en que usan la tecnología está fortaleciendo su trabajo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Después de mapear qué herramientas está utilizando la organización y qué datos recopila, almacena y comparte, pasamos a una segunda capa de preguntas: ¿Qué tan útil es todo esto (o qué tan útil podría ser) en el contexto de tu trabajo?:&nbsp;</p>



  ¿Cuál es el problema social o político central en el que estás trabajando?&nbsp;&nbsp;  ¿El uso de tecnología y datos te permite abordar mejor ese problema? Si es así, ¿cómo? Si no, ¿por qué crees que eso podría estar sucediendo?  ¿El uso diario de tecnología y datos te ayudan a conectarte con personas u organizaciones importantes para tu trabajo?  ¿La forma en que usas la tecnología y los datos está afectando tu carga de trabajo? ¿Está facilitando tu trabajo o la carga de trabajo está siendo insostenible para el equipo? ¿Te gusta usar tus herramientas de organización?

 Tomar decisiones – asegurándote de que los datos y la tecnología que usas coincidan con tus valores y misión 



 P5. ¿Cómo tomamos decisiones sobre la adopción de nuevas herramientas y/o la recopilación de datos?  



<p>Hay muchos aspectos a considerar al seleccionar una herramienta, y existen diversas opciones, incluso varias que quizás aún no conozcas. Entonces, ¿cómo empezar a reducir (o ampliar) tus opciones?</p>



<p>En el 2017, en base a nuestra investigación sobre la selección de herramientas en organizaciones de la sociedad civil, elaboramos un <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/alidade-interactive-guide-for-finding-technology-tools/">guía interactiva de selección de herramientas llamada Alidade</a> (Inglés), que por medio de preguntas puede ayudar a las organizaciones a decidir qué tipo de herramienta tecnológica mejor se adapta a sus necesidades. ¡Recomendamos probarla!.</p>



<p>En general, cuando las organizaciones buscan nuevas herramientas tecnológicas, hemos constatado que las siguientes pautas resultan beneficiosas:</p>



  Investigar a las personas, el problema y luego la tecnología. Analiza el problema general donde piensas que una herramienta tecnológica podría ser útil. Piensa en tu público objetivo. Investiga y examina las diferentes alternativas tecnológicas disponibles.&nbsp;  Pensar dos veces antes de construir. Busca herramientas ya existentes acordes a tus necesidades. Construir una herramienta completamente nueva puede ser complejo y arriesgado.  Conseguir una segunda opinión. Probablemente alguien más haya intentado un enfoque similar previamente. Encuentra a esa persona y pídele consejos.  Siempre hay que probar. Antes de elegir una prueba al menos dos herramientas, con las personas con las que quieres usarlas. Ponerlas a prueba permite detectar problemas. También te permite plantearte preguntas que no se te habían ocurrido.  Planificar por si falla. La primera vez puede que no salga bien. Prepara un plan y un presupuesto que te permita ir haciendo ajustes regulares a la herramienta a lo largo del proyecto.  Reflexionar sobre lo que estás haciendo. Sigue pensando en lo que funciona y lo que no funciona. Aplica ese aprendizaje al trabajo de tu organización y compártelo con otras organizaciones.  



<p>Asegúrate de que las herramientas que elijas también se adapten a tus necesidades de seguridad. Al evaluar la seguridad de una herramienta, considera lo siguiente:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  ¿Cuál es la política de privacidad de datos de la herramienta? ¿Qué tipo de datos recopila la herramienta y con quién se comparten esos datos? ¿Quién tiene acceso a los datos almacenados dentro de la herramienta?  ¿Está bien documentado el enfoque de privacidad y seguridad de la herramienta? ¿Qué puedes averiguar sobre el historial de privacidad y seguridad de la herramienta?  



<p>Documenta tus hallazgos y coméntalos con tus colegas antes de tomar una decisión final sobre una herramienta.</p>

 P6: Mi organización quiere integrar nuevas tecnologías, pero no hemos encontrado la herramienta adecuada. ¿Deberíamos construir una nueva herramienta? 



<p>Si estás familiarizado con nuestro trabajo, probablemente sepas que a menudo estamos a favor de adaptar las herramientas existentes a tus necesidades siempre que sea posible (llamamos a esto “reutilización de herramientas”).</p>



<p>Nuestra investigación en esta área en los últimos años ha demostrado que la reutilización y la adaptación de las herramientas existentes puede tener una serie de ventajas, como el uso más eficiente de los recursos financieros y el aumento del acceso al apoyo en la implementación y el mantenimiento.</p>



<p>Desarrollar una herramienta desde cero, por otro lado, este puede ser un proceso prolongado y costoso, con resultados decepcionantes: hemos visto cómo las herramientas pueden terminar siendo ineficaces o poco utilizadas, resultar inesperadamente onerosas o requerir para su mantenimiento y actualización del empleo intensivo de recursos.</p>



<p>Pero si la funcionalidad que tu organización está buscando no está disponible y, estás considerando construir una nueva herramienta, aquí hay algunas preguntas para reflexionar al respecto:</p>



  ¿Existe una necesidad real e identificable de esta herramienta? ¿Esto te acercará más a tus objetivos a largo plazo? ¿La construcción de una herramienta respondería a una fuerte necesidad que ha surgido durante tu trabajo, o la idea tuvo otro origen?  ¿Cuentas con los recursos necesarios para construir la herramienta, mantenerla a largo plazo y brindar apoyo continuo a quienes la utilizarán?  ¿Cuál es tu visión para la herramienta a largo plazo? ¿Podrían las necesidades o problemas que se está construyendo la herramienta para abordar potencialmente evolucionar con el tiempo?

 P7. ¿Cómo puedo usar tecnología/datos si mi acceso a Internet o a la electricidad no es confiable?  



<p>Si tienes problemas de acceso intermitente a Internet, considera la adopción de herramientas que te posibiliten trabajar tanto en línea como sin conexión. En Google Docs, por ejemplo, puedes <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6388102?hl=es">habilitar el acceso offline a los documentos</a> . Esto te permitirá continuar trabajando sin conexión y luego sincronizar los documentos una vez que se restablezca la conectividad. Algunas herramientas de recopilación y gestión de datos, como <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo ToolBox</a>, te permite recopilar datos en dispositivos cuando no tienes conexión, y luego cargar datos al servidor una vez que la red esté disponible. Para reuniones en línea en entornos de baja conectividad, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> es una opción gratuita, de código abierto y liviana para llamadas de solo audio.</p>



<p>Si el presupuesto de tu organización lo permite, también recomendamos invertir en una conexión de respaldo: por ejemplo, una conexión de red móvil para conectar sus dispositivos cuando su conexión de banda ancha no esté disponible.</p>



<p>Hay dos formas de hacerlo: usando un módem de Internet móvil o un teléfono inteligente para crear un punto de acceso móvil donde otros dispositivos pueden conectarse y compartir la conectividad móvil. Aquí hay un breve tutorial sobre <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915">Cómo crear un punto de acceso móvil en un teléfono inteligente Android</a> (Inglés). Puedes reducir el consumo de datos compartiendo la contraseña de acceso solo con dispositivos y personas imprescindibles.</p>



<p>En los casos en que la conexión a Internet y/o la electricidad sean intermitentes y estés trabajando en línea, asegúrate de guardar tu trabajo con la mayor frecuencia posible para minimizar el riesgo de perderlo.</p>



<p>Si con frecuencia sufres cortes de electricidad, adquirir un generador de respaldo puede ser una opción útil, siempre que tu organización cuente con los recursos para hacerlo.</p>

<p></p>



 P8. ¿Cómo trabajar con personas desarrolladoras y/o expertas en temas de tecnología? 



<p>Hay muchos tipos diferentes de profesionales con los que puedes trabajar. Entre las profesiones que interactúan con mayor frecuencia con tecnología y datos se encuentran:</p>



  Diseño de experiencia de usuario (UX): Trabaja tanto con clientes (¡en este caso, contigo!) como con usuarios para diseñar un producto que satisfaga múltiples necesidades y sea fácil de entender y operar.&nbsp;  Diseño visual o gráfico: Supervisa los elementos gráficos que utilizará un sitio web, una herramienta, una aplicación o una publicación, y es responsable de diseñar la identidad visual (o la marca). A menudo trabajan con la persona encargada de diseño de UX para asegurarse de que la identidad visual también funcione bien para las personas usuarias.  Ilustración: Crea ilustraciones, íconos, infografías, etc., que vivirán dentro de la estructura más grande que han creado el diseñador visual y el diseñador UX.  Desarrollo Frontend: Implementa el diseño en un sitio web, herramienta o aplicación. En particular, es capaz de codificar los aspectos que los usuarios verán y con los que interactuarán.  Desarrollo Backend: Desarrolla y conecta una base de datos al frontend (las partes del sitio web, la aplicación o la herramienta que un usuario puede ver) y realiza todas las tareas no visibles que llenarán el frontend con contenido dinámico.  Análisis de datos: Extrae patrones de grandes volúmenes de datos. También pueden estar equipados con las herramientas y el conocimiento para crear visualizaciones de datos para comunicar patrones importantes.  Sysadmin/DevOps: Mantiene los servidores donde vive el sitio web, la herramienta o la aplicación. A menudo son responsables de coordinar el procedimiento necesario para resolver problemas cuando los usuarios detectan errores o fallos.  



<p>A veces, los roles pueden superponerse: por ejemplo, puedes contratar a una persona que lidere el diseño y desarrollo de un sitio web, o una persona desarrolladora que sea capaz de trabajar tanto en el frontend como en el backend.</p>



<p>Antes de contratar personas desarrolladoras y tecnólogas externas, es útil que:&nbsp;</p>



  Seas claro acerca de por qué deseas crear o adoptar nuevas herramientas.  Identifiques los recursos que tienes y los que necesitarás.  Te acuerdes de planificar el mantenimiento a largo plazo.  



<p>Cuando comiencen a trabajar juntos es importante establecer puntos de coincidencia y una terminología compartida acerca de las necesidades y expectativas. Recomendamos redactar los TdR (Términos de Referencia) para documentar y compartir las necesidades y requisitos del proyecto. Los TdR deben cubrir como mínimo:</p>



  El presupuesto disponible del proyecto.  La línea de tiempo necesaria  Tus objetivos  Tus expectativas para el socio externo  Cualquier información adicional  



<p>También deben ponerse de acuerdo en lo referido a herramientas, canales de comunicación, roles y responsabilidades.</p>



<p>Todo esto puede contribuir en gran medida al éxito del proyecto desde el principio. Algunos items de la lista de tareas del trabajo con consultores una vez que el proceso está en marcha son:</p>



  Concéntrate en la claridad de los objetivos organizacionales, los grandes procesos y los hitos para apoyar mejor al equipo/proyecto.  Brinda retroalimentación relevante y oportuna.  Proporciona espacio y muestra respeto por la experiencia del consultor.  Trata de mantener una comunicación frecuente.

 P9. Mi organización hace mucho de nuestro trabajo en línea, pero nuestra colaboración no siempre funciona tan bien. ¿Cómo podemos hacer que la colaboración en línea funcione mejor? 



<p>Sabemos de primera mano que cuando se trata de colaborar en línea, encontrar la forma correcta de comunicarse es esencial, tanto para trabajar sin problemas como para el bienestar general.</p>



<p>Idealmente, tu equipo tendrá una selección de herramientas o canales para usar (por ejemplo, una combinación de aplicaciones de chat seguras, correo electrónico y herramientas de gestión de proyectos), pero es importante que cada uno de estos tenga una función clara.</p>



<p>A menudo, nuestros socios usan tantas herramientas diferentes que se sienten abrumados cada vez que necesitan compartir un documento, una idea o un mensaje. Si este es el caso de tu organización, destina un tiempo para anotar rápidamente todas las diversas herramientas que usan para comunicarse; la lista podría incluir aplicaciones como Signal y Whatsapp, plataformas de mensajería como Slack y Mattermost, CRM en línea como Salesforce, herramientas de VOIP como Skype, Zoom o Jitsi Meet, y herramientas de colaboración como Trello, Airtable, Asana y otras. Quizás también usan mensajes SMS y llamadas telefónicas.</p>



<p>Una vez que tengas esta lista, te sugerimos que te reúnas con tus colegas, o con las personas con las que colaboras más a menudo, para de manera consensuada intentar usar menos herramientas. Asigna a cada herramienta un propósito específico: por ejemplo, tal vez el correo electrónico sea para mensajes más largos que no sean sensibles al tiempo o para compartir documentos, mientras que los programas de mensajería son solo para preguntas urgentes o conversaciones amistosas.</p>



<p>Una vez que hayas identificado algunas cosas que funcionan, ¡documenta los aprendizajes! La documentación asegurará que todos estén en la misma página y que sea una gran referencia para cualquier persona nueva que se una al equipo o para permanecer consciente de los procesos/proyectos.</p>

 Centrar esfuerzos en torno a la seguridad y el cuidado 



 P10: ¿Cómo puedo asegurarme de que todo mi equipo esté utilizando las herramientas (o procesos de datos) que hemos elegido? 



<p>Incluso cuando estamos entusiasmados con una nueva herramienta tecnológica o un proceso para el uso de datos, es difícil adoptar nuevas formas de trabajar. Al mismo tiempo, asegurarnos de que estamos utilizando las herramientas que acordamos usar (y sus protocolos de seguridad o protección relevantes) es una manera importante de poner en práctica el cuidado mutuo en las organizaciones.</p>



<p>Una medida para ayudarnos mutuamente en la adopción de una nueva forma de trabajar es asegurarnos de que la nueva herramienta o protocolo responda a una necesidad concreta y que todos sepan cuál es esa necesidad. Esto significa que todos saben que el esfuerzo que realizan para aprender a usar la nueva herramienta, los acercará a encontrar una solución a un problema que venían enfrentando.</p>



<p>Al mismo tiempo, es importante gestionar las expectativas: los cambios posiblemente se empiecen a notar poco a poco, con el tiempo, a medida que más personas usan una herramienta o protocolo y se familiarizan con él. Eso es parte del proceso.</p>



<p>Y, como es un proceso, es bueno dejar espacio y tiempo para el aprendizaje, la adaptación y el debate cuando se implementa una nueva herramienta. Dependiendo de qué más esté pasando, las capacidades para aprender algo nuevo pueden variar entre los equipos, y dar espacio puede ser la mejor manera de reconocer esto.</p>



<p>Finalmente, escuchar las experiencias de aquellas personas que usan la nueva herramienta pueden ayudarte a detectar eventuales ajustes que quieras hacer en la herramienta como tal o en el modo en que se utiliza.&nbsp;</p>

 P11: ¿Qué podemos hacer para mantener a las personas más seguras cuando comenzamos a usar diferentes herramientas tecnológicas y prácticas de datos? 



<p>Muchas de las personas con las que hablamos tienen curiosidad sobre cómo incorporar la seguridad y el cuidado en todo el trabajo que realizan, especialmente cuando se trata de nuevas iniciativas de tecnología y datos. Cuando en las noticias, en nuestras comunidades y por experiencias personales nos enteramos de casos de fugas de datos y de hackeos a herramientas,&nbsp; incorporar de manera segura herramientas o procesos tecnológicos puede resultar una tarea ardua.</p>



<p>Un enfoque que puede contribuir a la construcción de una base adecuada es el de Datos Responsables (Responsible Data): la idea de que compartimos un “deber colectivo de dar cuenta de las consecuencias no deseadas de trabajar con datos.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Algunas áreas para explorar que caen bajo el paraguas de Datos Responsables son:</p>



  Prácticas como la minimización de datos (solo recopilar los datos necesarios).

<p>Si no estás familiarizado con este tipo de prácticas, existen recursos que pueden ayudarte, desde guías en línea hasta apoyo para profesionales.</p>



<p>Seleccionar herramientas que prioricen tu seguridad puede ser otro paso a seguir. A menudo, estas herramientas no se usan tanto como sus contrapartes menos seguras, por lo que esta podría ser una oportunidad para consultar con colegas de ideas afines o para contactar a una consultoría tecnológica externa de tu confianza. Algunas de estas herramientas podrían incluir:</p>



  Gestores de contraseñas: Crear contraseñas fuertes y únicas es una parte fundamental del uso de la tecnología de manera más segura. Los administradores de contraseñas pueden realizar un seguimiento de tus contraseñas y ayudarte a crear buenas contraseñas.&nbsp; <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords">Aprende más aquí</a> (Inglés).  Herramientas de comunicación más seguras: Muchos mensajes que enviamos digitalmente no están encriptados, lo que significa que si alguien los interceptara, podría leer el contenido. Las herramientas de comunicaciones más seguras ofrecen cifrado, lo que dificulta que las personas lean el contenido de tus mensajes. Puedes&nbsp; <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures">aprender más aquí</a> (Inglés), o puedes <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">comunicarte con The Engine Room</a> para obtener ayuda sobre la adopción de nuevas herramientas.  Redes privadas virtuales: Una VPN (red virtual privada) es una herramienta que puede ayudar a proteger tu actividad web de la vigilancia en la red de Internet que estás utilizando. Elegir la VPN correcta, y conocer sus limitaciones, es crucial y depende del contexto en el que te encuentres (en qué país estés, qué VPN elijas, etc.). Al mismo tiempo, elegir la VPN adecuada para tu situación puede ser complejo, así que puedes <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you">conseguir información aquí</a> y no dudes en <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">comunicarte con The Engine Room</a> para obtener apoyo.&nbsp;  



<p>Siempre ten en cuenta que la seguridad es una combinación de herramientas y prácticas. Así como contar con las herramientas adecuadas es importante, usarlas de la manera correcta y desarrollar prácticas internas sólidas en torno a la seguridad en general, teniendo en cuenta la seguridad física y psicológica también lo es.</p>

<p>Before we get started, what do we mean by data? And technology? Odds are, you’re working with both!&nbsp;<br><br>We define data as information that needs to be processed, organised and structured for the sake of usability. In other words, by data we mean the information that you hold, such as details about the communities you work with, findings from research you have done, results from surveys, email addresses and contact information for supporters, and so on. <br><br>We understand technology as the tools, systems, methods and processes that capitalise on the computational power to manage, analyse and communicate information. For this resource, when we talk about technology, we mean digital tools, broadly. Anything from email platforms and messenger apps to website hosts, email newsletter platforms, CRMs, databases, algorithmic processes and more.</p>

 Initial explorations – getting a feel for your own tech &amp; data landscape 



 Q1: Our peers seem to be using more tech/data. Should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well? 



<p>The answer here will really depend on context. Tech can support you to organise daily work and operations, enable safer and more secure communication, collect and manage information, and cut costs and free up resources, among other things. But if used ineffectively or non-strategically, tech can also compromise your ability to do your work safely and effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if your organisation is collecting first-hand accounts of human rights violations in areas with low internet/mobile connectivity, adopting a data collection tool that requires an internet connection will make your work difficult and negatively impact your ability to carry out your mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Used non-strategically, tech can also expose you, and those you work with, to new vulnerabilities and risks. For instance, if you’re in a context where government surveillance of civil society is common and you’re using tools that don’t adequately protect your communications, that may compromise your work and safety.</p>



<p>To make sure that you use tech strategically and responsibly, take some time to think about how adopting new tech or collecting more data could strengthen or weaken your work. Before adopting any new tools or platform, try to build up your internal capacity, connect with peers or other organisations you respect.</p>

 Q2: How can my team and I learn more about tech and how it’s relevant to our work?&nbsp; 



<p>Digital technologies evolve quickly, as do debates and conversations about the potential benefits and harms of using specific tools and platforms. When trying to learn more about tech, we find it’s most useful to focus on two things:&nbsp;</p>



  Work to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">slowly and incrementally build up staff technical intuition</a>, making it a team-wide priority as much as possible (as opposed to a one-person job).  Instead of looking for <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/">shiny new tools</a>, try to identify how tech and data could <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/">strengthen your core work</a> first.  



<p>When it comes to new tools and applications, there is a lot of information online that can be enticing — but it can be hard to identify what is relevant to you, and what isn’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To more easily make sense of tech-related information, start with the challenge you’re trying to understand or address first. Additionally, if you can, reach out to like-minded practitioners who might have similar contexts or missions to yours and learn more about what tools they’re using (and what their successes and challenges have been!).&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



 Q3: My organisation thinks it’s time to start using more tech and data in our work. Where do we start?&nbsp; 



<p>First get a clear overview of what you’re already using! Most organisations are already using at least some tech and data to support their work – from day-to-day tools such as email or instant messaging, to CRM tools and databases. Below, is a short list of questions that can serve as an initial exercise to map the ways you’re using tech and data for your work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note: Some of the information you gather as part of this mapping exercise may be sensitive: before you start, make sure your notes are stored in a safe place and only shared with people who need access.</p>



  What tools are you currently using for your work?&nbsp;  What platforms/tools do you and your team communicate with? These could include email, instant messaging, social media, SMS, and websites, to name a few.  How do you store and manage your files and documents? Which platforms do you use? Does everyone on your team use the same platforms?  Are you working on public campaigns or a part of collective efforts with other organisations? If yes, what tools do you use for activism, organising and community building?  Are you working with any databases or research platforms?    



  How are you using data?&nbsp;  What type of data/information do you collect or generate day-to-day? Think about your individual and collective workflows and list the moments at which you collect or generate data. For example, collecting contact information for people you have interviewed, having discussions over email or Whatsapp, taking interview or meeting notes, or conducting surveys with communities.  Where do you store data? Consider the data you currently have and list all the places it lives (make sure to include all your remote locations – &nbsp;emails, shared documents, and so on).&nbsp;  When and how do you share data? Think about times when you need to share data: when does it usually happen, who do you share this with and what tools do you use? For example, you might be sending spreadsheets or PDFs over email, sharing documents and meeting minutes via Google Docs, or sharing passwords via a messaging app.&nbsp;    



<p>These are initial exploratory questions.&nbsp; For a complete version of this mapping exercise, see <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/">Becoming RAD!</a> (published in 2021), or <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">reach out to our team</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, adopting new tools takes time and resources. Make sure to give yourself and your team dedicated spaces to learn unfamiliar tools, practice behaviours and get up to speed with new data being used.</p>



<p>Related questions: <br>– <a title="Q1">Our peers seem to be using more tech/data, should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well?</a><br>– <a>How can my team and I learn more about tech and how it’s relevant to our work?</a></p>

<p></p>



 Q4: How can I make sure that the tech tools and data we’re using are actually useful for our work? 



<p>In our work supporting civil society organisations, we are often faced with <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">assumptions that digital means better</a>, and that any tech solution will lead to increased efficiency, effectiveness and impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this isn’t always the case. When we’re working with a partner more intensively, we often start with an assessment of how their tech and data use currently maps on to their work and context.&nbsp; This can help us figure out how, or even if, the way they’re using tech is strengthening their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After mapping out what tools the organisation is using and what data is collected, stored and shared, we go through a second layer of questions: How useful is all of this (or how useful could it be ) in the context of your work:&nbsp;</p>



  What is the core social or political problem you are working on?&nbsp;&nbsp;  Is your use of tech and data supporting you in addressing that problem? If yes, how? If not, why do you think that could be happening?&nbsp;  Is your day-to-day use of tech and data helping you connect with individuals or organisations important to your work?  Is the way you use tech and data impacting your workload? Is it making your work easier or is it creating unsustainable amounts of work for the team? Do you enjoy using your organisational tools?&nbsp;

 Making decisions – making sure the data &amp; tech you use matches your values and mission 



 Q5. How do we make decisions around adopting new tools and/or collecting data?&nbsp; 



<p>There’s a lot to think about when selecting a tool, and there are many options out there – including many that you may not know about yet. So how do you start narrowing down (or expanding) your options?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2017, based on research we did on tool selection in civil society organisations, we created an <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/alidade-interactive-guide-for-finding-technology-tools/">interactive tool-selection guide called Alidade</a>, which takes organisations through questions that can help them decide what kind of technology tool would fit with their project or organisational needs. We recommend trying it out!.</p>



<p>In general, when organisations are looking for new tech tools, we have found the following guidelines to be beneficial:</p>



  Research the people, the problem, and then the technology. Look into the overall problem where you think a technology tool could help. Think about your intended audience. Do research and look at different options for what technology options are available.&nbsp;  Think twice before you build. Look for existing tools that can do what you need. Building a completely new tool can be complex and risky.  Get a second opinion. Someone else has probably tried a similar approach before you. Find them, and ask for advice.  Always take it for a test drive. Try out at least two tools, with the people you want to use it, before choosing. Trialling highlights problems at the start. It also raises questions you never knew you had.  Plan for failure. You will not get it right the first time. Budget and plan to make regular adjustments to the tool throughout the project.  Reflect on what you’re doing. Keep thinking about what is and isn’t working. Apply what you learn to your organisation’s work, and share with other organisations.  



<p>Make sure that the tools you choose also fit your security needs. When evaluating a tool’s security, consider the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  What is the tool’s data privacy policy? What kind of data does the tool collect and who is that data shared with? Who has access to any data stored within the tool?&nbsp;  Is the tool’s approach to privacy and security well-documented? What can you find out about the tool’s privacy and security record?&nbsp;  



<p>Document and discuss your findings with your colleagues before making a final decision on a tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Related questions: <br>– <a>Our peers seem to be using more tech/data, should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well?</a><br>– <a>How can my team and I learn more about tech and how it’s relevant to our work?&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Related resources:&nbsp; <a href="https://alidade.tech/">Alidade</a></p>



 
 <a>Back to the top</a> 
 



<p></p>



 Q6: My organisation wants to integrate new tech but we haven’t found the right tool. Should we build a new tool ourselves? 



<p>If you are familiar with our work, you probably know we often advocate for adapting existing tools for your own needs where possible (we call this ‘tool re-use’).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research in this area over the last few years has shown that re-using and adapting existing tools can have a number of advantages, like more efficient use of financial resources and increasing access to support in implementation and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building a tool from scratch, on the other hand, can be a resource-consuming, lengthy process that can lead to disappointment: We’ve seen how tools can end up being ineffective or under-used, be unexpectedly costly, or demand intensive resources to be maintained or updated.</p>



<p>But if the functionality your organisation is looking for just can’t be found, and you are considering building a new tool, here are a few questions to reflect on:</p>



  Is there a real, identifiable need for this tool? Will this get you closer to your long-term goals? Would building a tool respond to a strong need that has come up in your work, or has the idea come about in other ways?  Do you have the resources needed to build the tool, maintain it over the long term and provide continued support to those who will be using it?  What is your vision for the tool over the long term? Could the needs or problems that the tool is being built to address potentially evolve over time?&nbsp;

 Q7. How can I use tech/data if my access to the internet or to electricity is unreliable? 



<p>If you are struggling with intermittent internet access, consider adopting tools that allow you to work both online and offline. In Google Docs, for example, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6388102?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">enable offline access to documents.</a> This will allow you to continue with your work offline, and then sync documents once connectivity is restored. Some data collection and management tools, such as <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo ToolBox</a>, also allow you to collect data on devices when you have no connectivity and then upload data to the server once the network is available. For online meetings in low connectivity settings, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> is a free, open source and lightweight option for audio-only calls.</p>



<p>If your organisation’s budget allows for it, we also recommend investing in a backup connection: for example, a mobile network connection to connect your devices to when your broadband connection is not available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two ways to do this:&nbsp; Use a mobile internet modem, or use a dedicated smartphone to create a mobile hotspot where other devices can connect and share the mobile connectivity. Here is a brief tutorial on <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915">how to create a mobile hotspot on an Android smartphone</a>. You can limit the amount of data used by sharing the access password with only critical devices or users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In cases when the internet connection and/or electricity are intermittent and you are working online, make sure to save your work as frequently as possible, to minimise the risk of losing work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you experience electricity shortages often, acquiring a backup generator can be a useful option, as long as you have organisational resources to do so.</p>

<p></p>



 Q8. How do I work with external developers and/or technologists?&nbsp; 



<p>There are many different types of external experts you can work with. Common types of external consultants/experts who interact with technology or data include:</p>



  User experience (UX) designer: Works with both clients (in this case, that’s you!) and users to design a product that satisfies multiple needs and is easy to understand and operate.&nbsp;  Visual or Graphic Designer: Oversees the graphic elements that a website, tool, app or publication will use, and is responsible for designing the visual identity (or branding). They often work with the UX designer to make sure that the visual identity works well for users, too.  Illustrator: Creates illustrations, icons, infographics and more, which will live within the larger structure that the Visual Designer and UX Designer have created.  Frontend Developer: Implements the design on a website, tool or app. In particular, is able to code the aspects that users will see and interact with.&nbsp;  Backend Developer: Develops and connects a database to the frontend (the parts of the website, app or tool that a user can see) and does all the non-visible tasks that will fill the frontend with dynamic content.&nbsp;  Data Analyst/Scientist: Extracts patterns from large volumes of data. They may also be equipped with the tools and knowledge to create visualisations of data in order to communicate important patterns.  Sysadmin/DevOps: Maintains the servers where the website, tool or app lives. They’re often responsible for coordinating the troubleshooting necessary if users encounter bugs or errors.  



<p>Sometimes roles can overlap: for example, you could hire a consultant who leads the design and development of a website, or a developer who is capable of working on both the frontend and backend.</p>



<p>Before hiring external developers and technologists, it’s helpful to:&nbsp;</p>



  Be clear about why you want to build or adopt new tools.  Identify the resources you have and those you will need.  Remember to plan for long-term maintenance.&nbsp;  



<p>At the beginning of your work together, it’s important to establish common ground and a shared terminology about needs and expectations. We recommend developing a ToR (Terms of Reference) in order to document and share project needs and requirements. The ToR should cover at minimum:</p>



  &nbsp;The available project budget  &nbsp;The necessary timeline  &nbsp;Your goals  &nbsp;Your expectations for the external partner  Any additional information  



<p>You should also agree on tools, channels for communication, and roles and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this can greatly contribute to project success early on. Some “do’s” when working with consultants once the work is underway are:&nbsp;</p>



  Focus on clarity of organisational goals, big processes and milestones in order to better support the team/project.  Provide relevant and timely feedback.  Provide space and respect for the consultant’s expertise.  Try to be responsive with communications.

 Q9. My organisation does a lot of our work online, but our collaboration doesn’t always work so smoothly.&nbsp; How can we make online collaboration work better for us? 



<p>We know first hand that when it comes to collaborating online, finding the right way to communicate is essential – both to working smoothly and to overall well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, your team will have a selection of tools or channels to use (for example, a mix of secure chat apps, email and project management tools), but it’s important that each of these has a clear role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often, our partners are using so many different tools that they feel overwhelmed any time they need to share a document, idea or message. If this is the case for your organisation, take some time to quickly write down all the different tools people communicate through – it could include apps like Signal and Whatsapp, messaging platforms like Slack and Mattermost, online CRMs like Salesforce, VOIP tools like Skype, Zoom or Jitsi Meet, and collaboration tools like Trello, Airtable, Asana and others. Perhaps you also use SMS messages and phone calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you have this list, we suggest getting together with your colleagues, or the people you collaborate with most often, to agree to trying to use fewer tools. Assign each tool with a specific purpose: for example, perhaps email is for longer messages that aren’t time sensitive, or for sharing documents, whereas messaging programmes are only for urgent questions or friendly conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you’ve identified a few things that work, document it! Documentation will make sure that everyone is on the same page and will be a great reference for anyone new joining the team or for just remaining aware of processes/projects.</p>

 Centering safety and care&nbsp; 



 Q10: How can I make sure my whole team is using the tools (or data processes) that we’ve picked? 



<p>Even when we’re excited about a new tech tool or process for using data, actually adopting new ways of working is difficult. At the same time, making sure that we’re using the agreed-on tools (and their relevant safety or security protocols) is an important way in which we can practise care towards one another in organisations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One step to take to help each other adopt a new way of working is to make sure the new tool or protocol responds to a concrete need and that everyone knows what that need is. This means everyone knows that by putting in the work to learn the new tool, they will be closer to a solution to an issue they’ve been facing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, it’s important to manage expectations – changes might be felt little-by-little, over time, as more people use a tool or protocol and get familiar with it. That’s part of the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, because it’s a process, it’s good to leave space and time for learning, adaptation and discussion when a new tool is rolled out. Depending on what else is going on, capacities for learning something new can vary across teams, and giving space can be the best way to recognise this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, listening to the experiences of those using the new tool can help you spot ways you might want to tweak the tool itself if you can, or tweak how it’s being applied.&nbsp;</p>

 Q11: What can we do to keep people safer when we start using different tech tools and data practices? 



<p>Many of the people we speak with are curious about how to incorporate safety and care in all the work they do – especially when it comes to new tech and data initiatives. As we see things like data leaks and hacked tools in the news, in our communities, and in our own experiences, safely adopting tools or tech processes can feel daunting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One approach that can help provide grounding is that of Responsible Data (RD): the idea that we share a “collective duty to account for unintended consequences of working with data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some areas to explore that fall under the RD umbrella are:&nbsp;</p>



  Practices like data minimisation (only collecting the data you need).  Concepts like consent (ensuring that people are able to agree to how their data will be used in a freely-given, specific, informed and revocable way).&nbsp;  Related spaces like organisational security (a rich area of practice around setting protocols that can help build data/information security and physical well-being and security).  



<p>If you’re not familiar with these kinds of practices, there are resources that can help – from online guides to practitioner support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Selecting tools that prioritise your security can be another step to take. Often, these tools aren’t as widely used as their less-secure counterparts, so this could be an opportunity to consult with like-minded peers, or to contact an external technologist who you trust. Some of these tools could include:</p>



  Password managers: Creating strong, unique passwords is a fundamental part of using technology more safely. Password managers can both keep track of your passwords and help you create good passwords.&nbsp; <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords">Learn more here</a>.  Safer communications tools: Many messages that we send digitally are not encrypted, meaning that if someone were to intercept them, they could read the contents. Safer communications tools offer encryption, making it harder for people to read the contents of your messages. You can <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures">learn more here</a>, or reach out to us for support on adopting new tools.  Virtual private networks: A VPN (virtual private network) is a tool that can help protect your web activity from surveillance on the internet network you’re using. Picking the right VPN – and knowing its limitations – is crucial, and depends on the context you’re within (what country you’re in, what VPN you choose, etc.). At the same time, choosing the right VPN for your situation can be complex, so <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you">gather some information here</a> and don’t hesitate to reach out to us for support.&nbsp;  



<p>Always keep in mind that security is a mix of both tools and practices. It’s important to have the right tools, but it’s just as important to use these tools in the right way, and to build strong internal practices around security in general, taking into account physical and psychological safety as well.</p>

		<p>Founded in 2011, Zoom quickly became a household name during the pandemic as many remote workers, teachers, and students needed an online solution for learning and collaborating. Last year, Zoom was named a leader in the Gartner 2021 Magic Quadrant for Unified Communications as a service (UCaaS) Worldwide and rated as a top vendor by TrustRadius for excellence in customer satisfaction. Along with continuing to offer exceptional meeting room solutions, Zoom provides a cloud phone service that allows users to make phone calls with the same ease and familiarity as Zoom video meetings. Zoom Phone enables secure voice calls across all supported devices and offers a simple and straightforward way for Zoom users to set up quick calls without video. “As a single communications stack, Zoom Phone seamlessly allows people to connect into Zoom Cloud from a desktop, mobile device, hardware phone, or room system,” explains Glenn Grieshaber, Account Executive of Higher Education, Zoom Video Communications. “Zoom is a cloud-native infrastructure that gives our customers a single platform solution that is optimized for modern communications. From an educational organization perspective, the single unified client of Zoom Phone makes deploying, scaling, managing, and maintaining the technology much easier for IT managers.”</p>
<p>Designed to drive team collaboration, Zoom’s solutions look to enrich teaching and learning and expand traditional classroom settings with a true unified solution. “We are trying to meet the growing needs of schools and the requirements of their modern learners and teachers,” shares Grieshaber. “Zoom aims to help organizations improve their learning outcomes, make their meetings easier and more efficient, and increase student retention and engagement. From the organization’s viewpoint, we also want to maximize current resources. The single client of Zoom Phone makes using and scaling university and college resources much easier. Plus, this solution can seamlessly integrate with an institution’s learning management system (LMS).”</p>
<p>Migrating to the Cloud<br>
Many institutions in higher education are beginning to make the transition from conventional phone services, like private branch exchange (PBX), to cloud technology solutions. “This migration is being driven by the need to move away from legacy analog technology to a digital cloud solution for several reasons,” explains Michelle Ferraro, Member Account Manager, Edge. “PBX services are primarily supported by on premise hardware and software, and we are seeing many of these solutions become obsolete due to their lack of flexibility and high support cost models. Colleges and universities that are still running on legacy PBX systems have begun to migrate and explore the advantages of cloud-based technology for their communications offerings.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>With these PBX solutions becoming outdated, Grieshaber has also noted a rise in organizations exploring the advantages of cloud-based technology. “Fortunately, new solutions like Zoom Phone will easily integrate into other third-party solutions and allow institutions to move more of their support model into the Cloud through professional services or reduced administrative touchpoints, freeing up staff to focus on other tasks. We have also seen many of these legacy solutions being discontinued, so some institutions with very specific use cases demanded an enterprise-quality solution in the Cloud. Zoom Phone was built from the ground up to solve these types of use cases and administrative challenges and provide a streamlined end-user experience by leveraging data to that single client for all their video and phone needs.”</p>
<p>Cloud-based solutions offer flexible end user-based solutions that move most of the support model into the Cloud for easier management. “This transition is happening for several reasons,” explains Ferraro. “One is the need to consolidate and manage communication requirements from a single all-in-one solution for an UCaaS environment. Organizations also want to drive team collaboration on intelligent platforms, while supporting and managing off-site employees securely. Cloud solutions can also help organizations reduce IT expenditures, better manage the year-over-year forecasted budget, and effectively confront rising security concerns.”</p>
<p>In addition, Zoom helps enable our customers’ HIPAA compliance programs and is E911 compliant, addressing regulated Enhanced Emergency Services, such as Kari’s Law and Ray Baums Act, at no additional cost to the end user. This new federal law requires businesses to comply with three phases of compliance regulations that took final effect in January 2022. These requirements include: 1) A phone system must allow a user to dial 911 without any prefix or access code; 2) Notification must be sent when 911 is called; 3) A valid callback number (not the main company phone number) must be provided when 911 is called.</p>

		<p>Tailored Communication Experience<br>
Specifically, in the education space, many institutions have developed solutions over a long period of time and have combined multiple platforms together over the years, often resulting in a subpar end-user experience. “With platforms that have been bridged together, you have multiple touchpoints from the administrative side and this setup poses a very challenging support model in the end; raising the overall cost of the solution and complexity of the network,” says Grieshaber. “We’re seeing from most of our colleges and universities a desire to replace these multiple platforms and technologies with a simple single application. So far, the feedback from New Jersey institutions that have deployed Zoom Phone has been positive. Being architected on a single client, organizations have been able to scale very simply, securely support off-site employees and students, and train their staff easily, especially since many people are already familiar with the Zoom app and interface.”</p>
<p>Being a robust cloud PBX built on a single application, Zoom Phone allows a seamless workflow from a phone call to Zoom Meeting, Zoom Chat, and Zoom Room. “From the team management side, you have a centralized management tool or a single point of administration to conduct detailed reporting, meeting analysis, monitoring service, and scale Zoom phone users,” explains Grieshaber. “Zoom Phone provides a secure and reliable HD voice experience in the Cloud across globally distributed data centers. We have hundreds of features and continue to add more, like closed captioning, contact center capability, electronic transcription, keyboard shortcuts, and the ability to participate equitably across our client. We also give an institution’s users and administrators of that account the ability to access features, and either turn them on or off based on their preferences and needs. The Cloud gives you that flexibility and control to tailor your communication experience to your specific organization.”</p>
<p>Team of Experts<br>
Zoom is committed to making the transition to cloud-based communications as easy as possible and helping customers upgrade or scale their existing environment efficiently. “We partner closely with organizations and work to certify many of the leading manufacturers’ solutions in our ecosystem,” says Grieshaber. “This means we support a robust ecosystem of hardware from manufacturers like Poly, Yealink, Neat, ePen- Dten, AudioCode, Cisco, Ribbon, Spectralink, and many others. We offer certified headsets, classroom and conference room devices, USB cameras and speakerphones for video and audio capability, all-in-one room systems, and paging and intercom hardware to completely build out a robust phone system.”</p>
<p>Edge and Zoom have partnered to share their combined experience and expertise with member institutions, and Zoom video and web conferencing solutions can currently be procured through EdgeMarket. “We really value and appreciate our Edge relationship and are very proud of what we’re accomplishing together,” shares Grieshaber. “Our customers, like Edge members Georgian Court University (GCU) and Brookdale Community College, are benefiting from the Zoom and Edge partnership and how we work closely together in every customer engagement. As a collective team, we provide consistent technical information to ensure the best solution is being provided to meet an organization’s individual needs. From an administrative and contractual perspective, the Edge/Zoom partnership allows our customers like GCU, Brookdale, and others the flexibility to meet all of their procurement requirements. Each of these schools had legacy technology that was outdated, with equipment that was going to be discontinued soon. This can cause a great deal of pressure from a technical and feature perspective.”</p>
<p>Grieshaber continues, “Zoom and Edge were able to suggest a model that answered the growing demand for team collaboration and delivered an intelligent platform that provided a flexible and customizable solution. Both GCU and Brookdale were able to lower their overall yearly IT investment and were upgraded to a true cloud unified communications (UC) phone solution. Each institution was able to address any security concerns and compliance requirements with Zoom Professional Services. For customers who invest in Zoom solutions, the new features and functionalities that continue to be released will be added automatically. We will be adding more enhancements soon, and we think colleges and universities will be extremely excited about these new features and the collaboration opportunities they will provide for their organization.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				      
 
	 
		<p> GCU’s Successful Transition to Zoom Phone<br>
Edge member, Georgian Court University (GCU), recently made the transition to Zoom Phone from an Avaya PBX system that included a combination of old analog phones and IP phones. Along with deteriorating copper lines causing connection issues, GCU had been notified by the vendor that the PRI lines connected to the PBX were no longer going to be supported. The University began exploring solutions for updating their phone systems and after reviewing several options, GCU chose Zoom Phone to upgrade their communication capabilities.</p>
<p>GCU obtained Zoom Phone through EdgeMarket, allowing for a seamless procurement process and great pricing of a vetted phone system. Since GCU already uses Zoom for meetings, the transition to the new cloud-based phone system was fairly straightforward. To help all users get up to speed quickly, Zoom provided two training sessions and links to their extensive library of information on using their system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The new zoom phone system has provided many new features on an easy-to-use, familiar platform,” says Matthew R. Manfra, Vice President for Institutional Advancement, GCU. “Being able to seamlessly make or take calls anywhere using mobile, computers, and phones has increased our ability to engage with our constituents.”</p>
<p>By transitioning to Zoom Phone immediately following graduation, disruption to day-to-day operations was minimal and the University did not receive any complaints during implementation. Users say migrating to the Cloud was an easy process and they are excited to be able to use all the new features and enhanced flexibility the Zoom system offers.</p>

		<p>Over the past two decades, classrooms have gone through a massive shift, integrating technology and digital devices into everyday learning. The pandemic further expedited these changes, where the traditional learning space is becoming even further transformed. Classrooms are now requiring more built-in flexibility and technology capabilities to meet the evolving needs of teachers and students. “While we’re not turning every face-to-face classroom into a hybrid online learning space, institutions must be able to adapt to changing conditions, like a global health crisis or weather emergency,” says Josh Gaul, AVP &amp; Chief Digital Learning Officer, Edge. “Schools that have pedagogical practices in place are better prepared for such events and can keep classes going despite where and when learning is taking place. Learning spaces will need to advance to better serve the requirements of both traditional and non-traditional students and provide a greater reach to a larger student population. For instance, a classroom with digitally enhanced capabilities could give students living in regionally desperate areas access to high-level instructors.”</p>
<p>Chris Markham, Vice President for Information Technology &amp; Economic Advancement, Edge, says, “The pandemic also revealed the need for a unity in message within e-learning and educational technology, as well as unity in technology design. The last few years forced a fusion in thought leadership and in the approach to design of technology systems and ecosystems.” Many institutions were not prepared to meet the challenges of distance learning and struggled to maintain the educational effectiveness and quality. “Unfortunately when one side of an institution is leading without the point of view of the other, gaps can arise,” explains Gaul. “If the learning spaces are too IT focused without academic input, this creates user issues. And if they’re too academic focused without IT input, student issues can arise because their classrooms lack any technology at all. We need to find a way to balance both sides and help them work together strategically.”</p>
<p>Marrying Academic Goals with Technology<br>
Whether a classroom is teaching English or AP Physics, each learning space needs to be equipped to offer video-enhanced hybrid or hyflex learning capabilities with a quality Wi-Fi connection and video conferencing system. “Students are learning just as much connecting with their classmates outside of class via the Learning Management System (LMS) or other collaboration software,” says Gaul. “They are watching videos that are assigned to supplement course instruction, so classrooms nowadays have to be built to support that need, especially in smaller institutions where the same discipline doesn’t always use the same classroom. A chemistry class can be taught in the same room as a drama class or a business class, so these rooms must be multifaceted and flexible enough that they can meet the needs of each of these disciplines. Especially for smaller schools or community colleges, they must find ways to make their classrooms refurbishable, reusable, and innovative through the use of technology in order to create engaging learning experiences.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  

	 
		    
			 
				
 
	 
		 SPACE DESIGN INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY (SDIT)<br>
EVALUATION SNAPSHOT<br>
SPOTLIGHT 
<p>Edge recently partnered with member institution, Felician University, to digitally enhance a newly-built extension to their wellness and recreation center. To effectively and efficiently create these technology-infused spaces, Felician requested a space design integrated technology evaluation (SDIT) from Edge. “With Chris via Zoom, I visited campus in person to receive a tour of the entire building and the spaces they planned on upgrading,” shares Gaul. “I gathered the needs and goals of facilities, academics, and IT, and determined the risks, rewards, opportunities, and potential threats to the endeavor. Following subsequent interviews and meetings, we provided a report with suggestions for successfully achieving their objectives for the new spaces. We included a scale of pricing suggestions, from low range to higher, and created a holistic approach to upgrading the entire building system. There must be standardization and interconnectedness across rooms and a strategy that accounts for all aspects, including management, terms of usage, security, and future goals.”</p>
<p>Upon reviewing the report, Felician decided to move forward with all the suggestions provided in the SDIT. Edge partnered with AVA Technology, the IT team, and facilities to help organize installation and ensure questions were answered throughout the process. “Along with providing expertise in thought leadership and learning space design and technology, Edge can help with supply chain management, analysis of technology infrastructure, and project management of the technology ecosystem,” says Markham. “Not only do we offer a blueprint to follow, we can help outline the specs, materials, quantities, price, and timeline for delivery. Between the members of our team, we have over four decades of experience in space design integrated technologies and we are always excited to share with member institutions the insight and knowledge we’ve gained through the years.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>In addition to working closely with Felician University (see inset Space Design Integrated Technology (SDIT) Evaluation Snapshot), Edge has also performed SDIT evaluations for William Jewel College and Hudson County Community College (HCCC) to help update their learning spaces. “We recently evaluated one of the spaces at Hudson County where they wish to install a video studio for faculty members to deliver and record lectures,” says Gaul. “I worked with Matthew LaBrake, Executive Director of the HCCC Center for Online Learning (COL), to help inform the evaluation and outline recommendations for tools and solutions. I then met with our EdgeMarket team and partners at SHI to provide a proposal. The HCCC team then reviewed the recommendations to select the best way forward. Subsequently, in mid-August 2022, final implementation and installation took place .”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				       
	 
		 
		 
			
 
	 
		<p>“We could have never predicted the pandemic or the impact such an event had on our lives, but it certainly has shown us that anything can happen and that we must be united in how we approach transforming the industry to meet this changing tide. With unity of thought leadership and the methods of e-learning and space technology design, we can ensure more institutions across the community will have the flexibility and preparedness to navigate whatever the future holds and will have the tools they need to flourish in an ever-changing education landscape.”</p>

		<p>The role of learning space design is to connect IT and academic affairs, as well as successfully pulling in a 21st century learning approach to instructional design and teaching. When designing academic programs and curriculum, institutions must incorporate IT needs and initiatives—and vice versa—when IT is evaluating technology and designing solutions, they must include the academic mindset and the pedagogical needs of the instructors and students. To create a successful technology roadmap, the academic vision and the infrastructure of an institution must be closely connected and interwoven.</p>

Within the past few years, online learning has proved to be a viable solution for instruction and bringing new and innovative learning experiences to more students. “If done correctly, digital learning and remote education can provide countless opportunities for institutions,” says Gaul. “More and more students prefer these options and we must avoid silos being formed between in-person and remote learning without anything connecting the two. The role of learning space design is to connect IT and academic affairs, as well as successfully pulling in a 21st century learning approach to instructional design and teaching. When designing academic programs and curriculum, institutions must incorporate IT needs and initiatives—and vice versa—when IT is evaluating technology and designing solutions, they must include the academic mindset and the pedagogical needs of the instructors and students. To create a successful technology roadmap, the academic vision and the infrastructure of an institution must be closely connected and interwoven.”</p>
<p>“Edge can partner with institutions to not only help put the puzzle pieces in place for creating a learning environment that meets the needs and expectations of today’s learners, but can also give you a view around the corner,” shares Markham. “We could have never predicted the pandemic or the impact such an event had on our lives, but it certainly has shown us that anything can happen and that we must be united in how we approach transforming the industry to meet this changing tide. With unity of thought leadership and the methods of e-learning and space technology design, we can ensure more institutions across the community will have the flexibility and preparedness to navigate whatever the future holds and will have the tools they need to flourish in an ever-changing education landscape.”</p>

		<p>Faced with a number of barriers to data access and use, Villanova University knew that change was required in order to meet the data and analytics goals included in their updated strategic plan. Villanova had multiple source systems and tools, siloed data, no university-wide data warehouse, and a focus on operational reporting. With the goal of developing a foundation for an improved data infrastructure, data governance and creating a culture of data-informed decision making, Villanova needed a plan and a partner. However, even once key issues were identified and a plan was in place, COVID would upend and delay progress on their initiative.</p>
<p>Several triggers led to the launch of Villanova’s data journey, including frustration among business users, college deans, senior administrators, and the provost in getting accurate data and information in a timely manner for decision making. “Data stewards who were working with the data and pulling information from other source systems were dissatisfied with the tools that were available to generate reports,” explains Dr. Trina Das, Assistant Vice Provost, Office of Decision Support and Data Integrity, Villanova University. “Some were old, decommissioned tools that were not well supported. The newer tools lacked training resources and support, and none of them gained traction in usability for the data stewards. More recently, there was heightened concern among our leadership around data accuracy, especially in relation to the external agencies, including iPads, accreditation bodies, and ranking agencies, and providing vetted, peer-reviewed data.”</p>
<p>Prior to COVID, Villanova was completing their strategic plan and moving on to the next phase of planning. During these discussions, the main focus was the enhanced use of technology, data, and analytics to support decision making. “There was awareness and push from many directions to address these issues and these conversations led to a five-phased Villanova strategy,” shares Das. “The strategy begins with a planning and discovery phase, which allows for an assessment of our current data landscape, including identifying our challenges and what is working and what is not in the process. From this, we created a roadmap which outlined the most relevant and immediate need for the University. This led to the discussion for our data platform and governance initiative and then ultimately, the concept of change management, which we are embarking upon this year.”</p>
<p>Gathering Insight<br>
In the spring of 2019, the Office of the Provost reached out to Das, asking her to participate in a 6-month exploratory project, partnered with one of her colleagues in enrollment management. The project conducted an internal scoping of the data landscape at Villanova, specifically exploring the challenges, risks, opportunities, and recommended next steps for the process. “The goal was to provide recommendations for developing the foundation for improved data infrastructure and governance, a culture of data-informed decision making, and an operational framework that would be best suited for the University,” says Das. “We had two paths of exploration. One was our internal constituents, where we spoke to data people within every business area and college at Villanova to better understand the key issues they face. We also looked at our peer institution and other institutions to create a list of fifteen organizations that were ahead of us in this data journey and could provide a positive example for how we could move toward the future.”</p>
<p>Through this investigation, Villanova was able to gather several useful insights and identify the key issues that need to be addressed. “At the time, data operations was extremely decentralized,” explains Das. “We have so many source systems feeding data and have multiple reporting tools, which creates challenges for choosing which one to use, what’s the training, and who to ask. Plus, we faced data access and sharing challenges. Due to the decentralized nature of our operations, every business area handled their own data, and without interconnectedness, the crosspollination of data was not exactly happening. This setup leaves room for operational inefficiencies and inconsistencies and we had challenges replicating information. For example, looking at the whole student’s societal life cycle, the person starts as an applicant, then graduates and becomes an alumnus. We want to know if they’re donating; what is the profile of those donors? All of this information was in different systems. We wished to create a process that would make this exercise more efficient and seamless, so that we spend more time analyzing the data, instead of collecting and merging that information.”</p>
<p>Like Villanova, many institutions across the industry struggle with the lack of proper documentation and data definitions and lineage. “We are trying to improve process documentation and ensure that if someone leaves the University or changes roles, their knowledge does not depart with them,” explains Das. “Lastly, we looked to create a single source of truth, or a place where there are data snapshots and you can replicate information. All of these key issues led to the main pillars of our data strategy and how we can better recognize and maximize the use of institutional data as a strategic University asset.”</p>
<p>Creating a Strategy<br>
Upon reviewing the key issues and data challenges facing the institution, Villanova recognized the importance of a data strategy that would help them overcome the hurdles and make more informed decisions for the entire university. “We knew we must lay the foundation for creating an improved and sustainable data infrastructure,” says Das. “A central data environment would help reduce our vulnerabilities, improve our operational efficiencies, and ensure accuracy and accountability for data for internal and external reporting. The platform would bring together data from disparate sources for consistency, transparency, and accessibility. We look to foster a culture of data sharing and data-informed decision making, and Villanova continues to make great progress in this area.”</p>
<p>On the operational side, one of Villanova’s goals includes improving data management and the reporting and analytics platform for University data stewards. “What we are building must not only serve one purpose, but multiple purposes,” explains Das. “The infrastructure must not only meet analytical needs, but allow for some operational needs as well. We also look to create an environment that promotes succession planning for business units and includes training documentation and data definitions.”</p>

		<p>Identifying Key Initiatives<br>
At the end of the exploratory project, Villanova identified three institutional initiatives that would drive their data journey.&nbsp; The first was deciding upon a comprehensive data management and analytics platform that would include a data warehouse/lake, ETL (extract, transform and load) layer, and data visualization tools. Secondly, the institution wished to establish a university-wide data governance framework. Thirdly, Villanova decided to create a new organization under the Office of the Provost to manage the first two initiatives and implement a more centralized data management process. “The Office was charged with advancing a culture of data sharing, data stewardship, and data-informed decision making,” says Das. “A team member from our registrar’s office and I created this new department and we began by putting together a request for proposal (RFP) for a comprehensive data management analytic solution. This RFP was sent out to five vendors in December 2019 and we had a team of eight to evaluate the proposals and we brought in colleagues from different areas of the University to review the platforms with us.”</p>
<p>The evaluation was completed in May 2020, but the pandemic caused Villanova to direct their focus on other immediate needs. “Everything came to a stop,” recalls Das. “You have a plan and then suddenly COVID happened. Our provost said we had to press pause on the platform project but tasked me with finding a way to keep moving the mission of the University forward. We began by converting our factbooks and other relevant reports, which are a very rich source of data, into interactive dashboards. I felt this could give our internal constituents in the University community a glimpse into the future and how easily we can make data available to them to interact with and compare information. I believe we stayed true to helping advance the culture of data sharing and I’ve heard from many areas how much they leverage and enjoy these dashboards.”</p>
<p>Despite timing being later than anticipated due to the pandemic, Villanova moved forward and awarded the contract in July 2021 to HelioCampus. “We decided to partner with HelioCampus for a variety of reasons, first being their expertise and experience in higher education,” shares Das. “They understand the terminology and project goals of this industry and offer a comprehensive approach and technology solution. They could set up the whole environment with an entire suite of student information, including data from admissions, financial aid, course registrations, and student outcome—giving us a tremendous jumpstart. To do this internally would have taken us years and many institutions do not understand the scale of this work and how complicated this undertaking can be for an organization. HelioCampus also provides continued analytics and consulting support beyond the implementation phase.”</p>
<p>While Villanova is not an Edge member or EdgeMarket participant, they kindly joined the Edge team and a robust roster of Edge member attendees for a special webinar session titled Villanova University’s Data Journey: From Challenges Identified to Implementation. By sharing their story, Villanova served as a model for institutions thinking about how to approach a data analytics program from scratch, including selecting a partner like HelioCampus.</p>
<p>Takeaways and Lessons Learned<br>
To further help implement the data strategy, Villanova also established Data Governance committees, the first in November 2020 and the second in spring 2022. “Since the fall of 2020, we have met every month to discuss the policies, and we have three draft policies being sent to the President’s cabinet for approval. Throughout this process, we have gained valuable insight into the elements that lead to a successful data strategy. First is executive sponsorship and support. Without this piece, moving the needle becomes very challenging, especially without critical funding decisions and buy-ins from leadership. I would also encourage institutions to engage key campus leaders, even if they are not in the immediate scope of the platform. Representation from non-academic areas like human resources and finance prevent potential future bottlenecks and involving them for the very start allows you to create a universal central data repository.”</p>
<p>In addition to buy-in from key players throughout the organization who can champion your overall vision and the importance of the initiative, Das says the institution and vendor need to be flexible and maintain open communication. “As you encounter a misalignment of expectations as you go through the project goals, you must find a middle ground to ensure success. The key is to communicate and have a mutual understanding. We have been very fortunate with HelioCampus, who are extremely flexible and have navigated this process with us. By partnering with a vendor who could propel the initiative forward, we prevent the chance of becoming sidetracked by other priorities. We were able to hook people into the value proposition and the potential of a platform like this and show the value add it brings to the university’s decision-making process. We will continue to build beyond the scope of our initial implementation scope and successfully address these additions gradually with internal training and resources. Thankfully, the initial jumpstart was completed quickly, successfully, and without any derailments—moving us forward in this exciting data journey.”</p>

		<p>As technology and connectivity continue to diffuse into all areas of our lives, especially within the education community, having a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy will be of the utmost importance. In the K-12 space, students are accessing the Internet on a daily basis and using digital devices both inside and outside of the classroom. Unfortunately, without proper protection in place, the safety of the students and institution are at risk. “During the pandemic, we saw a 3,000-percent increase in cybersecurity attacks within the state of New Jersey alone,” says Christopher Markham, Vice President for Information Technology &amp; Economic Advancement, Edge.</p>
<p>To help organizations become better informed about cybersecurity and how to mitigate risk within an educational institution, Edge is presenting Tech Talk sessions at tech events around the state. “Increasing cybersecurity awareness and shifting security cultures from reactive to proactive are fundamentally important to our K-12 members,” explains Michelle Ferraro, Member Account Manager, Edge. “Each county has an IT Tech group that meets every couple of months depending on which county you are in. Edge has been offering free Zoom or in-person meetings with one of our chief information security officers (CISO) to discuss cybersecurity concerns, answer questions, and share advice on how to reduce expensive insurance policies.”</p>
<p>The hour-long Tech Talk sessions welcome IT directors, business administrators, and superintendents; ensuring all areas of an organization are able to become better informed with the insight and guidance they need to drive cybersecurity initiatives. “The technology curve is very dramatic and changes quickly,” says Markham. “As thought leaders, Edge is ahead of that curve and is dedicated to helping member institutions keep pace with technology and the changes happening in this digital era.”</p>

		<p>Assessing and Improving Security Measures<br>
Following a Tech Talk session, the CISO will share how to reduce insurance costs and ways to address various needs, including filling specific gaps in staffing and security domain expertise required to strengthen the district’s security posture. “Depending on the organization’s needs and current security profile, we may recommend a security assessment at nonprofit rates,” says Ferraro. “The Security Program Assessment draws on our collective expertise to deliver tailored, actionable recommendations to improve your security posture, reduce risk, and mitigate the impact of security incidents. Our virtual CISO (vCISO) will take the time to interview staff, review policies and procedures, determine risk appetite, identify weaknesses, and provide detailed, actionable recommendations to improve your security program.” Depending on an organization’s needs and current security profile, Edge may recommend one or more solutions to assist in addressing vulnerabilities. A vCISO can also augment an organization’s internal team to help identify and implement viable information security strategies and policies to improve security effectiveness and ensure regulatory and compliance requirements are being followed.</p>
<p>Edge’s Security Program Assessment evaluates the maturity of an organization’s security program based on National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), identifies gaps, and provides an incremental roadmap to improve the overall security posture of the organization. “We also offer Cybersecurity Health Check Programs that deliver monthly assessments, based on NIST standards, to identify possible vulnerabilities before they become a threat,” explains Ferraro. “In addition, our CISO offers consultant services to create incident response plans (IRP) and disaster recovery (DR) plans with testing to make sure our K-12 members have these protections in place.”</p>

		<p>Addressing Vulnerabilities<br>
A CISO plays an essential role in IT leadership, balancing information security, risk, and general business challenges, but not every organization has the ability to hire a CISO full time. “If a district realizes that formalizing and implementing&nbsp; a cybersecurity program is essential, but has challenges staffing the leadership position—whether it be budgetary issues or identifying and attracting talent—Edge is here to help fill that role and offer the guidance needed to be successful,” says Ferraro.</p>
<p>Keeping education districts’ budgets in mind, Edge offers vCISO services at a cost-effective rate where organizations can utilize expert guidance for a few hours, on a per-project basis, or as a full-time staff augmentation. “Edge looks to provide an executive-level information security resource to our K-12 members in a convenient and affordable way,” says Ferraro. “By proactively evaluating current IT processes, programs, and infrastructure for security integrity, institutions will be better positioned to remediate vulnerabilities and confidently protect the integrity of their students and organization.”</p>

		<p>Digital transformation efforts generally begin with a view of the business processes, workflows, and systems that enable an institution to more efficiently conduct business. “Oftentimes, institutions are approaching the concept of digital transformation backwards and look for the software to solve a business problem, when in fact, the approach should be the other way around,” explains Samuel Conn, Ph.D, President and Chief Executive Officer, Edge. “When you talk about the concept of enterprise information systems architecture, you first align and optimize your business processes, and then once those are documented, that documentation of your business processes is used to select and configure the appropriate software to enable those processes.”</p>
<p>One potential approach to lowering an institution’s operating expenses is to implement business process management practices—strategies which for-profit businesses have successfully used to lower operational expenses for decades. “Higher education lags behind traditional for-profit businesses in deploying business process management,” says Mark Meara, Ed.D., Vice President of Technical Operations and Chief Information Officer. “The practice of business process management seeks to improve or change these processes to enhance an organization’s products, services, effectiveness, and efficiency,”</p>
<p>“In the digital economy,” Meara continues, “Organizations experienced significant pressures from both economic and competition perspectives. These challenges are forcing organizations that wish to not only survive, but also thrive, to evaluate and improve their business processes. Historically, there was less pressure on institutions of higher education to be profitable; therefore, they only began evaluating the performance and improvement of their business processes around the year 2000, much after the business sector. Higher education institutions may not have business process modeling and notation skill sets readily available on staff, but they can leverage organizations such as Edge to provide such resources.”</p>
<p>Assessing Current and Future State Processes<br>
Edge has recently enhanced their EdgeDx Professional Services to better help member institutions optimize their business processes and achieve operational efficiency at every level of the student lifecycle. “EdgeDx has shifted toward a stronger focus on digital transformation and reengineering topologies that have better integration and interoperability with cloud services,” explains Conn. “EdgeDx combines four of our services: professional, security, digital learning, and cloud services, and we have experts available who are well versed in business process modeling. We can help model how things are being done currently and present this in a visual format on an engineering diagram. By thoroughly mapping out processes, we can see where the opportunities exist to eliminate redundancy, increase efficiency, and optimize the process so that it’s working smoothly and at the lowest level of friction within the organization.”</p>
<p>Meara adds, “Edge can also assist CIOs to be strategic within their institutions and transform themselves as business experts who specialize in IT, not as IT experts who position themselves as business experts. Edge can partner with its member CIOs to expedite and manage change by conducting various assessments (e.g., E360, Cloud readiness, cybersecurity, Business Process Improvement, etc.), but it doesn’t end there. We can also provide the resources necessary to leverage the assessments and fuel the necessary changes to achieve true digital transformation on the institutional level.”</p>

		<p>Reviewing Complex Business Processes<br>
Edge recently partnered with the New Jersey President’s Council (NJPC) Academic Issues Committee (AIC) to review and optimize their business processes to improve operational efficiency. The Committee helps address educational, research, and administrative issues within the education community and reviews proposals for new academic programs that could be beneficial to colleges and universities within the State. They ensure a proposed program is not redundant or conflicting with other programs and that the features and functions meet the demands of the marketplace. Throughout the articulated workflow and complex business process, the NJPC shares the collected data across the Council to determine if the program can advance to the next steps in the process.</p>
<p>Like any procedure with many moving parts that evolve over time, inefficiencies arose and the need for a more coordinated approach was necessary. The NJPC/AIC chair reached out to Edge to discuss their important review process and how they could improve the overall efficiency, while addressing current pain points. “The NJPC/AIC was aware of Edge’s expertise in business process redesign and reengineering efforts and was interested in fully documenting the process as it is today, and then creating a suggested future state process,” explains recently-retired Ed Chapel, Ph.D., Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Operating Officer, Edge. “The goal would be to re-document and create a more streamlined and efficient process that was more time and cost effective.”</p>
<p>Redesigning Business Processes<br>
Since the NJPC business process had some disconnects and there was no automation, institutions were submitting program proposals to the AIC via email. Without a consistent contact list, managing the process was very difficult and time consuming, there was no consistency in how programs were submitted, and not all institutions were getting notified when a new program was announced. The NJPC wanted to organize and standardize a process where all institutions were submitting forms and getting notified in a systematic way. To assist the AIC, Edge convened a committee that consisted of Dr. Chapel, Donna Rogalski, Ed.D., Assistant Director for Academic Programs: Office of the Secretary of Higher Education, and Allison Samay, Executive Director at New Jersey Presidents’ Council. “Donna and Allison provided important input on all the moving parts of the process and would reach into their organizations to clarify the finer points,” says Chapel. “A consultant for Edge, Stephanie Thomas, is also part of the committee and leads the business process redesign efforts. She documented the current state process and then added components where areas could be improved. She is second to none and has been an outstanding member of the team.”</p>
<p>To gain all the necessary, in-depth details of an institution’s process, Stephanie met with the stakeholders to map out every single step in as much detail as possible. “I get to meet with the people who are in the trenches doing the day-to-day work,” says Thomas. “We create a workflow diagram providing all details and technology notation in a universal language. Over multiple meetings, we then map out each individual task with all the different stakeholders. This helps us visually document all of the pieces and allows us to see the different perspectives and where they’re connected. I always tell an institution that they’re the brains and I’m just the hands. I facilitate and guide them through the process while they tell the story. This is an extremely visual process and you will be able to see it take shape and create an end product that delivers the automation and technology needed to serve your needs.”</p>
<p>Thomas continues, “In the end, we have a beautiful blueprint schematic diagram that shows the entire process including where technical intervention is required. For example, where a form is introduced in the process, what elements are included on that form, any communication that follows up on that form, and the kind of response that is sent to the user once the form is submitted. Edge can then take the blueprint diagram to a vendor showing the current and future state process with every step documented. On this project, after just a one-hour meeting with the vendor, they were able to create an in-depth demo based on the diagram and were able to start programming.”</p>

		<p>Selecting Software Solutions<br>
The streamlined process was shared with all of the NJPC stakeholders who affirmed that the new method met all their goals and objectives. They also used the insights to revise the user’s manual for generating an academic program proposal. During the business process redesign, several of the issues that were identified could be remedied with a software-based workflow automation solution. “The two-tiered effort of the AIC was to revise the process and then select a software solution that everyone could use to complete the process, while maintaining a proper communications protocol and providing access to managed lists stored in a common repository,” explains Chapel. “This ensures no missed steps in the collection of information, whether it is uploaded, downloaded, printed, or distributed.”</p>
<p>A current software partner of Edge, GRM Information Management, is a leading provider of information management systems and their solution, VisualVault® content services platform, is a cloud-based configurable workflow automation tool. VisualVault solutions automate inefficient manual processes and transform data and document-intensive processes to deliver dramatic increases in efficiency and valuable data-based insights via an advanced analytics suite. “Edge on behalf of the AIC is currently working with GRM to clarify the non-recurring costs of the implementation, as well as the recurring cost of the subscriptions for this program as it rolls out to the broader community of users,” says Chapel. “Through this process, the NJPC project team received a crash course in business process reengineering and quickly came to appreciate the value of reviewing every minute detail and identifying all of the places that were illogical, inefficient, or ineffective. This gives the opportunity to take a step back and look at the process that has been conducted for many years and find ways to make valuable improvements.”</p>
<p>Since Edge understands the process involved in digital transformation and the business process re-engineering, the cultural aspects of change management, and the role of business process modeling and notation in doing so, member institutions can tap into this expertise to make changes at their own organizations. “I believe seeing the end result of an automated improved workflow will resonate with organizations and make very clear the value of a business process redesign informed digital transformation,” shares Chapel. “In particular, this business process redesign can be very impactful when examining the prospect to enrolled student process for new full-time students and transfers and can help improve the overall student experience of this process.”</p>
<p>Successfully Migrating to the Cloud<br>
An important EdgeDx service that helps organizations improve operational efficiency includes cloud assessments and creating an effective cloud migration strategy. These assessments can help an institution simplify cloud migration and management by evaluating existing infrastructure and developing a strategy for migrating workloads and applications to the public and private clouds, as well as software as a service (SaaS) solutions. “Edge has the ability to help institutions digitally transform through the business reengineering process into seamless cloud technology that is multi-cloud and has interoperability between those clouds,” says Conn. “The world is changing quickly and the technology that allows institutions to run virtualized servers on campus is moving to the Cloud, and since it is a SaaS, will be a service model and will require a subscription. There is a sense of urgency where every institution should be evaluating if they are ready to successfully move to the Cloud and determining if they have all the elements in place.”</p>
<p>“Cloud Architecture involves using on-demand cloud components in lieu of traditional IT paradigms,” adds Polina Smirnova, Network Engineer, Edge. “The benefits to a consumer include very low upfront cost, on-demand scalability, and a potential for IT topology simplification. Creating an effective cloud migration plan involves assessing current IT topology (i.e. compute and storage needs). Assistance from an experienced cloud architecture team is vital in ensuring that the proposed cloud solution meets the institution’s immediate and future needs, and that the migration goes smoothly. While all cloud platforms offer services which aim to replicate on-prem services in a more scalable way, the creation and management of resources within these services always involves cloud-specific nuances the navigation of which an experienced cloud architect is a huge value add in.”</p>
<p>To determine the state of readiness and to create a cloud migration strategy, Conn says organizations must evaluate several elements. “You must review your data governance, information systems architecture, the level of virtualization you have with your servers and data, the location of your identity and access management and system, and the architecture needs to be re-architected into multi-cloud topology. In addition, it’s important to note that an organization’s disaster recovery strategy will be replaced because data protection will now occur in the Cloud. Edge provides all of these services, as well as having certified web architects, solution engineers, project planning experts, and vendor relationships that can help streamline the entire process.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				       
	 
		 
		 
			
 
	 
		<p>“Organizations experienced significant pressures from both economic and competition perspectives. These challenges are forcing organizations that wish to not only survive, but also thrive, to evaluate and improve their business processes. Historically, there was less pressure on institutions of higher education to be profitable; therefore, they only began evaluating the performance and improvement of their business processes around the year 2000, much after the business sector. Higher education institutions may not have business process modeling and notation skill sets readily available on staff, but they can leverage organizations such as Edge to provide&nbsp; such resources.”</p>

		<p>Helping Drive Cultural Change<br>
Moving to the Cloud and updating business processes is a cultural change that is required across an entire institution; leading to a new way of thinking and doing business. “Taking this journey leads to fundamental changes in the planning process, so how an institution budgets, how they plan their time, and how they organize support will all evolve,” says Conn. “These changes can occur rapidly too, so we encourage organizations to take advantage of our cloud migration readiness assessment. Over three to four days, we meet with key stakeholders and collect data, and come back with a report on the state of readiness for cloud migration and can offer recommendations for improvements. Even if an institution does not have a plan in place, Edge can help create a strategy that will get them successfully to the Cloud within one to two years.”</p>
<p>EdgeDx assessments employ a results-driven methodology designed to maximize efficiency and enable digital transformation within an institution. The E360 assessment provides a 360-degree view of an institution’s current-state technology program and will map how the IT strategy should evolve to accomplish the mission and vision of the organization. “The Edge team will support your organization’s digital transformation, enabling you to optimize processes and create positive student and staff experiences,” says Conn. “By augmenting your team with a variety of resources, we can help you drive cultural change within your organization, boost cloud migration readiness, and help your institution remain competitive well into the future.”</p>

		 Achieving Harmony In Your Technology Ecosystem 
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Creating a successful roadmap for digital transformation often begins with an in-depth look at an institution’s current technology and cyber infrastructure. Through this analysis, an organization can determine how best to modernize their IT strategy to help achieve an institutional mission and business initiatives. To aid member institutions in this complex endeavor, Edge performs a valuable service called an Enterprise 360 (E360) Assessment. The evaluation provides a holistic, 360-degree view of an institution’s current-state technology program and digital footprint and reviews all aspects of technology operations; investment and costs; service, software and hardware; cybersecurity; and educational technology.</p>
<p>While Edge has been assisting member institutions in the development of their technology strategies for years, the need for a comprehensive service like E360 became evident. By taking a 360-degree inventory and assessment of an organization’s technology investments, Edge can help determine whether these investments in equipment, staff, and software are optimal for achieving organizational goals and objectives. Oftentimes, the types of technology investments that have been made are mismatched with an institution’s own size, capabilities, mission, and objectives. With Edge’s thought leadership and breadth of consultative expertise across technology domains, member institutions can gain valuable insight into the operational integrity and appropriateness of their current technology ecosystem. Several Edge member institutions have already benefited from E360 assessments including, but not limited to, Bloomfield College, Felician University, Georgian Court University (GCU), and William Jewell College.</p>
<p>Assessing Digital Transformation Readiness<br>
The big picture view provided by the E360 Assessment allows an organization to see their institutional organism in its entirety and all the interactions between tech capability and whether their business needs and strategies can be successfully executed. When conducting an E360 analysis, the EdgePro team will focus on a variety of technology-related domains that impact digital transformation readiness, including current managerial finance and economic approaches within IT, cybersecurity capacity and capability, and an institution’s entire technology stack. Similarly to the importance of a doctor performing bloodwork in order to make a diagnosis, the E360 allows data to be collected and tested against the industry standards and best practices of business and technology science for IT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most important goals of the E360 is ensuring strategic technology plans, including contracts and terms for services, are creating a technology operating environment with the best possible return on investment. To begin an assessment, the Edge team typically reviews all documentation and contractual terms of an institution’s technology investments, as well as monitoring and performing a traffic analysis. This is followed by a two-day onsite visit to meet with stakeholders and representatives from each functional and academic area during standard business hours. This approach allows for a broad and deep exploration of an institution’s technology program, as well as viewing the aspects that relate not just to technology, but to the functional knowledge, skill, and efforts of the organization and whether they are effectively being facilitated by technology.</p>
<p>Balancing the Technology Ecosystem<br>
Many higher education organizations commonly have clusters of technology activity and investments can become disjointed to fulfill these focused needs. As part of the assessment, the E360 service reviews technology needs and capabilities across campus and ensures that an IT strategy allows all areas to work in harmony in the most optimal and streamlined process possible. Upon completion of the assessment, the organization will receive a diagnostic and prescriptive report, including an executive summary that outlines which aspects of an institution’s current technology and cyber infrastructure need immediate attention and the recommendations for accelerating the organization’s ability to drive business goals.</p>

		<p>In addition, the assessment can conduct a knowledge and skills matrix, where an organization can identify any gaps of where they may need to backfill existing vacancies or places where they are overloading personnel with responsibilities of mission critical importance. By taking inventory and properly aligning their personnel to the highest priority and best-fit items, an organization can efficiently synchronize their workforce with their IT needs. Institutions can also identify operational efficiencies through the E360 that allow them to migrate workloads to cloud services and adopt virtualization strategies to help unburden their staff. Edge aims to assist organizations in identifying investments that will modernize their technology solutions and implementations, while achieving operating efficiency in the process.</p>
<p>The actionable items provided from an E360 focus on remediation, acceleration, and transformation, and creating a roadmap for technology that moves in concert with the organization’s strategic plan. Most importantly, the solutions suggested in the assessment to achieve this mission are all encompassing as well. Through EdgeMarket, organizations can find the solutions and consortium-based pricing needed to help address the issues uncovered through the E360. Edge procures and curates the solutions and services that are available on the open market on behalf of its member institutions—helping organizations gain access to current technologies at an affordable price.</p>
<p>Embracing Change and Modernization<br>
This service can provide beneficial insight and direction for a variety of organizations, whether they have a well-established strategic technology plan or are just beginning to develop their approach for digital transformation. An institution may be struggling with a lackluster technology strategy or capacities that are not up to par; or an organization may be looking to mature their technology landscape and is seeking to improve the efficiency of how technology is utilized and the ways it impacts academic and business operations. In addition, an institution may be engaged or emerging from a major digital transformation initiative and they want to ensure they maximize their return on investment.</p>
<p>Through a dissection of an institution’s technology ecosystem, Edge can suggest solutions for both medium- and long-term changes that would allow an organization to leverage their technology capacity and capability to successfully achieve their digital transformation and business goals. Once the E360 is completed, the results can be a driver for organizational change management and an opportunity for an institution to rethink, modernize, and welcome the digital age. As organizations ready themselves for the future, Edge is dedicated to helping institutions confidently embrace change and the immense opportunities that the right technology approach and investment can bring.</p>

<p>The TRAC token is the utility token of the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph that is getting deployed on Polkadot through the OriginTrail dedicated Parachain. Becoming a token spanning both Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems has enormous potential, particularly in the benefits offered by the latest generation of blockchain features in Polkadot, such as native cross-chain interoperability and extensibility beyond the VM&nbsp;level.</p><p>The aim of this RFC is to outline the details of different approaches to technical deployment of the TRAC token on the OriginTrail Parachain and collect feedback from the OriginTrail community.</p> TRAC as a multi-chain token <p>Since its inception in January 2018, the TRAC token has been deployed as an ERC20 standardized token on the Ethereum mainnet blockchain as a limited supply, non-inflationary utility token fueling the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). Exactly 500 million TRAC have been created at the token generation event. Since then, the TRAC token has become crucial in enabling a variety of solutions used by notable global organizations as their data footprint constantly increases on the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>As a two layer system, OriginTrail has always been based on two tokens — the TRAC token as the utility token of the OriginTrail DKG (Layer 2), and the gas token of the underlying blockchain used such as ETH, Matic and xDAI (Layer&nbsp;1).</p><p>Earlier this year the OriginTrail community provided strong support for the launch of <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/">OriginTrail specific blockchain on Polkadot — the OriginTrail Parachain</a>, with its native OriginTrail Parachain token (OTP) providing blockchain utility on layer 1. Additionally, apart from OTP providing “gas” utility, its tokenomics are designed to directly incentivize network activity in the OriginTrail ecosystem. More information on the interplay between OriginTrail DKG and blockchain layers <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper">can be found in the whitepaper</a>, while detailed OTP tokenomics will be the subject of a separate&nbsp;RFC.</p> TRAC token deployment on&nbsp;Polkadot <p>With the launch of the OriginTrail Parachain, a highly scalable layer 1 blockchain tailored to the DKG has been successfully added to the OriginTrail ecosystem. This comes with the added benefit of native interoperability with the entire Polkadot ecosystem and any network adopting Polkadot’s communication standards.</p><p>Since the TRAC token is an Ethereum ERC20 token with significant adoption, it’s important to carefully consider its implementation in the new Polkadot ecosystem. In the previous request for comments <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges%20(v2).pdf">OT-RFC-12 OriginTrail Parachain Bridges</a>, the use of a third party bridge was deemed unsafe and a final decision alongside the community was made to teleport TRAC using the pre-audited SFC smart contract.</p><p>Polkadot enables advanced blockchain functionalities and customizability, and with the launch of OriginTrail Parachain the OriginTrail ecosystem became a direct beneficiary of features such&nbsp;as:</p>  Cross-chain message passing via XCM enabling Parachains to send arbitrary messages between each other in a trustless manner using the Polkadot Relay chain. This not only enables easy token transfers, but also execution of any arbitrary logic between chains. This opens up room for many integrations across the ecosystem, e.g. a transaction on the OriginTrail Parachain could execute a token swap on the Acala parachain or extend assets available on Moonbeam. More information on XCM <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm">can be found&nbsp;here</a>.  Secure bridging between Parachains via the Relay chain, as well as strong, trustless bridges to other ecosystems built as parachains rather than multi-sig driven implementations, which have seen numerous hacks in the previous year. The OT-RFC-12 focuses specifically on this issue and the transitioning TRAC safely to the OriginTrail Parachain.  Extensibility through “pallets”, enabling forkless upgrades directly on chain level (as opposed to being confined to the EVM environment and needing to fork the entire chain), allowing customizations and advanced features tailored to the use case of every parachain. Many pallets already exist for features such as governance, staking,&nbsp;etc.  <p>More information on Polkadot features and implementation details can be found <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/getting-started">here</a>. With this RFC we present two distinct approaches of TRAC token implementation on the OriginTrail Parachain (and therefore, Polkadot).</p> OriginTrail Parachain TRAC Deployment requirements <p>The end goal of TRAC token deployment on the OriginTrail Parachain is to achieve the following requirements:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach: appropriate measures and planning has to be undertaken to maximize the ease of use and create a simple user experience of TRAC in order to not hinder the value propositions of the OriginTrail ecosystem.  R2 — Maximized security: special care must be taken to remove any unnecessary complexities and potential points of failure to ensure the TRAC token economy is robust and remains decentralized. This includes both the technical decisions and implementations, as well as decision making in an open, public discourse (such as through the OriginTrail RFCs).  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability: ability to utilize TRAC token across the universe of Polkadot parachains and ecosystem tools (such as wallets), leveraging the innovations and value generated by the Polkadot ecosystem. This requires native Substrate integration through relevant pallets (such as the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-integrate-assets">Assets&nbsp;pallet</a>).  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility: TRAC on the OriginTrail Parachain should remain compatible with existing Ethereum infrastructure and tooling, retaining its standard ERC20 form. To achieve this in the context of the Substrate runtime, a set of precompile contracts need to be deployed on the OriginTrail Parachain (to reach the EVM2.0 deployment).  R5 — Effective time of deployment: The time resources required for TRAC implementation to provide utility (in the context of achieving above requirements) should be reasonably low (and thus effective).  <p>In both proposed approaches, each of the above requirements will be graded with NOT SATISFIED, EVENTUALLY SATISFIED, PARTIALLY SATISFIED or FULLY SATISFIED.</p> Approach #1: Evolutionary deployment (from EVM1.0 to&nbsp;EVM2.0) <p>This approach would entail a transition from TRAC initially getting deployed as ERC20 token on the OriginTrail Parachain (indicated in scheme below as “Temp TRAC”), to reaching a Polkadot native TRAC deployment (“Full TRAC”) in the next step. This initial TRAC token would operate as a standard ERC20 token in the current EVM 1.0 environment on the OriginTrail Parachain (satisfying R4). However in such an environment, the token would not benefit from the additional features available from Polkadot technology (R3), and therefore would require a future token migration to a fully implemented TRAC in the EVM 2.0 environment on the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>The main advantage of such an approach would be the immediate availability of TRAC on OriginTrail Parachain as no updates to the current Parachain codebase are necessary (OriginTrail Parachain 1.0.x codebase versions). The main disadvantage of the approach is the need to perform a token migration once all features necessary for the Parachain native implementation have been put in place (1.1.x codebase versions). There are two general approaches to such token migration, both introducing a new set of challenges:</p>  User-performed migration (open ended): token holders would “swap” between the initial and fully fledged TRAC token versions through a “one-way bridge” contract, which would be responsible for minting “full TRAC” tokens. While satisfying criterion R4, this approach most likely leads to an “open ended migration” (both token implementations “living” on the OriginTrail Parachain for an undetermined period of time) as users could decide not to migrate for whatever reason, which is problematic in terms of Polkadot compatibility requirement (R3). Additionally, this approach requires significant adaptations to the implementation of OriginTrail DKG nodes which will have to manage working with both tokens simultaneously. The core developers assess this as the least favorable option with regards to time resource expenditure (criterion R5). Finally, the existence of two implementations for the same token would likely cause user experience hurdles for less tech-savvy users (e.g. asset publishers), creating problems in terms of requirement R1 and likely R2 due to additional complexity.  Developer-performed migration (close ended): in this option the core developers would retain the capability of “freezing” the “Temp TRAC” token contract implementation for a small amount of time in order to perform a “snapshot migration” from one contract to another (temp TRAC to full TRAC). This option removes some of the downsides of having two simultaneously living TRAC token implementations on the OriginTrail Parachain, however for the cost of necessarily pausing the operations of the entire TRAC economy on the OriginTrail Parachain for the amount of time needed for migration. This particular approach would still require careful planning and execution from the entire ecosystem involved in the TRAC economy on the OriginTrail Parachain. It is estimated that this migration approach would require significant time expenditure from all actors in the community and is negatively assessed in the context of criterion R5, based on the experience in previous token staking and teleporting activities. Moreover, the pausing capability introduces a problematic component into the token implementation due to enabling additional powerful token control capability on the smart contract level (potential single point of failure), problematic in context of requirement R2 for the period of time until the migration to a native Polkadot implementation (full TRAC). Finally, even with developer lead initiative in this approach, it would still require effort and caution from the TRAC community which is not favorable in the context of requirement R1.  Approach #1: TRAC token migration path from EVM1.0 to EVM2.0 (1a involving the “Bridge” contract, 1b performing a snapshot transition)<p>Approach #1 in terms of defined criteria then can be assessed in the following way:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — as both approach #1a and #1b introduce the need to manage two implementations of the same token and require additional activity from all end users of the OriginTrail Parachain, especially in approach #1a which doesn’t have a time constraint on the token migration. Given that OriginTrail Parachain is a new environment (with new tools, such as wallets) the community is slowly getting accustomed to, having any additional friction is seen as problematic.  R2 — Maximized security — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — While significant measures need to be taken to ensure safe transition between two token implementations, the approach does satisfy the security requirements as the process can be entirely based on smart contracts. However, additional steps and complexity inherently do add an additional risk component in the&nbsp;process.  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability — grade: EVENTUALLY SATISFIED — with the evolutionary approach TRAC would start as a “non-native” Polkadot asset. The additional features provided by Polkadot would only be available post-migration.  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — in both approach #1a and #1b TRAC starts as an ERC20-compatible token.  R5 — Effective time of deployment — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — in order to reach the fully deployed state of TRAC on Polkadot, a significant time investment would be required to plan and execute the migration activities in detail, both by the core developers as well as by the OriginTrail community (estimated at several months). The partially satisfied grading of the requirements stems from the fact that it allows immediate deployment of the (non-Polkadot) version of TRAC tokens as no additional updates to the OriginTrail Parachain are&nbsp;needed.   Approach #2: Direct Polkadot-native deployment (EVM 2.0&nbsp;only) <p>The second approach would be to avoid the deployment of the TRAC token contract in the EVM1.0 environment (Parachain version 1.0.x) entirely, and proceed to direct Polkadot native deployment of TRAC tokens. With such an approach, the TRAC token would from the get-go have all of the benefits offered by Polkadot (as listed above) and would minimize the necessary coordination required by the migration activities detailed in approach #1, all of which would benefit from a better user experience and less friction.</p>Approach #2: TRAC token immediate deployment to EVM2.0 Parachain environment<p>This approach is favorable with regards to all requirements presented above:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — since only one TRAC token deployment would ever exist on the OriginTrail Parachain there would be no migrations or potentially difficult operations the TRAC community would need to&nbsp;perform.  R2 — Maximized security — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — higher security is achieved through minimizing complexity and need of coordination (compared to approach&nbsp;#1).  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — advanced Polkadot features will be available immediately from the moment of token deployment, as the token will be deployed as a Polkadot&nbsp;asset.  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — the TRAC token implementation will be performed in such a way that, apart from being a Polkadot asset from the Substrate perspective, it will remain an ERC20 standardized token from the EVM perspective.  R5 — Effective time of deployment — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — even though approach 2 is not entailing the immediate deployment of TRAC on the OriginTrail Parachain, we estimate that significantly lower amount of resources are required for a fully fledged TRAC implementation in approach #2 (compared to approach #1), from both the development team and the TRAC community, due to no migration activities and code adaptations required from the DKG node side. The estimated deployment time is under 1&nbsp;month.  <p>Due to the dynamics presented above, approach #2 is the preferred option of the core development team.</p> Bridging TRAC to other ecosystems <p>Due to Polkadot’s native interoperability features, once implemented, the TRAC token will be available to the entirety of Polkadot and its parachains, as the Relay chain acts as a de facto bridge between Polkadot parachains. This will open up new opportunities for both the token holders as well as builders in the ecosystem to deploy OriginTrail in ways previously not&nbsp;seen.</p><p>The implementation of trustless bridges to other blockchain ecosystems is an ongoing effort of multiple teams and has been discussed in the previous OT-RFC-12. The necessary preparation and discussions with ecosystem developers and Parity have been ongoing in anticipation of the bridge deployment between Ethereum and Polkadot, as indicated in the scheme&nbsp;above.</p> Conclusion <p>This RFC presents the requirements and approaches to implementing the TRAC token on the OriginTrail Parachain, including the details of their execution according to the requirements. As core developers we invite the wider OriginTrail community to provide feedback and comments in the dedicated discussion on the OriginTrail RFC repository.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">OriginTrail Twitter</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain">OriginTrail Parachain Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-13-trac-token-deployment-on-polkadot-c709347583cc">OT-RFC-13 TRAC Token deployment on Polkadot</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 💼 + 🤗 =&nbsp;🚀 <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed-use-cases/">the draft</a> Verifiable Credentials for Education, Employment, and Achievement Use Cases report was published. It’s worth a read for anyone interested in Open Badges, microcredentials, or certification. The next version of the Open Badges specification (v3.0) will be compatible with Verifiable Credentials (VCs). One thing to note about VCs is that they don’t have to have a visual representation in the form of an&nbsp;image.</p><p>The use cases provided in the report are interesting, and Verifiable Credentials promise to solve many seemingly-intractable problems around how individual people can prove claims in privacy-respecting ways. What we noted, however, especially given our work around <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>, is that there are some use cases that are likely to be transformational to learners and workers in the future of work. Both groups need control over the way that they are recognised to unlock future opportunities.</p><p>For example, the report talks about the recognition of prior learning, something which is an equity issue for those who haven’t had the same access to resources than&nbsp;others:</p><blockquote>Josephina decided to return to college to finish her bachelors degree. The college she attended evaluated her work experience and determined that skills and knowledge that she attained while working qualified to replace several of the courses required for the&nbsp;degree.</blockquote><p>There are countries and systems where recognising prior learning is a normal part of the learning landscape. Even in these cases, however, the aim of the activity is to assess whether an individual has met the criteria for admission to a course or institution. What VCs allow is for recognition to be turned into a credential, and therefore used as ‘currency’ not just to be ‘spent’ at that institution, but potentially anywhere.</p><p>The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">original vision</a> for Open Badges was to create an “open and decentralized [ecosystem] to allow for badges from any contexts where learners are learning, to support any and all types of learning occurring, to provide portable and sustainable value and to give each learner complete control”.</p><a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/issuing-open-badges/">Issuing Open Badges</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a><p>The key word here is control. Although a lot of learning happens in formal education institutions, a lot of learning happens on the job through informal and non-formal learning. So how can VCs work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_career">portfolio careers</a>, in a world where people change jobs relatively often and need to take proof of their learning with&nbsp;them?</p><p>We suggest that there are the following three examples where VCs can play an important role in Open Workplace Recognition (i.e. Open Recognition in the workplace):</p>  Recognition of prior learning — as discussed above, this is a way to translate knowledge, skills, and experience gained on the job into credentials that can be used more widely. This depends on an authority (the ‘Issuer’) assessing a portfolio of evidence about a person (the ‘Subject’), who will then also be able to use the VC as proof of their claim (i.e. also be the ‘Holder’).  Defining your own path — no two careers are ever the same, yet the way we present them can often be far too similar. VCs issued for the recognition of niche (or even unique!) things such as knowledge, skills, experience, and dispositions allows individuals to better tell their own story. One way of doing this would be to self-issue a VC (the ‘Subject’ and ‘Holder’ is also the ‘Issuer’) and then have someone else, or an organisation, endorse that&nbsp;claim.  Making recognition portable — combining the other two points, an individual may want to memorialise a particular important form of recognition they have received. This could be a tweet, a comment in an email, or anything that they want to be able to refer to in future. By self-issuing a VC (again, the ‘Subject’ and ‘Holder’ is also the ‘Issuer’) they can ask the person who gave the recognition to endorse their&nbsp;claim.  <p>The purpose of standards, and the working groups which create them, is necessarily to focus on the technical elements and most common use cases. With this post, we want to widen the conversation to consider what VCs make possible that is entirely new, and that which was perhaps always latent in Open&nbsp;Badges.</p><p>Using a lens of Open Workplace Recognition allows us to focus about the norms, behaviours, and expectations within the world of work. We can then go a step further to think about who controls what is recognised, by whom, and how that recognition can be shared more&nbsp;widely.</p><p>What other examples for Open Workplace Recognition using VCs can we come up with together?</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-workplace-recognition-using-verifiable-credentials-fc0134fad7ec">Open Workplace Recognition using Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We asked our Executive Director, Kay Chopard, for her thoughts and learnings from working through the first phase of the UK Digital Identity &amp; Attributes Framework (DIATF):</p>



<p>“It is nearly 7 months since<a href="https://www.ukas.com/resources/latest-news/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-pilot/"> UKAS announced the 5 organisations</a> that would certify Identity Service Providers (IDSPs) against the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> under an initial assessment program.</p>



<p>Digital identity and the provision of trusted credentials will be a vital component in the delivery of future public – and private – services. Through our global identity certification work, we observe first-hand just how quickly the digital identity market is growing. We have been certifying an increasing number of IDSPs against global standards as opportunities for digital identity expand and I’ve noticed, especially, the drive from sectors where identity verification is NOT mandated by regulation – for instance in healthcare.  At Kantara Initiative, we have been running identity assessment programs across the world for nearly 15 years.&nbsp; In the UK, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-identity-certification-for-right-to-work-right-to-rent-and-criminal-record-checks/digital-identity-certification-for-right-to-work-right-to-rent-and-criminal-record-checks#list-of-certified-idsps">17 identity proofing organisations have now been certified to provide services within the Framework</a>. To support this growth, I believe we should consider the following points:</p>



<p>Future-proofing the identity ecosystem</p>



<p>We have been proud to work with the Department of Culture, Media and Sports (DCMS), UKAS and our certification clients over the past 6 months as the DIATF has moved from the Alpha to Beta phase. Organisations that were certified in the first few months were assessed against the Alpha version of the framework. Our certification clients, however, are assessed against the Beta version of the DIATF as this is already much more robust and includes more fully defined assessment criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the program continues to evolve we will identify further assessment criteria that will be vital to roll out robust, trusted, identity solutions that will work for future use cases. Our auditors are dedicated identity specialists with experience across multiple sectors. They have shared with me that the DIATF will continue to benefit from the experiences of other programs across the world – what has worked and what hasn’t.&nbsp; This is vital, especially if we are to support those identity organisations that are planning for international expansion. The UK’s DIATF cannot exist in geographic isolation; individual customers and citizens will eventually require a digital identity that is portable. The DIATF should support organisations in providing this.</p>



<p>One size doesn’t fit all</p>



<p>This first wave of assessments has shown very quickly that each certification client operates quite differently and so a simple “tick box” approach to assessment will not work. We are often asked for a fixed price for our certification services, but I would argue that a fixed price indicates a fixed approach – and a fixed mindset. The underlying assessment criteria must, of course, be met consistently. But each organisation operates differently, and the Kantara ‘modular’ approach ensures each element of the process can be audited in line with requirements AND the business’ operating model. This also supports DCMS’ current model of having separate use cases. As new cases come online, we will continue to add in new assessments that support growth.</p>



<p>Challenge through collaboration</p>



<p>We are a not-for-profit organisation. While commerciality is an important focus, it is more significant that we continue to develop our understanding of emerging trends and issues across all markets. We have been encouraged by the response of parliamentarians, digital identity industry leaders, influencers and media to the Kantara approach and we have appointed a number of key assessors who bring with them experiences of specific sectors, territories and regulatory environments.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Most recently, the appointment of Emma Lindley MBE, Alison McDowell and Andrew Hindle to our UK Advisory Board was a deliberate move to ensure we continue to be challenged and stay abreast of the issues our clients face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our role on the Kantara UK Advisory Board is to provide independent thinking and guidance to Kantara’s UK team. As a UK citizen who has worked in the identity sector for over 20 years, I believe we can help ensure the customer is constantly “in the room” and at the heart of any discussions around the future of the digital identity framework.”  (Andrew Hindle, Kantara UK Advisor, Content Chair at Identiverse and Founding Board Member at IDPro.). </p>



<p>“There is now a clear vision for a digital identity market that is both open and competitive. The DIATF is intended to create choice, improve quality and increase innovation – ultimately improving customer experiences for the UK citizen and reducing the cost for UK PLC. Kantara Initiative has a vital role to play in delivering this vision.” (Emma Lindley MBE, Co-Founder of Women in Identity and MD, International Expansion, at CAF) </p>



<p>Going forward, we believe it is vital that certification bodies continue to work with DCMS and UKAS in a spirit of partnership – bringing together the cumulative value of dozens of great minds! To this end, we have&nbsp; been encouraged by the proactive approach of DCMS in creating forums where the 5 certification bodies can discuss ideas and feedback on the program in action.</p>

<p>Verifying identities and information in a digital world is critical for establishing trust. But there are issues of privacy as well as efficiency, scale and accuracy in models that rely on centralized data collectors and databases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The adoption of a new generation of digital identity solutions that leverage decentralized technologies such as distributed ledgers and verifiable credentials is accelerating. And Hyperledger technologies are playing a major role in this transformation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on for a cross section of the many Hyperledger-powered solutions that are in production now. For other examples, check out these past #HyperledgerIdentity round-ups:</p>



  <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2021/04/29/hyperledger-powered-digital-identity-solutions-at-work">Hyperledger-Powered Digital Identity Solutions at Work</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/04/30/identity-applications-in-action-powered-by-hyperledger">Identity Applications in Action &amp; Powered by Hyperledger</a>  



<p>IBM Digital Health Pass</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/digital-health-pass">IBM Digital Health Pass</a>, built on<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric"> Hyperledger Fabric</a>, offers a multi-credential verifier that organizations can use to manage and execute their verification policies for COVID-19 and vaccination status in a way that balances the privacy of the individual with the requirements set by the organization and local health authorities. With IBM Digital Health Pass, organizations can verify multiple types of health credentials, such as Good Health Pass, IBM Digital Health Pass, Smart Health Card and EU Digital COVID Certificate. Privacy is central to the solution, where the verifier application minimizes the personal data that is ever displayed to the user through the execution of business rules and it never lets any personal data leave, or be stored in, the verifier app.</p>



<p>Indicio Network&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-networks/">Indicio Network</a> is a collection of four professionally-staffed, enterprise-grade public-permissioned ledgers that provide a neutral, independent, and reliable network for the exchange of verifiable credentials. <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">MainNet</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-demonet/">DemoNet</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">TestNet</a>, and <a href="https://indicio.tech/deploy-your-own-private-network-for-critical-performance-testing/">TempNet</a> are all Hyperledger Indy-based networks with nodes operating on five continents—and a growing number of node operators. The Indicio Network is one of the networks that can support <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a>, a complete suite of decentralized identity components for authenticating and sharing high value data in a privacy-preserving way using verifiable digital credentials. Built on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a>, as well as AnonCreds and DIDComm, Proven is designed to make implementing and using these open source codebases simple, providing users with a fully-owned solution that’s easy to integrate with existing systems, to innovate on, and to scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDUnion&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://idunion.org/?lang=en">IDUnion</a>, the European identity verification network created as part of the “Secure Digital Identities Showcase” funding project, brings together public institutions, government agencies, private organizations, associations, educational institutions and other stakeholders from various fields to enable a fundamentally new, secure digital infrastructure for the verification of identity information. In August, 2022, IDUnion spun off Sociedad Cooperativa Europea (SCE) to operate the production network for credential verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IDUnion network, which is built on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>, enables the clear verification of individuals, companies and institutions while allowing people and organizations to manage their identity information by themselves and to decide when they want to share this information and with whom. It has a decentralized structure and stores no personal data – not even as a hash. In order to protect privacy right from the start, all personal data is stored on the user’s end device. Users have a choice of wallets for storing and presenting credentials to third parties as required. Credentials are issued, verified and stored using open standards to ensure interoperability. Hyperledger Aries is the framework for managing the credentials.</p>



<p>NHS Covid-19 Digital Staff Passport</p>



<p>In 2019, the NHS was preparing to pilot a digital passport project that would allow staff to carry their HR and other records as credentials on their phones as a long-term plan to make it easier to transfer from one facility to another. When the pandemic hit, this went from a pilot to a production deployment quickly. The <a href="https://beta.staffpassports.nhs.uk/">NHS Covid-19 Digital Staff Passport</a> rolled out in summer to support swift and efficient staff movement between NHS organizations in response to the response health emergency. The COVID-19 Digital Staff Passport provided a solid legal framework for staff to be temporarily deployed into other NHS organizations with evidence available that checks have been completed before staff move. As laid out in the pilot, the information was transferred securely by the staff member as verified credentials stored on their own smartphone, putting them in control.</p>



<p>This staff passport used the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sorvin Network</a>, which is built on Hyperledger Indy, to verify the digital credentials, and the Evernym (now Avast) <a href="https://connect.me/">Connect.me</a> digital wallet app, which is powered by Hyperledger Aries, Indy and Ursa, to enable staff to store and share their credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NHS is now gearing up to roll out the <a href="https://beta.staffpassports.nhs.uk/whats-next.htm">next generation</a> of its Digital Staff Passport, which will streamline transfers and staff movements through the NHS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBook BC&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca/search">OrgBook BC</a> is a searchable public directory of organizations registered in British Columbia, Canada, provided by the BC Government’s Ministry of Citizens’ Services. OrgBook BC provides verified data, including legal names and DBA names, business numbers, BC registration status and select licensee and permits, for more than 1.4 million organizations. All of the information in the OrgBookBC is received, stored, verified and displayed using the latest digital trust technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBookBC uses verifiable credentials to ensure that information about organizations are digitally signed by the entity that issues it. Issuers are public sector organizations that hold information about businesses, issue licenses or permits or certify processes. That electronic signature stays with the data throughout its life in OrgBook and is validated before its is display on the website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBookBC is part of an overall commitment to digital trust technologies by the Government of British Columbia. In addition to deploying Hyperledger Aries, Indy and Ursa, the team there is leading much of the open source development for those projects.

To summarize the mechanics, the Energy Web Consortia staking pool tracks the consistency of staking by taking snapshots of staking balances at random points in&nbsp;time.</p><p>Users who stake consistently, based on the snapshot date, will earn additional rewards from the staking pool. The additional rewards are designed to incentivize consistent staking, as EWT staking will be a major contributor to the cybersecurity of upcoming Energy Web solutions for enterprises.</p> Snapshot 3 Balance&nbsp;Analysis <p>Snapshot 3 was taken on block #<a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/block/19190154/transactions">19190154</a> generated on July 29th at 09:24:50 PM +2 UTC. At this block, there were 6,822 wallets staking, which is 181 more wallets compared to Snapshot 2 and 414 more compared to Snapshot 1. The total balance of all EWT staked in the pool was equal to 6,047,363 EWT, an increase of 316,401 EWT compared to Snapshot 2 and 506,775 EWT more than at Snapshot&nbsp;1.</p><p>Here are the balances of Snapshot 3 (in green), 2 (in orange), and 1 (in blue).

Interestingly, there are 5 wallets that were staking EWT during Snapshot 1, withdrew their stake during snapshot 2, and are now staking during snapshot&nbsp;3.</p><p>Here’s the balance distribution comparison between snapshot 1, 2, and 3 balances.

The highest increase in staking occurred in the highest, &lt;2,500–3000&gt; bound: 84 new wallets staked between 2,500 and 3,000 ETW. For comparison, there were only 42 additional wallets staking under 500&nbsp;EWT.</p> Snapshot 3&nbsp;insights <p>EWT staking in the Consortia pool continues to be consistent, which is exactly the intention behind the design of the snapshot mechanism. This is evidenced by the balance distribution of all snapshots and <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/address/0x181A8b2a5AEb25941F6A79b4aE43dBb1968c417A/coin-balances#address-tabs">EWT balances in the staking contract</a>:</p><p>Such consistent staking will provide a high degree of economic cybersecurity to all enterprise-grade Energy Web solutions (for more information on the connection between consistent staking, cybersecurity, and Energy Web solutions, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">please review our announcement on the upcoming Consortia chain</a>).</p><p>Before the end of the year, there will be 3 more Snapshots taken at random blocks. Patrons who receive at least 1 Snapshot will qualify for additional rewards. The rewards will be calculated and distributed after the Consortia staking pool ends. Again, since variable rewards are impossible to predict, the best strategy for all patrons is to stake as high a balance as possible and do so consistently.</p><p>Also read: <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-token-ewt-consortia-relay-staking-snapshots-insights-32675cdd20db">Energy Web Token (EWT) Consortia Relay Staking Snapshots Insights part&nbsp;1</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

 Collective imaginings of what is possible (or desirable!) <p>In a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">previous post</a>, we looked at a typology of Open Source communities. This got us thinking about other indicators that could be plotted against one another on 2x2 grids. Tools like this are useful when deciding as a community how you want to interact.</p><p>The idea here is not to precisely define reality, but rather paint a broad-brushstroke picture of the kind of community that you want to create. Then you can think about kind of platforms, tools, and processes that might enable&nbsp;that.</p><p>Let’s start with an&nbsp;example:</p>CC BY&nbsp;WAO<p>In the above diagram, we’re plotting how formal the community is (or will be) against how private it is. LinkedIn, in the top-right quadrant, is an example of a ‘formal’ space that is based on reputation. It’s widely accepted as a ‘professional’ platform, and users are associated with their ‘real’ work identities.</p><p>So if you are creating a community that fits with this way of understanding the world, LinkedIn might be a great platform. However, if you’re creating a community where people prefer to remain anonymous and have an informal chat, you might use something in the bottom-left quadrant such as&nbsp;Reddit.</p><p>So let’s take another example. If we plot ‘Scale’ (as in how large you want the community to potentially get) with ‘Intentionality’ (i.e. deciding in advance what it’s for) then you might get something like&nbsp;this:</p><p>This is similar in some ways to the 2x2 grid from our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">previous post</a>, except it’s focused on social relationships rather than audience. Its value comes in being explicit about the goals of the community, all the while bearing in mind that groups can morph from one into&nbsp;another.</p><p>The reason this is important as it helps current and potential community members have a mental model of what’s going on, helping them be on the same page as their peers. Someone joining a ‘Club’ when they thought they were joining a ‘Movement’ is likely to be disappointed, and vice-versa.</p><p>During our brainstorming sessions around this, we came up with plenty of examples of X and Y axes you could use to plot 2x2 grids. We’re still thinking about this, but so far have three buckets around Interaction, Identity, and Intention.</p> Interaction   Infrequent posting vs Frequent&nbsp;posting  Maintaining existing relationships vs Building new relationships  Low support requirements vs High support requirements  Asynchronous vs Synchronous   Identity   Informal vs&nbsp;Formal  Anonymous vs Reputational  Social vs Professional  Single group identity vs Multiple groups /&nbsp;factions   Intention   Thematic vs Goal-oriented  Receiving updates vs&nbsp;Learning  Small scale vs Large&nbsp;scale  Place-based vs Non-geographical  <p>As ever when it comes to community work, it’s the conversations around these grids that are the most interesting. These are all different lenses you can use to imagine a new community or look at an existing one. At the end of the day, they do not describe ‘objective reality’ but rather collective imaginings of what is possible (or desirable!)</p><p>What other labels could you come up with? What other lenses can you produce to help you conceptualise your community? 🤔</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/using-2x2-grids-for-open-source-community-development-b3a3824b1682">Using 2x2 grids for Open Source community development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Towards a new typology of projects based on user and contributor growth <p>I’ve just finished reading <a href="https://literal.club/dajbelshaw/book/working-in-public-d4nqv">Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</a> by Nadia Eghbal (now <a href="https://nadia.xyz/">Nadia Asparouhova</a>). I discovered it via an a16z podcast episode entitled <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/open-source-communities-creators-rerun-_j2VDSSF">Learning from Open Source Communities</a>.</p><p>People often use the term ‘Open Source’ in a way that downplays the extremely heterogenous landscape:</p><blockquote>The term “open source” refers only to how code is distributed and consumed. It says nothing about how code is produced. “Open source” projects have nothing more in common with one another than “companies” do. All companies, by definition, produce something of value that is exchanged for money, but we don’t assume that every company has the same business model.&nbsp;(p.54)</blockquote><p>So if we can’t easily refer to ‘Open Source communities’ in general, how are we to understand them?</p><p>There are many different scenarios for Open Source projects and the communities around them. One of the most useful parts of Working in Public is a typology based around comparing user growth with contributor growth.</p>Original image from ‘Working in&nbsp;Public’<p>The version of this typology below is WAO’s interpretation, which flips the columns in the original to make the high contributor growth and high user growth appear in the top-right quadrant. This is to make it easier to read. We also rename ‘toy’ projects as ‘side’ projects to avoid being dismissive of some types of Open Source projects.</p>Image CC BY WAO, based on ‘Working in Public’ by Nadia&nbsp;Eghbal<p>Taking each in&nbsp;turn:</p>  🛹 Side projects — low contributor growth and low user growth. These kind of projects serve to scratch an itch or made just for fun. This is not to say that they can’t be used for more serious activities, but that the original intention wasn’t to scale. Usually, there’s only a single ‘project lead’ (although even that term seems a bit too formal) and it’s unlikely anyone else really uses the product. As a result, there doesn’t really need to be much governance.  👥️ Clubs — high contributor growth but low user growth. These kind of projects tend to be a group of people working on something that may be potentially niche but personally or professionally relevant. Most users in this scenario will also be contributors and they are collectively scratching an itch. There is likely to be more governance and collective decision-making necessary around this kind of&nbsp;project.  🏟️ Stadiums — low contributor growth but high user growth. These kind of projects tend to be either super-niche projects which nevertheless are relied on as infrastructure or popular projects because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction">parasocial</a> (i.e. one-sided) relationship between ‘creator’ and ‘audience’. Although there will be many ideas and suggestions as part of this community, in terms of governance it’s likely that a very small number of people, make the decisions.  🔱 Federations — high contributor growth and high user growth. These kind of projects tend to be larger and more mature projects which may be backed by an incorporated organisation. As a result, they are more likely to have a governance model which includes established procedures such as decision-making workflows.  <p>This quadrant-based approach is a broad-brushstroke attempt to roughly define how a project sits relative to others. The boundaries are&nbsp;fuzzy:</p><blockquote>The difference between these project models is not precisely defined. At either extreme, we can see clear differences. We can say that Linux, a project with multiple subprojects and working groups, does not look like tslib, a small helper library for the programming language TypeScript. But the middle is a little murky. There are some projects with four or five maintainers, and other projects with many contributors who are not deeply involved. (p.77)</blockquote><p>Eghbal’s focus is mainly on technical projects which are hosted on GitHub, but I think this is much more widely applicable to some of our client and community work. I’m looking forward to applying this as I think it helps clarify thinking around governance in particular.</p><p>For example, presenting the four different types of community around a project makes it easier to ask whether the project lead conceptualises the community as more of a club or a&nbsp;stadium?</p><p>If you need some help with your community, get in touch! WAO are specialists in the Venn diagram overlap between learning, technology, and community 🙂</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">How Open Source communities are evolving</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has published explicit guidance designed to support retailers, hospitality providers and utility services in protecting both themselves and their customers from the growing impact of cyber-crime. The guidance emphasizes the need to add extra layers of security on top of passwords, such as multi-factor authentication, OAuth 2.0 or single sign-on, FIDO2, or one-time passcodes.</p>

   Scotland's Blockchain sector has blossomed from nothing into a major global presence.

<div class='wrap'>

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>When I first started this site a few years back Scotland’s Blockchain industry was non-existent. 
 Given it’s critical role as a foundation technology for a digital society this was disappointing and concerning. 
<p>On <a href="https://podcasts.scot/episode/scotland-europes-blockchain-capital/">a podcast</a> in 2021 Zumopay stated the lofty ambition for Scotland to become Europe’s Blockchain capital, and this would have seemed like nothing more than a pipe dream.</p>
<p>However when you consider the evolution of the sector over just the last year or two, you can see that the roots have formed such that this is actually now an achievable goal.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
 
 Zumopay themselves are of course a keynote exemplar. Just one year on from their £1.3m seed round <a href="https://zumo.money/press_releases/zumo-reports-100x-user-growth/">they reported</a> a 100x year on year user growth, are pioneering the <a href="https://zumo.money/press_releases/zumo-receives-government-funding-to-continue-crypto-decarbonisation-push/">decarbonization of crypto</a>, and <a href="https://zumo.money/press_releases/zumo-launches-first-full-stack-b2b-crypto-as-a-service-platform/">have launched</a>&nbsp;a B2b ‘Crypto-as-a-Service’ platform. 
 CD Corp is making the very smart move to specialize in helping small businesses integrate NFT’s into their business model. Following on from their <a href="https://digitalscot.net/whisky-on-the-blockchain/">Whisky Barrel client win</a> they just <a href="https://twitter.com/cdcorp__/status/1573000432317878272">announced a new project</a> with Aberfam. 
 In Nov 2020 <a href="https://siccar.net/siccar-connects-with-par-equity-to-secure-a-1-3m-investment-round/">Siccar raised</a> a £1.3m funding round, and in July 2021 Blockchain Technology Partners <a href="https://medium.com/blockchaintp/blockchain-technology-partners-raises-2-million-seed-round-led-by-force-over-mass-and-signature-865e346ece10">raised £2m</a>. Both specialize in the massive enterprise Blockchain market, addressing requirements such as secure data sharing and distributed ledger, smart contract, provenance, and cloud technologies. 
 Nov 2021 – Carbon Based Lifeforms <a href="https://scottishgames.net/2021/11/16/project-gateway-returns-with-1-7m-funding-for-blockchain-based-mmo/">launched</a> as a new game studio with $1.7m funding, announcing Project Gateway, a MMO/RPG underpinned by a Bitcoin and NFT asset-based play-to-earn, player-owned market economy. 
 Executives from one of Scotland’s giant tech successes Fanduel have also expanded into the sector, launching <a href="https://vault.fan/">Vault</a> and <a href="https://www.betdex.com/">BetDEX</a>. Both are innovating atop the Solana Blockchain platform, building a creator platform where fans unlock access to exclusive content by owning the key to a creator’s vault and a decentralized sports betting exchange. 
 
<p>A relatively short list but the breadth and depth of these ventures is considerable, each market they serve alone is very large, from enterprise technologies through global betting.&nbsp;BetDEX in particular is the heavyweight player, raising a massive <a href="https://www.betdex.com/post/former-fanduel-executives-launch-betdex">$21m seed round</a> from world-class investors and leading the development of the <a href="https://beststartup.scot/monaco-protocol-provides-foundation-for-web3-sports-betting-applications/">Monaco sports betting protocol</a>.</p>
 What more can we do? 
<p>Given this leap from nothing to a very significant industry footprint it begs the question what more can we do? If this is ‘first gear’ for Scotland’s Blockchain industry, what would it look like to step up through gears two, three and beyond, what benefits would that bring and how can we make it happen?</p>
<p>Naturally each is focused on their individual business success, but what could be achieved if we consolidated our efforts to grow their collective success and further expand the industry as a whole?</p>

 The single most important project relative to the goals of the Scottish Blockchain Network has been pioneered by <a href="https://www.thewhiskybarrel.com/">The Whisky Barrel</a> and their tech experts <a href="https://cdcorp.co.uk/">CD Corp</a>. 
<p>It’s so important because the primary challenge the industry faces is that it can be an extremely confusing, jargon-filled sector, to the extent it’s perceived as a very cliquey community populated only by hard-core techies and is thus inaccessible, and critically, irrelevant to others especially businesses.</p>
<p>Therefore’s it’s essential to showcase case studies that explain in plain english how businesses are adopting the technology, what use case it has been employed for and what benefits this has brought the company.</p>
<p>The Whisky Barrel project demonstrates i) how they have integrated it into and enhanced their e-commerce strategy, and ii) the technology field is still so young that it’s possible to achieve world firsts, and thus significant competitive advantage and associated PR potential.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/scotch-whisky-bottler-releases-one-26433299">Insider reported</a> they have released one of the world’s first single-cask Scotch whiskies with a digital provenance certificate, using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to digitally certify its whisky, which securely transmits essential product information on a public ledger, helping collectors and connoisseurs alleviate the risk of investing in counterfeit whisky.</p>
<p>Each of the 152 individually-numbered bottles feature a unique QR code that links to its corresponding digital certificate. This token provides digital proof of ownership, as well as the provenance of each bottle.&nbsp;Each NFT is minted on the Solana blockchain platform, which was chosen for its carbon-neutral and low-energy consumption qualities.</p>

<p>Update: registrations for this event are now closed.</p>



<p>In July, we published our report exploring the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-report-at-the-confluence-of-digital-rights-climate-justice/">intersections of digital rights, tech, and climate justice</a>. It’s been wonderful to hear from readers on what findings from our research you’ve found useful for your own work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’d like to keep the exchange going with an interactive discussion sharing our main findings and collaboratively plotting a course for further future work in this urgent area, so we’re hosting a community call October 18, at 5-6pm CET. Whether you’re working primarily in the climate justice space or the digital rights space, or are just interested in the topic, we’d love to see you there!&nbsp;</p>



 What will we discuss? 



<p>In our research, we focused on a number of intersections of digital rights and climate justice, and identified priority areas for further digital rights engagement and collaboration. In the call, we want to hone in on two 2 specific issue areas with you:</p>



  Climate intelligence: From long-standing environmental data initiatives to newer ‘AI for climate’ and ‘AI for planet’ efforts, governments, corporations and communities seek to harness digital data to monitor biodiversity and forecast future climate events with greater accuracy. How do you think the digital rights community can best support existing community-driven efforts and deepen its engagement on AI and sustainability issues? How might <a href="https://responsibledata.io/2018/01/24/rd-101-responsible-data-principles/" title="responsible data principles">responsible data principles</a> contribute to data governance discussions in this space?  Decarbonizing tech: In recent years, a number of tech companies have pledged carbon neutrality and greater sustainability. Yet, meaningfully measuring and mitigating the climate and environmental impacts of tech remains a challenge. What do you think are the main priorities for digital rights community engagement to ensure tech sustainability efforts are supporting climate justice?&nbsp;  



<p>The call will happen on October 18, at 5-6pm CET and it will be held in English.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Update: registrations for this event are now closed.</p>

<p>This article explains how verifiable credentials can be used to benefit event organizers and visitors alike based on a practical usage of the Lissi&nbsp;team.</p> Introduction <p>Currently, the majority of event tickets are issued in paper form or as&nbsp;.pdf files, which contain the relevant information about the event as well as the visitor. However, since these files can be easily transferred to another person, a personalisation of the ticket in combination with a verification of an identity document at the entrance is required to ensure that the buyer and visitor are the same person. This creates unnecessary overhead and complications for both the visitor and organizer. Therefore, we propose using verifiable credentials to avoid ticket scalping and provide direct access to online resources with the&nbsp;ticket.</p> Benefits of using verifiable credentials for&nbsp;tickets   Ownership binding and verifiability — tickets are bound to a specific owner and are not transferable  Prevention of ticket fraud — tickets are digitally signed by an&nbsp;issuer  Usage of the ticket for authentication (e.g. to access a digital stream, online presentations etc.) — Your ticket is your username and password!  Avoiding ticket scalping and ticket bots and therefore retain control over the secondary market — tickets are bound to a specific person and are not transferable  Directly communicate with a user in a messenger like way — a peer-to-peer connection between the event organizer or ticketing provider is being established and can be used for the exchange of further information  Cheap and convenient user identification and the possibility to verify multiple credentials at the same time (e.g. ticket, covid test, studentID, etc.)   How it&nbsp;works: <p>The user registers for an event via a website. For our pilot integration we used an established ticketing provider for the registration process. However, this process can also be fully executed based on decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. We sent an e-mail containing the required steps to derive the ticket into a wallet, which supports verifiable credentials. The following screens illustrate the process of receiving the ticket and presenting it to a verifier such as an access control authority at a physical&nbsp;event.</p>Illustration of the user flow of using the event ticket with&nbsp;Lissi. The verification process <p>As illustrated in the flow the access authority presents an QR-code, which is scanned by the visitor. Once scanned with the wallet, the visitor is requested to share his or her ticket (as well as additional information if required). Given the visitor agrees to share the information the verification status (valid / invalid) is presented as well as the attributes of the ticket. The access authority can use any device, which supports a web application (such as an laptop, mobile phone etc.) to verify the tickets of the&nbsp;visitor.</p> Our experience with verifiable tickets <p>We used verifiable tickets as part of our monthly <a href="https://neosfer.de/events">Between the Towers</a> event series. It was visited by around 70 people. While the download of the Lissi Wallet and derivation of the verifiable ticket was optional, more than 90 percent of visitors got the verifiable ticket in advance. While there were minor user experience issues (mainly due to work profiles on the phone) the vast majority of visitors were very satisfied with the user experience.</p><p>During the verification process most of the users started to show the verifiable credential within the wallet instead of directly scanning the QR-code presented, because the concept of scanning a QR-code to present a credential isn’t intuitive to users yet. However, once users present a credential with the wallet they understand how the process&nbsp;works.</p> Possible expansion for future&nbsp;events:   Identification of the visitor in advance of the ticket purchase.  Issuance of a picture of the visitor as part of the&nbsp;ticket.  Usage of the ticket for the authentication (login) to an online platform.  Communication with the&nbsp;visitor  Provision of further information to the visitor via direct communication channel  Usage of the ticket for discounted access (e.g. 10 % discount for the ticket next&nbsp;year)  <p>If you are interested in diving deeper into the topic, the research paper “<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12525-022-00573-9.pdf">Exploring the use of self‑sovereign identity for event ticketing systems</a>” by Simon Feulner, Johannes Sedlmeir, Vincent Schlatt and Nils Urbach will provide a great overview.</p><p>We would be delighted to hear your ideas about the usage of verifiable tickets in your next events.

<p>It’s a great pleasure to share with you&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/09/DINZ-Reflections-on-Select-Committee-Report-DISTF-1.pdf">DINZ Reflections Report</a>, a seminal piece of work that DINZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/dinz-distf-working-group/">Digital Identity Trust Framework working group</a>&nbsp;has developed over several months. While Trust Frameworks are not a novel concept, their application to the digital identity space is much more recent, and new to Aotearoa.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/09/DINZ-Reflections-on-Select-Committee-Report-DISTF-1.pdf">DINZ’s Reflections Report</a>&nbsp;is industry’s response to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/reports/document/SCR_122616/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">Final Report</a>&nbsp;published in April by the Select Committee members of the Economic Development, Science and Innovation Committee that responds to and makes recommendations based on the submissions made on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/LMS459583.html?src=qs">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Bil</a>l at the end of last year. The Select Committee is not expert in the subject matter of Digital Identity Trust Frameworks. However DINZ does have essential subject matter and operational expertise with an inherent obligation to share its experience for better outcomes in Aotearoa. DINZ welcomes the continued passage of the bill through Parliament recognising that the opportunity to change it substantially during this period is small. It is more likely that the detail contained in the DINZ Reflections Report will be considered once the regulatory operation of the Act is underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a classic example of the demonstrable value of DINZ – Aotearoa’s own digital identity industry association – and for that matter all associations operating under the&nbsp;<a href="https://techalliance.nz/">NZ Tech Alliance</a>&nbsp;banner. DINZ’s members comprise both local and international digital identity service providers, providers of identity and eligibility attributes, relying parties and individual subject matter experts. Many have first-hand overseas experience of Trust Framework operations in digital identity and in other domains that can inform the future of Trust Framework operations and conversations around&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2022/07/15/leading-the-digital-trust-conversation/">Digital Trust</a>&nbsp;more broadly in Aotearoa.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New Leadership to Prioritize Innovation to Advance Open Collaboration Initiatives</p> 


<p>20 September 2022 – OASIS Open, the global open source and standards consortium, announced Francis Beland as its Executive Director. A business builder and advisor, Beland brings more than 25 years of experience helping companies identify breakthroughs and elevate technical agendas, products, and achievements. He will utilize his open innovation background to drive new partnerships, ideas, and expertise to the wide range of open collaboration projects at OASIS.</p>



<p>“We welcome Francis Beland’s leadership, vision, and relationship-building experience,” said Gershon Janssen, chair of the OASIS Board of Directors. “His in-depth knowledge from different perspectives as an open innovation entrepreneur will be invaluable to the OASIS community.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout his career, Francis has served as partner at Global Accelerated Ventures and Oceans.Studio, E-TRON Technologies, and Deloitte/Monitor Group focusing on research, development, and commercialization of breakthrough technologies. In addition, he was vice president at the XPRIZE Foundation, where he led numerous innovation projects. Francis has helped organizations engineer Open Innovation practices into their ecosystem that bolstered innovation, transformed mindsets, and unlocked possibilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s an exciting time to step into this role, and I’m grateful to have the opportunity to expand the OASIS community,” Beland said. “As Executive Director, my goals are to leverage OASIS Open’s systems to help governmental organizations and Fortune 500s alike change their thinking, enhance their strategic initiatives, and envision a world of possibility that hasn’t existed before. Working closely with OASIS members to continue advancing the organization’s goals while focusing on growing the membership base, will ultimately lead to a stronger and more collaborative OASIS community.”</p>



<p>In addition to his background developing large-scale innovation programs in healthcare, automotive, biotech, medical devices, governments, oil &amp; gas and energy industries, Francis was an innovation advisor to Facebook, the United Nations, and the European Commission, and served as an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at the White House for the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

<p>Nearly one billion people on earth lack any form of widely recognized identity.</p><p>Let me say that again…a billion people! Looked at another way, that is one person in eight alive today living without any official record of their existence.</p><p>These individuals are mostly women and children, the majority are poor, and many are refugees or displaced persons. Their status — or rather, lack of official status — represents a constant barrier to participation in modern social, economic, and political life.</p><p>Many of us are lucky enough to live in countries where we have multiple forms of ID; a driver’s license or transit pass, which enables us to get where we need to go, a work ID to access our place of employment, credit or debit cards to make purchases, health ID cards to receive medical care, logins to access our work, financial, and social media accounts, and more. We use them without thinking about it and generally take them for&nbsp;granted.</p><p>But, if you want to get a sense of what life is like without a formal identity, try leaving all your forms of ID at home for one day. It will open your&nbsp;eyes.</p><p>If you are lucky, you will make it to work without being pulled over by a police officer (caution: your day is likely to get much worse if you do). Without carrying a driver's license, you will probably be looking over your shoulder and driving more slowly and carefully, experiencing — though to a lesser degree — the fear and uncertainty that those without ID experience on a daily basis, across all of their activities. You may return home hungry because you were unable to pay for lunch, or do any of the other activities that require a credit card. And, hopefully, the security guard in the lobby recognizes you — or can call someone to admit you — otherwise, you might be heading home early to “work remotely.”</p><p>Seriously… try a day of not using any form ID to recognize just how much you depend on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Digital ID can be a powerful tool that both empowers individuals and protects their basic human rights and civil liberties.</p><p>Those who lack an official identity find it difficult or impossible to access basic services, such as education, employment, health care, and financial services. They are unable to exercise their rights as citizens and voters and participate in the modern economy. Giving these individuals an official identity unlocks countless opportunities.</p><p>Article Six of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.” Adopted in 1948, the Declaration defines a variety of rights to which we are all entitled; equal treatment before the law, dignity, nationality, privacy, education, mobility, and more. Being able to prove one’s identity is fundamental to the full exercise of these&nbsp;rights.</p><p>In 2015, the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDG 16.9) established a target of providing legal identity for all, including birth registration, by 2030. The UN, World Bank, and nations around the world have made admirable progress toward closing the “identity gap.” In a recent <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202208/un-expects-350m-more-people-worldwide-to-get-legal-identity-by-2025">Biometric Update 16.9 Podcast</a>, UNDP’s Niall McCann predicted that, by 2025, 350 million more people will have a recognized form of identity. This would be a remarkable accomplishment. But, from our perspective, closing the identity gap is necessary, but, ultimately, insufficient.</p><p>The world would be a simpler place if having an ID guaranteed these rights. Of course, it doesn’t. For some individuals who do have an ID — religious and ethnic minorities, political dissidents, for example — relying on a national ID system can have the opposite effect, making them more susceptible to exclusion, oppression, and persecution. For these individuals, alternative forms of ID are necessary to ensure that their rights — and, in some cases, their lives — are protected.</p><p>Done properly, “good ID” can help address both challenges, offering the promise of both empowerment and protection. And yet, all ID systems — digital or paper-based — come with attendant risks, which must be understood and intentionally mitigated through technology, design, policy, and enforcement choices by public and private sector decision-makers.</p><p>At ID2020, we often say that “good ID = good technology + good policy + good governance.”</p><p>There is a dangerous tendency to think that we can “tech our way out of any problem.”</p><p>The reality is that technology alone cannot adequately prevent exclusion, oppression, surveillance, and a variety of other undesirable outcomes. Building ID systems — especially digital ID systems — in an ethical manner requires governance frameworks and robust policy and regulatory safeguards that add an extra layer of protection. This is why collaboration between governments, multilateral and bilateral funders, civil society, and the private sector is so essential.</p><p>We are encouraged by the progress being made. At the same time, we are humbled by the task ahead of us and know that we must do&nbsp;more.</p><p>Living up to the intent of SDG 16.9 and the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights </a>will require not only expanding access to ID, but also ensuring that these systems are designed, built, and implemented in ways that protect fundamental human rights, enhance equity, and promote social and financial inclusion.</p><p>We hope that you will join us today in celebrating Identity Day by taking a moment to reflect on how our community — and, indeed, each of us individually — can help enhance equity, inclusion, and social and economic justice through our&nbsp;work.</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>This contributed byline from Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of FIDO Alliance, details cybersecurity blind spots generated by growing IoT technology adoption. To address these issues, the FIDO Alliance launched FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) in 2021 to tackle two main problems: deployment efficiency and security at the point of onboarding. The main feature of FDO is fully automated device onboarding, which considerably speeds up the previously manual process. FDO also replaces generic password credentials with highly secure cryptographic keys, making the devices considerably more robust against attack.</p>

<p>The end of forgotten or stolen passwords? Apple is launching “passkeys” today, a new identification system that should make the use of cryptic passwords to guarantee the security of one’s accounts a thing of the past. In practice, logging in anywhere will be as easy as unlocking your screen: every site that offers to use passkeys will ask the user if they want to use them to authenticate. It will then be necessary to use the usual method of unlocking the phone (PIN code, pattern, fingerprint or facial recognition) to validate the connection, explains the Fast Identity Online Alliance (FIDO Alliance), which is behind this process.</p>

<p>Apple has shown it to everyone again. In early May 2022, Apple, Google and Microsoft jointly declared that passwordless login with security keys was coming “sometime in 2023”. Now the iPhone company has packed its version of the login – Apple calls it “Passkeys” – directly into its new mobile operating system iOS 16. It has been available to users since Monday. This is how Apple wants to make passwords superfluous.</p>

 Some recommendations for the LocalGov Drupal community​​ <p>Over the last few months, we’ve been working with the <a href="https://localgovdrupal.org">LocalGov Drupal</a> team to shore up support for the project and help the community scale. We’ve been looking at the ways the project can help more people to get involved in a way that is sustainable for the existing community. In <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">Quick wins to improve your Open Source community’s Architecture of Participation</a>, we talk about some tactics any project can implement quite&nbsp;quickly.</p><p>In this post, we continue using our Architecture of Participation, and present some strategies that will help this successful project. In one way or another, they all deal with developing empathy.</p> Clear mission <p>LocalGov Drupal has a fantastic mission. As the project grows, it’s important to ensure that the community stay on course with that&nbsp;mission:</p><blockquote>The publishing platform created by councils, for councils.</blockquote><p>This is expanded to explain&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>LocalGov Drupal is a publicly owned asset that delivers a better digital experience for citizens, improves service outcomes, and saves&nbsp;money.</blockquote><p>In order for councils to continue creating the platform, there needs to be clarity around how it is publicly owned and operated. What mechanisms exist for the community to influence the direction of the&nbsp;project?</p>Diagram via <a href="http://sociocracyforall.org/sociocracy/">Sociocracy for&nbsp;All</a> Recommendations   Involve the community in decision making through defined workflows and&nbsp;roles.  Share information and be transparent about financials (e.g. shortfalls in funding, investment opportunities) by creating a ‘funding’ circle that members can&nbsp;join.  Use consent-based decision making within relevant Sociocratic circles to guide relationship establishment with partner organisations.   Invitation to participate <p>The advice in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">our blog</a> post to take the time to personally invite people stands true, this is a game changer for participation. Another helpful way to ensure that you are inviting a diverse group of people is to establish some repeatable norms for the community.</p><p>At the beginning of meetings, invite people to check in by saying how they are arriving at that meeting. This gives people an opportunity to say how they are feeling, what might be bothering them or what they hope to get out of their participation.</p><p>In addition, create repeatable norms by inviting people to check out places they can get involved. Ask for feedback early and often, model pro-social behaviours around invitations that extend across the&nbsp;project.</p><a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/?s=participation">Participatory Culture</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a> Recommendations   Get in the habit of using check–ins / checkouts in ALL meetings to make people feel welcome, bring their ‘full selves’, and be ready for participation. Sign-ins and written check-ins are&nbsp;great!  Feed the #showyourwork channel by encouraging people to share what they’ve done, however&nbsp;small.  Share v0.1 of your work for feedback (rather than v1.0) to get feedback around direction as well and not just the ‘final&nbsp;polish’.   Easy onboarding + modular&nbsp;approach <p>A successful open source project like LocalGov Drupal has A LOT of information to wrap your head around. There are a lot of ways into the project, different places communication is taking place and a variety of technical and social skills required to participate.</p><p>In order to make onboarding to a project or community easy for anyone, it can help to present information in several different ways. Thinking about (and documenting!) pathways people might be using to come into a project can help the community see where information could be tidier. This in turn can help the community identify places where a different view of the information might be&nbsp;helpful.</p><a href="https://whimsical.com/contribution-pathways-8sy99ptgRoxG4DTtJAsQeW">Visualised contribution pathways for&nbsp;LGD</a> Recommendations   Create a step-by-step checklist of onboarding and interview new community members regularly to help improve&nbsp;it.  Develop and promote the documentation system (aka the wiki) to ensure that contribution guidelines are up-to-date.  Ensure the full context of the LGD project isn’t just held in the heads of core team members by creating standing agenda&nbsp;items.  Help prevent confusion for new community members by using (and updating) <a href="https://whimsical.com/contribution-pathways-8sy99ptgRoxG4DTtJAsQeW">contribution pathways</a>.  Identify the “most used” resources and make sure they are accessible in multiple ways (e.g. record a screencast of the most popular slidedeck or write a blogpost about the most popular&nbsp;graphic)   Strong leadership + celebration of milestones <p>There are many different types of leadership. Strong leadership in an open source project is both distributed and diverse, marked by empathy, fair processes, and the establishment/encouragement of positive relationships.</p><p>The approach being experimented with by LocalGov Drupal, and which we have seen work extremely well within the co-operative movement is Sociocracy. LGD already has a product group, steering group, and technical group, however consent-based decision-making is not necessarily the norm within these groups’ meetings.</p><p>Governance is a work in progress and so we should celebrate both milestones in the project (e.g. technical development) but also milestones in the maturity of the organisation. Those with more mature governance are able to devolve decision-making to relevant circles, encouraging democratic processes and removing bottlenecks.</p> Recommendations   Arrange a Sociocracy refresher workshop and invite everyone in the community. Document the content of the workshop and include it in the LGD knowledge base.  Ensure that each circle has an established “lead” and ask that person to participate in creating standing agenda items together with the other&nbsp;leads.  Celebrate milestones by issuing badges for everything from onboarding, to pro-social behaviours the LGD community wants to encourage, through to membership of groups/circles.  Plan for a specific role around governance and operations to allow ‘business as usual’ to flourish as well as innovation work.  Share progress around governance issues as well as technical development on the blog, newsletter, and in presentations about the&nbsp;project.   Ways of working open + backchannels <p>There are bits of information that need to be kept confidential for the good of the project, but as an open source community, you should default to the highest level of openness you&nbsp;can.</p><p>As you work openly, try not to make judgements about what’s “relevant” to the community. Community members will decide for themselves what is relevant and what isn’t. Just remember to add an appropriate license (e.g. Creative Commons) to help people know in what ways they can share and contribute.</p><p>In order for people to bring their full selves to the project and contribute in diverse ways, they need to be able to talk about things which may be slightly off-topic. These are opportunities to strengthen relationships between community members, much as people who work in the same office bond by sharing stories around the watercooler.</p><p>Positive, pro-social behaviours need to be modelled by those in leadership positions. This is why the habits of those leading meetings, giving presentations, and otherwise having responsibility within the LGD community are so important.</p>CC-BY-ND Bryan&nbsp;Mathers Recommendations   Establish at least one #backchannel in Slack to enable community members to get to know one another without being disruptive in a work-related channel.  Provide guidance on licences which relate to documentation of the project, over and above the code. For example, Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC&nbsp;BY-SA</a>.  Make decisions about technology used for community interaction based on established processes and criteria.  Revisit the Code of Conduct on at least an annual basis to ensure that nothing is standing in the way of diverse community contribution.  Issue badges based on regular (monthly/quarterly) mini-workshops on what it means to work openly and model/encourage open behaviours.   Onwards! <p>Open source is about collaboration, not just code. Finding ways to help people feel welcome and seen is a good way to help your open source project be sustainable.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-architecture-of-participation-for-community-growth-ed9d964ec360">An Architecture of Participation for Community growth</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Department of Homeland Security Signs on as First Premier Sponsor of New Public/Private Partnership</p> 


<p>14 September 2022 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, today announced that NIEM (formerly known as National Information Exchange Model), will transition to NIEM Open, an OASIS Open Project, in October 2022. A collaborative partnership between private industry and all levels of governmental agencies, the NIEM framework enables the effective and efficient sharing of critical data as currently demonstrated in the justice,&nbsp;public safety,&nbsp;emergency and disaster management,&nbsp;intelligence, and&nbsp;homeland security&nbsp;sectors. NIEM is designed to facilitate the creation of automated enterprise-wide information exchanges. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology">Science and Technology Directorate</a> (S&amp;T) has committed to support NIEM Open at the Premier Sponsor level to advance the critical work of the project.</p>



<p>This October, when NIEM transitions from the U.S. Department of Defense to OASIS, an ANSI-accredited and ISO-recognized standards development organization, NIEM’s expansion into global markets will provide access to a larger pool of stakeholders and developers to contribute to the project, creating a path for NIEM to become an official standard in national and international policy and procurement. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Transitioning to an OASIS Open Project allows NIEM to become more readily available to international communities and organizations that want to adopt NIEM,” said Stuart Whitehead of the U.S. Department of Defense. “We look forward to working with new alliances in the private sector to assist in the integration of NIEM into even broader user communities, allowing NIEM to become the gold standard for public-private partnerships. This is an exciting time to continue to advance the NIEM model technically as it transforms into an open, international standard.”</p>



<p>“At OASIS, there’s an extensive set of processes for collaborative development of standards. This is the type of environment that technology companies and government agencies need to accelerate interoperability initiatives across boundaries,” said Katherine Escobar, Deputy Division Chief for the Joint Staff’s J6 Data and Services Division. “We will continue to look for ways to simplify use, embrace emerging technologies, and welcome new communities. We look forward to expanding the NIEM footprint and seeing NIEM Open help organizations exchange information to improve decision making, increase efficiency, and advance their missions.”</p>



<p>“DHS S&amp;T is excited to see the evolution of NIEM to an OASIS Open Project,” said Philip Mattson, Standards Executive and Senior Standards Advisor at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;“This will strengthen NIEM’s overall development, raising the level of collaboration in diverse communities.”</p>



<p>NIEM Open’s Sponsors will provide strategic vision, governance, and technical guidance for future efforts and have the option to serve on the Project Governing Board, where they approve work produced by the community as well as proposals for new open source projects. To learn more about becoming a Sponsor and joining the Project’s Governing Board, please contact <a>join@oasis-open.org</a>.</p>



<p>Additional Information:</p>



<p>About NIEM:</p>



<p>Established in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, NIEM is a community-driven, standards-based approach to facilitate information sharing. U.S. and International organizations across Federal, State, Local, Tribal, Territorial, Public, Private and Commercial sectors use NIEM as a common base data model and methodology to promote interoperability of data and software, reduce design and development time for information exchange applications, and allow the reuse of intellectual capital and skills across multiple projects.</p>



<p>About OASIS:</p>



<p>One of the most respected, nonprofit open source and open standards bodies in the world, OASIS advances the fair, transparent development of open source software and standards through the power of global collaboration and community. OASIS is the home for worldwide standards in IoT, cybersecurity, blockchain, privacy, cryptography, cloud computing, urban mobility, emergency management, and other content technologies. Many OASIS standards go on to be ratified by de jure bodies and referenced in international policies and government procurement.

<p>As the world works towards climate goals, a government project from Canada is using digital trust technology to make it easier and more secure for natural resource companies to share sustainability data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) was established by the Government of British Columbia in recognition that we must do more to facilitate the transition to a clean, resilient economy. British Columbia (B.C.), Canada’s western-most province, was the first province in Canada to implement greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and mandatory sustainability reporting for major sectors of the provincial economy. As leaders in climate change legislation, B.C. is well positioned to explore cutting-edge technology in the journey towards a low-carbon economy. To improve trust, accuracy, and efficiency when sharing sustainability data, EMDT is coordinating a digital ecosystem – a network of organizations including environmental auditors, government bodies, mining and energy companies, and non-government organizations.</p>



<p>Improved Sustainability Reporting&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, reporting sustainability data can be challenging. Data is difficult to exchange internationally, and consumers cannot always access, or trust, reported data, not to mention the administrative burden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>EMDT’s digital ecosystem makes it possible to exchange sustainability information simply and securely, using digital credentials.</p>



<p>Digital credentials:&nbsp;</p>



  Can be shared quickly and are tamper-proof.&nbsp;  Allow companies to control their data.&nbsp;  Guarantee the integrity of the information.&nbsp;  Preserve privacy in business-to-business interactions.&nbsp;  



<p>Digital Trust Ecosystem: EMDT Pilot&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>EMDT has been testing and refining their technology and governance through multiple pilot projects to demonstrate how sustainability reporting can be made more efficient and trustworthy. Two pilot projects explore greenhouse gas emissions reporting in the mining sector and the natural gas sector. These pilots allow participants to test sharing and receiving digital credentials that include verified GHG emissions data for a specific mine site or natural gas facility.</p>







<p>*Because this is a pilot, the process depicted in this diagram does not satisfy or replace existing regulatory reporting obligations.</p>



<p>The greenhouse gas (GHG) mining pilot builds upon the existing regulatory emissions reporting process in British Columbia. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), an environmental auditor, issues a digital credential to Copper Mountain Mining Company containing verified GHG data. Copper Mountain can then use the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Report Verification Credential as part of their GHG emissions report to British Columbia’s Climate Action Secretariat. Copper Mountain can use the same digital credential to complete voluntary reporting to organizations such as the <a href="https://openclimate.org/">Open Earth Foundation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increased Connections&nbsp;</p>



<p>To facilitate the broad exchange of sustainability data, EMDT used Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries to create a highly interoperable tool, called Traction. Traction is an API accelerator built on top of Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-PY). Traction streamlines the process of sending and receiving digital credentials for governments and organizations.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Aries makes Traction highly interoperable with the technological solutions of companies and organizations around the world. “While two wallets might be different implementations or might be written in different code, they can still exchange data because both wallets use Aries,” explains Kyle Robinson, EMDT’s Senior Strategic Advisor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traction makes it easier to integrate digital trust technology into existing lines of business:&nbsp;</p>



  API-first Architecture: Traction is designed with an API-first architecture. This RESTful API allows for integration into existing line-of-business applications already being used by organizations. The Tenant user interface is built on this API to enable adoption prior to integration and for low-use functions.  Multitenancy: ACA-Py is implemented on a cloud-based server so multiple wallets can be managed with one Traction instance.&nbsp;  Higher Scalability: Traction is open-source technology, encouraging collaborative refinement, faster release, and higher scalability of the technology.  



<p>Collaborative Climate Change Progress</p>



<p>With an increasing emphasis on responsibly sourced products, simplified methods for exchanging sustainability data ensures that B.C. natural resource providers can compete in a global market. Digital trust technology streamlines access to trustworthy sustainability data, allowing businesses, governments, and non-government organizations to work towards climate change goals more efficiently and effectively. <a href="http://digital.gov.bc.ca/emdt">Visit our website</a> to learn more about Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust.</p>

<p>Until now, integrating with the Commercio blockchain required an IT framework and in-depth technical knowledge.</p>
<p>The two options available to date were:</p>
 
 develop a native integration (in case using the sdk),<br>
develop an integration in Rest Api (using the Commercio.app). 
 
<p>Both options require a large number of tasks that added together really take up a lot of time and energy.</p>
<p>This is where automation comes in.&nbsp;It gives you back this valuable time and makes a complex concept, such as blockchain, accessible to anyone who needs to use it.</p>
<p>Starting today, thanks to the invaluable work of the brilliant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ncontin/">Nicola Contin</a> of We Can Consulting SpA, you can use Zapier to connect your Commercio app to 5000+ other services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to get started with Zapier 
<p>Zapier is a tool you can use to automate different tasks, connect different Apps, and integrate them. It then allows you to tell Zapier what you want to achieve, without having to write a single line of code.</p>
<p>For example, whenever you get a new lead, Zapier can ask Dropbox to tell it what files you have uploaded, and in real time notarize them on Commercio.network.<br>
With more than 5,000 integrations, you can integrate any storage system or any action produced by one of these integrations with Commercio.network.</p>
<p>To use Zapier, you must first <a href="https://zapier.com/app/billing/plans">create an account.&nbsp;</a> There are different plans, including a free plan that includes 5 single-step zaps and 100 activities.</p>
<p>But before we begin, here are some terms you need to know:</p>
<p>Zap<br>
A Zap is an automated workflow between your Apps.&nbsp;They are a set of instructions you define in Zapier to perform predefined tasks.&nbsp;A zap is triggered when a certain event (a trigger) occurs in an app.</p>
<p>Trigger<br>
Triggers are basically events within software that initiate a workflow.&nbsp;The trigger sends a set of information to Zapier that can be used in zaps to perform actions in other online services, which are also connected to Zapier.</p>
<p>Action<br>
The action is any step taken by zap.&nbsp;For example, each time a row is added to a Google sheet, a zap updates the stock of a product.</p>
<p>Task<br>
A task is how Zapier keeps track of your actions.&nbsp;This is important when you choose your plans.&nbsp;Each time a zap performs one of its “Action” steps, Zapier considers it to be a task.&nbsp;For example, your zap updates the product stock twice a day, Zapier considers this as two tasks.</p>
<p>Remember this when you select your rate plan.</p>
 Commercio Network + Zapier 
<p>Grazie al nuovo Add-On Zapier, ora puoi connettere la blockchain di Commercio ad altri servizi online e impostare l’automazione, sempre senza scrivere una sola riga di codice.</p>
<p>Prima di tutto ti devi collegare a https://commercio.app/ , creare un account, confermarlo e acquistare una membership.</p>
<p>A quel punto, colleghi l’account tramite l’estensione Zapier inserendo username e password dell’account di Commercio.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now your connection is complete, and you can start configuring triggers and ready-to-use actions.</p>
<p>Your App automatically notifies Zapier whenever one of these two triggers occurs:</p>
 
 List of share doc processes initiated 
 Wallet amount 
 
<p>For example, you can create a zap that checks your wallet funds in real time, or that checks whether a new document has moved from the process queue to actual notarization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can automate the following actions in your Commercio.app using the information collected in Zapier:</p>
 
 Creating a new share doc 
 Searching for a specific process id to check the status of a transaction 
 
<p></p>
 Killer APP: Dropbox integration 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of a Killer APP might be the Dropbox integration:</p>
<p>connect your Dropbox account, and with each file upload start a new share doc and notice it in real time.</p>
<p></p>

It provides different configurations (building blocks) that allow developers to quickly build applications on Ceramic—including the ability to discover, create, share and reuse composable data models using GraphQL. </p><p>ComposeDB provides a complete data solution that supports multi-player use cases—like those demanded by social and DAO applications. Popular <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/highlighted-projects/">use cases</a> include projects around user profiles, reputation (publicly verifiable attestations for skills, credentials, and contribution scores), and user-generated content (portable social graphs, social media apps, networking, messaging, and blogs). </p><p>Today, Ceramic applies to a wide variety of use cases across different markets and segments. Its many examples include:</p>  Storing user-generated content as Ceramic streams for app interoperability  Storing contributor credentials for DAOs  Issuing and storing verifiable credentials  Creating unified conversation layers that can work across applications  Enabling fully encrypted wallet-to-wallet messaging  Storing user profile data  Storing dynamic NFT content and metadata attached to user identities  Dynamically appending metadata to NFTs over time<br>  <p>Following the production-ready release of ComposeDB, we expect to see applications that offer extremely rich end-user experiences—all built by developers who contributed to the community-driven data ecosystem on Ceramic. </p><p>Ceramic’s core team will present a production-ready version of ComposeDB in early 2023, one that will:</p>  Enable developers to define and query complex graph database schemas that feature many different forms of relations between accounts (e.g. a user) and their content (e.g. a social post)  Make indexing and querying possible on Ceramic  Make data models and data more easily reusable on Ceramic  Support advanced permissioning   Overview of ComposeDB on Ceramic <p>This section outlines the five features and components that make ComposeDB on Ceramic possible. Click <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.2.x/guides/concepts-overview">here</a> for a full overview of concepts.</p> Composites &amp; Data Models <p>Composites are composable building blocks used by developers. They are groups of data models (e.g. profiles, blog posts, and comments) that together define the graph database schema for an application. Content streams in Ceramic have metadata that automatically associates them to a data model, which defines the shape and schema of that data, as well as to accounts and other content (e.g. User X liked a post by User Y). Composites aggregate these lower-level data models into higher-level groups for application development. Composites are created by developers in the community and all feed into Ceramic’s ecosystem, making it easy for different applications to reuse and share data.</p><p>As we shift toward Composites, we’ll be sunsetting the previous data models module and discouraging using TileDocument streams.</p> Database <p>There are a few important changes required when running a JS Ceramic node after the ComposeDB release. Every node must now be backed by a SQL database, SQLite or Postgres, that will be used to index the data and construct the database for the data models in your Composite. Each node decides what to index and store in the database based on the models contained in its Composite, which must be passed to the node during development time.</p><p>Ceramic acts as a syncing protocol that maintains your local database state against a global network of documents and interoperable data models, maintained via the same verifiable event streams that have always been at the core of Ceramic—allowing you to trust the integrity of your index.</p> GraphQL <p>Developers only need to use one library, the ComposeDB Client, which provides a GraphQL interface to Ceramic. This client needs to be passed a Composite in order to saturate its own APIs and know which data models you’re using. Once your ComposeDB Client is loaded with your Composite, you can make GraphQL queries and mutations against your Ceramic node. Using ComposeDB will be much easier and more streamlined than building directly with previous developer packages on Ceramic—such as IDX or DID DataStore.</p> Data Model Reusability and Marketplace <p>Composites and their underlying data models are designed to be reusable, making it simple to build complementary and interoperable apps. Apps that reuse each other's Composites create instant interoperability, without any integrations needed. To date, developers have had to manually submit data models to the Registry on Github. Data models are now automatically indexed, enabling easier discovery and reuse. In the first release milestone, getting existing models happens through commands in the ComposeDB CLI, but we’ll follow closely with a UI.</p> Object Capabilities <p>One of the biggest challenges in Web3 is offering the ease of use of Web2—one-click sign-in and user sessions—while also preserving the user’s control of their data. To enable this, we have a new library called “did-sessions” built with CACAO (Chain Agnostic Capability Object), offering a permissions model called<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/capability-based-data-security-on-ceramic/"> capability-based access control</a>. CACAO will integrate with ComposeDB to grant granular permissions to specific models. Permissions open up a range of new use cases, sign in flows, and data access patterns on Ceramic. This includes capability-based permission scoping, which allows a developer to specify which Composites or data models they’re asking permission for.</p><p>The first major use case we’re enabling with CACAO is Sessions. We’ve paired CACAO and did-sessions library with a new DID method, called did:pkh, and the Sign-In With Ethereum specification (with more chains to come). This will allow users to seamlessly sign-in with their wallet and delegate actions (e.g. “liking”) and storage permissions to the developer for time-bound periods.</p> Ceramic Today vs. ComposeDB on Ceramic <br><p>Ceramic Today</p><p>ComposeDB on Ceramic</p><p>DB Type</p><p>Key-Value Store</p><p>Graph Database</p><p>Models</p><p>Account to single JSON object (Data Models)</p><p>Property graph supporting one-to-many relationships (Composites)</p><p>Storage</p><p>TileDocument streams</p><p>Model streams, MID streams</p><p>Indexing</p><p>None</p><p>Indexing by each Ceramic node</p><p>Queries</p><p>Many JS Library Method Calls</p><p>GraphQL Queries</p><p>Clients</p><p>HTTP Client, ModelManager, DID DataStore, Self.ID SDK</p><p>HTTP Client, GraphQL Client</p><p>Accounts</p><p>3ID as default</p><p>did:PKH as default</p><p>Authentication</p><p>All-or-nothing permissions</p><p>Granular permissions per model</p><p>Composability</p><p>GitHub Data Models Registry</p><p>Marketplace for models</p><p>DX</p><p>Patchwork of client libraries</p><p>Streamlined flow and tooling</p><p>UX</p><p>Specific Ceramic sign-in popups</p><p>Familiar, Web3 wallet-native</p><p></p> Milestones for ComposeDB on Ceramic <p>The following milestones represent different releases of ComposeDB on Ceramic. The dates are targets, not commitments. Please join our mailing list or Discord Server to find out when new releases go live.</p> Developer Preview <p>The <a href="https://threebox.notion.site/ComposeDB-on-Ceramic-Developer-Preview-c0032b37a007451683eb3d7a1091db53">Developer Preview</a> will be available for developers who want to familiarize themselves with the new ComposeDB stack. Over the coming months the Ceramic core team will release new versions with improved functionality and documentation.</p><p>Available Early September </p><p>The earliest Developer Preview will offer the CLI and GraphQL Client, Composites, Sign-In With Ethereum, DID-Sessions, and the ability to explore models in the CLI. The core team will provide a Getting Started Guide, high level docs and js-ComposeDB API documentation. </p><p>Limitations: Currently, ComposeDB only supports defining relations between an account and the documents created by this account. Relations between documents and accounts are under development. In addition, there will be no scalability guarantees, no access to historical third-party data, it will not be available on mainnet and there will be no retroactive data availability.<br></p><p>Available Early October at Devcon in Bogota, Colombia</p><p>This release milestone provides simple relations between documents and accounts, enabling developers to test graph models so they can build richer and more engaging applications on Ceramic. </p><p>This version of the preview will offer simple (as compared to the following release) model relations, an improved docs portal with updated API documentation (js-compose, js-did, js-ceramic), Sign-In With Solana functionality and an updated way to index models that doesn’t require developers to restart their nodes. </p><p>Limitations include no access to historical third-party data, no optimization for deeply-nested queries with many relations and, at this time, ComposeDB will allow duplicate relations (e.g. liking the same post twice); therefore, developers will need to build preventative logic.</p><p>Available Late December </p><p>This release enables support for interfaces, allowing developers to evolve their application through extending existing data models, and unifying queries across different data models. This will also make it easier for developers to build shared interfaces with other applications (e.g. an interface for comments) as well as extend models for their app (e.g. adding more fields to a model).</p><p>For example, there could be a generic verifiable credential interface, this interface could be implemented by an education credential and a job employment credential. An application could make a union of these two credentials and seamlessly query across both of them. Verifiable credential MID streams won’t belong to the generic VC interface, but they will belong to more specific data models that implement the verifiable credential interface (e.g. education credential, job employment credential, DAO contribution credential, etc.).</p><p>Developers can expect support for sets, and indexable anchors that enable historical data sync retroactively. Historical data sync will enable a node to connect to the network and sync previous data (before the point in time that the particular node started indexing the data model). Historical data sync also means that if Node B goes down it will still be able to index the data via Node A, allowing historical data to sync between applications that share the same data model.</p><p>Available January 2023</p><p>This release enables developers to build on an open data ecosystem and define the data standards for their app (and others to come) to interoperate. </p><p>At this stage, queries will be executed more efficiently than before (server-side query execution), improvements will come to the dev portal, and easy-to-use node metrics will be available—in addition to self-serve mainnet access. </p><p>Limitations at this stage include multi-node deployments and a lack of hosted node options. </p> Production<br> <p>Available Early 2023</p><p>Developers can build quickly on ComposeDB to offer rich end-to-end user experiences on their apps—providing data models and interoperable data within the Ceramic ecosystem. </p><p>At this point, Ceramic will handle a standard deployment of millions of writes and reads per day, in addition to a UI for searching Composites (data models) and improved Getting Started documentation. A UI for searching data models and Composites will make building with ComposeDB on Ceramic faster than before. Templates for scaled deployments and a hosted infrastructure option will also become available.</p>  💡  Read the <a href="https://threebox.notion.site/ComposeDB-on-Ceramic-Developer-Preview-c0032b37a007451683eb3d7a1091db53">Getting Started Guide</a> to build with ComposeDB and let us know what you think via this <a href="https://m6mc0n6phdp.typeform.com/to/c9XafeHl">2-minute survey</a>

<p>When Apple releases iOS 16 in September, it will debut the highly anticipated Passkey, a new form of security authorization that will allow users to sign into accounts without having to use a password. This effort was announced in May as part of a joint press release by Google, Apple, and Microsoft promoting a “passwordless future” based on new support for FIDO credentials. FIDO credentials are built on a digital standard that uses public-key cryptography to communicate secure authorizations to a user’s account.</p>

<p>While some experts continue to stress the use of password managers to solve the password problem, other developments might quash it entirely by killing the password altogether. This effort gained momentum when Apple, Google, and Microsoft committed to expanding their support for the FIDO standard to accelerate the availability of passwordless sign-ins. Users will soon be able to use two new capabilities for passwordless sign-ins. The first will let users automatically access their FIDO sign-in credentials on devices without re-enrolling their accounts. The second will let users enable FIDO authentication on their mobile devices to sign into an application or website on a nearby device, regardless of the operating system platform or browser they are using.</p>

<p>This contributed byline from Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of FIDO Alliance, details cybersecurity blind spots generated by growing IoT technology adoption. To address these issues, the FIDO Alliance launched FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) in 2021 to tackle two main problems: deployment efficiency and security at the point of onboarding. The main feature of FDO is fully automated device onboarding, which considerably speeds up the previously manual process. FDO also replaces generic password credentials with highly secure cryptographic keys, making the devices considerably more robust against attack.&nbsp;</p>

Truly password-free web services are those that allow logging in via a special USB security key – keyword FIDO2 (Fast IDentity Online 2). The range of compatible web services is still rather thin. It is possible that FIDO replaces passwords or functions as a second factor (2FA, two-factor authentication).</p>

<p>The Indian Payments ecosystem is going through rapid change and advancement. The Reserve Bank of India (Digital Payment Security Controls) Directions 2020 were issued for regulated entities to set up a robust governance structure for such systems and implement common minimum standards of security controls for channels like internet, mobile banking, and card payments, among others. In this paper, we demonstrate how FIDO Authentication represents the best way for organizations to implement simpler, stronger authentication that meets Reserve Bank of India’s Master Direction on Digital Payment Control requirements, while also enhancing the user experience.</p>

 How to take steps to recognise and encourage pro-social behaviours Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>Anyone can create a badging system, if by ‘badging system’ we mean ‘lots of badges for discrete things’. Too often, though, these badges focus on credentialing rather than recognition.</p><blockquote>Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.”</blockquote><blockquote>(<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">What is Open Recognition anyway?</a>)</blockquote><p>We’re so conditioned into getting certificates and trophies for achievement (aka ‘credentials’) that sometimes we have to remind ourselves what we mean by recognition.</p><p>So instead of talking about this in an abstract way, let’s talk about it in the context of the <a href="https://badges.community/">Keep Badges Weird (KBW) community</a>, which currently has over 300&nbsp;members.</p> Identifying pro-social behaviours <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosocial_behavior">Pro-social behaviours</a> are those intended to benefit others, or society as a whole — for example, helping, sharing, donating, co-operating, and volunteering. Within a community, they’re the behaviours that make it an attractive space to belong to, and which encourage its growth and/or development. It’s a central part of the value cycles that underpin the Communities of Practice&nbsp;model.</p>Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>Within the KBW community, we already have a series of fine badges including those shown above. These also happen to be<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wtf-are-stealth-badges-41130a75a1a9"> ‘stealth’ badges</a>, awarded to community members without them actively seeking&nbsp;them.</p><p>The particular pro-social behaviours we have identified with these badges&nbsp;are:</p>  Coming to someone’s rescue — is someone stuck with a problem, or in an awkward situation?  Kicking off a discussion — has someone gone out of their way to prompt discussion or debate on an&nbsp;issue?  Keeping it positive — is there someone who’s done a good job of keeping the community focused on solutions rather than endlessly talking about problems?  <p>People don’t have to reach a high bar of have done something out of the ordinary to earn a badge that recognises a pro-social behaviour. For example, the first badge that most people in the KBW community earn is the ‘Keep Badges Weird’ badge, issued to those who <a href="https://app.participate.com/discussions/introductions/9e0fa7d1-f307-4839-b1c8-5d95472c61a2">introduce themselves</a> in a dedicated thread.</p> Encouraging participation <p>The best badging systems evolve over time with communities. A great example of this is the <a href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/explore/badges">Fedora Linux community</a>, which has a badging system which at this point is around eight years old and contains hundreds of badges. These range from commonplace badges such as making a single contribution to the codebase, through to ultra-rare badges such as overall project&nbsp;leader.</p>Screenshot of Fedora&nbsp;badges<p>It’s interesting to note the different types of badges that are issued within this community:</p>  Content  Development  Community  Quality  Event  Miscellaneous  <p>These categories can emerge over time, and may not even be necessary at all. It’s important to understand that these emergent badge systems are built with community members, not for&nbsp;them.</p> A worked&nbsp;example <p>One of the resources that the KBW community helps maintain is <a href="https://badge.wiki">Badge Wiki</a>, a knowledge base for the entire Open Badges community. While it’s true that anyone with an account can edit the wiki, not so many&nbsp;do.</p><p>So the first thing we did was to create a time for us all to come together and work on it. We call this <a href="https://lu.ma/barn-raising">Badge Wiki barn raising</a>, and we do it monthly. Ideally, there are always new people on this call, as well as those who have been to at least one previous&nbsp;session.</p>Screenshot of Barn Raiser badge, description and&nbsp;criteria<p>The badge that those who come to a session can earn is shown above. This serves several purposes, from validating attendance (for those who need it) through to recognising the contribution they have&nbsp;made.</p><p>But where do we go next? How do we go from a single badge to start building out a badge system around stewardship of this particular resource?</p>Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>Perhaps the easiest place to start is to recognise people turning up on multiple occasions. They don’t have to be consecutive, and it doesn’t need to be the organiser of the session that keeps track. Instead, this could be a claimed badge based on pointing to evidence.</p><p>This kind of approach can be repeated ad infinitum. There’s value in doing so — the Fedora badges system has a badge for people who have performed 10,000 builds! But what else can we recognise and encourage? After all, people contribute to communities (including Open Source communities) in many and varied&nbsp;ways.</p>Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>People also have different interests and talents, so why not recognise those? We chose three types of people from <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiAgent">this helpful list</a> as a way of helping people identifying roles for themselves, and to help people understand that there are lots of different ways to contribute and create value. Every Badge Wiki barn raising call starts with this, as a ritual and routine and a way for people to feel&nbsp;welcome.</p>Image CC BY&nbsp;WAO<p>Even this small demarcation of roles helps in a number of&nbsp;ways:</p>  People can start small and work their way onto bigger&nbsp;tasks  Contributors arrive with varying energy levels, so may be in the mood for different tasks on different days  People can follow their interests as well as their talents for contributing to the&nbsp;project.  <p>Inevitably, even in the first session, those who turned up as contributors to the Badge Wiki barn raising started identifying themselves as ‘FairyGardeners’&nbsp;. That is to say they felt like doing a couple of different things, or mashing up those roles. This is absolutely to be encouraged!</p> Conclusion <p>This has been a brief guide with worked examples of how to create a culture of recognition, taking steps to recognise and encourage pro-social behaviours. WAO don’t have all of the answers, so we’d love to hear from you! Please do comment below if you’ve got examples (or questions)</p><p>Recognition within a community of practice is best as a varied and emergent system, and so our next task is to create badges from these reflections for the <a href="https://lu.ma/barn-raising">Badge Wiki barn raising sessions</a>. If you would like to come along, please <a href="https://badges.community">join the KBW community</a> and turn up for the monthly sessions!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/creating-a-culture-of-recognition-39ffdb6cf943">Creating a culture of recognition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A roundup of previous seasons and a sneak peak into Season 5&nbsp;planning <p>After summer holidays, sunshine and lollipops, we’re getting back into the groove. This includes some thinking and planning around Tao of WAO Season&nbsp;5.</p><p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/">The Tao of WAO is a podcast</a> about the intersection of technology, society, and internet culture — with a dash of philosophy and art for good measure. We <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/announcing-our-new-podcast-e38aaba57066">announced the podcast in May 2021</a>, and since then we’ve been pumping out season after season. We haven’t summed up the previous seasons, ever, so this is a quick post to do that and talk about what we’re planning for Season 5. Don’t want to read about it? <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/">Then just go give it a&nbsp;listen</a>!</p>Our <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tao-of-wao">Soundcloud</a> header Season 1 <p>When we started the Tao of WAO, we weren’t sure what kind of format we wanted to have. We kicked off the podcast talking about cooperatism because, well, we’re a co-op. Over the course of the season we talked about being geriatric millennials, doing digital detoxes and had our first guest, John Evans from <a href="https://code-operative.co.uk">Code Operative</a>.</p> Season 2 <p>We started to hit our stride in Season 2. We kicked off the season with a trailer, and then had great conversations with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamjessklein/">Jess Klein</a> on Ethical Design and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kudzayingwerume/">Kudzayi Ngwerume</a> on Creativity and Movement Building. We also chatted about working remotely, unframeworks and keeping badges&nbsp;weird.</p> Season 3 <p>Our first episode of Season 3 had all the <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-o</a>p folks on. We talked about some of our internal policies around dormancy in the co-op. This was also the season we talked to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerrilemoie/">Kerri Lemoie</a> about Verifiable Credentials, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexworradandrews/">Alex Worrad Andrews</a> about Networks of Networks, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/procter/">Adam Procter</a> about Social Impact Games. When we weren’t interviewing these amazing people, we recorded an episode on Misinformation and used our final episode of the season a somewhat random conversation about stuff we’d been working on and newsletters we like to&nbsp;read.</p> Season 4 <p>Again in Season 4, we managed to have amazing guests. We talked to <a href="https://outlandish.com/person/kayleigh-walsh/">Kayleigh Walsh</a> about Restorative Justice, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heatherleson/">Heather Leson</a> about Opening Up Social Impact Organisations and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryannalexander/">Bryan Alexander</a> about Futurism. In between our guest focused episodes, Doug and I talked about participation in Civic Society, Self-hosting IT and Reentering Events after&nbsp;Covid.</p> Season 5 (coming&nbsp;soon!) <p>You can probably tell from this short summary that we cover a wide variety of social, cultural and techie issues. In the new season, we’re planning to talk about edtech, communities of practice, feminism and more. We’ll have more book recommendations from our guests and more laughs coming soon to wherever you listen to your podcasts.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch! <p>We’re always looking for interesting folks with interesting things to say, so if you’d like to be a guest on the Tao of WAO, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">let us know</a>.

<p>A recent SpyCloud study showed that over 64% of people reuse their passwords. Some experts continue to stress the use of password managers to mitigate this issue, but this could be squashed by eliminating passwords all together. Going passwordless gained momentum in the second half of 2022 when Apple, Google and Microsoft committed to expanding their support for the FIDO standard. FIDO’s work has resulted in the development of FIDO Universal Second Factor (FIDO U2F), FIDO Universal Authentication Framework, and FIDO2- which have been embraced and further utilized by a few of the largest tech companies in the world.</p>

<p>In recent years, developers have been the targets of multiple attacks due to their access to sensitive systems.&nbsp; As the tech giants have begun their collaboration on making the user experience of passwordless better, users still need to register across all their devices.&nbsp;The solution to this is passkeys that allow users to easily and securely access passwordless systems across all devices. The FIDO2 Authentication standards are based on public key cryptography for authentication that is more secure than passwords and SMS one-time passwords. FIDO2 Authentication enables password-only logins to be replaced with secure and fast login experiences across websites and apps.</p>

Next up is Jason Sherman, Developer at <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/energy-mines-and-petroleum-resources">Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust, Government of British Columbia’s Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation</a>.</p>



<p>Give a bit of background on what you’re working on and how you got into blockchain</p>



<p>Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) is a pilot project enabling a collaborative digital ecosystem between the B.C. government, natural resource companies, and organizations around the world, making it simpler and more secure to share sustainability data. I am currently working on EMDT’s technology, called Traction. Traction is basically a layer above Hyperledger Aries&nbsp; Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) that enables the Government of British Columbia to use our technology for line of business applications. This allows the government to onboard into the world of digital credentials easily, and to track their business data with their credential and presentation exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Hyperledger frameworks or tools are you using in your projects? Any new developments to share? Can you sum up your experience with Hyperledger?</p>



<p>We are using Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) and Hyperledger Indy. Using Hyperledger frameworks has increased Traction’s interoperability, making it possible to incorporate a broader range of participants, tools, and technologies into the digital ecosystem EMDT is coordinating. We’re using Hyperledger’s open-source software to accelerate the Government of B.C.’s ability to adopt these tools. My experience with Hyperledger technologies is that things change quickly! And any problem or use case I identify is usually already being addressed.</p>



<p>What do you think is most important for Hyperledger Foundation to focus on in the next year?</p>



<p>I think the Hyperledger Foundation should focus on multiple ledger support (which is already underway) and onboarding users (not developers) of the implemented technology.</p>



<p>What advice would you offer other technologists or developers interested in getting started working on blockchain?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a very steep learning curve, but it’s extremely worthwhile. You will very quickly identify areas where the technology could benefit your clients.</p>



<p>As Hyperledger’s projects continue to mature, what do you see as the most interesting technologies, apps, or use cases coming out as a result?</p>



<p>I am interested in the ability for Hyperledger projects to enable more automated business flows using truly trusted and tamper-proof data. The number of personnel hours that can be saved just through automated conversation and interchange of data programmatically is massive.</p>



<p>What’s the one issue or problem you hope blockchain can solve?</p>



<p>I am hopeful that blockchain has the potential to improve trust between businesses. By exchanging information using blockchain technology and digital credentials, the validity and origin of the credential can always be verified, and businesses can proceed with their interactions confidently.</p>



<p>Where do you hope to see Hyperledger and/or blockchain in five years?</p>



<p>I would hope to see blockchain as a viable and easily selected technology, along the lines of Postgresql or MongoDb. I would hope that blockchain could be adopted as a mainstream technology that development teams can look at as a solution to solve their problems.</p>



<p>What is the best piece of developer advice you’ve ever received?</p>



<p>Your code isn’t precious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What technology could you not live without?</p>

<p>A cyber security breach that unfolded at LastPass – a provider of credential management services – appears to have affected only the firm’s developer environment, and is unlikely to rebound on users, according to community experts, who have praised the firm for its quick and transparent response to the incident. Many providers, including LastPass, are offering and migrating to passwordless logins which use more advanced security technologies such as FIDO2 security keys. This reduces friction for end-users and increases the overall account security.</p>

<p>Our online lives are protected, first and foremost, by passwords. They are a part of our everyday lives and protect our sensitive information in the digital world. However, they aren’t a flawless system of protection, and our lives would certainly be easier without the need for them. Many reuse passwords across accounts or set up very weak ones, easily guessed ones, and the truth is we are under a constant threat of cyberattacks by increasingly savvier hackers. Current basics of online security must ensure there is a high standard of education and password hygiene. From there, there are tools to help reinforce the education, such as password managers, and Single Sign-On (SSO) or Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) options. For a passwordless world, however, there needs to be more. Fast Identity Online (FIDO) technologies support authentication mechanisms, such as biometric face and fingerprint ID and the addition of hardware security keys.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The Universal Resolver is a utility developed by the community at DIF to resolve Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) across many different DID methods, based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C DID Core 1.0</a> and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/">DID Resolution</a> specifications. It is a work item of the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/">DIF Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>, and is provided as a tool to support interoperability efforts and enable testing.</p>
 New DID methods 
<p>We continue to receive great contributions from the community in the form of new drivers as well as updates to existing ones, in order to support as many DID methods as possible. Several more DID methods have recently been added to the Universal Resolver, including:</p>
 
 
<p>did:indy (the long-awaited upgrade of the original did:sov method) - See <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/">https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/</a></p>
 
 
<p>did:cheqd (from the Cheqd community) - See <a href="https://github.com/cheqd/did-resolver">https://github.com/cheqd/did-resolver</a></p>
 
 
<p>did:com (from Commercio Network) - See <a href="https://commercio.network/">https://commercio.network/</a></p>
 
 
<p>did:ala</p>
 
 
<p>Did:everscale</p>
 
 
<p>The Universal Resolver can now resolve 45 DID methods, and more are being added regularly. Visit <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a> to see the full list of supported methods, and visit <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/main/docs/driver-development.md">this github page</a> to contribute a driver for a DID method.&nbsp; In the event of a problem resolving a did or with driver functions, the contributor has 30 days to resolve the issue before the driver and DID method get delisted. This ensures that the list of methods on the Universal Resolver is regularly tested, and remains updated and functional.</p>
<p>For example, try the following commands to resolve DIDs to their DID documents:</p>
<p>curl -X GET <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE">https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE</a></p>
<p>curl -X GET <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:cheqd:mainnet:zF7rhDBfUt9d1gJPjx7s1JXfUY7oVWkY">https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:cheqd:mainnet:zF7rhDBfUt9d1gJPjx7s1JXfUY7oVWkY</a></p>
<p>curl -X GET <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:com:1l6zglh8pvcrjtahsvds2qmfpn0hv83vn8f9cf3">https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:com:1l6zglh8pvcrjtahsvds2qmfpn0hv83vn8f9cf3</a></p>
<p>Or try opening the UI to resolve the above DIDs:</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE">https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE</a></p>

 New hosting environment 
<p>It seems the community has been just as excited about the Universal Resolver as we are, and it has seen traffic grow steadily over the past few months: In order to serve this increased demand the hosting environment of the Universal Resolver has been upgraded and should now be able to handle additional load. DIF's public instance of the Universal Resolver can be reached at <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> and <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind however that this instance is meant for experimentation and testing only, NOT as a production service. It should not be used in situations where a reliable DID Resolution service is needed, or when DIDs are being resolved that are potentially sensitive from a privacy perspective. In general, self-hosting the Universal Resolver, or using other client-side DID Resolution tools, is preferable over relying on the public DIF-hosted instance.</p>
<p>Do you have any interesting applications or examples of where you have used the Universal Resolver? We would love to hear your experiences of it; constructive feedback is always welcome. Get in touch with us directly at <a href="mailto:ops@identity.foundation">ops@identity.foundation</a> or attend one of the meetings of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">DIF Identifiers &amp; DIscovery Working Group</a> to discuss. For further backstory on the Universal Resolver, see this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">blog post</a> and this <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/did-resolution-given-did-how-do-retrieve-document-markus-sabadello-webinar-13/">webinar</a>.</p>
<p>This new-and-improved Universal Resolver joins other tools, such as the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">Universal Registrar</a>, a DIF community-maintained tool to create, update and deactivate Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIF has also recently published <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">version 2 of the DIDComm protocol spec</a> and version 2 of the Presentation Exchange Protocol. Other community tooling includes items like the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/vui-donation/">Verifier Universal Interface</a>, standard APIs to enable interoperability between ID Wallets and Verifier components, and the completed <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree specification</a>, a protocol for creating scalable Decentralized Identifier networks that can run atop any existing decentralized anchoring system and be as open, public, and permissionless as the underlying anchoring systems they utilize. The most popular implementation of Sidetree currently is <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION (the Decentralized Identity Overlay Network)</a>, a layer 2 system.

<p>The Finnish Ministry of Finance has granted the Findynet Cooperative a three-million-euro government grant to build a pilot environment for a self-sovereign identity network. The aim of this public-private cooperation is to strengthen Finland’s leading position in digitalization and support the emergence of investments in new digital services.</p>
<p>The Findynet Cooperative aims to develop a network that ensures that digital wallets developed by different service providers are interoperable, and work seamlessly for both organizations and individuals. Digital wallets enable individuals and organizations to share information about themselves in a reliable and secure manner in various situations. The funding will enable the Findynet Cooperative to develop a common and secure self-sovereign identity network, which can be used to ensure the correctness of information in electronic interactions.</p>
<p>– We are very happy to have received this government grant, which allows us to continue our long-term work with public and private sector actors and build a trust network covering all of society, comments Markus Hautala, Chairman of the Board of the Findynet Cooperative.</p>
<p>The trust network, which will now be built, promotes digital and human-centered data economies. This means that end-users manage their own data and can decide for themselves what information they share about themselves with different parties to preserve their privacy. For example, this exchange of information could involve electronic receipts, credit information, and proof of professional qualifications.</p>
<p>The founding members of the Findynet Cooperative include nine public and private sector organizations: Finance Finland, Finnish Post, Nixu, Nordea Bank, OP Financial Group, Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela), Technology Finland, Tietoevry and Vastuu Group.</p>
<p>The announcement by the Ministry of Finance on the subject can be found <a href="https://vm.fi/-/valtiovarainministerio-myontaa-valtionavustusta-itsehallittavan-identiteetin-luottamusverkon-kehittamiseen">here</a> (in Finnish).</p>

<p>Switchboard provides companies with simple tools to administer decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials for organizations, users, and&nbsp;assets.</p><p>At Energy Web we believe <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/foundational-concepts/self-sovereign-identity">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a> will become a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/digitalization-means-decarbonization-4e4b1af21d63">fundamental pillar of the energy transition</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/how-companies-benefit-from-participating-in-the-public-ew-dos-infrastructure-c7f31735a196">enhancing interoperability</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/how-staking-ewt-increases-cybersecurity-for-energy-grids-and-enterprises-f26bb308bb1a">strengthening security</a> for <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/how-large-is-the-market-for-energy-web-dids-bda42a2848cc.">billions of assets, organizations, and customers</a>.</p><p>Today we’re pleased to announce a major step forward in making this vision a reality with the production deployment of <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/welcome">Switchboard</a> on the Energy Web Chain. This release includes major updates to the front-end Switchboard web application as well as the back-end libraries and components, giving companies access to the full suite features offered by legacy identity access management solutions in a decentralized architecture.</p><p>Why we built Switchboard<br>Digital identity is integral to every facet of the energy sector, from basic administrative procedures (processing customer rebates for smart thermostats, or registering new solar systems) to high-stakes operational tasks (granting access to customer data, or sending control signals to generators). Given the importance of keeping identity data accurate and secure, as well as the risks and limitations of centralized management approaches as energy systems become increasingly diverse and distributed, SSI has emerged as one of the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/decentralized-identity-market-worth-6-822-million-by-2027--exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets-301557216.html">fastest-growing segments</a> of the enterprise IT landscape in recent&nbsp;years.</p><p>We began developing what is now Switchboard in 2019 to address two gaps in the market that were hindering SSI adoption in the energy sector and&nbsp;beyond:</p>  Most SSI solutions are focused narrowly on end-users (individual identity wallets to store credentials) or organizations (platforms to issue credentials to internal users). We saw a need for a harmonized solution that not only addressed both of these requirements but also provided sophisticated features like role-based access control and identity management for non-human actors (i.e. hardware and software systems).  The end-to-end solutions that do exist align with open standards, but are based on proprietary technology, costly contracts, or permissioned back-ends (either private blockchains or centrally-administered databases). We saw a need for a fully open-source, low-cost solution built on a public network and tightly integrated with the Ethereum ecosystem to improve interoperability (e.g. support for multiple wallets) and usability.  <p>The alpha version of Switchboard was <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-unveils-ew-switchboard-2f71bc82daa0">launched on the Volta test network in late 2020</a> with basic tools for users to manage identities and credentials, and for application, developers to define roles and implement simple role-based access control for users. Since then the Energy Web team has overhauled both the user interface and back-end components to turn Switchboard into a comprehensive, enterprise-grade solution.</p><p>What’s new in production?<br>The production release of Switchboard incorporates several exciting new features that are critical for enterprise adoption:</p>  Credential Revocation: Identity and access management is a dynamic process, and when circumstances change they need to be reflected in user credentials. For example, when an employee resigns from the company, access rights need to be revoked in order to keep confidential information secure. Switchboard now offers tools for administrators to manually or programmatically revoke credentials based on customized business&nbsp;logic.  Credential Expiration: To maximize security credentials should never grant indefinite or permanent access to a given system. Just like driver’s licenses and passports, credentials should carry expiration dates and require ongoing renewal processes. Switchboard now allows role definers (e.g. organization administrators) to set default validity periods for credentials, which can be optionally overridden by&nbsp;issuers.  Full Support for Role-authorized Issuance: This feature allows administrators to delegate responsibility for the issuance of certain credentials to other entities based on their role within or relationship to the organization. For example, a user within a utility company who holds credentials to acquire the role of “IT Manager” may then inherit the ability to issue credentials to other internal users, or an external contractor with credentials granting the role of “Solar Hardware Installer” may inherit the ability to issue credentials to new photovoltaic systems. Multi-level hierarchies are now supported (for example, “Solar Hardware Installer” may be issued by “Installation Coordinator”) and the full hierarchy is verified upon each credential presentation.  Credential Issuance Based on Email Verification: Switchboard is currently used to support Energy Web’s staking system, which issues a verified email role credential based on email verification. This role credential is then used to authorize users to stake. (If you have participated in any Energy Web staking pools, you already have a DID with this credential and you can view its status in Switchboard under the “My Enrolments” page.) This functionality is now available for any other credential issuance and authorization use case that requires email verification.  Better Alignment with Verifiable Credentials Standards: We’ve made significant improvements to Switchboard’s underlying libraries and components to better align with new W3C Verifiable Credential Standards. Switchboard now supports the issuance of JSON-LD format Verifiable Credentials using an EIP-712 signature.  Asset Administration: Switchboard allows asset owners to assign identities to individual assets so they can be enrolled in applications and services, or managed throughout their lifecycle. These tools make it easy for owners to prove attributes to external parties and transfer ownership (including tracking ownership history).  <p>What’s next?<br>We’re proud to celebrate the launch of Switchboard as a milestone in Energy Web’s long-term technology roadmap. You can learn more about <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/switchboard/using-switchboard">how it works</a>, and <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">start using it</a>&nbsp;today.</p><p>However, there are many steps ahead in the journey to unlock the full potential of SSI in support of the energy transition. While Switchboard currently offers all the tools necessary to implement SSI in enterprise environments, we will continue to develop additional tools and features across our broader identity and access management stack, including a decentralized <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">universal resolver service</a> for both credential holders and issuers that makes it possible to resolve identity data from any blockchain or database.</p><p>Stay tuned for more announcements, and be sure <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">to follow us</a> for the latest&nbsp;updates.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>Avast (LON:AVST), a company best known for its antivirus and other cybersecurity products for consumers, has joined the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation as a Steering Member. Avast recently acquired Evernym, a founding ToIP Steering Member, and SecureKey, a ToIP Contributor Member since 2020.</p>



<p>Avast’s ToIP Steering Committee member will be Drummond Reed, Director of Trust Services at Avast. Mr. Reed has served as Evernym’s Steering Committee member since the founding of ToIP in May 2020. He currently co-chairs the ToIP Governance Stack Working Group and Concepts and Terminology Working Group and is a vice-chair of the Technology Stack Working Group.</p>



<p>“Avast brings a new perspective to the Foundation’s mission of defining Internet-scale decentralized digital trust infrastructure,” said Mr. Reed. “Avast has a 30 year history of protecting the digital devices of over 435 million consumers. Now Avast wants to extend that protection to individual’s digital identity and relationships online because identity is at the very heart of cybersecurity.”</p>



<p>Avast, headquartered in Prague, is rapidly building one of the largest decentralized digital trust teams in the world. In June of 2021, they hired Charles Walton, a former Mastercard executive (and Mastercard’s original ToIP Steering Committee member), as General Manager of their new Digital Trust Services division. Then in December 2021, Avast acquired Evernym, one of the global leaders in self-sovereign identity (SSI). In March 2022 they announced the acquisition of SecureKey, operators of the Verified.Me network in Canada that is one of the largest bank ID networks in the world.</p>



<p>In a keynote speech at the European Identity Conference in Berlin, Mr. Walton said Avast would be focusing its efforts on the “empowered consumer”—giving individuals the tools they need to have portable, reusable digital identity credentials that do not depend on any one device, operating system, or identity federation. “It is finally time we had digital wallets with digital credentials that work exactly the same way our real-world wallets do,” said Mr. Reed. “We can take and use them anywhere to privately prove just what another party needs to know in the context of a particular transaction. We don’t have to go through any third-party gatekeeper to do this. That’s the way it should work in the digital world too.”</p>



<p>The challenge, of course, is interoperability—the entire raison d’etre of the ToIP Foundation. According to Mr. Reed, this is the reason that Avast intends to participate very actively in advancing the work of ToIP Working Groups. “Avast is a global company, and the #1 challenge in establishing digital wallets and credentials that work around the world is interoperability,” said Mr. Reed. “It is a key focus of the European Digital Identity Wallets initiative as well as other government-sanctioned digital wallet projects. Avast believes that the ToIP stack is the answer, and we want to help drive its completion and adoption as quickly as possible.”For more information about Avast’s digital trust services and products, please visit <a href="https://www.avast.com/digital-trust">www.avast.com/digital-trust</a>.

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>This video shares a talk from the <a href="https://www.scottishaisummit.com/summit-2022">Scottish AI Summit</a>, addressing how best we can support the commercialization of AI technologies to meet real-world needs. 
<p>The University of Edinburgh has programmes to nurture data-driven entrepreneurs at different stages on their journey from the seed of an idea to scaling globally. As well as supporting both technology transfer from academic research and home grown businesses, the University is also attracting high growth global AI start-ups.</p>
<p>In this panel session, Katy Guthrie and Laura Bernal from the University’s Data-Driven Entrepreneurship programme will be joined by founders of some the companies they have supported, across different sectors including MedTech and ClimateTech.</p>
<p>The discussion will focus on the opportunities and challenges for companies using AI, how scaling AI driven business can benefit the people of Scotland and the world and what can be done to stimulate activity and address issues.</p>
 Introductions – (3m:15s) 
<p>Katy Guthrie, the Manager for the University of Edinburgh AI accelerator program commenced the summit by stating the purpose of the panel, which is to explore how best to support the commercialization of AI technologies.</p>
<p>The university has entrepreneurs at different stages on their journey from the seed of an idea to scaling globally, as well as supporting both technology transfer from academic research and home-grown business. The University is also attracting high-growth global AI start-ups.</p>
<p>She introduced the other members of the panel who are founders of AI-driven companies at different stages. They’ve all taken entrepreneurship programs at the university too.</p>
<p>After the introduction, at about 4m:20s Katy listed the topics to be discussed which are:</p>
 
 The role of AI as an enabler. 
 The areas of opportunity. 
 Challenges faced and how well to overcome them. 
 
<p>She describes how they had a recent program that supported 12 AI-driven companies over a period of 6 months and it’s helped companies to build commercial skills, connect them into networks, and to learn from each other.</p>
<p>At 6m:47s Laura Bernal talks about how they supported Ph.D. students and early career researchers who are looking to commercialize IP or research, and that their program helps companies to be more business-minded. They help scientific background people to think about business because they believe academia can have a relationship with industries. She was formerly a founder before she joined the program.</p>
<p>At 8m:14s they are joined by the other panel members introducing themselves and what they do. Xiaoyan Ma, founder and CEO of <a href="https://danurobotics.com/">Danu Robotics</a> introduced herself and talked more about her company.</p>
<p>Then at 9m:00s, she hands over to Lorenzo Conti, a founder and managing director at <a href="https://www.crover.tech/">Crover</a> who talked about his Edinburgh-based startup which focuses on helping grain storage operators like grain merchants, port operators, and cooperatives.</p>
<p>On to Debbie Wake (10m:28s), a medical doctor and clinical academic with the University of Edinburgh. She is also a Co-founder of a digital health company <a href="https://mywaydigitalhealth.co.uk/">MyWay</a>. She gave a brief talk on how they manage conditions like diabetes, drug response and diagnostic prediction as well as how they offer tools to Education platforms.</p>
<p>Joseph Twigg, CEO of <a href="https://aveni.ai/">Aveni</a>, introduces his company (11m:56s), also an Edinburgh-based startup, where they focus on natural language processing, delivering and helping with solutions in the service industries. They derive insight and automation from customer conversation.</p>
 Scaling AI in Scotland 
<p>From 13m:40s Katy moves on to the detail of the discussion, with the main perspective being to identify why it is important to support the scaling of these businesses, which is to boost economic growth and productivity because these companies are creating high-value jobs.</p>
<p>They also support companies that tackle societal issues in Scotland. They have a strong capability in AI in Scotland which is attractive to companies who want to work not just at the University of Edinburgh but in Scotland.</p>
<p>They are often seen as being great at inventing things but not as good as commercializing them. For example from a review it was identified that the UK is ranked third in the world for research in AI but only 11th in its ability to realize Impact from it. So they want to change that and make Scotland seen as an excellent place to build a high-value AI-driven business.</p>
<p>It’s partly about supporting homegrown businesses and also attracting AI start-ups from elsewhere. The key point is about building the ecosystem.</p>
<p>In Scotland, they’ve got lots of big corporates in industries and they need innovative smaller businesses like start-ups that can bring new ideas. Developing and fostering that ecosystem is a key part of what they do at the Bayes Centre of the University of Edinburgh with the data-driven entrepreneurship support program at the university.</p>
 The Role of AI as the Enabler (16m:23s) 
<p>Here Katy asks the panel why they use AI, to explore what role the technology plays as an enabler.</p>
<p>For example at 17m:04s Joseph said he worked in the financial services industry for 15 years and identified a number of potential scenarios for improved efficiencies through using the technology.</p>
<p>Debbie highlights how they didn’t start as an AI business, but rather as an educational web site for diabetes information, and they came to realize how important data was to that process, and it became clear that AI could play a key role in facilitating better personalized access to that data.</p>
<p>For Lorenzo (20m:00s) they were working with a very novel and complex technology that involves hardware locomotion through a very kind of unstable environment data and they employed AI to tackle several technical challenges in a different part of their product, and to reach the required level of performance. In a very efficient way, AI helped them in the prediction of the robot’s movement around the environment, and since then they have employed it in other areas like the accuracy of their sensors.</p>
<p>At 23m:41s Katy asked Laura if she has any other companies looking up to AI for solutions to early-stage academic problems.</p>
<p>In response to this she mentioned a company that didn’t start as an AI company but later employed AI to model how the results of diagnosis will perform and how effectively it could put them to an advantage over their competitors. She said she has seen many companies that are AI-driven and need AI to increase their competitive advantage.</p>
 Finding Opportunities 
<p>Laura takes over at 25m:11s and asks the panel if there are other areas where AI can be applied.</p>
<p>For Xiaoyan it will have a huge opportunity in traditional industries such as agriculture risk management and manufacturing. AI can help people in the space to improve their operational efficiency, profitability, and sustainability, and&nbsp;can help in changing the procurement processes.</p>
<p>For Lorenzo (29m:35s), what is needed for the AI solution to work is assistance on how to manage funding.</p>
<p>There’s a need for access to another company’s customers’ data and regulatory bar set very high to train models (Joseph 32m:58s), and AI also needs to make a product that compensates for the risk companies are taking.</p>
 If you could do something different this time what it be? (Laura 34m:14s) 
<p>According to Joseph, partner selection would be the first thing to do differently, especially in the first critical phase of developing and validating the concept.</p>
<p>Debbie seconds this at 35m:25s, describing their challenge with Information Governance in the NHS, and how bringing in an expert consultancy to address this early on for them would have saved them up to two years of work.</p>
<p>At 38m:00s&nbsp;Laura asks Katy what opportunities she has seen and the ones coming up next. Katy replies that she sees many, in key areas like Natural Language Processing, and that you can view them through a lens of industry vertical or horizontal technology specialisms, and that there is potential to cut across multiple use cases.</p>
<p>She cites an example of a body scanning app that took part in their accelerator, which can be used for e-commerce scenarios where it can be used to match customers sizes to reduce returns, and it can also be used in Healthcare.</p>
 Challenges Faced by AI-Driven Business 
<p>At 43m:45s the panel moves on to the final topic: Challenges Faced by AI-Driven Business.</p>
<p>These include&nbsp;the volume of data (Debbie 44:23), and when dealing with AI there’s high-risk complexity often that brings in regulatory burden, therefore there’s a need for additional research evaluation risk assessment.</p>
<p>Joseph makes a critical point at 45m:42s, that the Scottish startup support ecosystem is great, but it’s not so great when it comes to encouraging large enterprise organizations to work with those startups. For example providing them incentives to choose to work with a local startup vs AWS.</p>
<p>From 49m:18s, Debbie talked about what can help:</p>
 
 Support within the Scottish ecosystem. 
 Support from using wider support. 
 Support from Scottish Enterprise. They support in a lot of ways around market scoping internationally and have amazing networks and obviously the AI accelerator program. 
 
<p>From 51m:58s Lorenzo adds that there’s a need for support programs that truly understand deep hardware innovators, a challenge globally not just in Scotland.</p>
<p>At 54m:45s Katy asks Joseph: Should early-stage businesses worry about the public perception of AI, or should they just get on with making the best possible solutions?</p>
<p>Lorenzo believes it’s a lot to do with perception, that most people assume AI is intelligent robots when really what is in use is the type of business applications improved by algorithms that have been discussed on this panel. Similarly Joseph adds that while AI is used to augmented processes like those in financial services it is still ultimately a decision made by a human.</p>
<p>Debbie also added that though changing public perception is really hard but as SMEs she thinks they’ve got restricted resources as to how to do that. Working with policymakers and bodies to try and support the industry image is a good thing.</p>
 Wrap Up 
<p>At 57m:32s: Katy handed over to Laura to round off the summit.</p>
<p>Laura started by accepting the fact that there are always going to be challenges in the process. Therefore she encouraged us to think about how we could help companies that are developing in AI and how we can start changing that infrastructure to overcome those challenges as an ecosystem in general.</p>
<p>In her closing remark, she said the AI accelerator would be opening applications for their next intake in April to start the program in September. And also if anyone wants to scale an AI company should contact Katy through her LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katy-guthrie-edinburgh/">Katie Guthrie</a>.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNx3f74AmVQ">this video</a> Kate Forbes, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy, delivers a statement to the Scottish Parliament, about transforming Scotland’s tech sector. 
<p>In August 2020, the Scottish Government published the “Scottish Technology Ecosystem Review”, which is a blueprint to establish Scotland as a leading hub for tech start-ups. The report was written by Mark Logan, the former Chief Operating Officer of Skyscanner, which was one of Scotland’s first tech companies to achieve a valuation of more than £1 billion.</p>
<p>Professor Logan’s report was greeted with acclaim on publication. It was described as an “exciting route map for how the government and the private sector can work together to build Scotland into a global leader.</p>
<p>Last October, the Scottish Government invited suppliers to tender for a contract to establish a national network of five ‘tech scaler’ hubs in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Inverness.</p>
<p>The hubs will provide Scottish companies with commercial education sourced from the best providers in the world. That education will be complemented with physical co-location, first-rate mentoring and vibrant peer communities. Through state-of-the-art remote technologies, all of that will be available virtually in every community in Scotland.</p>
<p>Those tech scalers are a game changer. The government has established a new organization named Scottish Teachers Advancing Computing Science (STACS) which helps driving improvements in equipment, teacher training and the curation of best practice. Working with Toni Scullion and Brendan McCart, the government has invested more than £1 million pounds to add to schools’ existing stocks of computing hardware.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government also invested a further £500,000 in the digital skills pipeline, a bespoke set of modular courses running from beginner level all the way through to advanced coding. They provided grant funding of £150,000 to CodeYourFuture, a truly exceptional organization that supports refugees with the skills and networks necessary to progress in education and employment.</p>
<p>The Scottish National Investment Bank has agreed to support the all-female investor group, Investing Women Angels, to establish a new investment fund focused exclusively on women and minority founders based in Scotland. That makes Scotland one of very few European nations with a bespoke seed investment fund focused on stimulating the growth of female-led companies, delivering yet another of Mark Logan’s recommendations.</p>
<p>STACS ensures that there is greater choice for young people in their formal subject choices and informal extracurricular activities. It is a teacher-led organization, which starts with teachers. It aims to provide support and expertise to and promote skills among computing science teachers across Scotland.</p>
<p>Many young people in Scotland are choosing to work and study simultaneously, and a number of tech businesses are already taking advantage of that apprenticeship model. According to the government, work has also started on expanding the young person’s guarantee.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is progressing a number of recommendations specifically around investment and investment funding, to avoid the situation whereby, for a Scottish start-up to expand, grow and develop, it needs to access funding elsewhere. Although no one would dispute that Skyscanner has been a success, some of the recommendations looked at, for example, establishing a series A funding partnership between the Scottish Government, Scottish venture capitalists and external investors; investment vehicles specifically for certain groups, such as female founders.</p>
<p>In the opinion of Kate Forbes, the government has much to do with the 95 per cent of access to broadband that already exists. Clearly reaching the goals of the R100 program it needs to ensure that every property has access to broadband. They will progress that and ensure that it is delivered despite the fact that it is a reserved area and they are stepping into the breach to do that and the work is progressing.</p>
<p>The tech ecosystem fund has supported multiple events for and by women, with more than £160,000 of funding given to Women’s Enterprise Scotland, Female Founder Squad, Mint Ventures and other organizations providing learning and peer networking opportunities and helping to overcome some of the challenges faced by women in tech. There is a clear gender gap in business participation in Scotland. Closing that gap and unlocking the full economic potential of women in enterprise will have a transformative impact on Scotland’s economic performance.</p>
<p>According to Kate Forbes, being able to provide extracurricular activity that creates equity of access to opportunities to learn is so important. The young women are being role models as female founders and in celebrating female computer science teachers, which is critical to all of this. Right now, Education Scotland has a dedicated team that is working with schools and early learning centers specifically to deal with early gender stereotyping and to ensure that that engagement carries on throughout primary school and high school and ultimately into the university years.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is keen to see more small and medium-sized enterprises embracing the opportunities of technology, and that needs to go hand in hand with cybersecurity. In the past, they have provided financial support, such as vouchers, to help SMEs to do that. She has referred to some of the cyber apprenticeships that all goes hand in hand with promoting best practice across the public, private and third sector.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>Speaking at the Barclays Glasgow Campus on 13 July 2022 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon outlines the Scottish Government’s commitment to supporting entrepreneurship and innovation through the launch of the Tech Scalers network. 
 Video Summary 
<p>Barclays will be the host of the Glasgow Tech Scaler hub and that is good news, a further demonstration of how important this campus is going to be not just to Glasgow but to Scotland as a whole.</p>
<p>Over the last few years Scotland’s tech sector has really developed a very strong sense of community, and you can see, hear and feel this. Businesses are constantly sharing and learning from each other’s experiences.</p>
<p>Within the context of the Scottish Government’s overall&nbsp;approach to the economy the establishment of the Tech Scalers are central to the ambition of creating a more entrepreneurial nation, making sure that the commitment to and success in entrepreneurship in a future Scotland is very much chiming with that reputation for enterprise innovation and entrepreneurship that we have down through past generations.</p>
<p>A few months ago, we published the new Scottish government national strategy for economic transformation looking at how particularly we emerge from the Covid pandemic. We want to build a country that is greener, fairer and wealthier for this and generations to come, and to help us achieve those aims that we’ve set very clearly.</p>
<p>There is a need to establish a sense of common purpose among businesses trade unions, government and the many other partners that all need to contribute to building a successful economy and that sense of common purpose is already very striking in the tech and entrepreneurship sectors.</p>
<p>This has been developed in recent years by the likes of CodeBase, FutureX, the Bayes Centre EIE team,&nbsp;as well as by networks like Startup Grind, The Female Founders Squad, the Scottish Games Network and many others besides.</p>
<p>So, it’s something that as government we want to support and encourage across other parts of the economy. In recent years, for example, we funded SCDI to run productivity clubs to bring companies together to learn from each other about how to operate more effectively and how to benefit from new technology. So, it’s a simple but really powerful way of tackling what is one of the biggest issues facing our economy and how do we sustainably increase productivity.</p>
<p>The benefits of that approach where businesses and organizations cooperate and collaborate for a common purpose is already very clear in this sector. In the tech sector, the efforts you’ve made in recent years are already making this sector a very significant Scottish success story. Scottish startups and scale-ups employ more than 135,000 people which is more than anywhere else in the UK outside of London and the south east.</p>
<p>Our universities are recognized rightly as world leaders in areas like data analytics and informatics and we have got enormous strengths as a country in really key areas for the future like AI robotics and FinTech. So we’ve got lots to be proud of we’ve got lots to be enthusiastic and optimistic about.</p>
<p>The sector can still do much better and to illustrate that with just one example in recent years – Scotland has produced three unicorn companies of course valued at more than one billion dollars and two of these have been tech companies. It is something be celebrated but over that same period that Scotland has produced three unicorns, Ireland has produced seven, Estonia ten, Israel sixteen and Sweden thirty five.</p>
<p>Obviously, the creation of unicorn companies isn’t by any stretch of the imagination the only measure of a country’s success but it is a strong indicator and one that we should take seriously. We can and should be doing even more to build on the current strengths that this sector has. Scotland’s ecosystem before the pandemic was closer to this tipping point than at any time in its modern history.</p>
<p>It highlighted that relatively limited interventions by government could help reach that tipping point and it set out what those interventions should be in the three key areas of education, infrastructure and financing. The Scottish government has started implementing these recommendations.</p>
<p>For example, we’ve established a new organization called Scottish Teachers Advancing Computing Science and are designing a new plan for skills development for computer science and teaching. It will help to shape and transform how computer science is taught in our schools. We also establish the tech ecosystem fund which provides support for organizations that help entrepreneurs connect with their peers and with potential investors.</p>
<p>We invited tenders last year to establish the Tech Scalers. The bidding process generated a lot of interest which is really encouraging and has already led to new collaborations between Scottish and international organizations.</p>
<p>The contract has been awarded to CodeBase, who already run a very successful tech incubator in Edinburgh and under the contract they will establish seven Scalers in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling.</p>
<p>These hubs will be delivered in partnership with universities, local authorities and businesses. The Scalers will provide the basic infrastructure but also a complete support service for startups, will offer five separate courses for companies at different stages of development from new startups onwards. The course for advanced companies will include free access to a program called Reforge, which is Silicon Valley’s most prestigious education program for tech startups.</p>
<p>CodeBase have also promised to develop a national calendar of events for the tech community and companies led by women and minorities, currently significantly underrepresented amongst tech startups will be prioritized for entry to the incubators.</p>
<p>These companies will also be given extra support that recognizes the greater challenges they currently face in raising investment and developing peer networks. Supporting entrepreneurship is one of the most important interventions any government can make in an economy, so that’s why the new role Mark Logan is taking up as chief entrepreneurship officer is so vitally important.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is determined to do everything we can to create a more entrepreneurial nation indeed that’s why we’re investing in these tech scalers at a time when we’re facing a tough public spending environment, because we know that by providing the right environment for business government action can help to support a much stronger and more sustainable economy.</p>

<p>While many self-sovereign identity solutions offer tools for individuals, a government team from Canada is using digital trust technology to improve sustainability reporting in the natural resource sector for organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


 
Nancy Norris 


<p>The Government of British Columbia (B.C.) – a Trust Over IP (ToIP) Steering Committee Member – initiated the Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) project under the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation (EMLI) to facilitate the transition to a resilient, clean economy. EMDT’s pilot enables a collaborative digital ecosystem between the B.C. government, natural resource companies, and organizations around the world to improve sustainability reporting using digital credentials. Digital credentials make sustainability reporting more efficient, enhance business-to-business trust, and protect data from manipulation. Digital credentials can be checked in real time, expediting access to trustworthy information. These trusted, verifiable digital credentials are the core digital trust technologies being piloted and the trust ecosystem in which they operate are defined in ToIP architecture, governance, and related documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join members of the open-source community as they share projects, discuss problems, and collaborate on new solutions at three Linux Foundation conferences this September. Attend one of three sessions featuring EMDT’s business application of digital credentials with Nancy Norris, Senior Director of ESG &amp; Digital Trust in the Ministry for Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation for the Government of British Columbia, and Kyle Robinson, Senior Strategic Advisor.</p>

<p>Security threats are always changing and evolving causing us to shift gears into how we can better approach authentication. While there are plenty of authentication methods, the root of the security problem is the password. Traditional MFA solutions have proven to provide little additional assurance and leave companies vulnerable unless they make a change. By eliminating the password, we can eliminate the most common cyber-attack vector. Passwordless MFA (PMFA) is the only way to break this cycle. PMFA is phishing resistant and is core to the Zero Trust model which is part of FIDO2. CISA has endorsed FIDO2 as the gold standard for authentication. By eliminating the weakest part of the security chain, automated attacks are virtually eliminated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The role of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has notably changed since the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Dale Heath, Technology Lead at Rubrik A/NZ, “A holistic security approach – combining infrastructure, cloud and data security (or end-to-end Zero Trust security) – is required to help keep an organisation safe.”&nbsp; “This means bringing together prevention, detection and investigation as well as ensuring data resilience, data observability and data recovery.”&nbsp; The next plan of action is to go passwordless. The industry is on the cusp of replacing passwords and legacy Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) methods with modern open authentication standards, like FIDO2. These standards will enable widespread adoption of phishing-resistant and usable security, and hopefully, will be able to help CISOs to eradicate an entire class of issues that have long been associated with passwords.</p>

<p>The information industry is making a major push to improve identity and access management protocols so that users can obtain the answers they need swiftly and securely. More than 200 companies have joined the Fast Identity Online Alliance, or FIDO, to consolidate resources and support for passwordless authentication. As part of this movement, identity orchestration has emerged as a viable path for companies to put their passwordless plans into action.</p>

<p>In the last few days, the encrypted messaging platform, ‘Signal’ confirmed a variety of their customers fell victim to the phishing attack on Twilio. It is estimated that 1,900 were affected by the breach via phone number and SMS verification links to “reset passwords” on a phony Twilio link. By posing as Twilio’s IT dept, the hackers were able to obtain victim’s login credentials. Unfortunately, it is still unclear who was behind this attack. Cloudflare also revealed they were subjected to a phishing attack around the very same time as Twilio, but was not breached as an end result owing to the corporation-vast use of hardware-centered, FIDO2-compliant multi-factor authentication (MFA) keys.</p>

   University of Essex is proud to publish a report, and an accompanying workbook, created with the support of The Engine Room, which outline the ethical considerations that should be taken into account when conducting open source investigations for human rights advocacy or legal accountability. 
The post Ethical considerations for open source investigations first appeared on The Engine Room.

<p>Today, human rights abuses are often documented as they happen and quickly shared with others around the world: war is streamed live through digital communications technologies. Protesters carry cameras into the streets and film arrests or the misuse of teargas. Perpetrators share videos of violence in messaging groups. All of this is possible through cheap camera sensors in mobile telephones that allow their owners to film and share videos on social media platforms thanks to high-speed internet connections. The collection, analysis and publication of this information – and other digitally mediated data like satellite imagery and social media profiles – by journalists and human rights investigators has become known as open source investigations. This investigative technique has grown in prevalence over the past decade. Collecting videos and photographs of possible human rights abuses or violations of the laws of war is now part of the researcher’s methodological toolbox. Yet all too often, the collection, verification and use of open source information can happen without thinking through all the ethical considerations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March, the <a href="https://twitter.com/HRBDTNews/status/1509458926022107139" title="Human Rights, Big Data and Technology Project">Human Rights, Big Data and Technology Project</a> (University of Essex) published a report, and an accompanying workbook, created with the support of The Engine Room, which outline the ethical considerations that should be taken into account when conducting open source investigations for human rights advocacy or legal accountability. </p>



<p>The report outlines a <a href="http://repository.essex.ac.uk/32642/" title="report outlines a Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) to open source investigations">Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) to open source investigations</a> that tries to ensure that human rights organisations do not adversely affect the enjoyment of the human rights they seek to protect. The accompanying <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U0Yo0PFkOmk-G3myU--taiNN3wrRUkte7LeEtmBbE9c/edit#heading=h.greuez2wswie" title="Responsible Open Source Investigations Workbook">Responsible Open Source Investigations Workbook</a> is designed to support the human rights researcher using open source information to make the best possible judgements in the particular context they are working in.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 
 <a href="http://repository.essex.ac.uk/32642/">Read the report</a> 



 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U0Yo0PFkOmk-G3myU--taiNN3wrRUkte7LeEtmBbE9c/edit#heading=h.greuez2wswie">Read the workbook</a> 
 



<p></p>



<p>While we have reason to appreciate the increased visibility of serious international crimes that warrant investigation, these probes come with difficult decisions and raise human rights and ethical challenges. The appeal of open source investigations in allowing investigators to map violations across time and space pull these concerns to the fore. Open source research can, for example, uncover the identity of witnesses, victims or perpetrators and the location of a crime in near real time, potentially placing these people at risk. Open source research relies on the collection and analysis of large data sets that create and expose patterns in data. Human rights investigators and their organisations not only need to be aware of the ethical challenges this form of research presents; they also must consider and integrate their responses to them as they plan, execute and make public their research.</p>



<p>We hope this report and workbook offer material to open source human rights investigators and other organisations applying such an approach to their research, with discussion points that ensure that this rapidly-developing field always remains focused on the victim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Zara Rahman and Gabriela Ivens highlight in the <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/digital-witness-9780198836070?cc=nl&amp;lang=en&amp;" title="book Digital Witness">book Digital Witness</a>, “the end mission of defending human rights and revealing rights violations means that investigators should be particularly cautious about their actions and understand the responsibility they carry. In essence: human rights should not be violated during the process of a human rights investigation”.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I only discovered Kim Cameron’s seminar article on the seven laws of identity many years after it was published, it felt as current as anything new I was reading when I first began studying identity. Going through his thought-provoking blog posts about identity and privacy also provided me with ideas and considerations that I could not find anywhere else. As a result, I am deeply honored to be one of the first recipients of the award in his honor in recognition of my work in this field.</p>
<p>My journey with digital identity began as a back-end web developer who was curious about how the systems I was helping to build handled users’ passwords, as well as having to implement single sign-on using SAML. Many years later, when I began pursuing a PhD, my advisor suggested that I specialize in electronic identity at our very first meeting. After reading numerous books, papers, protocol specifications, and implementations, I am now researching quantum-safe IAM protocols and self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>One of my first thoughts while attending the conference was how excited I was to meet the giants who wrote the protocols I have been studying and actively implementing in my academic research. However, Identiverse provided me with much more. The opportunity to (physically) reach out to many like-minded people outside of academia who are interested in the challenges of security and privacy in IAM is perhaps the most valuable outcome.</p>
<p>Furthermore, learning about the most recent developments in the OIDC working groups FAPI, eKYC &amp; IDA, and SSE, as well as the work on the OAuth side of the force with OAuth 2.1, PKCE, and RFCs 9068, 9126, and 9207, was extremely beneficial. Furthermore, it was only through attending Identiverse that I discovered that a sizable portion of the IAM industry is focusing on multi-factor authentication, which surprised me because I assumed this was already well established.</p>
<p>I am grateful to the OpenID Foundation for this incredible opportunity and eager to collaborate with the identity community.</p>

<p>In this guide you will learn how to configure and run a Ceramic node for development in AWS. AWS is not the only cloud provider you can use to run a Ceramic node, but we will cover the other major providers in a separate blog post. The general steps are going to be the same regardless of cloud provider, so you could adapt what you read here for your favorite cloud.</p><p>This post will cover running a Ceramic node in <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/run/nodes/nodes/#things-to-know">bundled mode</a>, which is suitable for development and testing purposes.</p> Prerequisites <p>Before you can run a Ceramic node on AWS you’ll need a few things.</p>  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/account/">AWS Account</a>. Although billing information is required to create an account with AWS, this post will make use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&amp;all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&amp;awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&amp;awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all">AWS Free Tier</a> services to minimize cost  Basic understanding of the <a href="https://linuxcommand.org/">Linux Command Line</a>   Preparing AWS for Ceramic <p>Once you have an AWS account you will need to configure a few things in AWS so that your Ceramic node can be accessed.</p><p>You will be creating a Linux EC2 instance, which you will then connect to using SSH. The recommended way to do this through AWS is to configure and use an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console">Amazon EC2 Key Pair</a>.</p><p>If you already have a key pair you wish to use you can head directly to the Configuring Security Groups section.</p> Creating a key pair <p>Step 1<br>From the AWS Management Console use the search bar to locate the EC2 Key Pair Feature page by typing in <code>key pairs</code> and selecting the corresponding EC2 Feature.</p><p>Step 2<br>Click the Create key pair button in the top right corner of the page.</p><p>Step 3<br>Configure the new key pair with the following options:</p>  Name: ceramickeypair  Key pair type: RSA  Private key file format: <code>.pem</code>  If you are using a Windows machine select <code>.ppk</code> and make sure you have <a href="https://putty.org/">PuTTY</a> installed  Tags: you do not need to add any tags, but you can if you’d like to organize your resources  <p>Once you have those options selected click the Create key pair button.</p><p>You should be prompted to download the newly created key pair file. Save it somewhere that you will remember.</p><p>You will need this in a future step so don’t lose it!</p><p>You should now have a key pair populated in the management console as well as downloaded to your local machine.</p><p>This will be the private key used when connecting to the EC2 instance we will create using SSH.</p> Configuring Security Groups <p>The next thing you will need is an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.">AWS Security Group</a> for your soon-to-be-created EC2 instance. Security groups act as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances. To reach your Ceramic node you will need to have the proper ports configured in a security group.</p><p>Step 1<br>From the AWS Management Console use the search bar to locate the EC2 Security Groups Feature by typing <code>security groups</code>.</p><p>Step 2<br>You will most likely see a default security group. You can ignore this security group for now.</p><p>Click the Create security group button in the top right corner of the page.</p><p>Step 3<br>Configure the new security group with the following parameters:</p><p>Basic details</p>  Security group name: ceramicservers  Description: allow access to Ceramic services  VPC: Leave as default unless you have a more complex AWS environment  <p>Inbound rules</p><p>Rule 1:</p>  Type: Custom TCP  Port range: 7007  Source: Anywhere-IPv4  Description: Ceramic port  <p>Rule 2:</p>  Type: SSH  Source: Anywhere-IPv4  Description: SSH port  <p>Outbound Rules</p>  Leave as default  <p>Tags</p>  Leave as default  <p>Once you have filled in these configuration options click the Create security group button.</p><p>You should now see the newly-created security group in the management console.</p> Creating a Ceramic Node <p>Now that all of the AWS environment setup is complete it's time to begin building a Ceramic node in the cloud.</p> Creating an EC2 Instance For Ceramic <p>Step 1<br>From the AWS Management Console use the search bar to locate the EC2 Service by typing <code>EC2</code> and selecting the corresponding service.</p><p>You should now be able to see the associated EC2 Resources that you set up in previous steps. If you are working from a new AWS environment you will see that there is 1 key pair and 2 security groups.</p><p>If you do not see these resources, ensure that you are viewing the proper region. Sometimes the AWS Management Console will display resources from different regions and can make it appear as though resources are missing when they are in fact in a different region.</p><p>Step 2<br>Below the Resources box you will see a Launch instance section. Click the orange Launch instance button in this section and select Launch instance from the drop down menu that appears.</p><p>Step 3<br>You are now ready to begin configuring an EC2 instance for your Ceramic node. This screen can seem a little daunting with all the options, so take extra care to configure options properly before launching your instance.</p><p>Improper configuration could result in charges to your AWS account. 3Box Labs and the Ceramic Network are not responsible for any charges you incur while working with cloud resources. Please double check all your work and understand the AWS billing process before proceeding.</p><p>Configure your EC2 instance with the following options:</p><p>Name and Tags</p>  Name: Ceramic  <p>Application and OS Images</p>  AMI: Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) - Kernel 5.10, SSD Volume Type (Free tier eligible)  Architecture: 64-bit (x86  <p>Instance Type</p>  Instance type: t2.micro (free tier eligible)  <p>Key pair</p>  Key pair name: ceramickeypair  <p>Network Settings</p>  Firewall: Select existing security group  Common security groups: ceramicservers  <p>Configure Storage</p>  1x: 15gb  GiB: gp2  <p>Advanced details</p>  default  <p>Once you have added these configuration details, set the Number of instances to 1 and click the orange Launch instance button located at the bottom of the Summary</p><p>Step 4<br>The Launch an instance page should now have a button that allows you to View all instances. Click the View all instances button to continue.</p><p>You will now see a new EC2 instance named Ceramic Server running in your environment.</p><p>In the next section you will connect to this instance and configure your Ceramic node.</p> Connecting to The Newly Created EC2 Instance <p>Connecting to this newly created EC2 instance will vary based on your operating system. If you are using Windows you will need an SSH client, such as <a href="https://putty.org/">PuTTY</a>. If you are using Linux or MacOS you will be able to use the built-in SSH client located in the Terminal.</p><p>The instructions that follow will only cover the Linux and MacOS terminal. Once connected to the instance all commands and steps will be the same regardless of which operating system you are using.</p><p>Step 1<br>In the AWS Management Console select the Ceramic Server EC2 instance and click on the Connect button located near the top of the screen.</p><p>After clicking the Connect button select the SSH client tab to see the connection instructions for your instance. Your details will be different from what you see in the screenshot below since AWS populates this information dynamically.</p><p>Step 2<br>This step will guide you through the instructions located on the SSH client tab of the Connect to instance page.</p><p>Open your terminal and locate the key pair file you downloaded in Step 3 of the <a href="https://hackmd.io/ahqZ7_OeRp2f7vAKQyOP_Q#Preparing-AWS-for-Ceramic">Preparing AWS for Ceramic</a> section, it should be named <code>ceramickeypari.pem</code> if you followed along with the earlier steps.</p><p>This file may also have a <code>.cer</code> extension. This is perfectly fine and can be treated as a <code>.pem</code> file.</p><p>In this example the <code>ceramickeypair.cer</code> file is located in the Home directory of the logged in user.</p><p>When you download this file from AWS it downloads with improper permissions for use. If you try to use this file with your SSH client you will see an error explaining that the file has too many permissions to be used safely. Let’s fix that now by reducing the permissions granted to this key file.</p><p>In the terminal run the following command:</p><p><code>chmod 400 ceramickeypair.cer</code></p><p>There will be no output from this command, but if you inspect the permissions you should now see that this file is only able to be read by the owner. <a href="https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php">Learn more about file permissions</a>.</p><p>Now that your file permissions are properly restricted, use your terminal to connect to your EC2 instance. The connection information can be found in the example at the bottom of the Connect to instance page you opened above in Step 1. Your details will differ from what you see below.</p><p><code>ssh -i "ceramickeypair.cer" ec2-user@ec2-54-215-186-11.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com</code></p><p>When prompted to accept the fingerprint, type the word <code>yes</code> to continue connecting to your instance.</p><p>You should now see the terminal change to reflect that you are connected to the EC2 instance.</p><p>You are now connected to your EC2 instance using SSH. Any commands you run inside this terminal will execute on the remote instance located on AWS.</p> Installing Ceramic Dependencies <p>Step 1<br>When you launch a fresh AWS instance, it’s always a good practice to start by updating the package manager. This Amazon Machine Image(AMI) uses <a href="https://linuxconcept.com/yum-package-manager-a-complete-guide/">yum</a> as its package manager. To update the packages on the system run the <code>update</code> command as an administrator. In this case we will add the <code>-y</code> flag to skip being prompted if we are sure we want to apply the updates.</p><p><code>sudo yum update -y</code></p><p>There will be an overwhelming amount of information on the screen after you enter this command. The most important piece is at the end where the result of the command says complete and you have control of your prompt once more.</p><p>Step 2<br>One great thing about cloud computing is that the virtual machines provided for use are slim and often do not contain unnecessary software.</p><p>One downfall about cloud computing is that the virtual machines provided for use are slim and often do not contain the necessary software for our use case!</p><p>For a Ceramic node, your server will need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">NodeJS</a> version 16 installed on it. The simplest way to manage different version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">NodeJS</a> is through the use of a tool called [Node Version Manager(NVM)].</p><p>To download and install NVM on your EC2 instance run the following command in the terminal:</p><p><code>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash</code></p><p>It is important to note that NVM is frequently updated, you should always check the GitHub repository to ensure you are getting the most up-to-date version of NVM. This guide will NOT be updated as NVM versions change.</p><p>Once you see the information about what was added to the <code>.bashrc</code> file, NVM has been successfully installed.</p><p>However if you try to run NVM right now the terminal will display an error telling you the command <code>nvm</code> is not found.</p><p>To fix this error you need to “source” the <code>.bashrc</code> file to reload it into the current terminal session. Use the terminal to accomplish this. There will be no output from this command.</p><p><code>source .bashrc</code></p><p>Now if you type <code>nvm</code> into the terminal you should be greeted with the help text for this command.</p><p><code>nvm</code></p><p>Using NVM, install NodeJS Version 16.</p><p><code>nvm install 16</code></p><p>Your instance is now set up and ready to run Ceramic. Let’s get Ceramic running next!</p> Install and Run Ceramic <p>If you’ve made it this far then rejoice… the hard parts are over! Now you simply need to download and run Ceramic, and your AWS Ceramic Node will be fully accessible for your application.</p><p>Step 1<br>Use NPM to install the Ceramic daemon.</p><p><code>npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli</code></p><p>The amount of output from this command will be overwhelming; however, near the bottom of the output, you should see a message telling you that new packages have been added to your system.</p><p>Step 2<br>Run the Ceramic daemon to make this a usable Ceramic node.</p><p><code>ceramic daemon</code></p><p>Since you are running Ceramic in bundled mode, the output of this command will contain information about IPFS, to include peer discovery as well as Ceramic configuration information. When you see the message saying “Ceramic API running on 0.0.0.0:7007” you are ready to go.</p><p>Congratulations, you now have a Ceramic node running on AWS!</p><p>As you may have guessed, this is not an ideal setup. If you disconnect from this terminal session, shutdown the EC2 instance or perform many other tasks this process will terminate and your Ceramic node will be unreachable.</p><p>You may want to look into creating start-up scripts for your instance to ensure that the Ceramic daemon runs when the instance starts.</p> What’s next? <p>The only thing left is to connect to your instance using a Ceramic client.</p><p>Example using the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/javascript/http">Ceramic HTTP Client</a>:</p> <code>import CeramicClient from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
const API_URL = 'https://yourceramicnode.com' //AWS Public IPv4 info
const ceramic = new CeramicClient(API_URL)

</code> <p>Example using the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-glaze">Glaze CLI</a>:</p> <code>glaze config:set ceramic-url http://&lt;AWS Public IPv4&gt;:7007
</code>  Summary <p>You have now configured a Ceramic node in AWS that is accessible to anyone you share the IP Address or DNS address with.</p><p>It’s important to remember that Ceramic in bundled mode is intended for development purposes. Similarly to cloud providers other than AWS, future blog posts will guide you through setting up a node for production purposes.</p><p>Stay tuned for more Ceramic guides and tutorials.

 Our 20 Year Journey 



<p>Like many provinces and territories in Canada, British Columbia (BC) has a long history of providing secure access to online government services. We started our journey 20 years ago with the introduction of BCeID, a simple username and password solution. A lot has changed since then!</p>



<p>Today, we are investing in Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and a digital wallet. We see these as the cornerstones in the evolution of our digital strategy, adding a much needed layer of trust to the digital economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to share what we are doing, why we focus on interoperability and open-source, and why we are excited about VCs being our natural next step.</p>



 Why We Care 



<p>As a public sector organization, BC has a strong interest in seeing the adoption of technologies that are secure, privacy-preserving, and convenient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital is obviously everywhere. In 2021, 94% of BC citizens said they are online, and 90% of Canadians have smartphones. Also, according to the Business Council of Canada, in the last decade Canada’s digital economy grew 40% faster than the overall world economy.&nbsp; In Digital ID terms, this growth is an opportunity to make people’s online lives easier and safer.</p>



<p>We also know that cybersecurity threats are growing and there are no signs of it slowing down. BC sees an astonishing 496 million unauthorized access attempts per day – that’s 5,741 every second! Identity theft and fraud also continues to rise. We need digital trust solutions that counter this increasing risk.</p>



<p>In responding to this new reality, we recognize that people are familiar and comfortable with the many credentials that governments issue today. Things like physical copies of drivers’ licenses, health cards, passports, permits, and reports are widely accepted and trusted.&nbsp; In BC, we are building on that trust and moving towards providing the same things digitally. We are also enabling confidential connections through the wallet to give people choice and confidence in their digital lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 BC’s Approach&nbsp; 



<p>Clearly, digital trust goes far beyond just the government. Canadians expect more access, with greater security, to high-value services in both the public and private sectors. VCs and the wallet provide a highly flexible way to achieve that goal.</p>



<p>Collaboration is critical to achieving that goal and it’s important to us. BC’s Chief Information Officer, CJ Ritchie, strongly advocates for us working together to meet the expectations of Canadians.&nbsp; She notes, “If we don’t all act together to deliver solutions that protect privacy and interact securely, trust will erode and there will be negative impacts for businesses, people’s livelihoods, and the broader digital economy.”</p>



<p>As our approach evolves, we also remain keen to support open source solutions that interoperate with other national and international efforts. There is no dominant design yet, no one network or technology, so we must remain nimble and flexible in our exploration. We also need to coexist with existing identity solutions that millions of British Columbians already rely upon.</p>



 Technology Interoperability 



<p>In exploring VCs, BC is contributing to solutions that allow agents to verify credentials from multiple networks. Indeed, through one of our Code With Us initiatives, DID indy, we contributed over 11,000 lines of open-source code to support and prove the viability of a “network of networks”.</p>



<p>We also are focused on the interoperability of Hyperledger Aries agents themselves, another key success metric.&nbsp; We are leading contributors to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH)</a>, open-source software that runs a series of Hyperledger Aries interoperability tests and delivers the results to the <a href="http://aries-interop.info/">AATH website</a>. Great interoperability requires that we test—and re-test!—that interoperability on a regular basis.</p>



<p>__</p>



<p>Side note: If you want to test the interoperability of any Aries agent with this ecosystem, please sign up to join the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/event/hyperledger-aries-interoperability-event">Hyperledger Aries Interoperability Event on August&nbsp; 31</a>.</p>



<p>__</p>



 Driving Adoption 



<p>In BC we have a lot of technical skill in working with VCs and with Hyperledger Aries agents. However, for VCs to be successful, it needs to be easy for others to join in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the agents side, to complement our extensive contributions to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py)</a> and other Aries and Indy projects, we also contribute to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript">Hyperledger Aries Framework Javascript (AFJ)</a>, the agent commonly used for mobile digital wallets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why, when thinking about mobile digital wallets, we opted to contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native">Hyperledger Aries Bifold</a> project, helping it also essentially become “Bifold as a framework”. Bifold uses AFJ, and BC and others can use it to easily deploy a custom-designed digital wallet. Jurisdictions within Canada and elsewhere in the world are already taking this approach for their own wallet explorations. It’s an open-source stack right the way down.</p>



<p>VC adoption will be helped by a thriving open-source community, and we are giving back wherever we can.</p>



 Open-Source Success 



<p>We believe the community’s success becomes our success. For years we’ve been committed to open-source, interoperable solutions in this space. Our approach is always evolving, but our contributions and commitment to various digital trust open-source projects and technologies continue.</p>



<p>We hope that even more organizations will join in and contribute. Our goal in BC is a new layer of trust for the internet, making it easier for people to work and play online with confidence.&nbsp;</p>

 By <a href="https://medium.com/u/61f092fa8507">Michal&nbsp;Bacia</a> <p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/global-threat-report/">According to security analysts, nearly 80% of cyberattacks are identity-based</a>. In these attacks, bad actors steal administrators’ usernames and passwords or issue fake credentials to themselves. With credentials in hand, unauthorized parties can infiltrate enterprise information technology systems and go undetected for long periods of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Many of these attacks can be prevented via security architectures that embrace decentralized authentication and authorization of users and assets. These architectures, based on decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs), can unlock value across many segments of the global economy. But the energy sector, in particular, stands to benefit greatly. The number of energy sector assets (e.g., electric vehicles, smart inverters, batteries) and actors interacting with them is growing exponentially. A centralized, “Web 2” approach to digitizing these assets and their users (creating a centralized data silo and a super administrator of the silo) is expensive, fragile, and creates lucrative honeypots for malicious actors to attack. At Energy Web, we believe a more effective solution is to embrace a decentralized architecture for user and asset authentication and authorization.</p> The role of verifiable credentials <p>A critical component of any security architecture is the process by which users’ credentials are verified in order to be assigned specific roles. As shown below, when a user with a <a href="https://www.bcdiploma.com/en/blog/blockchain-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credential</a> presents it to a verification service, the service validates the VC and issues an access token. As shown in figure 1, this token can be used to unlock access to smart contracts on a blockchain or to perform certain roles using legacy information technology infrastructure.</p>Figure 1 | Security architecture process to verify credentials to specific&nbsp;roles<p>Conducting this verification process is not computationally intensive and has a binary outcome: whether the VC is valid (cryptographically signed by the authorized issuer) or not. There are several ways to conduct the verification process. It can be performed internally by an organization or via a third-party service provider. These traditional, centralized options create a single point of vulnerability since the verification service itself can be compromised, approve false VCs, and (inadvertently or not) whitelist attackers.</p> A decentralized verification service is a far better&nbsp;solution <p>As shown in figure 2, a decentralized verification service uses a diversity of nodes to perform the verification task independently and then reach a consensus about the outcome with other nodes on the same system. In this setting, validator nodes vote on whether or not a VC is valid. If consensus is reached, the user presenting the VC will be whitelisted or receive an access&nbsp;token.</p>Figure 2 |Decentralized verification service With a decentralized verification service, each node is required to stake economic value in order to verify VC presentations and earn&nbsp;rewards <p>Only honest nodes receive rewards. Misbehaving nodes that vote against consensus are penalized by having their stake reduced or removed entirely (for an overview of staking and “slashing” mechanisms on different blockchain-based networks, check out this explainer). The most practical way to implement this mechanism is to use public blockchains, paired with cryptocurrency, for staking and distributing awards to nodes performing the verification work. By doing so, the execution of the verification mechanism is completely automated, immediate, and impartial. This is a far better solution than relying on an opaque, centralized entity and/or process to perform the same verification service.</p><p>Under the decentralized architecture described here, honest nodes can sound an alarm if they don’t agree with the consensus. They receive the stake from misbehaving nodes in case they can prove wrongdoing. Attackers in this setting need to either a) hack each node individually or b) bribe all nodes needed to reach the consensus. The cost of bribing the nodes is equal to N*S+N*N*S, where N= number of nodes and S = stake of one node. Bottom line = more economic value staked across more nodes, more security.</p>Figure 3 | Decentralized verification service<p>Furthermore, consensus requirements can change based on the value of the VC itself. For high-value transactions or important access rights, consensus may require several rounds of voting. For VCs with relatively lower values, only 10% of nodes, for example, may need to approve the&nbsp;VC.</p><p>In summary, decentralized VC authentication powered by public blockchain and cryptocurrency shown in figure 3 can produce significant business benefits for enterprises in comparison to Web 2-based approaches to authentication and authorization. Don’t take our word for it: multiple Energy Web member companies have recently confirmed that public blockchains present a superior way to securing energy infrastructure and internet-connected devices alongside the findings of many research papers on the subject such&nbsp;as:</p>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8355182">Blockchain: A game changer for securing IoT&nbsp;data</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8605485">Secure IoT Communication using Blockchain Technology</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8012302">Can Blockchain Strengthen the Internet of&nbsp;Things?</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9013413">Cloud-Based Secure Service Providing for IoTs Using Blockchain</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7828539">Securing Smart Cities Using Blockchain Technology</a>   Cybersecurity through staking on Energy&nbsp;Web <p>Currently, Energy Web is working in partnership with Parity Technologies (the company behind Polkadot, Kusama, and Substrate) to design, build and launch the Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain, a public blockchain tailored to enterprises. The new blockchain is designed explicitly around the VC verification process described in this post. Our aim is to enable decentralized authentication and authorization for any energy company in any regulatory environment in a way that integrates with existing enterprise information technology systems.</p><p>Since identity management is a foundational component of this new blockchain, Validators on the new network who perform the decentralized VC verification service will be required to stake Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in order to secure the service and the network. In this way, all identity-related processes, together with other blockchain transactions, will be secured by the combined economic value of all <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dSLA-Lightpaper.pdf">EWT staked by Validators and their&nbsp;Patrons</a>.</p><p>With this staking mechanism in hand, the Consortia Relay Chain will unlock security solutions that are impossible to achieve using a centralized, Web 2 paradigm. It will provide unparalleled cybersecurity alongside a robust, flexible DID infrastructure for identity and access management.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers.</p><p>Our solutions for enterprise asset management, data exchange, and Green Proofs, our tool for registering and tracking low-carbon products, are underpinned by the Energy Web Chain, the world’s first public blockchain tailored to the energy sector.

 More system convening, community recognition and a dose of whimsy and weirdness <p>Thanks to <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>, we were able to take part at <a href="https://www.thebadgesummit.com/">Badge Summit 2022</a> in Boulder, Colorado earlier this month. The <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/feed">Keep Badges Weird community</a> was well represented! We had so much fun seeing KBW community members and having the opportunity to bond. There were great conversations, new ideas and connections and some table tennis tournaments.</p><p>In the lead up to Badge Summit, we had three goals for our participation.</p> 1) Make sure people in the Keep Badges Weird community felt respected and recognised <p>A healthy community is one in which people feel like they belong. Belonging comes from connection. Finding ways to help people connect and share is what community building is all&nbsp;about.</p><p>We wanted to do something special for people who have been working to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/keep-badges-weird-is-about-breaking-boundaries-42afb0415826">legitimise badges</a> and recognition for a long time. We have <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wtf-are-stealth-badges-41130a75a1a9">a stealth badge</a> (that isn’t so stealthy anymore) called “the O.G.”. It is a badge issued to people who have been involved in open badges since before January 2017. We invited people who earned the O.G. badge to a rooftop party on the Sunday evening before Badge Summit. Then in the most meta-badge fashion ever, we gifted these O.Gs a hat with a badge with a badge on a&nbsp;hat.</p>All the&nbsp;swag<p>We also gave out iron-on patches of the other stealth badges, Keep Badges Weird stickers and a “I kept badges weird at Badge Summit”&nbsp;badge.</p><p>A community shouldn’t only recognise members through badges and swag, though. At the party and throughout the few days we were together in Boulder, we spent time together! Swag doesn’t substitute the recognition we can give one another through our conversations and attention.</p><p>We’re so excited to hear what people in this community are working on and to find ways to collaborate. We were reminded at how important in real life events are when you’re trying to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">change the world</a>&nbsp;;)</p> 2) Help potential community members join and be able to interact with the community <p>A community needs to have low barriers to entry. It should also help people see themselves as part of something bigger. In KBW, we want to help members find meaningful contribution or reliable resources or whatever else they’re looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>We hosted two sessions designed to demystify some of what this community is working on. In the first, Wikis for Community Defined Skill Frameworks, we collaborated with KBW community members <a href="https://twitter.com/donpresant">Don</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/capt_info">Justin</a>. The session helped people understand the need for <a href="https://www.openskillsnetwork.org/rsd">Rich Skill Descriptors</a>. It got attendees writing RSDs through a collaborative exercise that helped participants connect.</p>Drawing of the session from KBW member <a href="https://twitter.com/CateTolnai">Cate&nbsp;Tolnai</a><p>Our second session, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/keep-badges-weird-helping-people-understand-the-badges-landscape-79cc8cf7281">Keep Badges Weird: helping people understand the badges landscape</a>, felt like a big success. Our idea to explain Badge Pathways with the help of a pizza metaphor went well. At Badge Summit there were lots of interesting questions and a discussion around <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>. We had lots of&nbsp;fun.</p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gxuBP7oZbphwgkYWX0VMEWoS3xg_DpHIrJiAUbhmLHI/edit#slide=id.g13cb12b5ea4_0_16">our very awesome title&nbsp;slide</a><p>At the end, participants were invited to join the community. Everyone went away with some beautiful KBW stickers. To make it extra easy for new people to get involved with the community, <a href="https://twitter.com/markjotter/">Mark</a> made the world’s most beautiful QR&nbsp;code.</p>The most beautiful QR&nbsp;code 3) Raise awareness of Open Recognition (i.e. non-credential use of&nbsp;badges) <p>Our third goal is the hardest to assess. Did we have an impact on people we interacted with and their understanding of Open Recognition? Did people at Badge Summit begin to understand that badging isn’t about supporting the old system of credentialing? That it should to be <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">a new system for a different world</a>? Time will&nbsp;tell.</p><p>We’re pleased to be members of a community that cares not only about “knowledge, skills and competencies”, but also things like talents, behaviours, aspirations, connections and more. <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-every-type-of-learning-ffd137a6fe17">Open Recognition is for every type of learning</a> and <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/feed">this Community of Practic</a>e knows all about it. We were happy that we weren’t alone at Badge Summit. KBW community members had recognition friendly narratives on stage and in their sessions. Surely, the people who attended Badge Summit 2022 went away with a few ideas on how to integrate recognition into their badging programmes.</p><p>In the coming months, we’re looking forward to reconnecting with people we met at the Badge Summit. We will continue to explore how we can support people in finding ways to integrate Open Recognition. Do you have ideas on what the Keep Badges Weird community could do to help you? <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/discussions">Start a conversation about&nbsp;it!</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/summing-up-badge-summit-fb9d974c647d">Summing up Badge Summit</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau<br><br>It has been three weeks since the Digital Trust Hui Taumata at Te Papa Tongarewa and yet it still resonates with many delegates, judging by feedback I continue to receive. It’s a clear indicator of a great event that Digital Identity NZ and NZTech worked hard to bring to the community, overcoming the significant challenges of the time.&nbsp;<br><br>Digital Identity NZ’s Executive Council (EC) remained in Wellington the next day for its annual strategy workshop. It developed a co-creation framework and questions to put to DINZ members – shown further down – regarding what activities our community want to undertake that returns overall value to our members, to DINZ and to Aotearoa’s digital economy in the next 12 months and beyond. &nbsp;<br><br>Let’s refresh our memory of the mahi undertaken in the past 12 months – still some&nbsp;‘work-in-progress’ – but nonetheless impressive for a group comprising of volunteers and minimal staff:</p>



  Creating the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework working group to review the draft Bill and prepare submissions and&nbsp;reports, which have been received positively;  Creating the Te Kahui te Tiriti o DINZ working group to develop and recommend an action plan for DINZ. The plan will help us to deliver on our Te Tiriti obligations SOI and support &amp; promote Māori representation and participation in Digital Identity, though still formative, looks promising;  Creating the Inclusive &amp; Equitable Uses of Digital Identity working group to develop guidance for industry and the Government to help give&nbsp;all&nbsp;New Zealanders equal access to the potential benefits of digital identity – again formative but active engagement underway with civil society organisations;  Completing benchmark consumer and business research in a challenging Covid environment. The results to be made public in a few weeks;  Delivering three&nbsp;in-person member Connect events, again, in a challenging Covid environment;  Delivering the much praised all-day Digital Trust Hui Taumata both in-person and online together with 23 online-only events to the community worldwide&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>  



<p>The 2022 EC reviewed last year’s annual member survey feedback and took the opportunity to review DINZ’s purpose,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">vision and mission</a>&nbsp;to ensure it remains incredibly relevant to the opportunities in Aotearoa’s digital economy.&nbsp;<br><br>The 2022 EC then proceeded to draft a ‘Pillars and Roles’ framework whose purpose is to give better definition and structure to the mahi and associated activities that this communication calls upon members to contribute to; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Four Pillars under which the mahi and associated activities can be categorised – Ecosystem Enablement, Sustainability, Privacy and Trust, Inclusion &amp; Diversity – to be positioned under;  Five Roles that DINZ would play (one or more) applicable to any given mahi and activity – Connect, Communicate, Guide, Develop, Promote;  



<p>DINZ’s Executive Council of 2022 seeks your feedback* on its proposal by August 31st 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YJ225RX">using this&nbsp;Survey Monkey link here</a>.<br><br>The EC’s proposals will be tested against your compiled member feedback and modified where necessary for confirmation through the annual member survey later in the year.<br><br>*Feedback is primarily sought from individual and organisation members of DINZ but feedback from non members is also welcomed.<br></p>



<p>Ngā mihi nui,</p>



<p>Colin and the DINZ Executive Council</p>

<p>As part of the Human Colossus Foundation's rollout of <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/dde-launch">Dynamic Data Economy</a> (DDE) in July, the HCF founders delivered <a href="https://hasgeek.com/PrivacyMode/data-gov-and-sem/">Data Governance and Semantics</a>, a three-part series of talks to the Indian tech community as part of <a href="https://hasgeek.com/">Hasgeek's</a> <a href="https://hasgeek.com/PrivacyMode">Privacy Mode initiative</a>, a forum of discussion for understanding the privacy and security needs of the Indian tech ecosystem through guides, research, collaboration, events, and conferences.</p><p>This Hasgeek initiative aims to help its audience become acquainted with the most efficient approaches and practices to data management, reducing operational risk to businesses. As a forum for experts across multiple sectors, blending in tools, frameworks, principles and design sensibilities, the project encourages organisational teams to address blind spots and treat data governance as a shared responsibility instead of a siloed approach to policy-making, processes and requirements.</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  




<p>The "Data Governance and Semantics" project featured three webinars introducing DDE as a decentralised trust infrastructure acutely aligned with the current movement toward data exchange models in the Economic domain where actors regain transactional sovereignty to share accurate information bilaterally.</p><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en">European Data Strategy</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/data-strategy/data-strategy.html">Canadian Data Strategy</a>, and new <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/fr/home/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id.html">Swiss e-ID</a> initiatives demonstrate governmental support for a new paradigm shift in national data management schemes. Moreover, this particular Hasgeek project aligns with the revision of India's current <a href="https://digitalindia.gov.in/writereaddata/files/6.Data%20Protection%20in%20India.pdf">data protection regulation</a>.</p><p>The DDE conceptual infrastructure gives an equal weight of importance to the three core data domains of decentralised semantics, decentralised authentication, and distributed data governance. The HCF founders presented the core DDE concepts in three webinar sessions which interested parties can access via the Hasgeek platform or the Human Colossus Foundation video platform.&nbsp;</p><p>By incorporating first-principle design methodology into the foundational modelling of the core data domains, a network-agnostic system is possible, offering the cryptographic assurance of verifiable digital interactions and the human accountability of socio-economic governance frameworks.</p>


 

 Part 1: Decentralised semantics <p>Presented by: Paul Knowles, Head of the Advisory Council</p><p>Date: Tuesday, July 5th, 2022&nbsp;</p><p>This talk focused on decentralised semantics and how the segregation of task-oriented objects within a standard layered architecture can provide a long-term solution for unifying a data language within distributed data ecosystems. From that lens, decentralised semantics is ontology-agnostic, offering a harmonisation solution between data models and data representation formats while providing a roadmap to resolve privacy-compliant data sharing between servers, networks, and across sectoral or jurisdictional boundaries.&nbsp;</p> What is “Decentralised semantics”? <p>Data semantics is the study of the meaning and use of data in any digital environment. In data semantics, the focus is on how a data object represents a concept or object in the real world.</p><p><br>Decentralised semantics describes a data modelling methodology of layering and cryptographically binding task-specific objects (overlays) to a standard capture base, which, when combined, defines a complex digital object. The segregation of task-specific overlays enables dynamic semantic interoperability in the construction process of any digital object without compromising the objectual integrity of the semantic structure, its modular components, or the relationship between those objects.</p><p>Decentralised semantics provides a powerful solution for semantic interoperability, data harmonisation, internationalisation, and dynamic presentation.</p>

 Part 2: Decentralised authentication <p>Presented by: Robert Mitwicki, Head of the Technology Council</p><p>Date: Tuesday, July 12th, 2022&nbsp;</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  




<p>The second talk focused on decentralised authentication and how a decentralised key management infrastructure, providing self-certifying identifier (SCID) issuance underpinned by one-way cryptographic functions, can offer information uniqueness from captured entropy. Furthermore, a decentralised authentication system must be ledger-agnostic, with its identifiers interoperable across ecosystems, platforms, and networks.</p> What is “Decentralised authentication”? <p>Data provenance refers to the tracing and recording of the origin of data and its movement between locations. If digital data is tamper-proof (i.e. provable to have not been corrupted after its creation), it can be assumed to be authentic. Data authentication focuses on timestamping data inputs at index time, determining each event as factual.</p><p>Decentralised authentication describes a key management methodology of cryptographically binding SCIDs to an associated log that compiles the history of all uses or changes to the public/private key pair, ensuring verifiable identifier provenance throughout any ambient infrastructure. Immutable ordering guarantees the factual authenticity of the recorded event underpinning any systematic data input. Furthermore, all system identifiers must remain network-agnostic, enabling identifier interoperability within and across any distributed data ecosystem.</p><p>Decentralised authentication provides a powerful solution for identifier interoperability, data provenance, data-intensive event streaming, and event sourcing applications.</p>

<p>Presented by: Dr Philippe Page, Head of the Knowledge Council</p><p>Date: Tuesday, July 19th</p><p>The final talk focused on distributed governance and how a multi-stakeholder Data Governance Administration (DGA) provides the legal provision to assume responsibility for the consensual veracity of data transactions under its administrative control on behalf of the citizens and legal entities it serves. The role of a DGA aligns closely with that of a “data intermediary” as described in the European Parliament’s recently proposed <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0767">Data Governance Act</a>, serving as a mediator between those who wish to make their data available and those who seek to leverage that data.</p> What is “Distributed data governance”? <p>Data governance is a system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models, which describe who can take what actions with what information and when, under what circumstances, and using what methods.</p><p>Distributed data governance describes an operational framework for the provision of rules, common standards and practices, infrastructures and a distributed governance framework to empower individuals through increased digital access to (and control of) their electronic personal data, nationally and across borders, fostering a genuine single market for electronic record systems, relevant components and high-risk artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Multi-stakeholder participation within DGAs guarantees the consensual veracity of purpose-driven ecosystem policy while providing a consistent, trustworthy and efficient set-up for personal data use for research, innovation, and regulatory activities.</p><p>Distributed data governance provides a powerful solution for multi-stakeholder collaboration of rules and regulations for safe and secure data sharing within and across distributed data ecosystems.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: Digital assets are only as safe as their private keys. Securing private keys through responsible key management has thus been a major focus at Blockchain Commons, under our <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a> initiative. Unfortunately, securing keys ultimately isn’t just a logistical problem or a technical problem. It’s also a legal problem because US courts have inserted themselves into the process by demanding keys, often as a part of discovery.</p>

  <p>Turning over keys to courts not only introduces major threats to the digital assets controlled by the keys, but it also fundamentally misunderstands the purpose and use of private keys. There are better tools for court-based discovery, public keys prime among them. There are better, more traditional ways to enforce the turn over of assets. Requiring the disclosure of private keys instead is a needless threat not just to digital assets, but to our rights as well.</p>
</blockquote>

 

<p>Increasingly, attorneys in the United States are asking courts to force the disclosure of private keys as part of discovery or other pre-trial motions, and increasingly courts are acceding to those demands. Though this is a relatively recent phenomenon, it’s part of a larger problem of law enforcement seeking back doors to cryptography that goes back at least to the U.S. government’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/clipper-chips-birthday-looking-back-22-years-key-escrow-failures">failed introduction of the Clipper Chip</a> in 1993.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, today’s attacks on private keys in the courtroom have been more successful, creating an existential threat to digital assets, data, and other information protected by digital keys. That danger arises from a fundamental disconnect between this practice and the realities of technologies that leverage public-key cryptography for security: private-key disclosure can cause irreparable harm, including the loss of funds and the distortion of digital identities.</p>

<p>As a result, we need to support legislation that will protect digital keys while allowing courts to access information and assets in a way that better recognizes those realities. The private-key disclosure law <a href="https://youtu.be/61c3sYGqO-E?t=1063">currently being considered in Wyoming</a> is an excellent example of the sort of legislation that we could put forth and advocate for in order to maintain the proper protection for our digital assets and identities.</p>

<p><a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0105">Wyoming Senate Filing 2021-0105</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    No person shall be compelled to produce a private key or make a private key known to any other person in any civil, administrative, legislative or other proceeding in this state that relates to a digital asset, other interest or right to which the private key provides access unless a public key is unavailable or unable to disclose the requisite information with respect to the digital asset, other interest or right. This paragraph shall not be interpreted to prohibit any lawful proceeding that compels a person to produce or disclose a digital asset, other interest or right to which a private key provides access, or to disclose information about the digital asset, other interest or right, provided that the proceeding does not require production or disclosure of the private key.
</blockquote>

 The Realities of Private Keys 

<p>The forced disclosure of private keys is deeply harmful because it fundamentally runs at odds with how private keys work. Attorneys (and courts) are usually trying to force the disclosure of information or (later) the relinquishment of assets, but they’re treating private keys just like they’re physical keys that they could demand, use, and give back.</p>

<p>Private keys do not match any of these realities. As Wyoming State Legislature Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislators///1971">Chris Rothfuss</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“There is no perfect analog for a modern cryptographic private key in existing statute or case law; it is unique in its form and function. As we build a policy framework around digital assets, it is essential that we appropriately recognize and reflect the characteristics of the underlying public / private key and cryptographic technologies. Without clear, unambiguous legal protection for the sanctity of the private key, it is impossible to ensure the integrity of the associated digital assets, information, smart contracts and identities.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That appropriation recognition and reflection requires us to understand that:</p>

<p>1. Private keys are not assets.</p>

<p>Private keys are fundamentally the way we exert authority in the digital space, an interface between our physical reality and the digital reality. They may give us the ability to control a digital asset: to store it, to send it, or to use it. Similarly, they may give us the ability to decrypt protected data or to verify a digital identity. However, they are not the assets, the data, nor the identity themselves.</p>

<p>It’s the obvious difference between your car and your electronic key fob. The one is an asset, while the other lets you control that asset.</p>

<p>As Jon Callas, Director of Technology Projects at the EFF, says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  “They don’t even want the key, they want the data; asking for the key is like asking for the filing cabinet rather than the file.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. Private keys are not the proper tool for discovery.</p>

<p>Treating private keys as a tool to ensure the discovery of information fundamentally misunderstands their purpose. Private keys are not how we see something in digital space, but instead how we exert authority in digital space!</p>

<p>Turning back to comparisons, it’s the difference between a ledger and a pen. If you wanted accounting information, you’d ask for the ledger; you wouldn’t ask for the pen, especially not if it was a pen that allowed you to write undetectably in the handwriting of the accountant!</p>

<p>Former Federal Prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan, when offering <a href="https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/wyoming-select-committee/private-key-disclosure-buchanan/">testimony</a> in favor of Wyoming’s private-key disclosure law, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>  “the court could order a disclosure or an accounting of all the digital assets that are held, and then those assets could be disclosed and the location of whether they are held across different platforms or even different wallets. But giving the key is actually giving access to those assets. That is the difference.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, there is an electronic tool that meets the needs of discovery: public keys. Wyoming has recognized that in their <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061423LSO-0058v0.2.pdf">legislation</a>, saying that a private key should never be required if a public key would do the job (and they parenthetically noting at hearings that their current understanding is that a public key will always do the job). If our concern is revealing information that will help to catch and prosecute criminals, then public keys are the answer.</p>

<p>3. Private keys are not physical.</p>

<p>Electronic private keys and physical keys are very different. A physical key could pass through many hands and there could be the expectation that it was very likely not duplicated (especially if it were a special key, such as a safety-deposit-box key), and that when the key was returned to the original holder, they would once again have control of all of the linked assets. The same is not true for a private key, which could be easily duplicated by any of the many hands it passed through, with no way to ascertain that had happened.</p>

<p>Returning to the example of a car’s key fob, it would not be appropriate to force the disclosure of the unique serial number stored within a car fob for the same reason it’s not appropriate to force the disclosure of a private key. Doing so, would give anyone who gets that serial number the ability to create a new fob and steal your car!</p>

<p>4. Private keys serve many purposes.</p>

<p>Finally, private keys are likely to have a lot more purposes than physical keys, especially if a court decides to go after not just a specific private key, but the root key from an HD wallet or a seed phrase. Root keys (and seeds) might be used to protect a wide variety of assets as well as private data. They may also be used to control identities and to offer irrefutable proof that the owner agreed to something through digital signatures.</p>

<p>The authoritative uses of private keys are so wide and all-encompassing that it’s hard to come up with a physical equivalent. The closest analogy, which was brought up by Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen at one of the Wyoming hearings, would be if a court demanded access to a hotel room by requiring the hotel’s master key, which can provide access to all rooms. But, a private key is more than that, so it would be as if the court also required that someone with signatory powers at the hotel sign a bunch of blank contracts and blank checks. The potential for harm with the disclosure of a private key is just that high for someone who is using it for a variety of purposes — and there will be more and more people doing so as the importance of the digital world continues to increase.</p>

 The Realities of Courts 

<p>Going beyond the fact that a private key is the wrong tool for courts and that it’s often being used in the wrong way, there are a number of other problematic realities related to the courts themselves and how and when they’re trying to access private keys.</p>

<p>5. Courts are not prepared to protect private keys.</p>

<p>To start with, courts don’t have the experience needed to protect private keys. This danger is made worse by the fact that a single private key is likely to pass through the hands of many different court staff over time.</p>

<p>But, this isn’t just about courts. The problem of creating safe ways to transfer public keys is far bigger. It’s something that the cryptographic field as a whole does not have good answers for. Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen attested in his  testimony in Wyoming that the “immense difficulties of transferring a private key are a risk that allows bearing of false witness.” Putting courts, without crypto-expertise, in the middle of the problem could be catastrophic.</p>

<p>Perhaps cryptographers will resolve these issues in time, and perhaps someday courts will be able to share in that expertise if they decide doing so is a good use of their time and resources, but we need to consider keys whose disclosures are being forced now.</p>

<p>6. Courts are requiring premature disclosure.</p>

<p>The current situation with key disclosure is even more problematic because it’s occurring as part of discovery or other pre-trial motions. Discovery rulings are <a href="https://www.resolvingdiscoverydisputes.com/appeals/obtaining-review-of-discovery-rulings/">almost impossible to appeal</a>, which means that in today’s environment key holders have almost no recourse for protecting the token of their own authority in digital space.</p>

<p>7. Courts are more demanding of digital assets than physical assets.</p>

<p>We recognize that courts should be able to require the usage of a key. Compelling usage is nothing new, but the private key is not required for that, simply a court order.</p>

<p>If someone refuses to use their private key in a way compelled by a court, that’s nothing new either. The physical world already has plenty of examples of people refusing such orders, such as by hiding assets or just refusing to pay judgements. They are handled with sanctions such as contempt of court.</p>

<p>Asking for more from the electronic world is an overreach of traditional judgements that also creates much greater repercussions.</p>

 The Repercussions of Disclosure 

<p>Using the wrong tool for the wrong reasons and putting it in hands not ready to deal with it will have calamitous results. Here are some of the most obvious repercussions.</p>

<p>1. Asset Theft</p>

<p>Obviously, there is a danger of the assets being stolen, as a private key gives total control over those assets. These assets could go far beyond the specifics of what a court is interested in, because of the multitude of uses for keys.</p>

<p>2. Asset Loss</p>

<p>Beyond the problem of purposeful theft, keys could be lost, and with them digital assets. Former federal prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan raised this concern in her <a href="https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/wyoming-select-committee/private-key-disclosure-buchanan/">testimony</a>, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Evidence is lost all the time.” If that evidence was a private key, which might hold a variety of assets, information, and proofs of identity, the loss could be tremendous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wyoming State Legislature Majority Whip <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislators///2035">Jared Olsen</a> agreed with this concern at a recent Wyoming hearing, noting that a judicial assistant could delete a key and cause a loss of $8 billion dollars in Bitcoin when there was only a judgment for $100,000. He said he was “concerned about just simply handling it”.</p>

<p>3. Collateral Damage</p>

<p>Thefts or losses resulting from the disclosure of a private key could also go far beyond an individual before the court. Increasingly, assets are being held in multisignatures, which may grant multiple people control over the same assets. By requiring the disclosure of a key, a court could negatively impact people entirely unrelated to the proceedings.</p>

<p>4. Identity Theft.</p>

<p>Because private keys might also protect the identifier for digital identity, their loss, theft, or misuse could put someone’s entire digital life at risk. If a key was copied, someone else could pretend to be the holder and even make digital signatures that are legally binding for them.</p>

 Support This Legislation 

<p>Protecting private keys is one of the most important things that Blockchain Commons has ever worked on. As Blockchain Commons’ founder Christopher Allen said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I find the protections of this Private Key Disclosure bill crucial for the future of digital rights.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wyoming State Legislature Senate Minority Leader Chris Rothfuss affirmed this, adding:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>” Christopher Allen has been an invaluable member of our blockchain policy community, bringing a lifetime of technical expertise to advise our committee work and inform our legislative drafting. Mr. Allen has emphasized the particular importance of protecting private keys from any form of compulsory disclosure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need your help to make it a reality.</p>

<p>If you’re an experienced member of the cryptocurrency or digital asset field or a human-rights activist, please submit your own testimony in support to the <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Committees/2022/S19">Wyoming Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology</a>. The bill will be coming up for further discussion on September 19-20 in Laramie, Wyoming.</p>

<p>But, Wyoming is just the start. They are doing an excellent job of leading the way, but we need other states and countries to follow. If you have connections to another legislature, please suggest they introduce <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061423LSO-0058v0.2.pdf">similar language to Wyoming’s bill</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t feel comfortable talking with a legislature, you can help by advocating for the protection of private keys as something different than assets.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our new world of digital assets and digital information will succeed or fail based upon how we lay its foundations today. It could become a safe space for us or a dangerous wild west.</p>

<p>Properly protecting private keys (and using public keys and other tools for legitimate judicial needs) is a keystone that will help us to build a sturdy edifice.</p>

<p>Frankfurt, 16th of August 2022</p>

<p>IDunion, the consortium created as part of the “Secure Digital Identities Showcase” funding project, has reached the next stage in building a productive, cross-border ecosystem by founding a European cooperative with limited liability (Sociedad Cooperativa Europea, or SCE for short). </p>

<p>Founding meeting of the IDunion SCE on 20.07.2022 (from left to right: Mirko Mollik/TrustCerts GmbH, Markus Sabadello/ Danube Tech GmbH, Dr. Carsten Stöcker/ Spherity GmbH)</p>

  With the spin-off into the SCE, the infrastructure for verifiable credentials, which was researched and developed in the research project can now go live into production.   The European cooperative will be deploying and operating the necessary technical network to provide the operations.  This will allow citizens, private-sector organisations and government institutions to augment the digital identifications (eID) provided by governments with use of secure digital credentials for  identity attributes required across a wide range of use cases.   The legal form of the SCE was chosen as it offers a legally secure basis for the operations of an independent infrastructure for digital credentials.  While the IDunion research project was initiated with funding from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Action (BMWK), the European cooperative aims to secure private sector funding to provide a stable, non-profit business operation.   The decision to use the legal form of a Sociedad Cooperativa Europea was driven by IDunion’s core principles of neutrality and openness. It allows all legal entities that adhere to the community values to apply for membership to the SCE. Furthermore a future takeover or control by a single entity is prohibited by this legal form. The guiding principle of the cooperative is the joint establishment of the ecosystem – a task that no individual member can achieve on its own.  
<p>On 20.07.2022, the founding members Spherity, Danube Tech and TrustCerts signed the articles of association of the SCE in Essen. “We are very pleased to have achieved this milestone for the IDunion project,” says Helge Michael, consortium Leader of the IDunion research project. “With the IDunion SCE, we have created the ideal basis for building a future-proof identity ecosystem for Europe in which all members can work together as equals. Special thanks goes to the BMWK for providing the funding support as part of the research project ‘Showcase Secure Digital Identities’, which was an essential prerequisite to this next stage,” Michael continues. Dr. Carsten Stöcker, Managing Director of Spherity GmbH, adds: “IDunion SCE provides the legal basis for a cooperative governance structure, which strengthens the interests of individual participants in the interplay of decentralisation and cooperation without allowing a central platform operator to exploit its users economically.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>IDunion: The IDunion research project is a European network that brings together public institutions, government agencies, private organisations, associations, educational institutions and other stakeholders from various fields. Its aim is to develop a fundamentally new, secure digital infrastructure for the verification of identity information.</p>

<p>IDunion SCE: IDunion SCE is a cooperative (European Cooperative Europea) with limited liability that will operate the production network for credential verification, based on the findings of the research project. The SCE and the network are subject to the community governance of its members. Initial founding members of the SCE are:</p>

<p>TrustCerts GmbH: The cyber security start-up TrustCerts from Gelsenkirchen focuses on verifiable credentials and digital identities. TrustCerts’ solution is based on a specially developed blockchain that is compliant with German data protection and security requirements.</p>

<p>Danube Tech GmbH: One of the first companies supporting the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) concept, the Vienna-based Danube Tech specialises in interoperability between different SSI networks across national borders. Among the products developed by Danube Tech are the Universal Resolver and godiddy.com.</p>

<p>Spherity GmbH: The German software provider Spherity provides secure and decentralised identity management solutions for companies, machines, products, data and algorithms. Spherity provides the enabling technology to digitise and automate compliance processes in highly regulated sectors. Spherity’s products strengthen cybersecurity and create efficiency and data interoperability between digital value chains.</p>

<p>Public key cryptographic token API ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that PKCS #11 Specification Version 3.1 from the OASIS PKCS 11 TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>The Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) are a group of public-key cryptography standards devised and published by RSA Security LLC, starting in the early 1990s. The OASIS PKCS 11 Technical Committee addresses the ongoing enhancement and maintenance of the PKCS #11 standard.</p>



<p>PKCS #11 Specification Version 3.1 defines a platform-independent API to cryptographic tokens, such as hardware security modules and smart cards. The API itself is named “Cryptoki” (from “cryptographic token interface” and pronounced as “crypto-key”). This specification defines data types, functions and other basic components of the PKCS #11 Cryptoki interface for devices that may hold cryptographic information and may perform cryptographic functions. It also defines mechanisms that are anticipated for use with the current version of PKCS #11.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>Passwords may be a thing of the past as tech giants are moving to new passkey technology — a passwordless login that is more secure and convenient. Passkeys were created with the Web Authentication API security standard that uses public key cryptography for access. Each key is unique and created with encrypted data for added security. Apple, Google and Microsoft are working with the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure passkeys are implemented in ways that work across multiple platforms.</p>

<p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare says the same attackers that went after Twilio also sent Cloudflare employees malicious SMS messages with links to phishing sites dressed up as an official company website. Despite employees at both companies taking the bait, Cloudflare said attackers were unable to snatch the full logon credentials of its workers because the company’s second layer of authentication isn’t time-limited one-time codes. Instead, every employee at the company is issued a FIDO2-compliant security key from a vendor like YubiKey. Although the attackers siphoned the credentials, the hard key authentication requirement stopped them from snatching a soft token that fooled employees otherwise would have entered into the phishing site.</p>

<p>Dublin, Ireland is the place to be this September.</p>



<p>The Hyperledger Foundation, a multi-project open source collaborative effort hosted by the Linux Foundation, is holding their annual <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/hyperledger-global-forum/bal-forum-2022-dublin-ireland">Hyperledger Global Forum</a> (HGF) September 12th -13th at <a href="https://www.theccd.ie/">Convention Centre Dublin</a> with workshops to follow on the 14th at the Gibson Hotel.&nbsp; The Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) will be present in the exhibition hall as a community partner at HGF.&nbsp; Please stop by and visit to learn more about the foundation.</p>



<p>ToIP Steering Committee member, Scott Perry, Principal of Crypto and Digital Trust Services at Schellman, will be speaking at HGF on Monday, September 12th on the topic of Governance and Audit of Blockchain Networks.</p>



<p>While blockchain technology creates strong cryptographic controls securing the integrity of data, successful, cooperative blockchain networks must establish trust between a variety of independent entities to create overall trust.&nbsp; In this presentation, Scott Perry will discuss how trust is created when using blockchain technologies in the utility layer of the Trust Over IP stack.  Scott will discuss how blockchain networks can add accountability within stakeholder roles to ensure that blockchain-based trust ecosystems are trustworthy above the embedded cryptographic trust assertions.&nbsp; Come learn which role systems auditors, cybersecurity professionals, and risk management experts play in ensuring how trust is built within the ToIP stack focusing on how blockchain-based trust ecosystems are maintained when adopting such cutting-edge technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-located at the Conventions Center Dublin the same week is the Linux Foundation <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open Source Summit Europe</a> September 13th to 16th.&nbsp; ToIP will be having a co-located <a href="https://trustoverip.org/summit/">Trust Over IP Summit 2022</a>, during the OSS.&nbsp; So when you<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/register/"> register for OSS</a>, don’t forget to add on the free registration for ToIP Summit 2022.<br><br><a href="https://trustoverip.org/summit/#agenda">Agenda for the ToIP Summit 2022</a>:</p>

It envisions a new paradigm in digital interaction underpinned by a data-agile economy that aims to empower people, businesses and organisations to make better decisions based on insights from harmonised, accurate data. HCF’s mission is to facilitate the creation and subsequent development of such a data-agile economy, focusing on building open source core public utility technologies.</p><p>DDE "Dynamic Data Economy" refers to a data-agile economy composed of three foundational pillars - semantics, inputs and governance. The DDE is essentially a decentralised trust infrastructure aligned with the European data strategy where actors have the transactional sovereignty to share accurate information bilaterally.

<p>Microsoft’s blog post explores Accenture’s journey as they adopted passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>With cyber-attacks on the rise, phishing has become the primary method used by attackers to compromise user data.&nbsp;Now, even though multifactor authentication (MFA) defeats over 90% of&nbsp;password breaches, it isn’t immune to phishing. Microsoft’s vision for a passwordless world emphasizes FIDO 2.0-powered inherently phish-resistant credentials like Windows Hello for Business and FIDO 2.0 External Security Keys. Accenture’s implantation includes over 500,000 users primarily using Windows Hello For Business, 200,000 Phone Sign in users, over 10,000 FIDO2 key users, and an 80% drop in day-to-day usage of passwords across the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Passwords are a form of knowledge-based authentication. For a user to prove they are who they claim to be, they need a secret — the password — that has been previously stored by the service. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a technique designed to strengthen the authentication process by adding possession-based authentication to knowledge-based authentication. A service can only authenticate a user when they prove they have knowledge of the shared secret in addition to something they have or are. Eliminating shared secrets removes the intrinsic weakness of password-based authentication and MFA. A secure form of possession-based authentication is the best alternative. Passwordless authentication based on FIDO standards is considered the archetype. FIDO passwordless authentication is based on public-key cryptography.</p>

<p>Stu Sjouwerman, founder, and CEO of KnowBe4 Inc shares his thoughts on how MFAs fell short in data security. A Verizon research report says that 82% of all cyberattacks fall on human error (stolen credentials, phishing, misuse). For a hacker to successfully gain access to credentials they need some level of human involvement to get around MFA defences. Some common phishing techniques include, MiTM attacks, SIM-swapping attacks, “Pass-the-cookie” attacks, and MFA fatigue. The strongest forms of MFAs are based on FIDO2 standards that enables users to access resources through biometrics. The deployment of FIDO2 eliminates the risk of phishing attacks but ensuring users are well trained to identify cyberthreats is just as important if not more.</p>

<p>Cloudflare employees were recently targeted by a “sophisticated” cyberattack, and even though some fell for the scheme, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-ddos-protection">DDoS protection</a>&nbsp;company managed to successfully defend itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/2022-07-sms-phishing-attacks/">blog post</a>(opens in new tab), Cloudflare co-founder Matthew Prince, together with team members Daniel Stinson-Diess and Sourov Zaman, explained how the attack happened and what made the difference between success and failure.</p>



<p>The threat actor made a couple of key preparations ahead of the attack: they registered a domain that looked legitimate and would fool many victims: cloudflare-okta.com. Okta is Cloudflare’s identity provider. They also managed to somehow obtain the phone numbers of almost 80 Cloudflare employees, as well as family members for some.</p>

<p>Yesterday, August 8, 2022, Twilio shared that they’d been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/august-2022-social-engineering-attack">compromised by a targeted phishing attack</a>. Around the same time as Twilio was attacked, we saw an attack with very similar characteristics also targeting Cloudflare’s employees. While individual employees did fall for the phishing messages, we were able to thwart the attack through our own use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/">Cloudflare One products</a>, and physical security keys issued to every employee that are required to access all our applications.</p>



<p>We have confirmed that no Cloudflare systems were compromised. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudforce-one-threat-operations-and-threat-research/">Cloudforce One threat intelligence team</a>&nbsp;was able to perform additional analysis to further dissect the mechanism of the attack and gather critical evidence to assist in tracking down the attacker.</p>



<p>This was a sophisticated attack targeting employees and systems in such a way that we believe most organizations would be likely to be breached. Given that the attacker is targeting multiple organizations, we wanted to share here a rundown of exactly what we saw in order to help other companies recognize and mitigate this attack.</p>

 Consumer Financial Protection Circular 2022-04 



 Insufficient data protection or security for sensitive consumer information 



 Question presented 



<p>Can entities violate the prohibition on unfair acts or practices in the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) when they have insufficient data protection or information security?</p>



 Summary answer 



<p>Yes. In addition to other federal laws governing data security for financial institutions, including the Safeguards Rules issued under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), “covered persons” and “service providers” must comply with the prohibition on unfair acts or practices in the CFPA. Inadequate security for the sensitive consumer information collected, processed, maintained, or stored by the company can constitute an unfair practice in violation of 12 U.S.C. 5536(a)(1)(B). While these requirements often overlap, they are not coextensive.</p>



<p>Acts or practices are unfair when they cause or are likely to cause substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Inadequate authentication, password management, or software update policies or practices are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers, and financial institutions are unlikely to successfully justify weak data security practices based on countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Inadequate data security can be an unfair practice in the absence of a breach or intrusion.</p>

<p>Passwords are a form of knowledge-based authentication. For a user to prove they are who they claim to be, they need a secret — the password — that has been previously stored by the service. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a technique designed to strengthen the authentication process by adding possession-based authentication to knowledge-based authentication. A service can only authenticate a user when they prove they have knowledge of the shared secret in addition to something they have or are. Eliminating shared secrets removes the intrinsic weakness of password-based authentication and MFA. A secure form of possession-based authentication is the best alternative. Passwordless authentication based on FIDO standards is considered the archetype. FIDO passwordless authentication is based on public-key cryptography.</p>

<p>This update provides a brief overview and technical analysis of the results of the “snapshot” mechanism currently being used to track the consistency of staked Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in the Consortia staking pool. Patrons staking EWT can use the tools provided at <a href="https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/">https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/</a> to check the status of their wallets and snapshots if applicable.</p> Snapshots and Variable EWT&nbsp;rewards <p>A series of Snapshots are being taken of wallets that have staked Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in the Energy Web Consortia staking pool. The purpose of the snapshots is to measure the consistency of staking. Specifically, snapshots track how much EWT is deposited into a staking contract by a given wallet and how long that stake is maintained throughout the life of the Consortia staking pool. Since staking will be a major contributor to the cybersecurity of Energy Web solutions tied to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">the upcoming Consortia blockchain</a>, having a consistent, high stake of EWT is crucial. Therefore, EWT staking pools reward consistent stakers with higher rewards compared to stakers who withdraw EWT before the staking pool&nbsp;ends.</p><p>In the case of the current Consortia staking pool, there will be an additional, variable reward distributed to all Patrons (individuals who have staked EWT into the pool) with at least 1 snapshot. This reward comes from redistributing all unallocated rewards from the Consortia staking smart contract. The staking contract was deployed with the maximum possible reward balance in order to provide rewards for Patrons staking a total of 7.5 million EWT for the entire 9 month duration of the staking&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Because the staking pool has yet to reach its capacity, not all fixed rewards will be distributed. This is where snapshots come in: the reward balance that is left unallocated will be distributed to Patrons who have snapshots. Rewards vary depending on the number of snapshots and the amount of EWT staked. For each wallet, the reward will be determined by an exponential formula taking into account the number of snapshots and average EWT stake. The exponential formula will incentivise Patrons to collect all snapshots, since a wallet with all snapshots will earn much higher rewards than wallets with 5 and less snapshots and the same EWT&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Similar to the timing of the snapshots, variable rewards are impossible to predict as they depend on the timing of snapshots and actions of other staking patrons. Therefore, the only rational behavior that maximizes variable APY is to stake as much EWT into a single wallet as possible and leave it staked consistently until the end of the Consortia staking pool. To be clear, the variable rewards will be distributed in addition to the fixed award already awarded by the Consortia staking&nbsp;pool.</p> Snapshot 1 Balance&nbsp;Analysis <p>In total, 6,408 wallets were included in the first snapshot. These wallets staked 5,540,589 EWT. The individual balances vary from 1 EWT (the lower limit for snapshots) to 3,000 EWT (the upper staking limit for a single wallet). The chart below shows the balances of all snapshot wallets: wallets on the horizontal axis, balances on the vertical&nbsp;axis.</p><p>The next chart shows the stake balance distribution with balance bounds on the horizontal axis and the number of wallets in each section on the vertical&nbsp;axis:</p><p>Almost 2/3rd of all wallets have balances under 500 EWT (out of which 334 are staking just 1 EWT), and 17% of wallets have balances higher than 2,500 EWT. This is surprising, as normally such distributions follow a power-law distribution (the higher the balance, the lower the number of wallets). In the case of Consortia staking, the relatively large number of wallets can be explained by Patrons holding many EWT (more than the upper limit of 3,000 EWT) staking with multiple wallets. Out of 1,110 wallets staking over 2,500 EWT, 970 are staking the maximum allowed 3,000&nbsp;EWT.</p> Snapshot 2 Balance&nbsp;Analysis <p>Snapshot 2 was taken on block #<a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/block/18648235/transactions">18648235</a> generated on June 27th, 2022 at 9:16 PM UTC+1. This time, there were 6,641 wallets staking (up 233 from the first snapshot), staking a total of 5,730,962 EWT, so (up 190,373 EWF from snapshot&nbsp;1).</p><p>Here are the balances of snapshot 2 (in orange) compared to snapshot 1 balances (in blue). Wallets on the bottom, balances on the vertical&nbsp;axis:</p><p>The orange spikes are wallets adding more EWT between snapshot 1 and 2. The orange dips are wallets withdrawing EWT. On the far right of the chart there is the orange line and no blue line: these are the completely new wallets that didn’t participate in snapshot&nbsp;1.</p><p>In total, 880 wallets increased their EWT stake and 350 of were completely new (not staked during snapshot 1). 180 wallets decreased their stake, 117 of them withdrawing all their EWT and not qualifying for snapshot&nbsp;2.</p><p>Here’s the balance distribution comparison between stake 1 and 2 balances. Bounds on the bottom, number of wallets in each category in the vertical&nbsp;scale:</p><p>We can see a slight increase in each category, even in the highest balances section: 41 new wallets staked between 2,500 and 3,000 ETW, out of which 40 staked the 3,000 EWT maximum. For comparison, there are now 150 additional wallets staking under 500&nbsp;EWT.</p> Snapshot insights and what to expect&nbsp;next <p>So far, staking in the Consortia pool has been consistent in line with the design of the snapshot mechanism. This is evidenced by the balance distribution of snapshot 1 and 2 and <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/address/0x181A8b2a5AEb25941F6A79b4aE43dBb1968c417A/coin-balances#address-tabs">EWT balances in the staking contract</a>:</p><p>Such consistent staking will provide a high degree of economic cybersecurity to all enterprise-grade Energy Web solutions (for more information on the connection between consistent staking, cybersecurity, and Energy Web solutions, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">please review our announcement on the upcoming Consortia chain</a>).</p><p>As mentioned above, the next 4 snapshots will be taken randomly between now and the end of the Consortia staking pool in December 2022. Patrons who receive at least 1 snapshot will qualify for additional rewards. The rewards will be calculated and distributed after the Consortia staking pool ends. Again, since variable rewards are impossible to predict, the best strategy for all patrons is to stake as high a balance as possible and do so consistently.</p><p>Also read: <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-community-staking-pool-snapshots-explained-3a9c3eebf28b">https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-community-staking-pool-snapshots-explained-3a9c3eebf28b</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>By Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>July 2022 was a busy month for FIDO members in APAC, particularly with the events that took place in Korea and Vietnam:</p>



<p>FIDO Tech Seminar in Korea</p>



<p>On July 13th, the FIDO Korea Working Group held a half-day virtual tech seminar with 250+ attendees.&nbsp; The sessions included updates on the state of the FIDO Alliance and its certification programs, an introduction to FIDO Device Onboard (FDO), a FIDO Authentication 101, an introduction to multi-device FIDO credentials (also known as “passkeys”), and a presentation on understanding Korean&nbsp; laws mandating the use of passwords.</p>

<p>This tech seminar covered topics such as FDO and passkey, and provided a forum for industry experts to learn about phishing-resistant online authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the post-event survey, over 30% of attendees reported they were victims of credential thefts, though they are online security industry experts or studying in the related fields.&nbsp; Mr. Hyeong Won Pyo at Chosun Media thoughtfully summarized what he learned from the seminar while sharing with his colleagues and friends: “Our journalists are under attack by online phishing campaigns, and it was great to learn how to protect them with FIDO Authentication.”</p>

<p>Vietnam Goes Passwordless Roundtable</p>



<p>On the same afternoon, FIDO Alliance participated in another hybrid event, the Vietnam Goes Passwordless Roundtable, organized by VinCSS and Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communication.</p>



<p>It was the first forum on passwordless authentication in Vietnam, and the cyber security industry leaders in the region gathered representatives from the state banks, and local journalists.</p>

<p>During the event local cyber security leaders discussed and shared best practices on digital authentication, disruptive technologies, and mega trends of passwordless authentication.&nbsp; The experts recognized the recent increase of cyber-attacks in Vietnam as a risk factor for further developing digital applications, which is one of the top strategic activities of Vietnamese National Digital Transformation Program.</p>



<p>Mr. Do Ngoc Duy Tranc, CEO of VinCSS said, “VinCSS is ready to sponsor and support the nation by integrating strong FIDO-based passwordless authentication technology by building broader cooperation mechanisms with multi-sectors.”</p>

<p>This blog post outlines the revised version of <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges.pdf">the initial RFC</a> detailing the TRAC bridging approach from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain based on the feedback received on the initial version from the OriginTrail community.</p> Teleporting TRAC to the OriginTrail Parachain on&nbsp;Polkadot <p>The <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges.pdf">previous version of this RFC</a> proposed the initial TRAC bridge for near-term utilisation be implemented via the Chainbridge system, while enabling emergent bridging infrastructure (such as the Snowfork bridge) as potential long term bridging solutions.<br>Due to the concerns expressed by the TRAC community regarding the inherent risks associated with such a bridge implementation (details below and in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/issues/16">RFC comments</a>), and demonstrated vulnerabilities of similar bridges seen recently within the crypto space (even while writing this update of the RFC), an alternative approach will be implemented — “one way teleports”.</p><p>A one way teleport is an already proven approach within the OriginTrail community as it was successfully executed during the Starfleet stage of the OriginTrail Parachain development. Via a “one-time” TRAC bridge from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain the OriginTrail community has successfully staked 100MM TRAC tokens to be transferred to the (then stand-alone) OriginTrail tailored blockchain.</p><p>The exact approach and details of the smart contract implementation are specified in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC%2010%20Starfleet%20boarding%20(staking)%20smart%20contract%20specs.pdf">OT-RFC-10</a>, however for practicality an outline is presented here:</p>  A special smart contract is deployed on Ethereum blockchain designed to lock a specific amount of TRAC tokens, to be teleported to the OriginTrail Parachain. The contract is permissionless and anybody can deposit (lock) TRAC into&nbsp;it.  The equivalent amount of TRAC tokens gets minted on the OriginTrail Parachain to the same address as the one that locked tokens on the Ethereum side (so tokens can be utilised by the same&nbsp;wallet).  Special care is taken to ensure security of the smart contract — a thorough smart contract audit has been conducted, together with functionality minimization (to lower complexity and thus risk surface) as well as coding and testing best practices.  <p>The near-term TRAC bridging proposal therefore is&nbsp;to:</p>  Perform one way TRAC teleports from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain by reutilizing <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/starfleet-boarding-contract">the same smart contract</a> already proven in the previous 100MM TRAC Starfleet staking procedure. This contract implementation has <a href="https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/origin-trail-starfleet-staking">been security audited by Quantstamp</a> and proven functional and secure in a production environment. Additionally, the smart contract is built in such a way that the locked funds can be used to integrate with the future&nbsp;bridges.  Execute teleports in a total of 15 batches in two week intervals.  This approach removes third-party code (non-OriginTrail ecosystem) from the bridging infrastructure, additionally minimising the risk surface until a more trust-minimising solution is available.  The approach enables continued exploration of bridging solutions within the Polkadot ecosystem for the mid- and long-term viability of a two-way TRAC bridge. It is expected that multiple options will be available, such as common-good parachain bridges, Snowfork and others, developed by the wider Polkadot community. Once a suitable bridge is available, all teleported tokens will be migrated (subject to the same RFC process as with this implementation).   Teleporting details <p>Teleporting will occur in 15 batches, each of which will be performed with a process similar to the previously executed Starfleet staking. Due to the nature of the smart contracts and them being audited and tested, only parametric changes can be implemented and no changes in smart contract code will be performed.</p><p>Each of the 15 teleportation batches will deploy a separate Teleport contract on Ethereum, managed by a multisig wallet. The illustration below shows the lifecycle of each Teleport contract and its phases as per smart contract design (specified in OT-RFC-10). There are 5 distinct periods defined in the life&nbsp;cycle:</p>  Preparation period: used for contract preparation and deployment on Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.  Boarding period: the period during which TRAC can be deposited in the smart contract for teleportation. The boarding period will last 2 weeks for each batch (except for the first batch lasting 3&nbsp;weeks).  Lock period: the period during which tokens are immobile (locked) in the teleportation smart contract on Ethereum. TRAC tokens are teleported to the OriginTrail Parachain and available for use with the same address as used for locking. Each lock period will be set to expire on March 31st&nbsp;2023.  Bridge period: the period during which locked tokens can be transferred from the teleportation smart contract on Ethereum to a fully fledged bridge implementation (which is expected to be available in the bridge period). The bridge period lasts for 12 months (latest until March 31st&nbsp;2024).  Fallback period: period used in the fallback scenario of a fully fledged bridge not becoming available, after all previous periods have expired. In this period it will be possible to teleport TRAC tokens back to Ethereum, using the accounting feature as described in the contract spec (OT-RFC-10).  <p>To incentivize the teleportation process and utility of the OriginTrail Parachain and the (then deployed) OriginTrail DKG v6, a designated amount of OTP bounty tokens will be made available for the users (to be announced).</p><p>The teleport timeline is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  August 18th (tentative): first Teleportation contract deployment and Batch #1 teleporting start, the first boarding period lasting 3&nbsp;weeks  September: first minting of TRAC on OT Parachain, added OTP bounty to enable the use of the OriginTrail Parchain (bonus size&nbsp;TBD)  Mid-September: Once TRAC is available, execute OriginTrail DKG v6&nbsp;launch  Batch #2 and further teleportation batches continue immediately after the first teleportation is completed and validated as successful.  <p>The detailed timeline will be shared in the following documents as soon as this RFC is approved.</p><p>The complete and updated OT-RFC-12 v2 document can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges%20(v2).pdf">here</a>.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">OriginTrail Twitter</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain">OriginTrail Parachain Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-12-v2-teleporting-trac-to-the-origintrail-parachain-on-polkadot-de535a9d2693">OT-RFC-12 V2: Teleporting TRAC to the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We’re excited to share that we launched the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network">Ceramic Community Forum</a>! The forum is the place to ask technical questions and receive support from your fellow community members and Ceramic’s core team.</p> Why did we launch the forum? <p>If you have been a part of Ceramic’s developer community for a while, you probably know that we've been exchanging knowledge and receiving updates from the Ceramic core team on a <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord Server</a>. One piece of feedback we received from multiple members of the community is that, over time, the RSS feed-like nature of Discord made it difficult to get answers to technical questions and search for information. It became clear that we need a better platform for facilitating technical support and empowering our developer community to share technical knowledge about Ceramic.</p> What do I use the forum for? <p>The forum is dedicated to asking and answering technical questions about Ceramic. It consists of a few main categories dedicated to specific aspects of Ceramic tech. If you have a question to ask, simply open it under the most relevant category. The questions asked on the forum will be answered between the Ceramic community and Ceramic’s core team.</p><p>The forum includes a few additional features that should improve the technical-information sharing and question answering across the Ceramic developer community:</p>  Better search—you can use the forum’s built-in search tool to discover questions that might be similar to yours  Sign-in with Ethereum—to begin using the forum, you can sign up using your Ethereum wallet.   And what about the Ceramic Discord server? <p>The Ceramic Discord Server is not going anywhere. Going forward, the server will be focused on facilitating more high-level discussions around Ceramic—e.g. talking about community projects, sharing ideas and feedback about specific aspects of the Ceramic Network. Over the next month, expect to see some architectural changes in the Discord server as we transition technical support to the Ceramic Forum.</p><p>Try out the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">Ceramic Forum</a> and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>So this will provide them an ultra simple way of achieving that, with the key distinction from other options like EBay or Amazon obviously being that it’s entirely Scotland focused. This means a much more local, hands on technical support, and a concentrated market focus.</p>
 Features 
<p>Key features will include:</p>
 
 A powerful set of digital marketing tools – As well as loading up your products, you’ll be able to send e-vouchers, email marketing etc. 
 Cryptocurrency – Accept Bitcoin payments et al. This is another key technology field where SMEs know they should be doing more but it is simply beyond them. 
 
<p>In short it will leverage the SaaS (Software as a Service) model to make easily accessible the powerful e-commerce and digital marketing technologies that most small businesses would greatly benefit from but don’t have the resource or expertise to deploy themselves.</p>
<p>There is also great potential to team up with other Scottish innovators, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/">Miconex</a>. They offer a gift card system that could tie in with #1, with a particular focus on local towns, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/casestudy/case-study--the-perth-gift-card">Perth</a>.</p>
<p>Shops.scot will be able to provide the core e-commerce tools for selling their products, and organized into similarly local sections, like Shops.scot/Perth. This will provide a powerful combined solution to achieve key Scottish Government goals like <a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/scottish-government-offers-support-local-online-firms">boosting local commerce for local merchants</a>.</p>

<p>Fast Identity Online (FIDO) outlines secure authentication protocols that are available to all. Now, Microsoft, Google and Apple are doubling down on passkeys to support FIDO Alliance. Their goal is to normalize passwordless authentication and eliminate passwords from the user authentication equation. FIDO Alliance seeks to bring the idea of the “password” into modern times with stronger security — by developing the FIDO protocols and setting a new standard.</p>

<p>Time to leave the passwords behind. Consumers are leaning that way — and would be happy to abandon that age-old, friction-filled relic that traces its genesis to the dawn of the Internet. The door is opening for authentication to increasingly be done by behavioral analytics. Advanced technologies parse how individuals wield their devices, how they type and enter data and leverage geolocation to help prove that people are who they say they are. The Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance also promotes the processes where the devices themselves authenticate identities as the devices are unlocked.</p>

Passkeys are based on public key cryptography, which involves storing a private security key on your device. Because there’s no password to type, phishing and other scams will become far less frequent.</p>

No more searching for the unique password you create for each internet account. Apple works with the FIDO Alliance so passwords also work on non-Apple devices.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/community/venture-builders/"></a>The <a href="https://digitalscot.net/community/venture-builders/">Venture Builders Group</a> is a&nbsp;community group for entrepreneurs seeking to launch new global-scale tech ventures. 
<p>The group provides a forum to brainstorm your venture idea, discuss business models, recruit co-founders and fast-track to launch, and we’ll showcase new ventures here on this site.</p>
 Learn.scot – A Virtual School for Scotland 
<p><a href="https://Learn.scot">Learn.scot</a> is a new venture under development, intended to deliver ‘Scotland’s Digital Learning Centre’, a community marketplace platform where members can be both learners and tutors, accessing and also creating e-learning courseware.&nbsp;A summary of the business model:</p>

<p>It is intended to play a pivotal role in <a href="https://digitalscot.net/library/digital-education/">Transforming Scottish Education for the 21st Century</a>.</p>
<p>While you would assume e-learning would now be a mature component within the education sector, the reality is that it’s adoption is still quite immature – <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-53067254">62% of parents</a> said their school had not provided any online learning for their children and <a href="https://www.tes.com/news/coronavirus-pupils-not-engaging-online-learning">teachers were struggling</a> with how to deliver it effectively.</p>
<p>Writing for Reform Scotland Jenifer Johnston offers <a href="https://reformscotland.com/2020/05/scotland-needs-a-virtual-school-jenifer-johnston/">this</a> simple but very compelling ideal for what is needed – A ‘virtual school’ for Scotland:</p>
<p>“My ask of the Scottish Government is that there is a national online curriculum developed and delivered digitally in really simple, open-access websites, no passwords, no gatekeeping, just lessons broadcast daily on a website, join in if you can. Scotland has many superstar teachers who could deliver classes to the nation’s kids in a virtual school – we could get to know them as well as our own fantastic class teachers. Lessons could be live and recorded to watch later if children can’t get to them right away.”</p>
<p>Our national opportunity is to harness this collective pool of innovation and define how various combinations of each can be applied to meet the various education needs of Scotland.</p>
<p>“Scotland has many superstar teachers who could deliver classes to the nation’s kids in a virtual school – we could get to know them as well as our own fantastic class teachers. Lessons could be live and recorded to watch later if children can’t get to them right away.”</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Harnessing modern digital learning platforms can address Scotland’s challenge, and overall presents the country with the opportunity to modernize not only what we learn, but how&nbsp;we learn, and transform our entire approach to education.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of Digital Scotland is to drive the initiatives that will see us emulate the digital nation success of countries like Estonia, and with this program&nbsp;ask and answer the question how might Scotland achieve this same level of digital capability and the same high performance academic achievement it enables.</p>

<p>Accenture, Broadcom, Copado, IBM, Security Compass, US Department of Defense, and Others to Enable VSM Data Sharing Across Platforms</p> 


<p>2 August 2022 — Members of OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, are working together to define interoperability standards for value stream management (VSM). The new VSM Interoperability Technical Committee’s goal is to bring increased interoperability to existing value stream standards, tools, and best practices, enabling a more secure approach to sharing data across platforms in the software supply chain and systems ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For VSM journeys, sharing of data across enterprise platforms to get holistic, valuable data in the form of forensics, observability and auditability, for example, is critical. But it requires data standards and secure interoperability,” said Eveline Oehrlich, Research Director at Research In Action and Chief Research Officer at DevOps Institute. “Having such interoperability allows for teams to look at events that are relevant to an organization with additional context for the forensic processes of post incident and future incident management work, as an example use case.”</p>



<p>The TC’s work will focus on defining key component parts of value stream data, enabling interoperability of value streams among users and platforms, establishing good practice for value stream data architecture, and creating open standards for value stream management metrics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The formation of the OASIS VSM Interoperability Technical Committee is an important next step in the advancement of VSM, with the potential to provide an accelerated path to VSM adoption. We look forward to leading this talented group of organizations as we work towards our common goal of aiding VSM capabilities,” said VSMI TC co-chairs Helen Beal of Value Stream Management Consortium and Kelly Cullinane of Copado.</p>



<p>Organizations typically use different tools to measure the performance of their software delivery processes. Using VSM tools, an organization can utilize data and metrics to maximize innovation, drive growth, and add greater value. This TC sets out to create a VSM standard for interoperability and tool integration, allowing for broader adoption in the long term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participation in the OASIS VSMI TC is open to all through membership in OASIS. Digital product leaders; product value stream organizations; cybersecurity, public sector security, and quality management professionals; and others are invited to join the group.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Support for Value Stream Management Interoperability Technical Committee</p>



<p>Broadcom<br>“As a leader in introducing and implementing VSM solutions Broadcom Software is thrilled to support this initiative. VSM has emerged as a critical success factor in digital transformation and uniting to support interoperability standards is the next logical step, especially as we see more businesses adopting VSM. Data lives at the core of ValueOps VSM and we are committed to continually innovating in this space.”<br>-Jean-Louis Vignaud, Head of ValueOps, Broadcom Software</p>



<p>Copado<br>“Standards are critical for the proper interoperability of internet infrastructure and software. That interoperability drives innovation and capabilities that help create a more resilient ecosystem. That’s why it’s so exciting to launch VSMI; this will help companies normalize value stream management data for better measurement, auditability and terminology between large scale ecosystems.”<br>-Daniel Riedel, SVP Strategic Services, Copado&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM<br>“Often times, enterprises are constrained from realizing maximum value from their workflows because of disparate systems that may not seamlessly integrate. This situation is further challenged when there are mergers and acquisitions, and new tooling is invariably brought into the value stream. VSMI can play a key role in bridging this void. We support the VSMI initiative and feel like this will be the logical next step towards creating Next-Gen DevSecOps organizations.”<br>-Sunil Joshi, Vice President &amp; CTO, Hybrid Cloud Services, Americas, IBM</p>



<p>Security Compass<br>“Value streams are a critical part of integrating our disparate security activities and aligning them to produce business value. Including multiple stakeholders, from business leaders to developers, to derive requirements and deliver insights in security activities is the next evolution in securing our applications and infrastructure. Security Compass is honored to participate in this OASIS working group to help create an open standard around value streams so that we can collectively build a world where organizations build secure systems at the pace of business demand.”<br>-Altaz Valani, Director of Insights Research, Security Compass</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/community/solution-partners/"></a>Our <a href="https://digitalscot.net/community/solution-partners/">Solutions Partner Group</a> provides a collaboration space for Scottish tech vendors to grow sales through industry team work.

 Changeworks: Web Site Transformation Project 

		 
			 
				
 
 Organization: <a href="https://www.changeworks.org.uk/">Changeworks</a>. 
 Tender: <a href="https://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/search/show/search_view.aspx?ID=JUL454333">Public Contracts</a>. 
 Deadline: 8th Aug. 
 Budget: £70k. 
 

			 
		 
	
 RFP Summary 
 Business Case 
<p>We recognise that our current website is not serving us well and will be developing an organisational digital strategy. We require an agency to partner with on this transformation journey that can help establish a new improved website and a new standard for how we develop digital information and services linking with our established organisational systems.</p>
<p>A digital strategy is in development, alongside a digital framework. Improving our user journeys and website is integral to achieving our strategic aims and to maximise reach, efficiency and engagement. As an organisation, we are in the process of pivoting to be userled and insight-driven to develop intuitive and supportive journeys to support decarbonisation of homes. An organisation-wide customer journey is being planned, which will need to be developed in tandem with our website transformation.</p>
 Tech Platform 
<p>Changeworks’ staff and teams range from those that are highly digitally capable, to people who have few or limited skills. We are in the process of moving to SharePoint and embedding usage of Power Platform capabilities such as our CRM across Changeworks, and we are still in process of adoption and learning. There is an ICT team responsible for Power Platform, CRM and support relating to information technology.</p>
<p>The Digital, Marketing and Communications team is responsible for the website and have a content lead, but only limited SEO capabilities, and no developer or UX resources.</p>
<p>We are currently using Drupal 7 but it is not fit for purpose. While we can make minor updates to our website, bigger changes to webpages need to be done through an agency, which is time-consuming and not cost-effective. Our website is not optimised towards user needs and user journeys are poorly mapped out. Though we have a wealth of quality content, it is difficult to find and surface to users, and our service proposition is unclear.</p>
 Project Scope 
 
 Develop a digital roadmap for our website transformation project incl. project timeline, milestones and quality assurance. 
 Develop user personas and journeys for our B2B and B2C audiences, engaging with Changeworks teams through a Discovery phase to determine which services or aspects of services are equipped with online self-servicing and/or lead generation in a phased approach. Includes providing support with:<br>
a. Content audit and content migration<br>
b. User personas and journeys development and testing<br>
c. Plan for lead generation<br>
d. SEO and content development 
 Re-platform the Changeworks website to a more user-friendly CMS (and develop a Minimum Viable Product version as necessary before full website launch alongside new brand). 
 Ensure the website, CMS, tech stack and other necessary components can integrate with current and future requirements, and are able to support Changeworks’ ambitious aims of scaling up reach through digital including digital service design over the 22-25 strategic period and beyond.
 
 Changeworks is invested in Microsoft (including use of Power Platform for e-marketing and as our CRM). The long-term aim is to use Microsoft Azure Cloud. Sharepoint migration began in May ’22. Dynamics 365 / Power Platform can integrate with the majority of systems as long as they accept HTTP requests, which most modern CMS and websites should be able to handle. 
 
 
 Ongoing (min. 3 years) contract for hosting and maintenance incl. options for annual extensions and break-out clauses. 
 
 Proposal 
<p>Identify and map out costings for the above as well as phased project management cycles as may be required.</p>
<p>a. Proposed costings for website transformation project<br>
b. Proposed costings including fixed budget for maintenance and hosting<br>
c. Estimate costings for future development work (for example for new online services or further integrations)</p>

  🚀 Foundation News  
 W3C DIDCore spec approved as an open web standard 
 
 The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) have approved the Decentralized Identifiers (DID) V1.0 specification as an official W3C Recommendation. This is a significant milestone in the digital identity sector. Announcing the Decentralized Identifiers (DID) v1.0 specification as an open web standard signals that it is technically sound, mature, and ready for widespread adoption. Having an established v1.0 specification allows work to continue with renewed energy and focus, not only at the many groups meeting at DIF, but across the digital identity community.<br>
Read about this decision <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/w3cdidspec-2/">on the DIF blog here</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/07/pressrelease-did-rec.html.en">the official W3C Press release here</a>. 
 
 <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">DIDComm v2 reached DIF approved spec status</a> 
 
 DIF is delighted to announce the approval of the DIDComm v2 specification from the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm working group</a>. This, along with the W3C decision on DIDs, represents a major step forward in the acceptance of decentralized identity, one that opens the path to widespread adoption and further development especially with regard to the types of peer-to-peer communication now possible. <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">Check out the DIF blog here</a> for more on the path to this milestone, what's new in v2, and where work goes from here! 
 
 <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/vui-donation/">The Verifier Universal Interface (VUI), an international self-sovereign identity interoperability initiative has been donated to DIF</a> 
 
 Together, 12 SSI organizations have led the definition of the minimum set of standard APIs necessary to implement or interoperate with the Verifier component. After months of hard work and collaboration, the VUI work has been successfully donated to DIF with the goal of furthering its evolution and reach to the international community.

 Members of the Ethereum Foundation joined the SIG to review Ethereum's Decentralized Identity discussion in general, and ideas around a 'portable KYC' system in particular. You can find the discussion on the Ethereum website <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/decentralized-identity/">here</a>, and a problem statement draft on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/sustany/dvg/wiki/Problem-Statement-Framing">here</a> 
 Invited speaker&nbsp;Anessa Allen Santos.&nbsp;Anessa's legal practice is largely dedicated to blockchain and fintech by helping innovative corporate clients navigate the evolving regulatory landscape for securities, commodities, and financial services. 
 John Popeo, a Partner at The Gallatin Group, joins the group. Before entering private practice, John spent a decade in various roles at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Having been on both sides of the regulatory divide, John brings a unique perspective to our discussion towards untangling the externalities of current AML and KYC regimes.

<p>Most breaches involve a stolen password or credential, but ironically enough, passwords are still a popular way to protect your online identity. A study conducted by Google revealed that 52% of people reuse the same password for multiple accounts, making it easy for hackers to guess your passwords. Thankfully, there has been a major shift towards a passwordless future with the development of FIDO2 by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using FIDO2, your smartphone will serve as your identity authenticator and store a passkey with the help of public and private key cryptography.</p>

<p>Google, Apple and Microsoft want to say goodbye to the principle of passwords altogether. Instead, a method jointly developed by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is to be used. The FIDO method generates a key pair on devices that is linked to a fingerprint or other biometric factors. Logging on to a cell phone is then sufficient to access accounts on a computer.</p>

 Semantic Engine project with Agri-food Data Canada at the University of Guelph&nbsp; <p>In partnership with Agri-food Data Canada at the University of Guelph, the Human Colossus Foundation is co-developing a <a href="https://agrifooddatacanada.ca/semantic-engine/">Semantic Engine for researchers</a> to create, use and export schemas using the flexible and extensible Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) as a preferred solution for data harmonisation. The semantic engine will help researchers write better data schemas with less effort to generate meaningful data.</p><blockquote><p>Agri-food Data Canada is extremely excited about working with the Human Colossus Foundation to increase the FAIRness of agri-food data.</p><p>Michelle Edwards -Director, Agri-Food Data Strategy, University of Guelph</p></blockquote><p>The summer of 2024 marks the earmarked completion of the project's next development phase. More projects on the way…</p>


 

 New Project Proposals <p>All project development at The Human Colossus Foundation is a collaborative engagement with like-minded contributors who resonate with DDE concepts, technologies, and methodologies, facilitating the development of distributed data ecosystems and harnessing the transformative power of technological and socio-economic innovation through earmarked funding. We strive to engage with collaborators in a spirit of trust, candid communication, and transparency. Our collective efforts also depend on the support and resources of governments, the private sector, communities, and individuals.</p><p>To receive updates about the Foundation’s projects, subscribe to the Foundation’s mailing list <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kRop_rIejjA22GecV--GTbKxwQLF5JVP/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<p>Two years ago, we launched an atypical foundation with a societal mission to create synergies, exposing the formidable challenges of inclusiveness and privacy in digital transformation. Nevertheless, the core design of the Human Colossus Foundation is about experimentation, progressive development, and testing.</p><p>We want to thank our early supporters in the private and public sectors for providing nearly CHF 0.5 Mio of seed funding for prototyping core components to support data harmonisation, digital event authentication and distributed ecosystem governance</p><p>Our focus now shifts from experimentation to progressive development. Funded by the EU Horizon 2020 eSSIF-Lab initiative, the closing of our DKMS-4-SSIproject marks that transition as we hit the road of no return in our journey. Here we present our path to inclusiveness and privacy in digital transformation.</p> 0. Today <p>Every day more private and public services are available online. Users receive the digital benefits of increased availability and mobility. Digital services are available everywhere all the time. But the advantages come at a price: accessibility to the platform delivering the services. Moreover, with the current economic incentive that values data over the purpose of usage, platforms collect more data than they need for the intended purposes of the service. Furthermore, data are kept behind a walled garden, forcing users to share too much data with too many institutions. </p><p>Therefore services are restricted to users with the technological capacity to access the platform. Unfortunately, the same platforms too often force a form of consent, allowing them a secondary usage of user's information outside the initial purpose.</p><p>As a result, we evolve towards a two-tier society, excluding individuals that can not access the platform or are not willing to open their private sphere for an unclear rationale.</p> 1. Inclusiveness Needs Interoperability <p>Early in the 20th century, Georges Orwell introduced the "Big Brother" concept in his novel "1984". Although, at the time caricatural, it recognised early that no single over-centralised system could cope with the diversity and complexity of society. </p><p>When it comes to digital transformation, there is a direct technological corollary: digital platforms can not scale beyond a specific limit. If they grow outside their intended purpose, societal friction appears as they can not cope with the complexity of society as a whole. The diversity of our daily activities as individuals, of our customers as businesses or citizen's needs as a government requires digital services to focus on a clear purpose. Interoperability between services tailored to their user base is the natural solution to include every specific case in our digitalised society. Interoperability should be to services what cooperation is to humans; a natural core capacity enabling growth as a group. </p><p>This interoperability of services requires first machines to talk together (the unfortunately too narrow technological definition of interoperability) while the ultimate exchange of information remains under the user's control. Thus we started with the essential element: the tooling for a decentralised cryptographic key management infrastructure (DKMS). Then, within the creativity nest provided by the eSSIF-Lab, we started building libraries allowing developers to begin their journey into the most advanced decentralised authentication architecture: KERI, the brainchild of the prolific veteran of network security, Samuel Smith. Designed for secure authentication, KERI provides the grounds for an alternative form of interoperability. The user and platform authentication does not rely on an administrative intermediary. Instead, an ambient infrastructure under the separate control of each party lets them choose an adequate level of security according to the context. Security is distributed, and interoperability can follow. </p><p>Michal, a core team member of the DKMS-4-SSI project states: </p><blockquote><p>"Distribute the responsibility and decision making for authentication and authorisation among network participants and let them decide. No more castles with giant walls but a synergistic approach where network participants interact and make decisions based upon other participants' reputations. The foundations for our alternative are very similar to what the US National Institute of Standards (NIST) proposes with the "Zero-trust concept" -- distribute". </p><p>Michal Pietrus -Senior Developer &amp; Co-Founder of ArgonAUTHs</p></blockquote> 2. Privacy Needs Cybersecurity + Information Security = Human Governance <p>Interoperability requires more than secure authentication; it requires trust between participants. The user naturally becomes the central point of overall control of his digital experience. And trust requires meaning, not faith in technology providers. </p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation sees privacy as a fundamental factor enabling human cooperation at all levels. If cybersecurity protects data, privacy protection is at a higher level where data acquires meaning. A text string becomes a name only when the data model unambiguously links it to an attribute. Our equation is simple, Data plus Meaning equals Information. It is information usage that must be governed to protect privacy.</p><p>Like authentication, to be effective at the complexity scale of the Internet, a peer-to-peer mechanism to define the meaning of data has to supplement available standards. This requirement is the motivation behind the decentralised semantics domain. As a result, we elevate privacy protection to the governance of information. In other words, securing privacy requires more than data protection regulation. It requires adherence to the complete existing legal framework of an ecosystem. </p> 3. The ambition: valuing information usage, not data itself. <p>In conclusion, to address the challenges of inclusiveness and privacy, the journey starts by solving thorny technological questions in the domains of authentication and semantics. Then, digital communication channels and the fantastic potential of digital technologies to enrich information can be included case-by-case in the existing trust frameworks (legal, ethical, cultural). This is our roadmap towards accurate information for decision-making.</p><p>Once reached, our ambition loops back to the origins of the foundation as captured by Robert Mitwicki as co-founder:</p><blockquote><p> "Data has value when it flows. It is costly when it stagnates"</p><p>Robert Mitwicki, Head of the Technology Council of the Human Colossus Foundation</p></blockquote><p>To receive updates about the Foundation and DDE v1.0, subscribe to the Foundation’s mailing list <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kRop_rIejjA22GecV--GTbKxwQLF5JVP/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

  <p>The Human Colossus Foundation, a Swiss-based independent non-profit organisation, announces the release of its eagerly-awaited Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) v1.0 architecture, describing the core concepts and technologies to enable a next-generation data-agile economy. Two years following its conception, the Foundation published today DDE v1.0, which includes the Principles and a Trust Infrastructure Stack as well as a rollout plan for a related suite of components: Overlays Capture Architecture, Trusted Digital Assistant, Data Governance Administration. In addition, a DDE Founding Donors’ Programme launch accompanies the release, offering exclusive opportunities for organisations to become the earliest DDE v1.0 contributors and experts by engaging in the next stage of development.&nbsp;</p><p>Inspired by the three co-founders' aspiration for secured, authentic data management in an increasingly digitised world, the Foundation coined the term "Dynamic Data Economy", the "DDE". With an overarching vision to empower people and organisations, the DDE enables better-informed decisions based on insights from harmonised, accurate data framed by sound data governance. It has developed an ambient cryptographic infrastructure to underpin ecosystems dealing with harmonised data within distributed governance, a paradigm shift in human-centric digital interaction, free from existing, platform-centric economic models. Further development of the DDE continues to bridge existing data standards and legacy infrastructure whilst preserving nuanced jurisdictional and human distinctions and differences in the digital space. Since its formation in 2020, the Foundation has received multiple rounds of government and private funding to develop this groundbreaking next-generation infrastructure. The release of DDE v1.0 marks the Foundation's readiness for broader collaborative stakeholders and community engagement.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“The DDE v1.0 conceptual models, methodologies, and technological infrastructure provide a realistic solution for digital transformation across distributed data ecosystems. It is about returning to the roots of how humans interact online, arming individuals and businesses with the conceptual knowledge to understand the technical design limitations of the current Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last two years, our team has contributed to open standard and open source development of the new Internet at various community forums and summarised our learning and insights into critical blog posts and webinars. It has become clear to us that we developed wrong habits in the digital space, letting technology take over our agency for authentication and privacy. We would never allow this in our physical world; nor should we have done so for the digital one. It is time for real DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, one that can create a more sustainable, scalable, and human-friendly Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>We released DDE v1.0 today to help you start seeing what we see through the DDE vision and its short-term development roadmap. We also want to invite you to participate in our journey to develop DDE further and use it to solve our collective problems. Are you ready?”</p><p>Dr. Philippe Page, Chair of the Board of Trustees</p></blockquote><p><br>DDE Principles</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  




<p>The DDE, a decentralised, network-agnostic trust infrastructure acutely aligned with the European data strategy, is built upon a set of core <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f288b25f9c364d7945e6eb/1660061875006/HCF+DDE+Principles+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Principles</a>. The DDE Principles describe the essential building blocks of any information system, leading to a trust infrastructure that preserves the structural, definitional, and contextual integrity (DDE Principle 1) of any object and their relationships in the Semantic domain, the factual authenticity (DDE Principle 2) of any recorded event in the Inputs domain, and the consensual veracity (DDE Principle 3) of any purpose-driven policy or notice in the Governance domain. As a result, actors in DDE ecosystems will ultimately have the transactional sovereignty (DDE Principle 4) to share accurate information bilaterally in the fourth domain, the Economic domain.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>DDE Trust Infrastructure Stack&nbsp;</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  




<p>To better define and describe what contributes most notably to creating a cross-sectoral trust infrastructure for access and use of data according to the DDE principles, the Foundation developed the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Trust Infrastructure Stack</a> that presents "Infrastructure" versus "Security" incrementally through the core data domains (see figure below). Deployed implementations that align with the Stack will positively affect the relationship between DDE actors and incentivise them to share horizontal data across sectors and jurisdictions. The cryptographic assurance of verifiable digital primitives and the human accountability facilitated by socio-economic data governance administrations and framework empowered by the Stack is pivotal for innovation in analytics, artificial intelligence, or other data-driven applications.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>DDE v1.0 Rollout Plan</p><p>As part of the DDE v1.0 release this year, the Foundation will launch three foundational DDE tools, which include:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a standardised global solution for data capture and exchange which protects sensitive data, providing a positive alternative to current architectures;</p>  <p>Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA), a key DDE software interface component that provides a way to look at and interact with information in distributed data ecosystems; and&nbsp;</p>  <p>Data Governance Administration (DGA), a suite of governance methodologies for distributed data ecosystems.</p>  <p>To build a community of DDE developers and advocates, the Foundation will organise community events to facilitate learning and dialogue, launching the Colossi Network later in 2022 as an open forum for more structured community collaboration and contribution.</p>

<p>First public review - ends August 27th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC are pleased to announce that Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Architecture Specification Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment. This is the first public review for this specification.</p>



<p>Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyber defense via statically configured products operating in isolation is untenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system and between systems. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. A high level overview of OpenC2 featuring insights from the Technical Director of NSA’s Capabilities Directorate can be viewed at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCooyNJoOrU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCooyNJoOrU</a>.</p>



<p>This specification describes the abstract architecture of OpenC2 to define a common understanding of the messages and interactions for all bindings and serializations.</p>

<p>Newly Elected Bret Jordan and Duncan Sparrell Expand Board’s Expertise in Cybersecurity and Promote Further Collaboration in Standards and Open Source</p> 


<p>28 July 2022 — OASIS Open, the international standards and open source consortium, announced the results of its Board of Directors election. Duncan Sparrell of sFractal Consulting, and Bret Jordan were elected to the Board while Jeremy Allison of Google, Jim Cabral of InfoTrack, Gershon Janssen of Reideate, and Altaz Valani of Security Compass were re-elected to two-year terms. The continuing members of the OASIS Board, whose terms extend through July 2023, are Nima Dokoohaki, Ph.D., of Accenture; Ross Gardler of Microsoft; Anish Karmarkar, Ph.D., of Oracle; Jason Keirstead of IBM; and Daniel Riedel of Copado.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Board members’ extensive industry experience and dedication to serving the OASIS community helps extend the Board’s reach and further establishes OASIS as the home for open source projects and standards in cybersecurity, blockchain, privacy, cryptography, cloud computing, IoT, urban mobility, emergency management, and other content technologies.</p>



<p>“The OASIS Board reflects the tremendous diversity of our member base, bringing together executives from multinational companies, start-ups, and consultancies with interests across the spectrum of open innovation,” said Gershon Janssen, Director of Architecture at Reideate who chairs the OASIS Board of Directors. “It’s really a nexus of thought leadership–all focused on what’s ahead for OASIS, standards, and open source development.”</p>



<p>“OASIS Open has a culture of inclusive interaction and a long-standing tradition of excellence in creating and defining international standards,” said Bret Jordan, who co-chairs the OASIS CACAO cybersecurity playbooks committee. “OASIS promotes and enables open and freely available standards and specifications that are vital to the success of the technologies we all rely on every day. I am excited to once again serve on the OASIS Open Board of Directors.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Having my peers entrust me to participate in setting the vision for a tremendously impactful organization like OASIS is at once a great honor, inestimable privilege, and serious responsibility,” said Duncan Sparrell, a former AT&amp;T executive who co-chairs the OASIS OpenC2 cybersecurity standards group. “All of which leave me feeling humbled and grateful to have been selected as a member of the Board of Directors.”</p>



<p>Jeremy Allison of Google’s Open Source Program Office said, “I am very grateful to the OASIS Community for being given a chance to continue to serve OASIS on behalf of Google.

<p>In late June, as a part of <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/meet-our-new-matchbox-partners/">our work with Ugandan organisation Albinism Umbrella</a>, we hosted a<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/invite-community-call-responsible-data-social-justice/"> Community Call about Responsible Data</a>. The call included speakers <a href="https://twitter.com/amosdoornbos">Amos Doornbos and </a>former Engine Roomer <a href="https://twitter.com/paolasinu">Paola Verhaert</a> and brought together a variety of civil society organisations interested in collecting, managing, and storing data in equitable and responsible ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversation was centred on the risks and potential harms of data management, and how to go about integrating responsible data into an organisations’ ongoing work. Below are some of the insights that surfaced in the call.</p>



 Starting from the top: figuring out what data you are using 



<p>Speaker Amos Doornbos pointed out that it is best to start by identifying the ways in which your organisation is using data. It can be easy to underestimate how much data you’re collecting in your day-to-day work, how your team is using it (or not using it!) and what is actually being done with all of it. He introduced the following guiding questions, as well as <a href="https://thisisamos.com/data-inventory-map-fillable-template/">this short Cheat sheet</a>, to support the process of mapping this out:&nbsp;</p>



  What data is being collected and why?&nbsp;  Who is collecting it?&nbsp;  Where is it stored?&nbsp;  Who is this data shared with?&nbsp;  



<p>For further support, The Engine Room’s <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/">Becoming RAD! [Retaining, Archiving, and Disposal]</a> Tipsheets can guide you through some of the processes in more detail.&nbsp;</p>



 Responsible data as an organisation-wide priority 



<p>Our speakers also talked about how important it can be for the whole organisation (and if possible, also the organisation’s partners and the communities they work with) to be involved in conversations about potential risks and harms related to the data the organisation collects, stores and works with. Data is not just an issue for the “tech person” on your team: the consequences of the ways individuals on the team use data will affect the whole of your work. In addition to that, taking your team’s different experiences and perspectives into account is a good way of designing your data strategy and solutions that work for all.</p>



 Mitigating risk and potential harm 



<p>Much of our conversation focused on the importance of assessing how the data we work with could generate or exacerbate risks for the people reflected in the data. Our speakers shared the following resources to support teams in reflecting on potential risks and harms:</p>



  <a href="https://thisisamos.com/2022/02/09/identifying-potential-data-risks-and-harms/">Identifying Potential Data Risks and Harms</a>  <a href="https://thisisamos.com/cheat-sheets/">Data Sharing Cheat Sheet</a> (scroll down the page)  



<p>We also talked about how practising data minimisation – that is minimising the amount and the categories of data you collect – can be a good strategy to prevent potential harm. If the data you collect does not serve a purpose for your work, consider deleting it and/or not collecting it all.</p>



 Participation is key 



<p>Another insight from our speakers referred to consent practices: The communities you serve should be informed about potential risks associated with your use of their data, and should be able to withdraw their consent regarding the data you store at any point. That is why baking participation into your processes is a good practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Relatedly, a key point that emerged in the call was this: Responsible data is not a one-off thing. It’s not a conversation you have once (for example, at the moment that you’re collecting data from the people you work with).&nbsp; Context regularly changes (and so do the potential risks you and your organisation face), so plan accordingly. One way to do this is by creating user-friendly check-ins throughout your project to inform people about what’s happening with their data, making room for them to exercise their agency and select whether to opt-in or out.&nbsp;</p>



 Be specific and realistic with your data management goals&nbsp; 



<p>A different suggestion that came up in the call is to avoid broad and abstract recommendations and processes when implementing responsible data practices in your organisation. Paola Verhaert highlighted how important it is to make them clear and practical, so that they can be implemented easily. Staff might not have extra time on their hands to spend on this, so being specific and realistic with your data management goals is a good way of making sure your team is able to implement them.&nbsp;</p>



 Where to start? 



<p>Changing the way your organisation operates can seem overwhelming. If you need support advocating for changes around your data practices, look for allies both within your own organisation and in the sector (the <a href="https://responsibledata.io/get-involved/">Responsible Data Community</a> might be a good place to start!).

<p>The OriginTrail ecosystem is a two-layer system, driving its two symbiotic networks by their respective crypto tokens — the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (hosting the multichain OriginTrail DKG, as indicated<a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper?section=origintrail-technology-stack"> in the whitepaper</a>) driven by its utility token TRAC, and the underlying blockchains with their respective native tokens used for transactions.</p><p>The OriginTrail Decentralized Network utility enabled by the TRAC token therefore requires each of the respective blockchains to support the TRAC token according to the TRAC tokenomics design, and requires necessary bridge infrastructure between relevant chains. TRAC being an ERC20 token on Ethereum has been so far successfully bridged to two blockchains — Gnosis chain (formerly xDAI) and Polygon with their respective bridge infrastructure.</p><p>With the launch of the dedicated OriginTrail blockchain on Polkadot — the OriginTrail Parachain — the required bridge infrastructure needs to be created to facilitate the OriginTrail DKG operation on this new chain. Moreover, the same infrastructure will enable further network effects for TRAC on all of Polkadot emerging parachain infrastructure and solutions, such as Acala and its DeFi stack (DEX, aUSD stablecoin, etc).</p><p>The purpose of this document is to outline the technical approach to bridging the TRAC token to Polkadot via the OriginTrail Parachain and collect relevant feedback from the OriginTrail community.</p> Bridging TRAC to OriginTrail Parachain and&nbsp;Polkadot <p>Polkadot is a network designed to enable high interoperability between blockchains and inter-blockchain trustless operations, such as bridging Polkadot based tokens on connected blockchains. As a multi blockchain network of parachains connected via the common Layer 0 Polkadot Relay Chain, bridging tokens is enabled by the powerful <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain">cross chain messaging format XCM</a>. Using these inherent functionalities of Polkadot therefore solves the “bridging problem” within the entire Polkadot ecosystem — once the TRAC token is available on the OriginTrail Parachain, making it available to other parachains is a non-issue.</p><p>When it comes to external blockchains such as Ethereum however, there are a multitude of bridging approaches evolving in parallel. Two of the most promising approaches at the moment of writing this RFC&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://snowbridge.snowfork.com/">Snowbridge</a>, a general purpose trustless bridge in development by the Snowfork team, yet to be launched,  <a href="https://chainbridge.chainsafe.io/">Chainbridge</a>, an EVM to Substrate bridge already available and in utilization by parachains such as Moonbeam and Centrifuge.  <p>As development progresses, we can naturally expect new and improved bridging solutions in the years to come. Therefore, bridging of TRAC to the OriginTrail Parachain will, over time, most likely involve a multitude of different bridges and related infrastructure as the Polkadot ecosystem evolves. It is therefore essential to plan for this eventuality from the start and thus enable the bridge infrastructure evolution to be “inherited” by the TRAC bridges on the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>It is important to note that TRAC token will stay an ERC-20 token on Ethereum and will be implemented as a bridgeable asset on the OriginTrail Parachain, which operates with its native token&nbsp;OTP.</p> Near term bridging approach — Chainbridge <p>Out of the two approaches outlined above, the core developers of OriginTrail propose the implementation of the Chainbridge bridge system for the first TRAC bridge between Ethereum and OriginTrail Parachain. Chainbridge is a battle tested, two way bridge, used by several teams within the Polkadot ecosystem to move assets to parachains.</p><p>Chainbridge implements a bridge smart contract on the Ethereum side (similar to Gnosis and Polygon bridges), with a respective pallet enabled on the OriginTrail Parachain. Tokens are transferred between the Ethereum bridge contract and the parachain via a set of relayers which listen for bridging events on both blockchains and executing the necessary transfers on the blockchain on the “other side” of the bridge, as illustrated below.</p><p>The bridged TRAC token will be implemented as a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-assets">parachain asset </a>on the OriginTrail Parachain and further bridged to the EVM&nbsp;pallet.</p><p>The Chainbridge implementation has been significantly researched by the OriginTrail core developers and progressed in implementation together with assistance from the Parity development team. To our knowledge and experience it is the most mature and tested system within the ecosystem and is the proposed solution for the near&nbsp;term.</p><p>However, as most existing bridges (such as Gnosis and Polygon bridges) its trust model can be improved, as explained in the <a href="https://chainbridge.chainsafe.io/">Chainbridge docs</a>:</p><p>“In its current state ChainBridge operates under a trusted federation model. Deposit events on one chain are detected by a trusted set of off-chain relayers who await finality, submit events to the other chain and vote on submissions to reach acceptance triggering the appropriate handler. Research is currently underway to reduce the levels of trust required and move toward a fully trust-less bridge.”</p><p>Therefore a key component of this proposal is to avoid “bridge lock-in” and enable further development of the OriginTrail bridging infrastructure to involve more trust-minimized solutions (such as Snowfork when&nbsp;ready).</p><p>The initial set of bridge relayers will be run by OriginTrail core developers, with an ambition to include additional relayers from the ecosystem in the near&nbsp;future.</p> Long term approach — multiple&nbsp;bridges <p>We expect a multitude of improvements as bridging infrastructure evolves to support more than one bridge on the OriginTrail Parachain. These will most likely include improvements in security models (trustless bridges), efficiency and user experience. It’s important to note however that having multiple bridge systems bridging the same asset effectively creates multiple “mirror versions” of the same asset on the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>To enable a sustainable, long term evolution of the bridging infrastructure therefore 3 key considerations need to be applied from the&nbsp;start:</p>  Ensuring equivalence of bridged TRAC tokens as they might need to be implemented as “different” assets on the OriginTrail Parachain — for example, a TRAC token bridged via Chainbridge and a TRAC token bridged via Snowfork might be two “mirror version” assets on the parachain, with essentially the same value (1 TRAC). Equivalence would involve enabling OriginTrail DKG and other systems utilizing TRAC to register all TRAC mirror versions on the Parachain as the same (equivalent).  Appropriate mirror asset naming should be applied to avoid confusion, especially as these assets move across the Polkadot ecosystem.  “Phase out” capability for mirror assets in case of potential bridge issues (such as a major flaw being discovered), which would enable a safe decommission of potentially problematic bridges, ensuring TRAC tokenomics preservation.  <p>Having these points in place while implementing the first bridge is important and already taken into consideration by the core development team.</p> Conclusion <p>This document outlines the near and long term approach of enabling the utilization of TRAC token in the Polkadot ecosystem via the OriginTrail Parachain token. We invite the OriginTrail community to provide their improvement proposals, comments and suggestions via the <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository">official RFC repository</a>.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">OriginTrail Twitter</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain">OriginTrail Parachain Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-12-origintrail-parachain-trac-bridges-57bb6852dfa7">OT-RFC-12 OriginTrail Parachain TRAC bridges</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Exploration of Verite verification patterns, with a focus on non-DID wallets. Part 2 in a 2-part series

<p>Part 2 of this 2-part series explains the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md">did:pkh</a>/<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md#simple-summary">CACAO</a> variation for Verite data models and flows, which provides an entry path for wallets that may not support sufficient functionality for emerging decentralized identity patterns</p><p>Since some wallets may not themselves be willing to embed protocol-specific logic (interaction with verifiers) or more general verifiable-credential logic, we have to find a kind of "minimum viable" level of support for today’s non-DID-enabled crypto wallets. While handling DIDs and signing Verifiable Presentations brings a kind of secure indirection that enables portability and multi-chain wallets, these properties are not strictly essential to the core functionality of Verite. For this reason, we define a crypto wallet that can receive and pass to dApps a Verifiable Credential issued against its blockchain address adequate, with a few adjustments and supplements.</p> Phase 0: Issuance Directly to Crypto Wallet<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>In a crypto-wallet centric end-to-end flow, the trust model is different and the interplay between credential wallet and crypto wallet can be greatly simplified. The credentials themselves must also be slightly different– instead of obtaining the credential subject DID directly from the wallet to which they are being issued, the issuer will use a credential subject identifier based on a specific blockchain address controlled by that wallet. Using DID terminology, rather than attest to the controller of a wallet, it attests only to a specific address controlled by that wallet.</p><p>This greatly simplifies the ownership question, by relying on native mechanisms for proving ownership of the address– at the time of issuance, as well as at time of verification of the credentials.</p> Two Options of Expressing a Blockchain address as a DID (and as a VC subject)<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Instead of defining the subject of the VC as a chain-agnostic DID provided by the wallet, the issuer will deterministically generate a DID from the blockchain address controlled by the connected wallet. Multiple DID methods allow this possibility; we’ll describe two of them, assuming a wallet with an Ethereum address (referred to as <code>ETH_ADDRESS</code>).</p>  did:key method - issue against a crypto wallet’s public key: If the issuer has the wallet address <code>ETH_ADDRESS</code> and any signature over a known message, the corresponding public key can be recovered using the <code>ecrecover</code> mechanism ported over from Bitcoin in the early days of Ethereum. In this way. the issuer can deterministically obtain a<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/"> did:key</a> DID that will be used as the value of <code>credentialSubject.id</code>. This is the method Circle will begin with, for ease of implementation by participants.  In this case, the mapping is:<code> did:key:&lt;ecrecover(ETH_ADDRESS, signature)&gt;</code>  For blockchains that do not use a Bitcoin-style pay2hash address system, like Solana and Polkadot, no recovery from a signature is necessary because the base form of the address is already a public key supported by <code><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-multiformats-multibase">multibase</a> </code>and thus by <code><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/#introduction">did:key</a></code>.    did:pkh method - issue against a crypto wallet’s public address: Other DID methods, like [did:pkh](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md), allow DIDs to be defined directly based on blockchain addresses in their commonly-used, public-facing forms. Long term, this is the preferred method. Among other advantages, the implementation across chains is more apparent. - In this case, the mapping is: <code>did:pkh:eip155:1:&lt;ETH_ADDRESS&gt;</code>. eip155 here refers to the EVM namespace (defined in EIP155), while 1 refers to the ethereum mainnet according to EIP155. - Just as the did:key URI scheme relies on the <code>[multibase](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-multiformats-multibase)</code> registry, so does the did:pkh URI scheme rely on the ChainAgnostic Standards Alliance’s [namespace registry](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/namespaces) to add non-EVM namespaces. - In cases where human-readability is important, end-users can introspect the VC and see their familiar address, as opposed to a public key that in pay2hash systems like BTC or ETH, they might never have seen or know they control   Sign-In With Ethereum and dApp-native Identity<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Wallets that have not incorporated decentralized identity capabilities rarely support JWT _signing _features, or other token mechanics that are common to the traditional web2 identity world. For this reason, many web3 sites and dApps have started using the wallet connection pattern to create a more feature-rich and auditable session mechanism via offchain message signing (i.e. <code>personal_sign</code> on EVM systems). Equivalents for other blockchain ecosystems, such as Solana, are forthcoming.</p><p>In the case of issuance, this signature is enough to extract the crypto wallet’s public key, as mentioned above. Importantly, though, it also enables delegated keys to sign offchain events without another onerous or fraught wallet-interaction, as we will see below.</p> Phase 1: Off-chain Verification<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a>  Variant: Crypto-Wallet only with only VC storage capabilities<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>At verification time, when a wallet "connects” to a dApp by providing an off-chain signature over a structured <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/5e9b0fe0728e160f56dd1e4cbf7dc0a0b1772f82/EIPS/eip-4361.md#informal-message-template">authentication message</a>, the dApp will have the wallet’s address (and live proof-of-control, if the authentication message included a secure nonce) so it can simply compare this address with the corresponding DID:PKH <code>credentialSubject.id</code> of the VC. This way, the verifier will not need to do an ownership check on the VC, and the dApp can trust the verifier to have received credentials from the right wallet because it, too, will require a wallet connection and prove ownership of the same wallet.</p><p>Without necessarily even having to parse, validity-check, or introspect the verifiable credentials, any wallet that can store them (whether as JWTs or even as raw text files) can submit them directly to verifiers, as shown below.</p><p></p><p>Note: while it is recommended that crypto wallets parse verifiable credentials and check their validity or safety, crypto wallets could in theory allow blind passthrough if the user can assume the responsibility for their contents. In the Verite case, there are little security concerns or abuses possible.</p><p>By itself, however, this bare VC is inferior to a VP from a full-featured decentralized-identity wallet, since it does not contain a non-repudiable off-chain wallet signature for auditing purposes. Or, to put it another way, it is only as trustworthy as the authentication of the wallet that sent it to you, and there is little standardization of the receipts you keep of crypto-wallet authentication to replay it for a future auditor or security review.</p><p>While the corner cases of impersonation or exfiltrated VCs might be vanishingly rare, the "audit trail” of a bare VC is weaker than a VC wrapped in a timestamped signature. For this reason, we encourage Verite dApps to create a functional equivalent to a verifiable presentation in the form of a signed presentation receipt (signed with a session-specific ephemeral key) for logging purposes. To accomplish this, we return to the Sign-In With Ethereum pattern to elaborate on its key delegation feature.</p> Sign-In With Ethereum Flow<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>As mentioned above, we support the emerging standard approach of the "Sign-In With Ethereum” mechanism which defines a sign-in message that includes a domain-binding anchor, an ephemeral session key, and other caveats. While the ephemeral session key property was not essential to the issuance wallet connection, it can be useful in the verification situation for more trustless (and auditable) logging.</p><p>By generating an ephemeral key and including it in the initial wallet-connection message for the crypto wallet to sign over upon authenticating itself to the dApp, the wallet effectively "delegates” that ephemeral key for the duration of the session. In UX terms, this saves the user from a distinct off-chain wallet signature at each confirmation or consent event. Carefully defining the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361#message-field-descriptions">other properties</a> of the SIWE message, dApps can secure and constrain that delegation, link to an applicable terms-of-service agreement, enable DNS-based domain-checks analogous to the "lock symbol” in modern browsers, etc.</p><p>Once the user has "connected” their wallet by signing this SIWE message, a CACAO is generated as a receipt of that session (and of the delegation of signing rights to the key). This allows the dApp to use smoother UX than requiring a full off-chain wallet signature to confirm each consent event or internal transaction (such as the presentation of VCs in a signed VP). But it also provides a compact and tamperproof way of encapsulating each event or internal transaction as a time-stamped and signed object for logging purposes– this makes each event as verifiable as an off-chain (or on-chain) signature, via the indirection of the delegated key.</p> Ownership Verification<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>You could say that the crypto wallet delegates the encapsulation and signature of a VP to the dApp, which creates a short-lived key with which to sign the VP, which is a kind of standardized logging object for a presentation event. This allows the verifier to confirm that the dApp is interacting on behalf of the wallet. Since the Verifier has confirmed control of the wallet address with a SIWE message, and the VC is issued to the address directly, there is no ownership verification needed as with a decentralized wallet; thanks to the CACAO, future auditors can replay these interactions and re-check signatures and tamper-proof objects to confirm all of these transactions trustlessly.</p> Detailed Flow<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p></p>  Wallet initiates DeFi transaction with dApp.  dApp generates a session-specific ephemeral signing key and encoded it in the SIWE message for the wallet to sign. This generated session key will delegate the wallet for future signings, once after wallet vouches it (by signing the CACAO).  Once the wallet has signed it and returned it to the dApp, the signature and message are encoded into a compact <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md">CACAO</a> session receipt for logging and forensic purposes (if needed).  Next the dApp lets the verifier know about the session, by POSTing the receipt to an endpoint (eg. <a href="https://github.com/centrehq/verite-minter-allowlist/blob/main/backend/src/index.js#L136">signIn</a>). The signed receipt also includes <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md#test-cases">caveats</a>, a domain-binding, an expiration, and other constraints to secure the delegation and the transfer of the session parameters.  The verifier saves the CACAO. The verifier only uses this CACAO in the scope of this verification session (to prove the VP signed by the ephemeral key). Once the CACAO verification step is completed, the session object will be updated.  Instead of sending the wallet to verify directly with the verifier (as in the previous post), the wallet will submit the VC directly to the dapp (or an agent/service it trusts). The dApp presents the prompt to verify.  Wallet submits the bare VC.  Subsequent requests from the dApp will include a reference to the session which the verifier can use if they need to check signatures made by that key. The VC(s) submitted by the dApp in this case will not be signed in a VP with the wallet’s key; instead, it/they will be put into a VP and signed by the dApp using the ephemeral key (the signing key mentioned in the first step above) delegated to it by the SIWE message. Introspection into the CACAO is required to extract the public key that signed the VP, as well as a signature from the wallet key over the public key.  When all the information is submitted to the verifier, the verifier needs to examine the ownership of the credential:  Extract the public key of the session signing key from the resources section of the CACAO  Use the public key of the session signing key to validate the VP’s signature. This is to ensure that the dApp properly (which held the key and got user consent to delegate signing rights to it) signed the VP and that it has not been tampered with in transport.  Compare <code>iss</code> in CACAO with the wallet’s DID in VC (in this case a did:pkh representing the wallet address as a long URI). They should match, if the dApp’s SIWE message. conforms to the SIWE specification. This is to check the wallet which vouched the session key is the subject (and holder) of the VC, which is also connected to the dApp with a signature over a nonce, included in the CACAO to keep future auditors from having to trust the verifier.     Conclusion:<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Circle’s implementation of the Verite protocol allows us to serve our customers and the dApps they interact with equally, putting the rigor of our KYC processes at the service of a process that is auditable and verifiable end-to-end without duplicating KYC process or PII from those processes across the chain of asset custody. We are proud to be driving the Verite process, and welcome more implementations, whether end-to-end issuer+verifier solutions like ours or more focused implementations that bring more wallets and more users into the ecosystem.</p><p>As the Centre team updates its documentation and sample implementation to reflect the new patterns and flows, we will continue to work with them to share the insights we are gaining from our exploratory work with dApps and clients.</p>
