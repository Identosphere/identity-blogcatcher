 Exploring the Evolution of Trust in Networks Over the Next&nbsp;Decade <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/towards-a-manifesto-for-open-recognition-07b2606efd81">Previously</a>, we discussed working towards a manifesto for <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>, an initiative which involves envisioning what we might call ‘plausible utopias’. This is work for and on behalf of the Open Recognition is for Everybody (ORE) Community, which is stewarded by <a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> and sponsored by <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>.</p>Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>In this post, we explore these plausible utopias over five-year and ten-year time horizons, bearing in mind the balance between institutional credentials and community-based recognition. It’s not a case of either/or but both-and. We need credentials from institutions to prove everything from our identity to our ability to perform at a high level. But we also need a way of giving and receiving recognition in ways that go beyond credentials. In short, we want to create a world that eliminates unfair hoops and hurdles that go along with systemic injustices and institutional bias. But read on for more specifics.</p> What is Open Recognition? <p>A quick reminder of what we mean by Open Recognition, from <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">this&nbsp;post</a>:</p><blockquote>Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.</blockquote> Open Recognition by 2029: A Five-Year Outlook Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>Considering the significant interest and investment in skills-based hiring, it is likely to fully develop within the next five years. The progress of this trend is likely to be unevenly distributed; the USA, where the bulk of the funding is available, will no doubt lead the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Skills-based hiring is an approach to recruitment that prioritises a candidate’s skills and competencies over traditional credentials. This includes the actual abilities required to perform a job well, and is a combination of technical skills, ‘durable’ (aka ‘soft’) skills, and the ability to problem-solve. The idea is that it widens the talent pool, reduces bias inherent in the hiring process, and aligns candidates more closely with the needs of the&nbsp;job.</p> Going Beyond&nbsp;Work <p>While it can be useful to put people into categories and to match them to jobs, there is more to life than work. So while skills-based hiring is an important step into a plausible utopia for Open Recognition, let’s paint a broader and more holistic&nbsp;picture.</p><p>The definition of Open Recognition used above includes “recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions.” We envisage a continuing focus on the right of self-determination of all people, including within online and offline networks. We also see a world in which peer recognition is valuable and honoured in hiring and acceptance processes. This means, where appropriate, badges for everything from knowledge within indigenous communities to recognition for the determined and resilient person who shows up for others, no matter&nbsp;what.</p><p>CVs and resumes will start to be replaced by digital portfolios which can be shown via mobile devices and shared with others via web links. Whereas CVs and resumes are claim-based, in that the person they represent claims to know or have done a thing, badges are evidence-based, as they provide evidence that the person can do something — or stands in a particular relationship to another individual or organisation. In addition, digital portfolios will begin to hold <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">Verifiable Credentials</a>, both those issued by governments or higher learning institutions, as well as VCs issued in communities and by&nbsp;peers.</p><p>Community learning is particularly well-placed to provide the recognition of talents which are so valuable in all aspects of society. People who participate in communities of practice develop all sorts of skills that often go unrecognised. For example, facilitation skills are useful not only in the world of work, but also in the contexts of family life, sports, and activism. Being able to quickly see what experience and abilities you have within a group of people can be particularly useful, especially in times of&nbsp;need.</p> Open Recognition in 2034: A Ten-Year&nbsp;Vision Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>The next decade could see significant shifts in how we approach education and professional development. There has long been talk about the ‘disruption’ of formal education systems which are (mistakenly) labelled as being fit only for the Industrial Revolution. While teachers do a great job in difficult circumstances, when looking a decade into the future, we can begin to imagine a world where educational journeys are bespoke, mapped out through different forms of recognition.</p><p>Some of this recognition may be through formal institutional credentials, gained as a result of summative assessment. In other words, you are still likely to get credentials for passing exams, but these will increasingly be&nbsp;digital.</p> Innovations in Recognition <p>But there are more ways to prove that you know or can do a thing than through high-stakes examinations. One of our favourite ways of using badges for Open Recognition includes pledging for a badge and then working towards it. Another is self-issuing badges for skills you have taught yourself, and then asking others to endorse those badges. Other approaches include mentorship, participation in community events, and interest-based badges — for example with creative pursuits.</p><p>We expect some strides to be made towards the automation of what is often called APL (Assessing Prior Learning) or RPL (Recognition of Prior Learning). While it will still be useful to keep a human in the loop, AI technology is advancing to help us use Rich Skills Descriptors (RSDs) to help with misunderstandings around semantics.</p><p>Take volunteering, something which is sadly on the decline in the western world. There are many different ways to donate your skills to groups or organisations that need help. With a little help from technology, it will be normal to be matched with opportunities based on the recognition you have received in the form of&nbsp;badges.</p><p>In ten years time, the digital portfolios of credentials, badges and other pieces of recognition will be commonplace. They will be built on top of open technology, like open source wallets, and using W3C standards. The best way to ensure that the ecosystem around Open Recognition flourishes in the future is to build it in the&nbsp;open.</p> Trusting Recognition Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>Both the short term and long term vision described here relies on the evolution of trust within our networks. Luckily, for over a decade, technologists have been working on standards and methods to help people verify their skills through both claims and evidence. Hundreds of millions of digital credentials based on standards-compliant technologies are issued every year. We are no longer working on <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/advocating-for-learner-centric-badge-systems-21a65be4a725">spreading awareness</a> of what digital credentialing is or could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Years ago, we needed to get people to accept the idea of digital credentials as a plausible alternative to physical credentials. What we need now is an ecosystem that places value not only on the reputation of the issuer, but the story the earner wants to tell about themselves. Because this ecosystem is built on open standards and increasingly on top of open technologies, we are building trust into digital credentialing writ&nbsp;large.</p> Conclusion <p>None of this vision is free, cheap or easy. In fact, it’s taken over a decade and millions invested into wide reaching projects and problem spaces. When you’re building an alternative to a system that was built before the invention of the World Wide Web, it can take some time to convince people that a different way is possible. Open Badges, Verifiable Credentials and the people who build and make the projects and ecosystem around these technologies need support to continue advancing a system that is designed to level the playing field for everyday learners and&nbsp;earners.</p><p>If you’re looking to enhance your professional development programme or educational initiative through Open Recognition, get in touch with <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> — we’re here to&nbsp;help!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">Plausible Utopias: the future of Open Recognition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 “FIDO Drives Strong&nbsp;&nbsp;Authentication Results&nbsp;&nbsp;for the State of Michigan’s&nbsp;&nbsp;MiLogin” 



<p>The State of Michigan’s Department of Technology, Management &amp;&nbsp; Budget (DTMB) is a principal department of the state’s government&nbsp; responsible for providing a wide range of support functions to other state&nbsp; agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The department’s broad spectrum of responsibilities includes technology&nbsp; services, labor market information, facilities management, financial&nbsp; services, procurement, retirement services, real estate management, the&nbsp; Michigan public safety communication system, fleet and records&nbsp; management, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DTMB also plays a crucial role in cybersecurity for the state,&nbsp; providing resources and tools to protect against cyber threats and&nbsp; manage the State’s IT infrastructure. One of the DTMB’s efforts is the&nbsp; MiLogin digital identity solution, which enables over 10 million users to&nbsp; access state government services securely and conveniently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DTMB was looking to secure MiLogin, Michigan’s application that allows&nbsp; users to access multiple state applications and services with a single user&nbsp; ID, with strong authentication that improves user experience and decided&nbsp; to go with passkeys, based on FIDO authentication.&nbsp;</p>



 Passkeys are a password replacement that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices. Unlike passwords, passkeys are resistant to phishing, are always strong, and are designed so that there are no shared secrets. 



 Key Objectives&nbsp; 



<p>The State of Michigan aimed to address several key objectives with the integration of passkeys:</p>



<p>Enhance the digital user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal was to streamline the digital user experience, particularly in providing users with seamless access to critical state&nbsp; government services. DTMB aimed to simplify the login process, making it more user-friendly and efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reduce help desk support dependency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing the strain on help desk resources due to login access issues, DTMB sought to reduce users’ need to access help desk support. By implementing changes to enhance the login process, the goal was to empower users to navigate.</p>



<p>Fortify security resilience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no shortage of risk and vulnerabilities associated with traditional username and password authentication. A key&nbsp; objective was to fortify the system against security threats and phishing incidents, by adopting advanced FIDO strong&nbsp; authentication to mitigate the risks commonly exploited by bad actors seeking unauthorized access.</p>



 The Importance of Open Standards and Interoperability&nbsp; 



<p>Before deciding to implement passkeys, the DTMB explored a proprietary passwordless login solution offered by a cloud based identity-as-a-solution (IDaaS) provider. However, the solution lacked the interoperability required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DTMB determined early on in its process that open standard and interoperability were critical and required&nbsp; components of its strong authentication strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A standards-based approach provides interoperability across popular device types and web browsers, maintains vendor&nbsp; neutrality, allows for cost savings through community adoption, and a pathway to adopt future innovations in the FIDO&nbsp; ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 The Solution: FIDO Drives Results&nbsp; 



<p>Passkeys checked all the boxes for the DTMB, utilizing open standards and an interoperable approach for authentication.</p>



<p>The DTMB found that passkeys provide the following advantages:</p>



 
 Passkeys are based on open standards, ensuring interoperability without&nbsp;&nbsp;necessitating additional software for users to download.&nbsp; 



 Multiple vendor support for FIDO standards and the tech’s rapid&nbsp;&nbsp;adoption promotes the long-term continuity of FIDO authentication as a&nbsp;&nbsp;service.&nbsp; 



 FIDO standards accommodate various authenticator types (such as&nbsp;&nbsp;biometric sensors, hardware keys, etc.) across desktop and mobile&nbsp;&nbsp;devices, catering to the DTMB’s user base’s diverse authentication&nbsp;&nbsp;requirements.&nbsp; 



 Prioritizing user and ecosystem partner security, passkeys provide strong&nbsp;&nbsp;phishing resistance.&nbsp; 
 



 MiLogin’s Path to Passkeys&nbsp; 



<p>The DTMB’s passkey rollout involved a meticulous process to ensure a seamless, secure transition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Extensive research on passwordless authentication solutions was conducted, engaging the DTMB’s cybersecurity review&nbsp; board in the evaluation process. Upon selecting passkeys for further exploration, the DTMB delved into the analysis of&nbsp; various FIDO options and sought feedback from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working together with Deloitte, which is the DTMB’s trusted systems integrator for the State’s enterprise digital identity&nbsp; solution, a comprehensive strategy was planned for the design, development, and implementation phases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the design phase, insights from the FIDO Alliance’s usability study results were working into screen and workflow&nbsp; designs. Findings from the DTMB’s MiLogin human-centered design usability study were also used to create a user&nbsp; experience tailored to address the diverse needs of various personas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The development phase focused on integrating MiLogin with FIDO authentication methods, accompanied by the creation&nbsp; of animated user help guides and tutorial videos to drive greater user adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Post-implementation, the DTMB monitored production metrics and gathered feedback from end-users, ensuring the&nbsp; success of the implementation and identifying areas for functionality enhancements in future releases.</p>



 MiLogin’s Impressive Passwordless Results&nbsp; 



<p>Within the first six months of release, MiLogin achieved impressive results for the State of Michigan: </p>



 
 100,000+ customer devices enrolled in passkeys&nbsp; 



 ~18,000 new passkey enrollments per month&nbsp; 



 Increased FIDO-based logins with zero reported issues&nbsp; 



 Decreased help desk initiated password resets with 1,300 fewer calls&nbsp; related to password resets in a single month.&nbsp; 
 



 



<blockquote>
<p>“I am proud that our MiLogin team has brought passwordless authentication to our public&nbsp; digital identities. Passwordless brings additional protections to our public digital identities, and&nbsp; helps protect our systems from account takeover attempts such as brute force and password&nbsp; spray attacks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
– Jayson Cavendish, Chief Security Officer, State of Michigan, DTMB&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>The Road Ahead for Passwordless in the State of Michigan&nbsp;</p>



<p>The State of Michigan anticipates a significant increase in passkey adoption, targeting over 10 million public users.&nbsp; They also plan to implement passwordless authentication for their workforce, integrating with their state directory&nbsp; services solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO authentication is a part of the State of Michigan’s Zero Trust Identity strategy to establish a secure identity in citizen&nbsp; interactions with state services. It will also improve the user experience, generate cost savings for the state, and increase adoption of the State’s digital identity solution by diverse state agency partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what advice does the DTMB have for other other organizations? The State of Michigan recommends understanding&nbsp; diverse user bases and use cases, prioritizing user experience, and incorporating usability studies, clear end-user messaging,&nbsp; and a well-designed communication plan for a successful FIDO authentication implementation.</p>

<p>As mentioned in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/web3-points-library/">post introducing our points library</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Solutions SDK</a> also contains examples (found within the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/demo?ref=blog.ceramic.network">demo directory</a>) designed to help developers understand how to use the libraries within a larger application context. The remainder of this article will walk through a tutorial of the "full-stack app" example. If you prefer to follow a video tutorial, visit our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75IZp2oYncM&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">YouTube video</a> of this tutorial. </p> The Use Case: Rewarding Points for Joining a Community <p>This example offers a simple demonstration of how one could use the points library to reward community members for their engagement such as joining key platforms. To keep things simple, this tutorial will walk through the act of joining a Discord server as the trigger.</p> Getting Started <p>While an identical version of this example lives directly in the SDK repository, we've pulled it into a separate codebase for this walk-through. To get started, clone the code, install your dependencies, and duplicate the example environment file:</p> <code>// if you don't have pnpm installed
npm install -g pnpm@9

// otherwise: 
git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example &amp;&amp; cd points-example
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env</code> <p>Next, we'll need to configure a few environment variables:</p><p>NEXTAUTH_SECRET</p><p>We will be using&nbsp;<a href="https://next-auth.js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">NextAuth</a>&nbsp;as our open-source authentication solution (in order to verify Discord server membership). You can create a secret easily by running the following in your terminal:</p> <code>openssl rand -base64 32</code> <p>DISCORD_CLIENT_ID and DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET</p><p>This app will use Discord as the authentication provider (wrapped by NextAuth). To obtain these credentials, navigate to the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Discord Developer Portal</a>&nbsp;and set up a new application. On the left-hand panel, click on "OAuth2" and bring over your Client ID and Client Secret from the "Client Information" box.</p><p>Finally, since you'll be running the application locally, set the following URI value within the "Redirects" box (found under "Client Information"):&nbsp;<code>http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord</code>.</p><p>CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY</p><p>This is the private key your application will use to instantiate a static key:did in order to write points using the library. This DID will act as the identifier for the issuer of points for your application (you).</p><p>If you have the&nbsp;<a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.7.x/api/modules/cli?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB CLI</a>&nbsp;installed globally, you can run the following command in your terminal to create one:</p> <code>composedb did:generate-private-key</code> <p>AGGREGATION_ID</p><p>A default value for this environment variable has been provided for you within the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/.env.example?ref=blog.ceramic.network">.env.example</a>&nbsp;file. Please leave this as-is. You can reference the "extending the default library interfaces" below to learn more about this variable.</p><p>PROJECT_ID</p><p>We will be using&nbsp;<a href="https://walletconnect.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect's</a>&nbsp;Web3Modal for Web3 authentication. In your&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/pages/_app.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">_app.tsx</a>&nbsp;file, you will need to enter an active value for the&nbsp;<code>PROJECT_ID</code>&nbsp;constant defined on line 10.</p><p>You can set up a developer account for free by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">cloud.walletconnect.com</a>. Once authenticated, create a new app and copy over the "Project ID" value (found in the dashboard view for that corresponding app).</p> Extending the Default Library Interfaces <p>For our use case let's assume the following about our point reward structure:</p>  Participants can earn points related to engaging on certain platforms (such as Discord)  There are various ways participants can earn points across each platform (for example, following, posting, liking, and so on)  <p>As such, our application logic has the following requirements:</p>  Our application needs to easily access platform-specific subtotals for each participant  Our application also needs to easily access "global" totals for each participant as a sum of all eligible behavior  <p>The points library's default implementation of the <code>PointsAggregationInterface</code> serves only the second requirement above:</p> <code>type SimplePointsAggregation implements PointsAggregationInterface
  @createModel(
    description: "Simple points aggregation to an account at a specific date"
    accountRelation: SET
    accountRelationFields: ["recipient"]
  ) {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
  date: DateTime!
}</code> <p>This default model defines a <code>SET</code> accountRelation using the "recipient" subfield, which ensures that there can be only 1 model instance document any given account can create that points to a specific recipient. This will be useful for logging the global total for each participant, but would not be ideal for our first requirement.</p><p>Conversely, the <code>SimplePointsAllocation</code> model, the default type implementation of the <code>PointsAllocationInterface</code> (found in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/blob/main/composites/points/schemas/1-init.graphql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">schemas</a>), defines a <code>LIST</code> accountRelation, and is designed to track the history of allocation events rather than the current sum.</p><p>We've therefore chosen this example to show how easily developers can extend the defaults to meet more nuanced use cases. For this example app, we've defined a new type to fit our needs:</p> <code>type ContextPointAggregation implements PointsAggregationInterface
  @createModel(
    description: "A simple context-based point aggregation model"
    accountRelation: SET
    accountRelationFields: ["recipient", "context"]
  ) {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
  date: DateTime!
  context: String! @string(maxLength: 100)
}</code> <p>The extension you'll notice is that our SET relation now sits on two fields - "recipient" and "context". If, for example, we wanted to sum up all Discord-eligible behavior under a "discord" context value, this new accountRelation scheme ensures that our application (as the issuer) can create only 1 model instance per recipient+context combination.</p><p>For this tutorial, we've already pre-deployed this special type to the default node endpoint (if you want to create your own custom extensions, you will need to set up a node first). The model's stream ID is the corresponding value for the <code>AGGREGATION_ID</code> key provided for you in your .env file.</p> Using the Points Library in the Application <p>You can find the points library being used in our app's server logic as API routes and a context utility. If you look at our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/utils/context.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">context.ts</a> file, you can see how we've imported our <code>CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY</code> and <code>AGGREGATION_ID</code> environment variables to instantiate our reader and writer classes:</p> <code>import { PointsWriter, PointsReader } from '@ceramic-solutions/points'
import { getAuthenticatedDID } from '@ceramic-solutions/key-did'
import { fromString } from 'uint8arrays'

const CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY: string = process.env.CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY ?? ''
const aggregationModelID: string | undefined = process.env.AGGREGATION_ID ?? undefined

const seed = fromString(CERAMIC_PRIVATE_KEY, 'base16') as Uint8Array

// create a context writer
const contextWriter = await PointsWriter.fromSeed({
  aggregationModelID,
  seed,
})

// create a total writer
const writer = await PointsWriter.fromSeed({
  seed,
})

// generate issuer for reader context
const issuer = await getAuthenticatedDID(seed)

//create a context reader
const contextReader = PointsReader.create({
  issuer: issuer.id,
  aggregationModelID,
})

//create a total reader
const reader = PointsReader.create({
  issuer: issuer.id,
})

export { contextWriter, writer, contextReader, reader }</code> <p>We're purposely creating 2 instances of each, one of which is blank and therefore uses the default value  of <code>aggregationModelID</code> (the <code>SimplePointsAggregation</code> discussed above), while the other uses our imported extension.</p><p>In our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/tree/main/src/pages/api?ref=blog.ceramic.network">API routes</a> you'll find simple endpoints for reading and creating points. Notice how we import our writer instances from our context utility in order to mutate or create two separate documents:</p> <code>import { type NextApiRequest, type NextApiResponse } from 'next'
import { contextWriter, writer } from '@/utils/context'
import type { ModelInstanceDocument } from '@composedb/types'
import { type PointsContent, type AggregationContent } from '@/utils/types'

interface Request extends NextApiRequest {
  body: {
    recipient: string
    amount: number
    context: string
  }
}

interface Response extends NextApiResponse {
  status(code: number): Response
  send(data: { contextTotal: number; total: number } | { error: string }): void
}

export default async function handler(req: Request, res: Response) {
  try {
    const { recipient, amount, context } = req.body

    // get context aggregation doc if exists
    const aggregationDoc: ModelInstanceDocument&lt;AggregationContent&gt; | null =
      await contextWriter.loadAggregationDocumentFor([recipient, context])

    // if aggregation doc does not exist for that context, set points aggregation for both context and global total
    if (aggregationDoc === null) {
      // update context-specific aggregation
      const updatedContextAgg: ModelInstanceDocument&lt;AggregationContent&gt; =
        await contextWriter.setPointsAggregationFor([recipient, context], amount, {
          recipient,
          points: amount,
          date: new Date().toISOString(),
          context,
        } as Partial&lt;PointsContent&gt;)

      // update total aggregation
      const updatedTotalAgg: ModelInstanceDocument&lt;AggregationContent&gt; =
        await writer.updatePointsAggregationFor([recipient], (content) =&gt; {
          return {
            points: content ? content.points + amount : amount,
            date: new Date().toISOString(),
            recipient,
          }
        })

      res.status(200).send({
        contextTotal: updatedContextAgg.content ? updatedContextAgg.content.points : 0,
        total: updatedTotalAgg.content ? updatedTotalAgg.content.points : 0,
      })
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    res.status(500).send({ error: 'Internal Server Error' })
  }
}
</code> <p>As you might've noticed, the current logic only issues the points if the recipient has not yet been rewarded for the input context, which makes sense given that the app in its current form only confirms Discord server membership.</p><p>You'll notice that our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/pages/api/readPoints.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">readPoints.ts</a> route is even simpler, making use of the <code>getAggregationPointsFor</code> method our reader instances offer. </p> Requesting to View Users' Servers with NextAuth <p>If you navigate to our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/points-example/blob/main/src/server/auth.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">auth.ts</a> route you'll notice the inclusion of an authorization URI that specifies the scope of read access we need to view a user's server (or guild) membership:</p> <code>providers: [
    DiscordProvider({

 Introducing AutoGreenCharge by Energy Web: a decentralized application for decarbonizing electric vehicle&nbsp;charging  Mobile app helps automotive companies, charging companies, and EV drivers decarbonize electric&nbsp;mobility <p>Energy Web, a global nonprofit organization that builds open source software to accelerate the energy transition, has announced <a href="http://www.autogreencharge.com">AutoGreenCharge</a> by Energy Web, a new product that makes it simple for electric vehicle drivers, manufacturers, and other electric mobility companies to decarbonize electric vehicle charging. The application is designed to serve both electric vehicle drivers and e-mobility companies while bringing new levels of transparency and verifiability to the electric vehicle charging&nbsp;space.</p><p>In 2023, electric vehicles used approximately 110 terawatt hours of electricity — comparable to the annual electricity consumption of the Netherlands, and this figure is expected to increase tenfold by 2030. And although electric vehicles are far more efficient than gas-powered vehicles, electric vehicle charging in most markets around the world is not fully renewable: in the U.S. approximately 38% of charging is green while in Europe the figure is&nbsp;60%.</p><p><a href="http://www.autogreencharge.com">AutoGreenCharge</a> by Energy Web closes this gap by calculating the sustainability of charging sessions and matching the non-renewable portion with verified energy attribute certificates. These digital tokens represent renewable power generation and have been used by governments and corporations like Google and Microsoft since the 2010s to decarbonize business operations. AutoGreenCharge’s functionality extends to a mobile app, allowing drivers to clean up their charging, and can be integrated into existing apps used by EV manufacturers and charging companies. Over time, users will be able to choose certificates from a variety of power plants with different characteristics, such as solar power plants situated in particularly dirty grids that have a greater impact on decarbonization than renewable energy facilities in renewable-rich areas.</p><p>Currently, Energy Web is partnering with top EV manufacturers and additional partners to test, develop, and release AutoGreenCharge to the&nbsp;public.</p><p>Sign up to become one of the first beta-testers at: www.autogreencharge.com</p><blockquote>Sahas Katta, CEO at Smartcar, the leading connected car API platform and Greencharge partner, said “This partnership will empower EV drivers with the knowledge and confidence to maximize the sustainability of their EV charging experience. With Smartcar, Energy Web can seamlessly integrate across diverse vehicle brands, giving more EV drivers access to accurate insights into charging transparency and renewable energy&nbsp;options.</blockquote><blockquote>We could not be more excited to apply Energy Web technology to electric vehicle charging,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web Foundation. “This is a fast growing sector of electricity demand; pairing demand with high impact renewables from around the globe is a great way to bring more capital into renewable energy&nbsp;markets.</blockquote><p>About Energy Web Foundation:</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology for energy systems. Our enterprise-grade solutions improve coordination across complex energy markets, unlocking the full potential of clean, distributed energy resources for businesses, grid operators, and customers. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading corporates, energy companies, utilities, renewable energy developers, transportation sector majors and telecommunications leaders.

 Andrea D’Intino, Dyne.org 
 Nancy Cam-Winget, Cisco 
 John Bradley, Yubico 
 Rick Byers, Google 
 Gail Hodges, OpenID Foundation (moderator) 
 
<p>This summary draws out general themes and comments are not attributed to individuals or their organizations. You can also view this summary by the OpenID Chairman, Nat Sakimura.</p>
<p>  </p>
 Dissecting the Threat 
<p>Traditional public-key cryptography (PKC) will not withstand the code-breaking power of quantum computers. Put simply, today’s encryption methods depend upon complex mathematical problems that conventional computers cannot solve. PKC is used widely: to protect private data at rest, to secure messages (data in transit), to prevent unwanted third parties from hijacking digital sessions, and many other things. In the case of the OpenID Foundation, &nbsp;our standards – from OIDC to OID4VP and Federation – leverage PKC to secure identity data. As an increasingly digital society, it is how we all secure private data, business processes, government secrets, and critical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a world of quantum computing, however, certain algorithms become more feasible to run (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor’s algorithm</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm">Grover’s search</a>). With these algorithms in play, those mathematical problems that underpin PKC become breakable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The panel discussed several ways in which modern identity infrastructure is vulnerable to these threats.</p>
<p>Tokens – OpenID Connect, Verifiable Credentials, and other standards rely heavily on tokens. The Identity Token at the end of an OIDC flow, for example, is a JSON Web Token (JWT). Tokens depend upon encrypted digital signatures that will come under threat in a post-quantum world.</p>
<p>Certificates and Transport Layer Security – the panel discussed the dependence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) on certificates and digital signatures. Digitally signed certificates come under threat when those signatures can more easily be forged in a post quantum environment.</p>
<p>Hardware Security Modules – create, store, and (ideally) never transmit key material. Today, this irrefutably establishes signature provenance. However, if the key-generation algorithm used by that HSM isn’t quantum-resistant, then any keys generated are vulnerable. Furthermore, there are key transmission and import processes undertaken today by large enterprises who require scalable and resilient signing capabilities: unless those transfer protocols are quantum-resistant, private keys may be intercepted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, quantum threatens not only our data, but also our Roots of Trust: once these systems are broken, how will anyone be able to reliably trust that they know the nature of any entity they are interacting with online?</p>
<p>For more information about the threat of quantum in the context of today’s cryptography, see <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5108747984306176/google-s-threat-model-for-post-quantum-cryptography">Google’s Threat Model for Post-Quantum Cryptography</a>.</p>
 Not a Y2K Event 
<p>When asked whether there were parallels between the quantum threat and Y2K, the panelists agreed that the analogy doesn’t hold: Y2K was a predictable event with a known timeline. The “post-quantum cross-over” is much less clear cut and the threats more insidious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most importantly, the threats of quantum computing actually begin long before the technology is available. While quantum computers do not seem to pose an immediate threat, since they are not readily available, the panelists agreed that much of today’s encrypted data is sill threatened. In part, this is because nation-state actors, in particular, may have these capabilities on the foreseeable horizon.</p>
<p>It is also because data captured today can be stored (and is being stored) with the intent of future decryption. This includes data stored today that could lead to the reverse engineering of signing keys years into the future. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes data stored or transmitted by individuals, companies, governments, and all other actors online. Encrypted digital transactions, like payments and secure messages, intercepted today can be stored and decrypted tomorrow. As such, there are major implications for the way we secure any secrets that will still matter in the future – whether that be state secrets or the private keys of our hardware.</p>
 Preparation is Key 
<p>…no pun intended…</p>
<p>The panelists agreed that, given the recognizable threat, players across the landscape must work to develop and align around quantum-resistant algorithms that can be implemented at scale. This alignment will enable organizations to roll-out future-proofed hardware and protect today’s data against the threats of tomorrow. In the interim, many players are introducing “quantum-safe” solutions and offering guidance as to how organizations can best position themselves today. Some of these solutions involve actively testing and “doubling up” pre/post-quantum controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All panelists agreed that not all safeguards are “post-quantum.” Many best-practices of today will continue to be protective and, as yet, are not sufficiently commonplace (see, for example,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/CSRB_Review_of_the_Summer_2023_MEO_Intrusion_Final_508c.pdf">Cyber Safety Review Board’s recent recommendations</a> to Cloud Service Providers). These include best practices for key storage, key rotation, passkey (or password) management. Today’s essential hygiene remains critical and the ecosystem will continue to be only as protected as its weakest link. The panelists argued that a robust cybersecurity position has dependencies across the whole supply chain. If we want to solve the problems, the industry must continue to advocate for comprehensive standards and controls that protect.</p>
<p>This includes supporting global efforts to find quantum-resistant algorithms that scale and complement existing infrastructures. For example, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms">NIST is in the middle of a six-year competition</a> to standardize algorithms fit for essential use cases. There were four winners of the 2022 competition:</p>
 
 Kyber (a key exchange mechanism) 
 CRYSTALS-Dilithium (signing) 
 Falcon (signing) 
 Sphincs+ (signing) 
 
<p>The panel saw examples of how some of this had been implemented, including dyne.org’s implementation of <a href="https://dyne.org/W3C-DID/">Dilithium-signed Decentralized Identifiers</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 What does this mean for OpenID Foundation? 
<p>Members of the panel and OIDF members in the room reached consensus that, given the post-quantum vulnerabilities to identity tokens, credentials, and trust ecosystems, this is an area that requires immediate attention on behalf of the Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OIDF standards have a role in underpinning trust today. Our standards are designed to mitigate modern security threats. <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI</a>, for example, provides data schemas and security guidance appropriate for use cases requiring financial-grade privacy and security. <a href="https://openid.net/third-implementers-draft-of-openid-connect-federation-specification-approved/">OpenID Federation</a> also has a role underpinning trust between counterparties through cryptographically signed entity statements. Both standards have a place addressing the risks in today’s cybersecurity landscape: broad adoption of these and other emerging standards will reduce risk today.</p>
<p>However, while OIDF standards utilize modern cryptography, all Work Groups&nbsp; need to keep a watchful eye on emerging standards for quantum-resilience. At a point in the not-too-distant future, they will need to bake new cryptographic best practices into the standards. In the mean time, we can increase our advocacy and cross-industry collaborative efforts to test and refine quantum-safe algorithms.</p>
<p>We welcome your thoughts and contributions in the comments or to director@oidf.org</p>
 About the OpenID Foundation 
 The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate.

<p>Voting in the Elastos Cyber Republic election is crucial because it embodies the principles of decentralisation and community governance. The Cyber Republic DAO empowers everyone by allowing you to participate directly in decision-making processes and the strategic direction of Elastos. By voting, stakeholders can influence the development of technologies that integrate blockchain with the internet, ensuring a more secure, open, and decentralised web.</p>
<p>By staking ELA and voting, you can not only help secure the network through the BPOS staking mechanism but also contribute to a system where technological innovations are driven by community needs and priorities, rather than centralised authorities. Interested in running as a candidate? Follow our guide <a href="https://elastos.info/news/cyber-republic-election-a-guide-to-candidate-registration/">here.</a> So, let’s jump straight into the process of voting, allowing you to actively engage with and contribute to the Cyber Republic’s governance!</p>
 Step 1: Preparing to Vote 
<p>Elections are hosted on the Essentials Wallet. Download the Essentials Wallet here!</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/web3-essentials-crypto-wallet/id1568931743">iOS Essentials Wallet</a></p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.elastos.essentials.app">Android Essentials Wallet</a></p>
<p>Voting is performed using ELA from the Elastos Mainchain. You can obtain Mainchain ELA and deposit it into your wallet via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gate.io/trade/ELA_USDT">Kucoin.</a>&nbsp; Alternatively, you can acquire Smart Chain ELA through <a href="https://glidefinance.io/swap?inputCurrency=0xa06be0f5950781ce28d965e5efc6996e88a8c141">Glide Finance</a>&nbsp;and transfer it to Mainchain ELA within Essentials.</p>
 
 Step 2: Staking ELA 
<p>Ensure ELA is in the Mainchain Wallet: If you already have staked ELA in Essentials, head over to Step 3.</p>
<p>Open your Essentials Wallet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Navigate to the Staking tab.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Click the “Stake” button at the bottom right.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Enter the amount of ELA you wish to stake (1 ELA = 1 vote). Remember to keep a small amount, like 0.1 ELA, unstaked for potential transaction fees.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Confirm by signing the transaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember, transactions are <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elastos-ela-bitcoin-merge-mining-economic-model/">merged mined with Bitcoin</a>, which might take longer. Typically, it should reflect in your wallet within 5 minutes.</p>
 <br>
Step 3. Voting for Cyber Republic Candidates 
<p></p>
<p>Go back to the wallet’s home screen, select the “Cyber Republic” or “CR Council” option.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tap on “Vote” at the top right of the interface.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Select the candidates you want to support.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Distribute your votes. You can allocate all to one candidate or spread them across multiple candidates.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Confirm your choice by clicking “Cast Votes” and sign the transaction. Once you’ve cast your votes, allow about five minutes for the transaction to process; your votes will then be officially tallied under the candidates’ totals. If you wish to modify or retract your votes later, simply revisit the voting or staking sections of the wallet. Adjust your vote allocations or unstake your ELA respectively, confirming each transaction as required.</p>
<p>Important Dates:<br>
The election period this year is set from April 28 (Block height 1,678,450) to roughly June 28 (Block height 1,700,050), you can monitor the current block height&nbsp;<a href="https://ela.elastos.io/">here</a>. For additional details on the election process, including information on how to find a candidate sponsor, please read the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/whitepaper">Cyber Republic whitepaper</a>&nbsp;and follow the Cyber Republic&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Cyber__Republic">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>And that’s it! As we step into the 5th year of empowering the Elastos ecosystem through decentralised governance, we encourage all community members to participate actively in shaping the future of Cyber Republic. This process not only facilitates your active participation in Elastos’ governance but also advances the broader mission of fostering a decentralised, secure, and empowered digital ecosystem. Best of luck to all candidates! For the latest updates on all things Elastos, follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/ElastosInfo">here</a>!</p>

<p>Cybersecurity threats have evolved significantly over the years, with cyber attackers constantly finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in software systems. From worms and viruses to the more recent ransomware attacks, the cost of cybercrime continues to rise. Not only are financial losses mounting, but the potential impact on critical infrastructure such as healthcare systems is also a cause for concern. Recent breaches like Log4Shell, SolarWinds, and XZ underscore the vulnerabilities within our software supply chains. These incidents highlight the critical need for understanding software supply chains, their vulnerabilities, and ways to prevent, detect, mitigate, and recover from attacks. To do this requires understanding the supply chain, which is hard in today’s environment</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2024/04/30/call-for-participation-oasis-osim-tc/">OASIS Open Supply Chain Information Modeling (OSIM)</a> Technical Committee aims to standardize and promote information models for supply chains.</p>



<p>The Role of OSIM</p>



<p>OSIM members will work to standardize the representation of information related to supply chains. Unlike data models, information models operate at a higher level of abstraction. They offer a holistic view of the supply chain ecosystem, facilitating a better understanding of the existing data formats, where similarities exist, where gaps exist, and how to utilize the inherent information in them.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Exploring Information Models</p>



<p>While data modeling focuses on implementing data structures, information modeling provides an abstract model that precedes knowledge modeling. Despite the current emphasis on data modeling, there’s a notable lack of attention given to information modeling, particularly in sectors such as supply chain software and cybersecurity. To address this gap, exploring specific use cases and adopting tools like <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-jadn-im/blob/published/imjadn-v1.0-cn01.md#2-information-modeling-overview">JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN)</a>, an OASIS specification for information modeling, is essential.</p>



<p>Using Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) as an example, the acute need for SBOMs has spurred significant work in recent years, highlighting the value of SBOMs and driving the implementation of several different SBOM data formats (e.g. <a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX</a> and <a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX</a>). And those formats can portray data other than SBOM (e.g. vulnerability exploitability, licensing). So what makes an SBOM an SBOM? That is a question OSIM can answer with an SBOM information model. Besides being used to compare the features of the various data formats, the resulting information model can then be used as input to knowledge model graphs for defining the semantics/knowledge/meaning.</p>



<p>Another example is Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (<a href="https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/vex_one-page_summary_0.pdf">VEX</a>) which is even newer and also has multiple evolving data formats (<a href="https://oasis-open.github.io/csaf-documentation/">CSAF</a>, <a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openvex">OpenVex</a>, <a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX</a>). What makes a VEX a VEX? And what elements are in common with SBOM or have relationships with elements in an SBOM? This question becomes even more important as SBOM and VEX begin to appear in regulations and contractual procurement documents.</p>



<p>Standardizing Supply Chain Information Models</p>



<p>The U.S. government, through agencies like the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (<a href="https://www.ntia.gov/page/software-bill-materials">NTIA</a>) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sbom">CISA</a>), is recognizing the need for transparency and accountability in software procurement. They are requiring vendors to disclose what’s in their software through SBOMs to aid in identifying vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>However, the existence of various competing data models (SPDX, CycloneDX, CSAF, OpenVex) highlights the necessity for creating information models. By establishing a standard framework that sits atop existing data models, it defines the essence of “what is an SBOM?”, “what is a VEX” and it becomes easier to identify commonalities and differences across diverse specifications. Such a model could streamline interoperability and facilitate software conversion processes. While challenges persist, efforts to standardize supply chain information modeling aim to bring clarity and coherence to the complex landscape of software supply chains.</p>



<p>The goal of OSIM isn’t to create yet another competing standard but to provide a unifying framework. By standardizing OSIM, we can bridge the gap between existing data models emphasizing interoperability and collaboration among multiple standards.</p>



<p>Collaboration is Key<br><br>OSIM is paving the way for a safer and more resilient digital future with a secure software supply chain ecosystem. Achieving creation and widespread adoption of OSIM of supply chain information models will require collaboration among stakeholders across industries. Whether you’re a customer, a vendor, or a solution provider, your involvement is crucial.</p>

<p>20% of the world’s top 100 websites now support the password alternative</p>



<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., 02 May, 2024 – World Password Day may soon need a rebrand, as the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> survey released today shows that half of people in the US and UK have begun ditching the password in favor of more convenient and secure passwordless alternatives.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/content-ebook-consumer-password-and-passkey-trends-wpd-2024/">independent survey</a> commissioned by the FIDO Alliance found that 53% of people have enabled passkeys on at least one of their accounts, with 22% enabling them on every account they possibly can. In separate research, the Alliance found that passkeys are now supported by 20% of the world’s top 100 websites and 12% of the top 250.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shift away from passwords toward passkeys is being driven by three key trends; people’s concerns over password security, their frustrations in using them, and the growing availability of passkeys on major websites and services.</p>



<p>The Alliance’s research found that in the last year, 24% of people had at least one of their accounts compromised due to password vulnerabilities, and 26% had to reset or recover at least one password every month. In addition, 45% of consumers will abandon purchases if they have forgotten their password for that particular account. This is hugely significant for passkey adoption, as 61% of people familiar with passkeys consider them to be more convenient than passwords, and 58% believe they offer greater security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The availability of passkeys has also increased steadily over the last year, with <a href="https://aka.ms/VasuJoyWPD2024">Microsoft today announcing</a> that Microsoft accounts, including a wide range of services like Bing, Microsoft 365 and Xbox.com – now also support passkeys. This is added to support from large global consumer brands, such as Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Google, Hyatt, Nintendo, PayPal, PlayStation, Shopify and TikTok. In all, more than 13 billion user accounts can now leverage passkeys for sign in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result of high-profile passkey deployments like these, awareness of the technology has grown to 62% of people, according to the research. Among people with some knowledge of passkeys, those enabling them on at least one account rises substantially to 74%, while those enabling passkeys on every account possible rises to 32%. This suggests that adoption will only increase as more people become more familiar with passkeys.</p>



<p>“It was just two years ago that FIDO Alliance, alongside the world’s largest platform providers, introduced the vision for passkeys to accelerate the scale and usability of password-free sign-ins. The market’s reaction since then has been nothing short of phenomenal, with hundreds of services enabling billions of consumers to use passkeys,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance. “We expect this trend to accelerate in the months and years ahead, and our research makes it clear that when offered, people prefer the better security and usability of passkeys over passwords.”</p>



<p>Ends</p>



<p>Notes to editors:</p>



 
 The independent survey was conducted by Sapio Research in April 2024 among 2,000 consumers across the UK and US – with 1,000 in each country. Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. In this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 2.2 percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample. 



 To calculate the proportion of the world’s top websites and services that support passkeys, the FIDO Alliance combined publicly available information with its own data on passkey deployments.&nbsp; 
 



<p>About the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.<br>Contact<br><a href="mailto:press@fidoalliance.org">press@fidoalliance.org</a></p>

<p>In our technologically driven world, vulnerabilities in hardware and software are an unavoidable reality. No software or hardware is immune to security vulnerabilities. Addressing these “open wounds” in cybersecurity needs automation. This is where the <a href="https://csaf.io/">Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)</a> emerges as a game-changer.</p>



<p>CSAF is an OASIS open standard designed to streamline the communication and distribution of machine-processable security advisories and mitigation information. It aims to simplify the process by which organizations access and process information about security vulnerabilities and their potential remedies.</p>



<p>As the Chair of CSAF, I have had the honor of working and collaborating with the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and numerous industry and government partners in the development and enhancement of CSAF and VEX. This collaboration has been instrumental in creating the future of vulnerability management.</p>



<p>Recognizing the critical importance of modernized vulnerability management, BSI not only promotes the adoption of CSAF but also actively organizes workshops to educate and enable organizations to utilize this framework effectively. As part of the Alliance for Cyber Security (ACS), BSI has scheduled three free workshops from May 14 to May 16, 2024, aimed at strengthening understanding and implementation of CSAF.</p>



<p>We cordially invite you to join the upcoming CSAF workshops, hosted by BSI. These workshops offer a unique opportunity to deepen your understanding of the future of vulnerability disclosure and its critical role in modern cybersecurity.</p>



<p>Participating in these workshops will empower you and your organization with the knowledge to implement CSAF effectively, enhancing your ability to manage vulnerabilities with precision and efficiency. You’ll gain invaluable insights into automated vulnerability management and how CSAF can streamline the communication of security advisories.</p>



<p>Don’t miss this chance to learn from leading experts and network with peers who are equally dedicated to advancing cybersecurity practices.</p>

<p>For those in our community who have been staying up-to-date on our thoughts and experimenting thus far as they relate to points, you already know why we see points as a logical vehicle for Web3 reputation systems. As our co-founder, Danny importantly points out in his blog post entitled <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/points-how-reputation-tokens-collide-where-it-goes-from-here/">Points: How Reputation &amp; Tokens Collide</a>, points not only align the incentives of the platform and its users, but Web3 enables point systems to be more open and composable by "...making every event driving points both transparent and verifiable..."</p><p>Given Ceramic's native composability, provenance, performance, and flexible-by-design characteristics, "points built on Ceramic" became an obvious idea for a design pattern that would appeal to teams looking to integrate reward systems into their projects. In March, we released a post called <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/points-on-ceramic/">Building Points on Ceramic - an Example and Learnings</a> meant to walk readers through a points proof-of-concept application we deployed for EthDenver '24. Later that month, we also released another post to announce <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/toward-the-first-decentralized-points-system-oamo-becomes-the-first-points-provider-on-ceramic/">Oamo as the first points provider on Ceramic</a>.</p><p>This is all to say - as an organization, we've strived to be thoughtful and deliberate about how we approach the opportunity Web3 points presents while aiming to maintain quick iteration and experimentation as engineering and product norms.</p><p>As such, we've been working on a new experiment that we're excited to share with you - a points library built on Ceramic!</p> Why Develop a Points Library?  <p>Given that we identified points as an ideal use case for Ceramic, building a points library presented an opportunity to help developers start experimenting with and iterating on Ceramic much faster. We also predicted that the approach would accelerate developers' learning rate by packaging Ceramic within an easy-to-understand paradigm. Finally, a use case-specific library allowed us to:</p>  Predefine library interfaces and base models for users, helping them bypass this development stage  Eliminate the friction of compiling and deploying a composite  Enable immediate utility and experimentation by removing the need for node setup  Help developers focus on their core application logic by baking straightforward functionality into the library  <p>...and so on.</p> Which Use Cases is it Built for? <p>Throughout this post, we'll take a high-level walk through the anatomy of the points module (and the broader SDK it lives in) which should reveal how flexible and extendable the library is. However, here are some scenarios we considered that helped inform its design and utility:</p><p>Rewarding Community Engagement</p>  A project wants to incentivize meaningful participation by rewarding points for engagement across key social platforms  The project must track a history of point allocation events per participant, as well as have easy access to a participant's total  <p>Incentivizing Collaboration</p>  A project wants to reward collaborators for contributing to a codebase  Various types of contributions under this system are eligible for point rewards  <p>Quests or Education</p>  An education platform wants to reward students for completing class modules  Points are distributed in correlation to quiz or test scores at the end of each module   What is the Points Library? <p>The points library is the first module within our larger <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Solutions SDK</a>, designed to be the eventual home for any experimental tooling our team creates for certain common patterns or use cases we've identified as priorities. While the individual libraries (points, for example) sit at the core of this SDK, this repository will also contain example applications, API documentation, and other helpful modules to support developers looking to get started.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/libraries/points?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Points Library module</a> (which is now available as an NPM module - <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramic-solutions/points?activeTab=readme&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">@ceramic-solutions/points</a>) removes the common points of tension mentioned above by:</p><p>Delivering a hosted node endpoint</p><p>This is the default endpoint if no alternate is provided by the user (for test purposes only - not intended for production). This feature was designed to accelerate developer experimentation. Of course, the library also supports private endpoints as well.</p><p>Predefined Interfaces and Default Models</p><p>The points library relies on two schema interfaces (implemented by two default models) for keeping track of points. These interfaces can easily be extended by developers who desire more complex use cases, or developers can leverage the default models out of the box with no additional configuration.</p> <code>interface PointsAllocationInterface implements PointsInterface
  @createModel(description: "Interface for a single allocation of points to an account") {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
}

interface PointsAggregationInterface implements PointsInterface
  @createModel(description: "Interface for an aggregation of points to an account") {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  points: Int!
  date: DateTime!
}</code> <p>While the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/blob/main/libraries/points/README.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Points Library Readme</a> offers more detail, these interfaces broadly speak to the two primary utilities we anticipate developers will need. Model instances of <code>PointsAllocationInterface</code> will keep track of the history of allocation events (and if extended, can include fields to capture additional details such as when and why points were allocated). Conversely, <code>PointsAggregationInterface</code> is designed to keep track of the sum of points for a recipient at any given time (and like allocation docs, can also be extended to keep track of more nuanced data points like contextual subtotals).</p><p>Built-in Reader and Writer Classes</p><p>The two core library modules consist of a points reader class and a separate writer class, allowing developers multiple ways to instantiate an instance (the easiest of which simply requires a private key if using the default node endpoint and default models). Each class includes built-in methods to read or issue points and can accommodate extensions of the interfaces without the necessity of additional wrapping.</p> What Will You Build with Points? <p>While we covered a few examples of typical use cases for points, there are so many other possibilities out there for developers to explore. Perhaps you want to reward your community for showing up to in-person events or collaborating on projects. Maybe you want to build a service that analyzes on-chain behavior (such as interacting with certain smart contracts or holding certain assets) and uses a framework of weights to award contextual points.</p><p>We'd love to learn how you're using reward systems across your communities and projects, and whether this initial library has what it needs to support your use case. Feel free to contact me directly at <a href="mailto:mzk@3box.io">mzk@3box.io</a>, or start a conversation on the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Forum</a>. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

Statement of Purpose<br><br>The OASIS Open Supplychain Information Modeling (OSIM) TC aims to standardize and promote information models about all aspects of supply chains.<br><br>An Information Model (IM) defines the essential content of messages used in computing, independently of how those messages are represented (i.e., serialized) for communication or storage. Information models are a means to understand and document the essential information content relevant to a system, application, or protocol exchange without regard to how that information is represented in actual implementations. Having a clear view of the information required provides clarity regarding the goals that the eventual implementation must satisfy.<br>1.c. Business Benefits<br>&nbsp;<br>The establishment of information models and associated explanatory materials will benefit a wide array of stakeholders across the software and hardware industries. The key beneficiaries of this work can be broadly categorized into the following groups:<br><br>Software and Hardware Vendors:&nbsp;Standardized information models will provide clarity acrosssupply chains reducing the confusion and inefficiencies that result from the various diverse implementations of data exchanges across participants in supply chains. It will help vendors plan their product updates, support, and discontinuation more effectively and transparently,thereby improving customer trust and satisfaction. A standardized information model will also help to catalyze and undergird a thriving diverse ISV supply chain solution ecosystem-enabling modularity, extensibility, and a composable approach across vendors.<br><br>Open-Source Maintainers:&nbsp;Both hardware and software open-source maintainers will benefit from standardized supply chain information models, enabling them to make informed decisions about incorporating different software and hardware components into their projects.<br><br>End Users and Enterprises:&nbsp;Both individual end users and enterprises that rely heavily on technology for their operations will benefit significantly. They will receive timely and clear information about the products they use, helping them plan upgrades, replacements, or contingency plans in advance, thereby reducing vulnerabilities, disruptions, and potential security risks.<br><br>Technology Consultants and Service Providers:&nbsp;Consultants and service providers will be able to offer more accurate advice and support to their clients with access to standardized supply chain information.<br><br>Supply Chain Partners:&nbsp;The standardization would increase transparency and predictability in the supply chain, which can help reduce uncertainties and risks, leading to a more secure and resilient supply chain.<br><br>Government:&nbsp;Standardization can assist government agencies and regulatory bodies in overseeing the industry more effectively, ensuring that all players comply with the set guidelines, and promoting fair practices.1.d. Scope<br><br>The OASIS Open Supplychain Information Modeling (OSIM) TC will:<br><br>– Research and survey existing supply chain activities and share with the TC membership. Whenever possible, OSIM TC will reference and reuse existing work.<br><br>– Develop and maintain value propositions and use cases for supply chain information modeling.<br><br>– Develop and maintain supply chain information model standards about all aspects of supply chains, ensuring their relevance and applicability to current industry needs.<br><br>– Develop and maintain conformance supply chain information model standards.<br><br>– Facilitate interoperability and compatibility across different platforms and industries.<br><br>– Promote the widespread adoption of these supply chain information model standards and ensure their broad application to hardware and software from both vendors and open-source maintainers.<br><br>– Provide technical expertise and guidance on the application and evolution of these supply chain information model standards.1.e. Deliverables<br><br>The primary deliverables of the OASIS Open Supplychain Information Modeling (OSIM) TC will be:<br><br>– Value propositions and use cases: Specifications or Committee Notes to explain why the models are needed and how they will be used.<br><br>– Supply chain information model standards: One or more comprehensive specifications detailing the information models.<br><br>– Implementation Guide(s):One or more Committee Notes guiding stakeholders in implementing the information model(s).<br><br>– Open Source Software: One or more software repositories with software, tools, examples, FAQs, and other material supporting awareness and adoption of TC work products.1.f. IPR Mode<br><br>The OASIS Open Supplychain Information Modeling (OSIM) TC will operate in the Non-Assertion Mode, as described in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr/">OASIS IPR Policy</a>.1.g. Audience<br><br>The anticipated audience for this work includes, but is not limited, to:<br><br>– Software and hardware vendors<br>– Software and hardware open-source maintainers<br>– Technology consultants<br>– Business stakeholders reliant on technology products<br>– International, Federal, and local government organizations<br>– Regulatory bodies in the software and hardware industries1.h.

  🚀 Decentralized Identity Foundation News  
<p>The community welcomes Ankur Banerjee to the Helm of DIF TSC</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIF is excited to announce that Ankur Banerjee has been elected as the new co-chair of the DIF Technical Steering Committee (TSC). Ankur plays an increasingly critical role at DIF, and last year he was elected to the DIF Steering Committee. He joins current co-chair Andor Kesselman, and together they are bound to drive DIF's mission forward with renewed vigor and vision.</p>
<p>“We are extremely fortunate to have Ankur join us in a TSC leadership role," said Kim Hamilton Duffy, DIF’s Executive Director. "As decentralized identity technology continues to mature, it finds broader adoption across diverse markets and use cases, making the need for interoperability and compliance with emerging regulations more critical than ever. Ankur’s deep expertise across both consumer and enterprise spheres aligns perfectly with our strategic goals. His leadership will be crucial in navigating these evolving landscapes and ensuring that DIF remains at the forefront of technological innovation and standards development.”</p>
<p>"I am deeply honored to take on the role of co-chair of the DIF Technical Steering Committee. Decentralized identity technology is at an inflection point for adoption, where the basic building blocks of the standards are built and settled. I look forward to supporting DIF member organizations in accelerating their industry-wide efforts to make it easier for developers to build usable, privacy-preserving experiences that give users control of their data,” said Ankur Banerjee.</p>
<p>We encourage all our readers and members to extend their warmest welcome to Ankur. More <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/welcoming-ankur-banerjee-to-the-helm-of-dif-tsc/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Switchchord provides tools for songwriters to document ownership of their creations and connect with music publishers who administer their copyrights. The company is bringing sophisticated digital identity and legal technology solutions to the music industry. DIF recently spoke to Founder and CEO Cole Davis, who shared his insights into the industry's workings, and his approach to modernizing the music supply chain.   </p><p>Where did the idea for Switchchord come from?&nbsp;</p><p>I started playing the bass guitar at 15, and played throughout high school and college. After college I was playing in a band while working at a bank when we received a cease and desist letter telling us we had to change our name. It got me curious about the legal side of music and I decided to go back to school to study law.</p><p>After gaining a foundation in corporate law I switched to entertainment law. While helping ad agencies and filmmakers get the rights to use music in their productions, I was surprised by the lack of operational workflows and communication tools to enable this. In the music industry there are a mass of legal contracts that drive behavior. You need to prove you have the right to take certain actions based on these contracts, like license a certain copyright in a particular media. The identity and communication infrastructure was essentially nonexistent.</p><p>There are two sides to the music industry. The first is music publishing, which involves songwriters who write compositions–think melody, lyrics, and chord progressions. These compositions receive copyright protection, and usually songwriters sell or license these copyrights to music publishers. The music publisher makes money by licensing the composition and then shares the revenue with the songwriter.&nbsp;</p><p>The second part of the industry is recorded music. Recording artists make recordings of compositions, resulting in a sound recording. These sound recordings receive separate copyright protection, and this copyright is usually owned by the record company who “signed” the recording artist. So any time you hear music, there are technically two copyrights involved, and those two copyrights are usually owned by different entities.</p><p>The music publishing side gets very complex. Often songs are written by multiple songwriters who are “signed” to different music publishers, meaning multiple publishers co-own the copyright. Some music publishers then hire publishing administration companies to license their songs for them. And many music publishers hire “sub-publishers” in foreign territories for local administration and licensing . There’s no central record of ownership or administration rights. Instead, you have many third-party databases that have built up over time, all doing relatively the same thing and that are divorced from the legal contracts that actually govern copyright ownership and administration rights. Information relating to these legal relationships is usually delivered via texts and emails, often resulting in inconsistencies across the entire supply chain. The transaction costs are enormous.&nbsp;</p><p>I started researching the problem intensively, eventually quitting my job as a lawyer to study technology full time.&nbsp; I was originally focused on blockchain but eventually migrated to the W3C’s emerging decentralized identity framework.&nbsp;</p><p>How do these problems affect songwriters and recording artists?&nbsp;</p><p>Streaming fraud is a really big issue — there are estimates that 10% or more of all streams are fraudulent in some way. There are bad actors who try to “game” the system of common royalty pools. Sometimes they will hijack existing legitimate streaming accounts and turn them into a bot farm to stream the bad actor’s music. Or the bad actor will upload music they don’t own and hope to make money before the music is taken down.</p><p>Then there are ‘black box’ royalties that are unallocated, and can’t be distributed due to incomplete or incorrectly registered information. This is a global phenomenon in the music industry. In the US, these are often held in escrow by collective licensing agencies&nbsp;like the Mechanical Licensing Collective, which licenses certain music publishing rights to streaming platforms in the US — their unallocated royalty pool&nbsp;is estimated at $500M or more — who collectively try to figure it out. Eventually, after years, this money gets paid out based on market share.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also ramifications for attribution. If you’re not credited correctly, it can be a career killer for a songwriter.&nbsp;</p><p>Generative AI is the new big problem. Everything will need digital signatures at source, or you’re not sure whether it’s human or AI created.&nbsp;</p><p>What approach have you taken to address these challenges?&nbsp;</p><p>All these issues are identity problems in disguise. We need digital signatures on everything, and data supply chains based on machine-readable data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first requirement was to represent a copyright in a digital form so that it could interact with existing copyright management platforms, effectively turning the copyright itself into a messaging hub that can connect different systems.</p><p>The second requirement was an identity system that can map contractual relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>With these in place, you can build verifiable data “pipes” between different industry databases, creating a routing system to pass data relating to verifiable identities and verifiable legal relationships. That helps keep ownership and administration rights in sync across the supply chain.&nbsp;</p><p>Our first product is designed to move data from the point of origin, such as a recording studio, into various copyright management platforms as quickly and easily as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Where does decentralized identity come in?&nbsp;</p><p>All our products rely on decentralized identity. It’s the key technology to make everything work.&nbsp;</p><p>The music industry uses lots of different types of identifiers. Some are ISO standards and others are proprietary. To get paid, you need to be identified correctly by the supply chain, which relies on getting these different identifiers into downstream databases.&nbsp;</p><p>We verify and bind all these identifiers to a single Decentralized Identifier (DID), enabling you to bring all of your identifiers with you without any manual data entry. In addition, these DIDs are able to make statements about their legal relationships and contractual authorizations, in the form of verifiable credentials, that can be proven to other parts of the supply chain. This enables everyone in the music industry to stay in sync, with a single identity for all their identifiers, industry memberships, and legal relationships.</p><p>With an open-source identity system at the foundation, we make data supply chains between songwriters, publishers, copyright management systems and the recorded music side of the industry, with protocols for sending metadata around the system.&nbsp;</p><p>What lessons have you learned during the development of Switchchord?&nbsp;</p><p>The key is to integrate with what already exists. We see decentralization as extremely powerful but it’s a process, it doesn’t just magically happen.&nbsp;</p><p>How do you babystep people into this new world? If you’re modeling legal relationships or an identity for a copyright, you can get into tricky issues with governance. For example, if you have four writers, each with a different publisher, and you want to represent the copyright with a DID, who acts as the DID controller?</p><p>There are usually two roots of trust in each of these situations: a legal root of trust and a cryptographic root of trust. You have to marry all these worlds. We’re working with the industry on that.&nbsp;</p><p>We use did:web for now as it’s easy. We don’t want to force songwriters to have their own wallet, or to use the same infrastructure to manage their keys. We’re realistic about that.&nbsp;</p><p>What is your vision for the future?&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, we want everyone to be able to bring their own identity. You’ll be able to insert these DIDs directly into legal workflows, with agents controlling the data flows. The copyright itself can have a Decentralized Web Node (DWN) where data can be written to and shared. Any time you see a statement being made about copyright ownership or administration rights, we see an opportunity to present that statement as a verifiable credential. That will be very helpful at getting to the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>Because we see decentralization as a spectrum that can occur over time, we closely follow some of the recent upgrades to did:web that extend things like key management. So DID methods like did:plc, did:webplus, did:tdw, or did:webs, which uses KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure). Until the infrastructure exists to let people BYOI (bring your own identity), we’ve left our DID method selection purposefully modular.</p><p>DIDComm is also great. If you need to contact people, we’d like to enable that within the framework of decentralized identifiers. That goes back to my original frustrations with licensing music into things like movies and the complete lack of communication infrastructure.</p><p>What do you see as the wider significance of these new types of decentralized approaches?</p><p>In my previous careers I’ve worked with other industries such as oil and gas and real estate. The basic questions are the same: how to map legal relationships within a complex supply chain, and how to represent assets as digital versions that are intrinsically tied to the legal system.</p><p>The decentralized identity framework is the future of commercial transactions. It’s the most important thing out there. There’s cool stuff you can do with blockchain and payments, but that’s not everything. You don’t need blockchain for the vast majority of these use cases, just digital signatures and verifiable data.&nbsp;</p><p>What value do you get from DIF membership?&nbsp;</p><p>DIF is a really good rallying point for people who are trying to tackle these kinds of hard problems using decentralized technology. It’s the body I’m most involved in, though I’m also involved with ToIP, W3C, and C2PA. The community is really approachable.&nbsp;</p><p>I was a judge on the DIF hackathon. It was so cool to see people start to use this stuff. I was really happy to be involved.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually it would be great to introduce DIF to some of the music industry standards bodies we participate in, like DDEX and ISNI. I think DIF could play a role as this connective layer across different industries who are all tackling similar problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DIDComm — or Decentralized Identifier Communication — provides a method for creating a direct, secure line of communication between the owners of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, we provide an overview of DIDComm's unique capabilities, and how it's being deployed in a range of real-world use cases.</p><p>How DIDComm works</p><p>Each holder of a DID agrees to accept a connection. Once created, the connection enables ongoing secure communication along the channel where the connection was established.</p><p>DIDComm is more than just a mechanism for an individual message, it’s a framework for safe, structured interactions built on decentralization technology. DIDComm connections benefit from the built-in features of DIDComm technology, including message encryption, mutual authentication, and message routing (adapted from <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-is-didcomm-with-pictures/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">this article</a> on the Indicio blog). </p><p>Why DIDComm matters</p>  Trusted communication  <p>Trustworthy communication is foundational for parties on the internet to quickly establish trust. Yet this is still not widely available today, due to a lack of mutual authentication and/or end-to-end encryption in prevalent communication channels.&nbsp;</p><p>APIs enable business applications to securely exchange information in a prescribed format, but they need to be hosted and maintained, requiring infrastructure such as servers or cloud-based storage, as well as technical skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Like APIs, DIDComm can be used to securely pass rich information. Unlike APIs, it’s designed to work with the devices and services people use in their daily lives, like smartphones, tablets and laptops, without the need to host (or download) anything.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, while online services require us to authenticate ourselves, we are rarely given the option to authenticate them. Automatic mutual authentication is a core feature of DIDComm, greatly reducing the risk of falling prey to online scams.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“DIDComm is not anti-business, it’s pro-people, as it works brilliantly with the tech individuals and small businesses already use,” comments Sam Curren, Deputy CTO of Indicio and DIF Steering Committee member.&nbsp;</p>  Unmediated relationships  <p>During the Web2 era, people lost their first class citizenship of the internet as communication was mostly consolidated into social media platform silos. Today, we depend on third parties such as tech companies and social media websites for our digital activities and online presence. As a result, we have little choice but to trust these providers with our information — trust that’s eroded a little further with each new database security breach.&nbsp;</p><p>DIDComm restores agency to individuals and organizations by enabling us to interact and share our information directly with the recipient, without needing to entrust it to centralized services and databases. </p>  Persistent connections&nbsp;  <p>Once established, a DIDComm connection lasts for as long as it is not canceled by either party.</p><p>Currently, when a user visits a website, they use a shared secret to prove who they are. The user’s interactions are generally limited to their browser, meaning the website can no longer communicate with them once they leave the site. A DIDComm channel to the user’s phone becomes an excellent out-of-band channel that persists after the user has left the site. </p>  Flexible use cases and applications&nbsp;  <p>DIDComm is widely used to exchange Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Verifiable Presentations (VPs) — files containing verifiable information derived from one or more VCs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, this is just one of many potential applications of DIDComm, a generalized protocol that enables diverse use cases to benefit from the security and decentralization of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).&nbsp;</p><p>“DIDComm is fully capable of working in this way, but it can enable so much more. Once two parties have used VCs to establish trust, what’s next?” says Sam Curren.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of Verifiable Credential-based services regulate people back into the client / server model. The vision of DIDComm is to enable VCs and all sorts of other interactions that can better our lives on the internet, with browsers, email, video calls and a host of other channels.</p><p>“There’s no need to create a dedicated app in order to leverage DIDComm — developers can enable users to have a trusted relationship through any existing app,” he adds.&nbsp;</p><p>A selection of current use cases</p><p>Following is a selection of some of the many compelling use cases where DIDComm is used.&nbsp;</p>  The Government of British Columbia has been actively involved in the development of decentralized identity technology, including DIDComm Messaging.  The Department of Homeland Security’s Silicon Valley Innovation Program is piloting use of DIDComm to enable trusted interactions and verifiable document exchange for international trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;  DIDComm is used to exchange Verifiable Credentials between issuers, citizens’ National Digital Identity wallets and verifiers in Bhutan.&nbsp;  DIDComm is being used by the IDUnion consortium to enable users of digital identity wallets in the EU to establish secure communication channels with businesses and other users.&nbsp;  DIDComm is being piloted within the travel sector to enable secure exchange of verifiable credentials between IATA (International Air Transport Association) as issuer, travel agencies as holders and airline booking systems as verifiers. It is also used in production to enable seamless presentation of travel credentials and entry to the island of Aruba (Indicio).&nbsp;  DIDComm is used by Entidad to enable farm workers to conduct routine tasks digitally (Entidad.io).  DIDComm is being used to enable users to secure files uploaded to cloud storage (Anonyome).  <p>“This is a technology that not only Americans are using. There’s broad interest, including within the EU and across Asia,” Sam Curren concludes.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

<p>Traditional organisations are often hierarchical, centralising decision-making among a few top-level individuals, which limits broader participation. In contrast, blockchain technology supports decentralised and transparent governance on a distributed ledger, enhancing security, immutability, and trust without central oversight.</p>
<p>Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) embody decentralisation by distributing decision-making across all global members online, preventing power imbalances and promoting equity. DAOs are community-driven, with each member having a stake and a voice in organisational decisions, aligning individual success with the collective success of the organisation. This incentivises members to prioritise the organisation’s best interest, aligning with Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/chen2rong2?lang=en">Rong Chen’s</a> vision for how Elastos should be run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Elastos’ Cyber Republic DAO 
<p>Elastos’ <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/">Cyber Republic DAO</a> employs a democratic, blockchain-based election model, fostering decentralised governance within the Elastos ecosystem. Annually, during a one-month election period, all community members holding ELA coins from the Elastos Mainchain, <a href="https://ela.elastos.io/">secured by Bitcoin,</a> cast their votes, proportional to their ELA holdings, to elect 12 Cyber Republic Council members. The top 12 candidates receiving the most community votes secure their positions for a term of about one year or 262,800 main chain blocks. After 4 years of running, the fifth-year election begins tomorrow, at block height 1,678,450, a huge milestone!</p>
<p>Joining the Cyber Republic Council offers a unique opportunity to directly shape Elastos’ future and be a part of its decentralised governance history. This role allows you to influence strategic decisions and manage the CR treasury, aligning both individual and community goals within the Elastos ecosystem. It’s an eye-opening experience, offering prestige, leadership recognition, and substantial ELA rewards. If you believe in Elastos’ vision and have the necessary resources, we encourage you to participate in this part of our ecosystem by running and campaigning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 How to Run as a Council Member 
<p>To run for Council membership, candidates must possess Elastos Digital IDs and register their candidacy on the <a href="https://elastos.info/essentials-the-super-wallet/">Essentials wallet.</a> A refundable deposit of 5,000 ELA is required to ensure commitment to governance responsibilities. If elected, this deposit serves as collateral which may be penalised if the member fails to vote on proposals.</p>
<p>Council members earn approximately <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elastos-ela-bitcoin-merge-mining-economic-model/">35% APY</a> on their 5000 ELA and participate in decision-making, proposal evaluation, and strategic governance. Familiarity with the duties and expectations outlined in the <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/whitepaper">Cyber Republic whitepaper</a> is recommended. Council members manage the CR treasury, which contains 440,782 ELA today, with an additional top-up of 307,903 ELA incoming for the upcoming Cyber Republic Council. They influence Elastos’ development and governance. The role offers prestige, recognition as community leaders, and ELA rewards through Bitcoin-secured mainchain validator incentives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Voting for Council Members 
<p>As the Cyber Republic community, we will use our ELA coins for voting over the 30-day elections, with each staked coin, which is not locked and can be withdrawn at any time, equaling one vote. Transparency and communication are vital for gaining community trust and support.</p>
<p>The election starts tomorrow at block height 1,678,450, <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals">monitor here</a>! Your participation supports Elastos and strengthens our network. Let’s build a transparent, inclusive future. Vote wisely and thank you for your dedication to the Cyber Republic.</p>
<p>Do you want to run? Act now, join the Cyber Republic Council, and help drive our Elastos community forward. For the latest election news, follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/Cyber__Republic">Cyber Republic Twitter </a>and<a href="https://t.me/elastosgroup/1"> Elastos Telegram</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Last month, at the Gartner Identity and Access Management Summit in London, industry leaders showcased successful, interoperable implementations of the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) and Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP). This included <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2024/02/unifying-efforts-amplifying-security-shared-signals-interoperability/">Okta</a>, SailPoint, and <a href="https://sharedsignals.guide/#aboutssf">Cisco</a> as well as security startups <a href="https://sgnl.ai/2024/03/biggest-insights-for-identity-professionals-from-the-gartner-iam-summit-in-london/">SGNL</a>, VeriClouds, and Helisoft. &nbsp;The SSF suite of standards underpins Zero-Trust architectures and promises to enable a more secure digital future for everyone.</p>
<p></p>
 The Shared Signals Framework is a Game Changer 
<p>Today’s businesses and their users demand seamless access to services. Often, this involves many concurrent logged in sessions to countless applications – and these sessions can last days or even weeks at a time. Over the course of the session, plenty can change:</p>
 
 A user may change their location 
 A malicious application may be found on a device 
 Users may be granted new privileges (or privileges may have been revoked) 
 
<p>Furthermore, there may be suspicious activity on user accounts that have meaningful implications for other dependent services – like an email address that is used to login to many other online services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The industry has worked hard over the last decade to make single sign-on and federated identity possible. This greatly improved the experience for users and opened many doors to make adoption of SaaS widespread. However, closing doors when needed was more of an afterthought, and hasn’t been fully solved.</p>
<p>While many security solutions now exist, a lot of actionable data sits siloed within individual tools, applications, and dashboards—and it hasn’t historically traveled across service providers. This lack of data sharing constrains the implementation of a Zero Trust security posture.</p>
 Enter SSF: the Solution 
<p>The Shared Signals Framework is an open API built upon a suite of protocols that enable applications and service providers to communicate about security events in order to make dynamic access and authorization decisions. It acts as a signaling layer on a back channel that helps to secure sessions at near real-time. </p>
<p>Back in 2019, Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/re-thinking-federated-identity-with-the-continuous-access-evaluation-protocol">introduced</a> a standards-based approach to continuously evaluating access authorization. The Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (<a href="https://caep.dev/learn">CAEP</a>) created a simpler way for IdPs and services to convey information about a given session. Meanwhile, the OpenID Foundation published the Risk &amp; Incident Sharing and Collaboration (RISC) specification to define a standardized way to communicate account-level risk events. The two initiatives merged within the OpenID Foundation and formed the Shared Signals working group. CAEP and RISC are now profiles on top of the Shared Signals Framework (SSF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now a maturing standard, SSF is an API with a standard format for expressing both account-level and session-level Security Events. It offers seamless, privacy-preserving data-sharing about security events between service providers. Organizations can easily integrate SSF into their security infrastructure and begin sending and receiving Security Events across an ecosystem. This enables organizations to deliver Zero Trust security underpinned by continuous risk assessment efficiently and at scale.</p>
 Security through Collaboration 
<p>In a <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/04/2003313510/-1/-1/0/ESF%20CTR%20IAM%20MFA%20SSO%20CHALLENGES.PDF">recent report by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a>, the authors note that the Shared Signals Framework is an emerging, promising standard gaining traction in the industry. They state “support for and the development of these standards in the enterprise ecosystem will enable a variety of security use cases, ranging from limiting access to managed devices to quickly revoking access when accounts are compromised.” They further recommend broader support for the development and implementation of identity standards as a crucial underpinning of security.</p>
<p>The interoperability session held at the Gartner IAM Summit in London demonstrates, not only the latest in security protocols, but also the industry’s shift towards collaborative security enabled by Open Standards. By sharing these security events across an ecosystem of trusted parties, organizations have more informed Zero Trust implementations and are empowered to mitigate threats more effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Input to the Work Group 
<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">OIDF Shared Signals Work Group</a> is very active and welcomes a wider set of requirements from implementors. For example, implementors at April’s Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) discussed the possibility of using the Shared Signals Framework to communicate lifecycle and security signals between participants (issuers, wallets, etc.) in mobile driving license (mDL) and other digital identity ecosystems. Such an approach would lower the burden on issuing authorities to deploy across wallets and ensure their policies are enforced consistently.</p>

 A Vision for Crypto-friendly Jurisdiction 
<p><a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/">Cyber Republic</a> DAO LLC, an entity previously incorporated in Delaware, U.S., has strategically repositioned itself by migrating to the Marshall Islands. This move is driven by a fundamental principle: seeking an environment where the legal framework is not just reactive to technology but proactive in embracing the new digital era.</p>
<p>The U.S., while technologically advanced, presents a legal landscape fraught with complexities and ambiguities concerning digital currencies and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs). The Cyber Republic’s exploration for a jurisdiction that not only understands but advocates for the underlying ethos of cryptocurrency has led to this big shift. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/marshall+islands/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x650119b22129ca2b:0x8b3e03e8aa09b776?sa=X&amp;ved=1t:155783&amp;ictx=111">The Marshall Islands</a>, contrasting the U.S., provides a pioneering legal infrastructure that explicitly recognises and supports the unique operational needs of DAOs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 A Quick Cyber Republic DAO Run Down 
<p>A DAO, or Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, is an organisational structure built on blockchain technology, where decisions are made from the bottom up, governed by consensus rather than a central authority. The Cyber Republic (CR) is a DAO that specifically governs the Elastos ecosystem, managing its development and community assets through a system of proposals and community consensus.</p>
<p>The Cyber Republic employs a governance system where community members holding ELA, Elastos’ currency secured by <a href="https://ela.elastos.io/">Bitcoin’s hash rate since 2018</a>, can participate in decision-making processes. It involves:</p>
 
 Electing Council members yearly through democratic voting to act as proposal managers and decision-makers. 
 Submitting, voting on, and implementing proposals that guide the ecosystem’s development. 
 Using blockchain technology to ensure all actions are transparent, immutable, and verifiable. 
 
<p>The Cyber Republic promotes a robust, fair, and engaged community by decentralising power, encouraging contributions, and managing resources through collective decision-making, ensuring all members influence the direction of the Elastos ecosystem. To learn more, you can read the <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/whitepaper">CR whitepaper here</a> and visit Elastos’ <a href="https://elastos.info/">website</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Marshall Islands’ Progressive Legislation 
<p>Led by Cyber Republic Council Member <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sashmitchell/">Sasha Mitchell</a>, with support from Council Member <a href="https://twitter.com/Nenchy_Crypto">Nenchy</a>, CR <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals/65b121b760cec9007c80f76e">Proposal 144 was passed on January 24th</a>, culminating three months of effort to establish this new entity working with <a href="https://www.midao.org/">MIDAO</a>. Here are the core reasons for selecting the Marshall Islands:</p>
 
 Strategic Location and Sovereignty: Located between Hawaii and Australia, the Marshall Islands leverages its sovereignty and UN membership to set its own policies, making it an attractive location for crypto-focused laws and activities. 
 Global Leadership in Crypto Legislation: The enactment of the <a href="https://rmicourts.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/PL-2022-50-Decentralized-Autonomous.pdf">Decentralised Autonomous Organisation Act of 2022</a>, along with previous crypto-friendly laws, places the Marshall Islands at the forefront of global crypto legislation, demonstrating a progressive stance towards digital currencies and blockchain technology. 
 Innovative Legal Framework: As the Marshall Islands passed a DAO law, which is one of the first of its kind, it allows for the legal recognition of DAOs as entities that can interact with both the on-chain and off-chain legal systems. This law positions the Marshall Islands as a<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/30/marshall-islands-further-strengthens-law-that-made-daos-legal-entities/#:~:text=The%20move%20also%20makes%20the,have%20separate%20assets%20and%20liabilities."> forward-thinking jurisdiction in the crypto space.</a> 
 Support for Crypto Entrepreneurs: Over 100 DAOs have been established in the Marshall Islands, showing a supportive environment for crypto entrepreneurs, founders, and investors seeking a competitive jurisdiction. 
 Experience with Digital Currencies: The Marshall Islands’ history with digital currencies, including the Sovereign (SOV) as legal tender, despite regulatory and implementation challenges, showcases their long-term commitment to integrating crypto into their economic system. 
 Criticism and Validation: The initial criticism from international financial institutions and subsequent recognition of the importance of digital currencies highlight the Marshall Islands’ pioneering role in the crypto domain. 
 Cryptocurrency and DAO Advantages: The DAO law facilitates web3 and crypto projects by addressing common legal barriers, such as anonymity and decentralised governance, providing a more suitable legal structure for DAOs compared to traditional entities. 
 Economic Diversification: The government views the digitalisation of its economy through laws like the DAO law as a means to achieve economic stability, considering its limited physical resources and the challenges posed by climate change. 
 Global and Local Benefits: The DAO framework not only benefits the global crypto community by offering a compliant and progressive jurisdiction but also promises economic benefits and technological advancement for the Marshall Islands, positioning it as a key player in the digital economy. 
 
<p>But don’t just take our word for it; watch&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaji_Srinivasan">Balaji Srinivasan</a>, the former Chief Technology Officer of Coinbase, former general partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and author of “The Network State,” share his thoughts on the Marshall Islands in this video&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/balajis/status/1751442917603131413">here</a>!</p>
<p></p>
 
 A New Era in Blockchain Governance 
<p>The relocation of Cyber Republic DAO to the Marshall Islands marks a significant pivot in the structure of digital organisations. It’s a move that reflects the core values of Elastos—decentralisation, transparency, and democratic participation. This transition is supportive as the Cyber Republic heralds the DAO’s fifth council year, powered by the collective voice of its global community. This evolution in governance is not merely an administrative change but a demonstration of a system where decision-making is distributed across its membership, each of whom holds a stake in the direction and success of the DAO.</p>
 Strategic Relocation and Legal Empowerment 
<p>This strategic relocation underlines a broader shift in the cryptocurrency landscape, where the influence of traditional jurisdictions like the U.S. is balanced by smaller states through innovative legislation. The Marshall Islands, by welcoming the Cyber Republic, becomes a pivotal hub in the digital economy. This proactive step towards a crypto-friendly future empowers the DAO with the legal authority to forge binding agreements, opening doors to growth opportunities that harmonise individual and collective goals, such as moving forward on <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals/6605604e60cec9007c846ea6">Proposal 151 on Market Making</a> and <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals/6608069760cec9007c8489a6">152 on Strategic Investment.</a>&nbsp;It’s a forward leap that not only aligns with the vision of Elastos’ founder <a href="https://twitter.com/chen2rong2?lang=en">Rong Chen</a> but also stands as a collective achievement for the community, setting a course for the future of Web3 and decentralised digital ecosystems. Congratulations to the community, the Cyber Republic and the CR Council on this milestone!</p>
<p>In a few days, the Cyber Republic Council will begin its 5th year elections! You can be a part of the decision-making that drives our community forward. <a href="https://twitter.com/ElastosInfo">Follow us</a> for the latest updates on upcoming elections information and guidance.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p></p><p>The functionality of Ceramic and ComposeDB has been recently enhanced by a number of new features that give developers more control over account relation  definitions and data accessibility. More specifically, you can now use the following tools to enhance your applications:</p>  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/relations?ref=blog.ceramic.network#model-to-model">SET account relation</a> - enabling users to enforce a constraint where each user account (or DID) can create only one instance of a model for a specific record of another model.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/schemas?ref=blog.ceramic.network#type-validation-directives">Immutable fields</a> - allow specific data to be prevented from being altered.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/interact-with-data?ref=blog.ceramic.network#removerestore-record-from-index">shouldIndex flag</a> - gives developers an option to manage the data visibility by choosing which fields should be indexed.  <p>In this blog post, we are going to dive into these features in more detail. For a video walkthrough, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2BRQqPI354&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">this video tutorial</a>.</p> SET account relations <p>SET relations in ComposeDB enable developers to define relations between the data models that follow specific constraints and include the user as part of the relationship. SET account relation allows users to enforce the constraint that a specific account (DID) can have only one instance of a model for a specific record of another model.</p><p>The best example to illustrate the “like” feature of a social media application. SET relation can be utilized to make sure that the user (DID) can “like” a specific post only once, while at the same time allowing the user to like multiple posts.</p><p>Let’s have a look at how SET Relations can be used in practice.</p> Ceramic Layer <p>To use SET account relation in Ceramic, you will first have to define a SET <code>accountRelation</code> in your model definition. An example below consists of two simple models - <code>POST_MODEL</code> representing the model definition for social media posts, and <code>LIKE_MODEL</code> representing the model definition for users liking the posts.</p><p>The model definition for <code>POST_MODEL</code> has the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/relations?ref=blog.ceramic.network#types-of-relations">accountRelation</a> as a list, meaning that one user account will be allowed to create multiple posts.</p><p>The model definition for <code>LIKE_MODEL</code> has a <code>SET</code> accountRelation and includes the fields which should be used to create the unique relation - <code>postID</code> and <code>userID</code>. This defines that a specific user can create only one "like" record for a specific post.</p><p></p> <code>const POST_MODEL: ModelDefinition = {
  name: 'Post',
  version: '2.0',
  interface: false,
  implements: [],
  accountRelation: {type: 'list'},
  schema: {
    $schema: '&lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema&gt;',
    type: 'object',
    additionalProperties: false,
    properties: {
      content: {type: 'string', maxLength: 500},
      author: {type: 'string'},
    },
    required: ['content', 'author'],
  },
}

const LIKE_MODEL: ModelDefinition = {
  name: 'Like',
  version: '2.0',
  interface: false,
  implements: [],
  accountRelation: {type: 'set', fields: ['postID', 'userID']},
  schema: {
    $schema: '&lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema&gt;',
    type: 'object',
    additionalProperties: false,
    properties: {
      postID: {type: 'string'},
      userID: {type: 'string'},
    },
    required: ['postID', 'userID'],
  },
}

</code>  ComposeDB Layer <p>Now let's see an example of how you can use SET account relations in ComposeDB. Similar to the example above, the key component that allows you to define the SET account relation for a specific model is the <code>accountRelation</code> scalar alongside the fields that should be used to define the unique relation.</p><p>Take the example below. Here we have two models defined using GraphQL schema definition language. The first model is a model for storing data about a Picture - the source and the dimensions of the image. The model definition Favourite implements the behavior of the user setting a picture as a favorite. Note that this model has an <code>accountRelation</code> defined as SET. The field that is used to define the relation is <code>docID</code>, which refers to the document ID of the picture record.</p> <code>type Picture @createModel(description: "A model for pictures", accountRelation: SINGLE) {
  src: String! @string(maxLength: 150),
  mimeType: String! @string(maxLength: 50),
  width: Int! @int(min:1),
  height: Int! @int(min:1),
  size: Int! @int(min:1),
}

type Favourite @createModel(description: "A set of favourite documents", accountRelation: SET, accountRelationFields: ["docID"]){
  docID: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "Picture")
  doc: Node @relationDocument(property: "docID")
  note: String @string(maxLength: 500)
}

</code> <p>All this means that the user will be able to set only one image as a favorite. They can set different pictures as favorites, but only one record per picture.</p> Immutable Fields <p>Another feature that has been recently added to Ceramic is Immutable Fields. With Immutable Fields, you are able to define which fields (for example, some critical data) should remain unchangeable no matter what and be accessible as read-only data. Any attempt to alter the data set as immutable would result in an error message.</p> Ceramic Layer <p>Defining specific fields as immutable is pretty simple. Below we have an example of a simple model defining a Person - their address, name, and other details. To make these fields immutable you simply need to include them into the <code>immutableFields</code> array. In the example below, fields like <code>address</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>myArray</code>, and <code>myMultipleType</code> will be set as immutable, meaning that once this data is created, it will be unchangeable:</p> <code>const example_model : ModelDefinition = {
  name : 'Person',
  views : {},
  schema : {
    type : 'object',
    $defs : {
      Address : {
        type : 'object',
        title : 'Address',
        required : [ 'street', 'city', 'zipCode' ],
        properties : {
          city : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 5},
          street : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 5},
          zipCode : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 5},
        },
        additionalProperties : false,
      },
    },
    $schema : '&lt;https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema&gt;',
    required : [ 'name', 'address' ],
    properties : {
      name : {type : 'string', maxLength : 100, minLength : 10},
      address : {$ref : '#/$defs/Address'},
      myArray : {type : 'array', maxItems : 3, items : {type : 'integer'}},
      myMultipleType : {oneOf : [ {type : 'integer'}, {type : 'string'} ]},
    },
    additionalProperties : false,
  },
  version : '2.0',
  interface : false,
  relations : {},
  implements : [],
  description : 'Simple person with immutable field',
  accountRelation : {type : 'list'},
  immutableFields : [ 'address', 'name', 'myArray', 'myMultipleType' ],
}</code>  ComposeDB Layer <p>In ComposeDB, a specific field can be set as immutable by adding a directive <code>@immutable</code> to the fields that should remain unchangeable. For example:</p> <code>type ModelWithImmutableProp@createModel(
  accountRelation: SINGLE, 
  description: "Test model with an immutable int property"
  ) {
    uniqueValue: Int @immutable 
    uniqueValue2: Int @immutable
  }
}</code> <p></p><p>Here, we set that fields <code>uniqueValue</code> and <code>uniqueValue2</code> are going to be immutable.</p> shouldIndex Flag <p>Last but not least, let’s talk about the shouldIndex Flag available in Ceramic and ComposeDB. shouldIndex Flag allows you to control the stream indexing by toggling a boolean metadata flag. It enables you to manage data visibility and indexing. By setting the shouldIndex Flag to <code>false</code>, you can disable the stream from being indexed, making it “invisible” for indexing operations. Let’s take a look at how you can use this feature.</p> Ceramic Layer <p>When working with model documents, <code>ModelInstanceDocument</code>, there is a new method called <code>shouldIndex(boolean-value)</code> where false would indicate the stream corresponding to this model should not be indexed, and can be called with value = true to reindex an existing document, e.g.:</p> <code>const document = await ModelInstanceDocument.create(ceramic, CONTENT0, midMetadata)
// Unindex
await document.shouldIndex(false)
</code>  ComposeDB Layer <p>There are two ways to signal that a stream shouldn’t be indexed using ComposeDB. The first one is by including the <code>shouldIndex</code>option in a mutation query, setting it to <code>true</code> if it should be indexed and set to <code>false</code> in the contrary:</p> <code>const runtime = new ComposeRuntime({ ceramic, context, definition: composite.toRuntime() })
await runtime.executeQuery&lt;{
updateProfile: { viewer: { profile: { name: string } } }
}&gt;(`
  mutation UpdateProfile($input: UpdateProfileInput!) {
    updateProfile(input: $input) {
      viewer {
        profile {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
`, { input: { id: profileID, content: {}, options: { shouldIndex: false } } },
)</code> <p>The second way is to use a mutation type called enableIndexing, just like a create or update mutation, it should be paired with the model’s name, sending the streamId and shouldIndex value as part of the input, e.g.:</p> <code>const enableIndexingPostMutation = `mutation EnableIndexingPost($input: EnableIndexingPostInput!) {
  enableIndexingPost(input: $input) {
    document {
      id
    }
  }
}`

await runtime.executeQuery&lt;{ enableIndexingPost: { document: { id: string } } }&gt;
enableIndexingPostMutation, { input: { id, shouldIndex: false } },)
</code> <p>Note that the shouldIndex flag doesn’t delete the data. If set to <code>false</code>, the stream will still exist on the network; however, it will not be indexed and will not be available for data interactions.</p>  Summary <p>The powerful new features in Ceramic and ComposeDB offer users a sophisticated toolkit for data management. From enforcing unique constraints with SET account relations to securing key data with immutable fields and controlling indexing operations using the shouldIndex flag, these features empower developers to build robust and efficient data models for their applications.

<p>Bitcoin fundamentally transforms access to financial services by operating on a decentralized network, where trust is built through cryptographic proofs rather than a centralised authority. This is crucial in places like Nigeria and Brazil, where traditional banking either falls short or imposes prohibitive costs on users. Bitcoin’s promise, therefore, isn’t just theoretical but a practical solution to real economic constraints faced by millions. Its potential to safeguard assets against inflation and political instability makes it particularly appealing in these markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Creation and Significance of the BIT Index 
<p>Elastos launched the <a href="https://elastos.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BitcoinSurveyOff.pdf">BIT Index</a> to track the understanding and usage of Bitcoin globally. This index serves a vital role by providing empirical data on how deeply Bitcoin is ingrained in the daily lives of its users, especially in tech-savvy demographics across various countries. By focusing on markets where digital currencies could leapfrog traditional financial systems, the BIT Index highlights areas where Bitcoin’s impact is most profound, quantifying trust and optimism in contrast to established economies. <a href="https://elastos.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BitcoinSurveyOff.pdf">See here!</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Integration of BeL2 and Elastos’ Technologies to Enhance Bitcoin 
<p><a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos</a> redefines the structural framework of the internet with its SmartWeb platform, where Bitcoin’s blockchain plays a central role, being <a href="https://elastos.info/news/ela-queen-of-bitcoin/">merged-mined and secured</a> by Bitcoin’s network, a concept suggested by <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.220">Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010</a>. This opens up a new symbiotic door, where Bitcoin’s utility and energy resources can be enhanced in ways not previously considered possible, enhancing ‘Be Your Own Bank’ into ‘Be Your Own Internet,’ allowing you to control and monetise your data with Bitcoin in a world that is increasingly being digitised.</p>
<p><a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a> by Elastos introduces a ‘BTC Oracle’ and a second-layer interoperability solution to Bitcoin’s network, allowing a data feed to be generated on Bitcoin that can communicate with Ethereum blockchains, making deals, executing contracts, and expanding its influence without ever compromising its integrity. As a result, Bitcoin users globally can extend the utility of their Bitcoin to interact with services and operate with reduced fees and increased speed. By using a layer atop the existing Bitcoin blockchain, BeL2 enables Layer 2 solutions which simplify transactions and further reduce the need for intermediaries, aligning with decentralisation and user empowerment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BeL2’s ability to enable smart contracts directly on Bitcoin transforms it from a passive asset into an active tool for decentralised applications (dApps). This capability allows Bitcoin to engage in complex financial transactions and agreements, directly on its blockchain, without the need to convert into other crypto tokens. But what’s more, BeL2’s BTC Oracle data feed could be expanded to support decentralized indices, such as enhancing the BIT Index, by providing crucial privacy-preserving insights to stakeholders in Bitcoin markets regarding transactions, volume, and value.</p>
<p>Additionally, this data feed could offer market liquidity measures, real-time alerts for unusual activity, and insights into network health metrics. It could also facilitate risk management by identifying transaction patterns and market depth, and support regulatory compliance by aggregating anonymized data for AML and CFT compliance. So, after initial research has been conducted, what have we discovered? Let’s dive in!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Evaluating the Current Impact and Future Trajectory of Bitcoin with BeL2 and Elastos 
<p>According to the inaugural BIT Index, 20% of Nigerian consumers use Bitcoin daily, which is significantly higher than the global average of 15%. In the UAE, daily usage stands at 20%, compared to only 8% and 9% in more developed markets like Germany and the UK, respectively. This stark difference underscores the effectiveness of Bitcoin in fulfilling the financial needs of users in emerging markets, where traditional banking systems often fail to meet these needs due to high fees or lack of accessibility. As BeL2 broadens Bitcoin’s capabilities and integrates it into more daily transactions and contracts, the BIT Index could track an increase in Bitcoin’s usage and trust levels, particularly in regions eager for more sophisticated financial tools.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The future of Bitcoin, particularly in these emerging markets, looks optimistic. The BIT Index shows that 78% of Nigerian respondents and 70% of Brazilians believe Bitcoin’s usage and value will continue to rise. This optimism, coupled with the technological advancements provided by BeL2 and Elastos, sets the stage for a more robust adoption of Bitcoin. As these technologies mature, they are likely to catalyze the next wave of innovations in financial services, making Bitcoin not only a store of value but also a cornerstone for new economic interactions on the SmartWeb.</p>
<p>The integration of Bitcoin with technologies like BeL2 and the strategic insights provided by the BIT Index paint a promising picture for the future of decentralized finance. Through a simplified, secure, and user-centric approach, Bitcoin is poised to transform the economic landscape, especially in regions that stand to benefit the most from its promises.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>April brings change in many forms – not just shorter days and falling leaves from our deciduous trees. For business it’s not only a new trading quarter and for some a new financial year, but also the arrival of policy exposure drafts from Government agencies that sometimes stack three, four or five deep. This is hard enough for people or organisations, but for consensus-driven community/industry groups it is quite daunting. I’ve always found it strange that while agencies recognise the value of group responses, additional time for the process is not afforded to them by default. However, it’s great that most agencies do so when approached. You know who you are, so thank you!</p>

<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to reliability, scalability, and performance, the Ceramic core developers have spent a lot of the last year making significant architectural improvements to our Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS). To further advance the goal of a reliable and performant anchoring system, the CAS is moving away from IPFS. This change requires developers to upgrade their Ceramic nodes to v5.3+ by 6th of May, 2024 to avoid potential data loss.</p> About the change <p>The Ceramic team is getting closer to releasing Ceramic’s Recon protocol, intended to dramatically improve the performance, scalability, and reliability of cross-node data synchronization. Utilizing our new custom Recon protocol requires moving away from IPFS pubsub as the mechanism for synchronizing Streams in Ceramic. In preparation for this change, the Ceramic team has built a new direct HTTP-based mechanism for sharing Time Events from the CAS to Ceramic nodes. This means that newer Ceramic nodes no longer have any dependency on IPFS pubsub to learn about Time Events from the CAS. Older Ceramic nodes, however, may still be relying on pubsub to learn about Time Events. Since the correct delivery of Time Events is a requirement to avoid data loss, it is important that all Ceramic nodes on the network be upgraded to at least v5.3 by the 6th of May, 2024, to avoid potential data loss.</p> What does this mean to Ceramic developers? <p>Developers must upgrade their Ceramic nodes to v5.3+ by the 6th of May, 2024. After the 6th of May, the CAS will no longer publish Time Events to IPFS pubsub which means that if you don’t upgrade to v5.3+, your node won’t get notifications about anchor successes, which in turn may result in data loss.</p> How to get support? <p>If you need support regarding the upgrade or choosing the best path forward for your project, please create a post on <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/upgrade-your-ceramic-node-to-v5-3-before-the-6th-of-may/1563?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic developer forum</a> with your project details and the core Ceramic team members will reach out to you.</p>

 An innovative approach to support Bitcoin’s decarbonization by financially rewarding miners who use clean&nbsp;energy <p>One of the most pervasive conversations surrounding blockchain technology is sustainability. Blockchain networks — specifically proof-of-work (PoW) networks like Bitcoin — can consume large amounts of energy. Recent estimates suggest that Bitcoin mining is currently responsible annually for an estimated 85 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (<a href="https://filecache.mediaroom.com/mr5mr_paypal/186970/Green_Mining_Initiative_2024.pdf">as of April 02, 2024</a>). Even with new blockchain consensus mechanisms proliferating rapidly, Bitcoin’s PoW architecture is likely to&nbsp;persist.</p><p>PayPal’s Blockchain Research Group, in a strategic collaboration with Energy Web and DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (“DMG”), presents an opportunity to accelerate the clean energy transition for Bitcoin mining. Just like so many other mechanisms throughout web3, we propose the use of cryptoeconomic incentives to encourage desired behavior: Bitcoin miners using low-carbon energy sources in their mining operations. The full research paper, linked below, outlines an opportunity that not only rewards Bitcoin miners for operating with sustainable energy, but also increases the likelihood of participating entities to route on-chain transactions to these specific&nbsp;miners.</p><p>Read the full paper from the <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.paypal-corp.com%2Fimage%2FGreen_Mining_Initiative_2024.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cwilburns%40paypal.com%7Cd2510d3722fc4939429608dc622c4164%7Cfb00791460204374977e21bac5f3f4c8%7C0%7C0%7C638493189460006661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=eCx%2Fu0p3a6TNK7Y0VpN3x0W%2FMl9e8ZHGEcGnVo3IRGo%3D&amp;reserved=0">PayPal Blockchain Research&nbsp;Group</a>.</p> Incentivizing desired activity with cryptoeconomics <p>Rational miners are driven by cryptoeconomic incentives. They expect to be rewarded with an asset (bitcoin BTC) that is more valuable than the resources they expended to acquire that reward. Much of blockchain’s history has focused on how to get a group of disparate, individual miners to all perform honestly and responsibly in the maintenance of a decentralized ledger.</p><p>Since 2008, Bitcoin has achieved the robust, secure, decentralized, and censorship-resistant maintenance of the ledger with its decentralized miner community. In other words, the fundamental cryptoeconomic structure of Bitcoin and its PoW consensus mechanism has proven successful. Now, the question is whether additional cryptoeconomic incentives can be layered on top of the fundamental PoW mechanism thereby allowing us to encourage more environmentally sustainable actions that we desire as a community.</p><p>PayPal’s Blockchain Research Group’s partner EnergyWeb has developed a clean energy validation platform to permit Bitcoin miners to obtain low-carbon accreditation for their mining operations. These green miners are associated with public keys (which we refer to as green keys), to which rewards can be distributed. On-chain transactions are preferentially routed to green miners by being broadcasted with low transaction fees, but with some BTC reward “locked” in a multisig payout address. Green miners will be incentivized to mine these transactions, since they will be the only ones eligible for the additional “locked” BTC&nbsp;reward.</p><p>PayPal’s Blockchain Research Group hopes that this paper influences preferred behaviors by proposing ways in which fundamental cryptoeconomic incentives can be reapplied to improve and optimize existing, proven, strong networks. Sustainability is a significant topic of conversation for nearly every emerging and established industry in the world, and we aim to support the role of crypto in a sustainable future.</p><p>Read the full paper from the <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.paypal-corp.com%2Fimage%2FGreen_Mining_Initiative_2024.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cwilburns%40paypal.com%7Cd2510d3722fc4939429608dc622c4164%7Cfb00791460204374977e21bac5f3f4c8%7C0%7C0%7C638493189460006661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=eCx%2Fu0p3a6TNK7Y0VpN3x0W%2FMl9e8ZHGEcGnVo3IRGo%3D&amp;reserved=0">PayPal Blockchain Research&nbsp;Group</a>.</p><p>About Energy Web Foundation:Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CEO</p>



<p>Adoption of passkeys has grown rapidly since the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">introduction</a> of sync capabilities less than two years ago, with passkeys being offered by a large and growing proportion of the world’s most visited websites and services. This adoption has come in large part because passkeys offer a true password replacement, helping address the well-known security and user experience weaknesses of knowledge-based authentication like passwords and even other second-factor methods like SMS OTPs.</p>



<p>Market adoption of new technology naturally moves faster than the associated policy and regulatory guidance – which for user authentication still generally reflects the password-centric worldview from when such guidance was developed. This is why we are excited that NIST has taken a lead amongst government agencies and moved quickly to provide <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/giving-nist-digital-identity-guidelines-boost-supplement-incorporating">new supplemental guidance</a> confirming that synced passkeys meet Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2).</p>



<p>This new NIST guidance makes clear that passkeys – like other FIDO authenticators – can support both AAL2 and AAL3 requirements. Synced passkeys can be AAL2 and device-bound passkeys can be AAL3.</p>



<p>Crucially, the NIST supplement also cites that synced passkeys deployed in a manner consistent with the guidelines as being phishing resistant. This has obvious benefits in a world where 87% of hacking-related breaches are caused by weak or stolen passwords and where there has been a 967% rise in credential phishing since 2022.</p>



<p>Passkey adoption to be boosted by the ‘reassurance of assurance’</p>



<p>While the rate of passkey adoption to date has been nothing short of phenomenal, some organizations – particularly those in regulated industries – understandably want to see that key government bodies accept and recommend new technologies like passkeys before supporting them at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have heard this from our partners and constituents across the globe about NIST in particular, whose digital identity guidelines are a global gold standard that are frequently cited by other countries. Today’s supplemental guidance from NIST stands to remove a critical barrier to passkey adoption, which now stands to be further accelerated.</p>



<p>However, there is still work to do. We are working closely with other agencies across the globe to educate them about passkeys and the importance of phishing-resistant authentication, and are encouraging them to update legacy policies, guidelines, and regulations to ultimately allow all organizations, wherever they are, to confidently provide more secure and more convenient authentication to their users and customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building NIST guidance into business best practices</p>



<p>Identity and authentication architects should contemplate NIST’s supplemental guidance as part of their broader digital identity strategy. For example, for every use case where password + OTP was used in the past, a synced passkey deployed in accordance with the new NIST guidance is not only sufficient to meet AAL2 requirements, but also more effective. In the vast majority of deployment scenarios, synced passkeys will provide a significant security and UX improvement over today’s authentication patterns – almost all of which are susceptible to phishing.</p>



<p>If organizations have specific business, regulatory, or other security requirements, they can choose whether to accept a synced passkey as the primary authentication method, a second factor, pair it with a risk engine, or require a device-bound key. Today’s guidance frees architects up from thinking about authentication layers and to instead focus on business requirements and related threat models. And today’s primary threat model of phishing and social engineering can be directly addressed by utilization of passkeys.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles, 22 April 2024 — <a href="https://dlt.mobi/">MOBI</a> and <a href="https://www.gaia-x4futuremobility.de/en/projects/moveid">Gaia-X 4 moveID</a> proudly announce a joint initiative aimed to advance cross-industry interoperability. The initiative focuses on the joint implementation of two pioneering <a href="https://dlt.mobi/standards/">MOBI standards</a> — <a href="https://dlt.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MOBI-VID0002TS2024-Version-2.0.pdf">MOBI Vehicle Identity</a> (VID) and <a href="https://dlt.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2024/4/MOBI-BBC0001TS2024">MOBI Battery Birth Certificate</a> (BBC). More specifically, the initiative centers around linking physical objects — e.g., vehicles and their parts such as batteries — to Web3 digital identities and credentials. The goal is to demonstrate technical interoperability using <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) open-standards to establish a secure Self-Sovereign Data and Identities framework. The collaboration builds upon W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) to manage identities of vehicles and vehicle parts along with their credentials for transactions and claims, foundational for a circular economy.</p>
<p>Gaia-X 4 moveID is set to fundamentally reshape the landscape of mobility and vehicle services, fostering a unified digital ecosystem with <a href="https://www.51nodes.io/en/ssi-self-sovereign-identities/">Self-Sovereign Identities</a> (SSI) for all traffic participants. By crafting the essential technical and economic foundations, moveID is leading the charge toward a decentralized, user-focused mobility service ecosystem, leveraging SSI and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) alongside open-source software and standards. This pioneering ecosystem is designed to support a wide range of applications, including peer-to-peer parking and charging infrastructures, ensuring seamless data availability for smart mobility services, and creating open markets for data providers, AI applications, and mobility infrastructure services.</p>
<p>MOBI, a global nonprofit Web3 consortium, unites public and private sector efforts to create cross-industry interoperability through the creation of standards and building of critical infrastructure for Self-Sovereign Data (SSD), SSI, and verifiable transactions. This infrastructure comprises two federated networks: <a href="https://citopia.global/">Citopia</a>, a decentralized marketplace leveraging VCs, and the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/">Integrated Trust Network </a>(ITN), a DIDs Registry. Citopia and the ITN work together to deliver regulatory-compliant and standardized communication protocols for near-real-time transactions. Implemented in tandem, MOBI VID and MOBI BBC standards form the groundwork for a globally interoperable, open, and connected ecosystem; critical to unlocking a vast array of new applications for a resilient and circular economy.</p>
<p>Within the circular economy value chain, countless public and private stakeholders operate with distinct processes for managing sensitive business and consumer data. In complex, connected networks where trust incurs significant frictional costs, current centralized solutions are unable to provide adequate interoperability and extensibility needed to enable secure data exchange and authentication between stakeholders. The initiative will demonstrate the effectiveness of a Web3-enabled approach rooted in global standards by equipping vehicles and vehicle parts — such as batteries — with trusted self-sovereign identities for verifiable claims and transactions.</p>
<p>The initiative’s future potential is promising, with plans to explore standardized know-your-business (KYB) and know-your-customer (KYC) processes for Phase II. While Phase I focuses on testing technical interoperability, Phase II will involve testing business interoperability, a more complex endeavor that necessitates the creation of shared standards for the onboarding of consumers, businesses, and regulators’ trusted identities and credentials.</p>
<p>“A <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/bad-bots-account-for-73-of-internet-traffic-analysis/#:~:text=Bad%20Bots%20are%20increasing%20dramatically,%2C%20and%20in%2Dproduct%20abuse.">recent study</a> estimates that 73% of all internet traffic comprises bad bots and fraud farm traffic. Generative AI increases these risks dramatically. Today, approximately 20 billion IoT-connected devices lack trusted, verifiable identities and credentials, rendering them unable to securely engage in eCommerce,” said Tram Vo, MOBI CEO and Co-Founder. “With trusted and verifiable identities and claims, IoT devices — such as vehicles and batteries — can act as autonomous economic agents to securely share and authenticate data for every transaction, ensuring regulatory compliance and a higher degree of trust throughout the entire value chain.”</p>
<p>“A holistic, transparent system architecture for the exchange of data in road traffic which meets the new data sovereignty needs is not available today. There are individual companies that already offer services. But these services are tailored to specific applications, vehicles, or customer groups. With its open and EU compliant digital identity architecture, moveID helps to solve that challenge in the future markets,” explains Peter Busch, project manager at Gaia-X 4 moveID consortium lead Bosch.</p>

 Specifications 

<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/christophera@lifewithalacrity.com"></a></p>

<p>One of Blockchain Commons biggest priorities is producing interoperable specifications that can be used by principals in the digital asset &amp; identity field to create apps and hardware devices that support independence, privacy, resilience, and openness for users. In Q1, we worked to advance some of our specifications into true standards and also interacted with  standards being developed by the rest of the field.</p>

<p>dCBOR. Our <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/">Internet-Draft for Decentralized CBOR (dCBOR)</a> went through drafts 6, 7, and 8 this quarter. CBOR expert Carten Bormann joined us as a co-author and we continued to make tweaks based on expertise from the CBOR community, most recently revising how we defined leaves (“enclosed CBOR”). dCBOR is crucial for deterministic data formats such as <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a> because it ensures that data is always encoded in the same way, no matter when or where the encoding is done. We have high hopes that dCBOR will be an IETF standard soon.</p>

<p>Hashed Data Elision. We previously authored an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-envelope/">Internet-Draft for Gordian Envelope</a>, which we’ve continued to update in connection with our dCBOR updates. We’ve been getting less traction here, so we supplemented it this quarter with a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-appelcline-hashed-elision/">problem statement on Deterministic Hashed Data Elision Internet-Draft</a>. We also presented on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soI-j6LF4Xg">hashed data elision at IETF 119 Dispatch</a>. Our core premise was that privacy and human-rights needs are not well supported in IETF standards. We believe that hashed data elision (including Gordian Envelope) should be used as an easy method to address those needs. Unfortunately, the IETF hasn’t been strong on privacy concerns. Previous RFCs on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6973">Privacy</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6973">Humans Rights Considerations</a> are mere recommendations with no weight. The bottom line seems to be that unless an existing protocol expresses a desire for privacy standards, there’s no place for hashed data elision in the IETF, though the <a href="https://www.irtf.org/">IRTF</a>, which focuses on “Research” instead of “Engineering”, might be a home for it.</p>


<p><br><br></p>

<p>FROST. FROST, a <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">threshold scheme for Schnorr signatures</a>, originated with a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852">paper</a> in 2020. We’ve been looking forward to its deployment in wallets because of its improved resilience and privacy, plus other advantages such as being able to change thresholds offline. See <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">our FROST page</a> and <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">Layperson’s introduction to Schnorr</a> for some foundational info. In the last six months, we’ve been doing our share to help FROST become a reality. In Q4, we held an <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">implementer’s round table</a> to allow people working on FROST to talk to each other. This quarter, one of those implementers, Jesse Posner, gave a presentation at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCM8dDql6oo">most recent Gordian Developers meeting</a> to help to introduce developers to the powers of Schnorr and FROST. Dare we say: winter is coming? At least, FROST is.</p>

 Specification Docs 

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/images/2024-Q1-Research.jpg">
    
</a></p>

<p>We want to make sure that our specifications are easily adaptable, especially to developers who might want to implement them. As a result, in Q1, we added two new implementation guides and revised how we flag the status of our specifications.</p>

<p>Multipart UR Implementation Guide. Multipart Uniform Resources (MURs) are Blockchain Commons’ biggest success because they allow for the interoperable and efficient creation of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/animated-qrs/">Animated QRs</a>. They’ve been adopted by over a dozen wallets, mainly to pass PSBTs, but they can also pass other large data sets over an <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/airgap/">airgap</a>: we’ve even <a href="https://youtu.be/t-GGZ9FyuT8">tested megabytes!</a> (video link). The pioneering MUR developers based their implementations on our reference code. This quarter we supplemented that with a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-001-multipart-ur.md">MUR Implementation Guide</a> that still focuses on our code, but offers explanations of how MURs work and precise instructions on how to make them work for you. Also see our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRYgEczhekg&amp;list=PLCkrqxOY1Fbp-P1Yv-7gmu75i2QS2Z6vk">January Gordian Developers Meeting</a> for a walk-through of the Implementation Guide.</p>

<p>Request &amp; Response Implementation Guide. The heart of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a> is its ability to elide information while still allowing both certification and verification of that data. That’s the Hashed Data Elision concept that we presented at IETF. However, Gordian Envelope has much more functionality than just hashed data elision, including literal functions, which can be used in a request-response system where one interoperable system asks for something and another provides it. Our request/response docs were spread across a variety of smaller docs such as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-012-envelope-expression.md">Expressions Research doc</a> and our source code, so we conslidated it all into a single <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-004-request.md">Gordian Transport Protocol Implementation Guide</a>, which describes the layers that build up to GTP and how to do requests and responses with Gordian Envelope. As for why you might want to, our new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig-RR.md">Improving Multisigs with Request/Reponse</a> document presents an important case study on the usage of this system: it makes very difficult processes, like creating a multisig with multiple devices, much more accessiblem by reducing decision, research, and human-initiated actions, and thus much more likely to be used.</p>


  <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig-RR.md">
    
  </a>

<p><br></p>

<p>Updated Research List. All of our specifications can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/research/?tab=readme-ov-file#blockchain-commons-research">Research list</a>. Since we have specifications at a variety of levels of development, from pure investigation on our part to implementation by multiple partners, we introduced a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/research/?tab=readme-ov-file#status">status listing</a> that tells developers exactly how mature each specification is.</p>

 Reference Releases 

<p>Specifications are just one step in creating interoperability. We also produce reference apps and libraries that demonstrate how to use our specifications and how to incorporate best practices.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">
  
</a></p>

<p>Gordian SeedTool 1.6. Our top reference app has long been Gordian SeedTool, which demonstrates specifications like <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/">Gordian Envelope</a>, <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR</a>, and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/ur/">URs</a> as well as best practices for safe and resilient digital-asset holding. We’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/releases/tag/releases%2Funiversal%2F1.6">version 1.6</a> for a long time, but it’s now finally out, through GitHub and the Apple App Store. It includes updates to our newest specifications, new best-practices for UIs, and integration of Tezos assets.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases/tag/v1.1.0">
  
</a></p>

<p>Gordian Server 1.1. Our oldest supported reference app is Gordian Server, a Macintosh app that installs, maintains, and run Bitcoin Core. It demonstrates our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/quickconnect/">Quick Connect</a> URI, but more importantly it shows off some of our architectural fundamentals, such as maintaining partitioned services that are separated from each other by a <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/torgap/">TorGap</a>. The new 1.1.0 release of Gordian Server updates for Apple’s native Arm64 (M1+) chips and also works with newer version of Bitcoin Core, up to and including the newly released <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/26.1/">Bitcoin Core 26.1</a>. It also contains a major update that’s been a few years coming that replaces the older RPC password files with the much more secure <code>rpcauth</code> system. (Thanks to Peter Denton for this update and check out his <a href="https://fonta1n3.github.io/FullyNoded/">Fully Noded</a> for a wallet that integrates with Gordian Server!)</p>

<p>Rust Crate Updates. Over recent quarters, we converted our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/libraries/">fundamental crypto libraries</a>  to Rust. We are continuing to keep them updated with our newest specifications and continuing to polish them, such as our recent work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-rust"><code>bc-envelope-rust</code></a> to streamline the API and reduce calls to <code>clone()</code>.</p>

 Constrained Devices Research 

<p>Specifications, reference apps, and reference libraries represent some of our more mature work, but we’re also constantly researching other fields that might improve the management and usage of digital assets and identity online. One of our fields of research recently has been on constrained devices.</p>

<p>JavaCards. Could we hold assets or private keys on NFCs or JavaCards? We’ve discussed the topic at some of our recent Gordian meetings and have a <a href="https://signal.group/#CjQKIHy0JTnKLDSbMmtRXANQt4It6SwWTf65TXO-ZXtfV037EhBAYMV-y5nb7sxiEAJSBVC_">Signal group</a> dedicated to the topic, which you’re welcome to join. We’re hoping to do more with it in 2024.</p>

<p><code>no_std</code> in Rust. Our Rust crate for <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-dcbor-rust"><code>bc-dcbor-rust</code></a> now supports <a href="https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/no-std.html"><code>no_std</code></a>. The <code>no_std</code> crate attribute allows Rust code to run on embedded systems and other constrained environments that don’t have access to the standard library. This means that dCBOR can now be used to serialize and deserialize data in firmware for IoT devices, microcontrollers, and smart cards. It’s another step forward in our support of constrained environments.</p>

 Provenance Research 

<p>How can you validate the provenance of data or identity? This is a natural expansion of our work with Gordian Envelope, which allows validation of data even when it’s been elided, so it’s been another source of research in the last quarter.</p>

<p><a href="https://c2pa.org/">
  
</a></p>

<p>C2PA. We have joined the <a href="https://c2pa.org/">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA</a>, which is focused on developing standards for certifying the provenance of media content. We’ve talked with them some about Gordian Envelope as a possible tool for this purpose.</p>

<p>Source-Code Provenance. We’ve long been thinking about source-code provenance and the validation of software developers, going back to our support for Joe Andrieu’s <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf">Amira Use Case</a>, which grew out of <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">RWOT5</a>. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/blob/master/_pages/envelope-usecases-software.md">software release use cases</a> discuss many of the issues and how to resolve them with Gordian Envelope. More recently, we’ve been investigating SSH signing, which is now <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-23-ssh-commit-verification-now-supported/">supported at GitHub</a>. We’re working on a doc of best practices and also an SSH tool that will link up the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust"><code>envelope-cli</code></a> with <code>ssh-keygen</code>. We’ve got a working prototype and expect to be able to talk more about the project, and the issues with software-release provenance, next quarter.</p>

 Identity Research 

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9KuIlAg4wg"></a></p>

<p>Work on identity, ultimately stemming from Christopher Allen’s <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>, and continued work on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">VCs</a> at <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, was one of the things that got Blockchain Commons going in the first place. However, our partners and patrons have all been focused more on digital assets, so that’s where most of our work has been concentrated over the last five years. Nonetheless, we keep our foot in the identity pond, particularly for some of our <a href="https://advocacy.blockchaincommons.com/">Advocacy work</a>.</p>

<p>eIDAS Dangers. Late in 2023, Christopher published an article on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/eidas/">“The Dangers of eIDAS”</a>, which is Europe’s new European Digital Identity regulation. Unfortunately, besides having some deeply flawed security models, it also ignores many of the dangers of the past.</p>

<p>Identity Dangers. What are those dangers? That’s the topic of “Foremembrance”, a book that Christopher been working on for a few years that remembers how overidentification led to genocide during World War II. On March 27, which is Foremembrance Day, Christopher gave a talk on the topic on Twitter. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9KuIlAg4wg">YouTube video</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/2024/03-27/foremembrance-presentation.pdf">presentation</a> are both available.</p>

 The Future 

<p>Many of these topics will continue onward, especially our more research-focused projects, such as our look at SSH signing and software provenance. We’re also hoping to do some major work with one or more of our partners to turn many of our specifications into deployed reality.</p>

<p>Our next Gordian Meeting, on May 1st, will have another feature presentation: Dan Gould will talk about <a href="https://payjoin.org/">PayJoin</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, our <a href="https://advocacy.blockchaincommons.com/">advocacy</a> is heating up again as the Wyoming legislature prepares for its meetings in May through September. We are engaged in discussions and early agenda setting with the co-chairs of the Wyoming Select Committe on Blockchain. We are hoping to see topics such as digital attestations from the Secretary of State, best practices for data minimization, and duties of care and best practices for digital identity on the agenda, as well as topics that we’ve pushed in the past such as Wyoming eResidency.</p>

 

<p>Blockchain Commons needs funding to continue its work as an architect for interoperable specifications and a central forum for their discussion because many of our funding sources dried up due to the economic conditions of recent years. If you’re a developer, please consider becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Benefactor</a> to lend your name to our efforts, and if you’re a company, especially one using our work, please consider becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Sustaining Sponsor</a>.  We’re also open to working with partners on special projects that are open-source and aligned with our objectives, or that accelerate the deployment of our specs in your products. If sponsorship or a special project interest you, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a> for more information.</p>

<p>We have further been seeking grants to continue our work. If you have the inside track on any grants that you think would be well-aligned with our work, or just want to make suggestions, again <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a>.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons is literally a commons: we are producing work that we hope is useful for the rest of the community, some of which is now widely deployed. But, the name might have been too apt, because the <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/tragedy-of-the-commons-impact-on-sustainability-issues">Tragedy of the Commons</a> has long said that public resources of this sort are depleted. Help us replenish our resources to make sure the Commons continues!</p>

This update marks a critical step forward marking the specification's continued adoption. Community members and stakeholders are encouraged to provide their feedback by April 26, 2024. Barring any significant objections, the proposal will transition to the Working Group Approved state and subsequently seek the approval of the DIF Steering Committee.</p> What’s New in v2.1? <p>The latest iteration is a minor release, bringing with it several important updates for stability and adoption:</p>  Security Enhancements: We have introduced a "Security Considerations" section, helping users navigate the security implications of the exchange more effectively.  Expanded Use Cases: A new "Use Cases" section has been added. This aims to broaden the understanding and applicability of the Presentation Exchange, providing examples and scenarios where it can be implemented.  Editorial Improvements: To further enhance the readability and clarity of the documentation, we have made various editorial changes throughout the text.   Future Developments <p>It’s important to note that as a minor release, v2.1 does not incorporate any breaking changes. This decision ensures stability and backward compatibility. Future potential enhancements are currently being explored and can be tracked via <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/work-item-lifecycle.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation#deliverable-development-process">the "Future" tagged issues</a> in our GitHub repository.</p> We Want to Hear from You! <p>Your input is invaluable to us. We invite all community members to review the proposed changes and share their feedback via the Github issues. Your insights will play a pivotal role in shaping the final version of Presentation Exchange v2.1 and future iterations. Together, we can continue to evolve and strengthen this essential standard.</p>

		 Announcing EdgeCon Spring 2024 Keynote Speaker 
<p>Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others, have had an astonishing impact on the ways we learn, work, and think over the past year.&nbsp; Initially, the concern for many in higher education was how students might use these tools to complete assignments; however, a much more complex and daunting challenge has emerged.&nbsp; A 2023 Goldman Sachs report analyzed tasks versus jobs and concluded that two-thirds of current occupations could be partially automated by AI. This doesn’t mean that two-thirds of jobs will be replaced by AI, though some positions will indeed be lost to the new technology; rather, most of our graduates will soon be asked to collaborate with AI to complete significant portions of their work each week.</p>
<p>Drawing from the presenter’s new book, Teaching with AI: A Practical Guide to a New Era of Human Learning (Johns Hopkins University Press), this keynote will explore the evolving AI landscape and detail the companion challenges and opportunities that are emerging for higher education.&nbsp; While academic integrity and AI detection will be discussed, the core focus of this keynote will be on concrete approaches and strategies higher education can adopt, both within the classroom and across larger curricular structures, to best prepare students for the life that awaits them after graduation.</p>

					 MAGIC in Higher Education: Motivating, Active Learning, Gamifying, Imagining, and Collaborating
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Room: BSC 225 East</p>
<p>“MAGIC in Higher Education: Motivating, Active Learning, Gamifying, Imagining, and Collaborating,” a convergent parallel design, mixed-methods study, assessed how embedding play into the architecture of a classroom can improve the learning process for students. We aimed to identify if changing the natural passive environment of a classroom to an active, play-driven environment would influence learning outcomes. Considering low national retention and graduation rates within community colleges, we examined concepts highlighting embedded play in the lesson as an extrinsic motivator to augment the learning process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hypothesized that creating an abstract classroom learning environment, considering both passive and active learning can positively impact comprehension and the student learning experience. We collaborated with faculty and administration to investigate learning environments and teaching practices. We focused on the architecture and design of the classroom environment and how engaging students in play might strengthen its structure, increasing comprehension of the subject material. Our research revealed that play promotes positive experiences for students focusing on active learning.</p>
<p>The data exposed a dichotomy between teaching and learning; faculty primarily engage in passive lecture-based teaching, whereas students prefer active play-based learning. We recognized that a natural classroom environment is subjective depending on the discipline and pedagogy. Therefore, we engaged faculty to redesign a lecture to include play-based learning aligning with their discipline. The data from the active learning investigation revealed that participating in the playful activity significantly improved students’ understanding and application of the lesson’s content. Reflecting on our research and outcomes, we created a forum to showcase our data to faculty, administration, and students. This showcase has launched a play-based, active learning Community of Practice (CoP) for faculty professional development.</p>

					 Beyond Barriers: Crafting Inclusive Learning Environments through Digital Accessibility and Universal Design
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Room: BSC 225 West</p>
<p>Digital accessibility is frequently approached reactively, wherein instructors generate course content, students submit accommodation letters, and the subsequent realization of content inaccessibility prompts efforts to modify and enhance accessibility. This method proves time-consuming and perpetuates the marginalization of students by reinforcing structural and environmental barriers to learning. Rather, embracing a proactive universal design perspective in addressing digital accessibility enables instructors to prioritize the diverse needs of learners during the creation of digital content and materials. This approach minimizes the necessity for accommodations, fostering a more inclusive learning environment from the outset. While achieving digital accessibility necessitates a comprehensive commitment at the systemic and institutional levels, instructors can adopt various practices within their classrooms to advance the creation and provision of accessible course materials. This interactive workshop will guide participants in contemplating the significance of digital accessibility in higher education and in exploring practical tools for implementing digital accessibility principles across physical, hybrid, and online learning environments, grounded in a universal design approach.</p>

					 Active Learning Design: Contextualizing Multimedia for Knowledge Transfer
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Room: BSC 225 West</p>
<p>Technological advancements have made multimedia a main language for conveying information and knowledge. Multimedia elements like video, audio, animation, and interactive media enable learners to encode information in multiple formats, which leads to deeper understanding. A multimedia learning environment tailored to the context allows students to integrate and interpret relationships. This approach promotes learner-centered teaching and adheres to constructivist theory. According to this theory, learners do not passively absorb new knowledge and understanding. Instead, they actively build new knowledge by experiencing and integrating new information with their prior knowledge.</p>
<p>This session will explore the concept of visual thinking by delving into the cognitive psychology behind media-based instructions and their role in humanizing digital learning and fostering stronger teacher-student relationships. It will also highlight the significance of interactive multimedia in learning environments. Encouraging students to interact with and manipulate media to achieve their learning goals creates an environment that promotes learning by doing. This teaching approach promotes higher-order thinking in multiple dimensions, resulting in better knowledge retention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session will also explore the distinct capability of multimedia in addressing various learning objectives and requirements and discuss the methods of integrating them into instructional design. I will use actual course examples to illustrate how and when students learn best. By participating in this session, attendees will better understand the distinct advantages of multimedia teaching and acquire practical techniques for integrating multimedia design into their courses.</p>

 Why do we need a Trust Spanning Protocol? 



<p>No one would question that the Internet has completely transformed the global information economy. It has become indispensable for connectivity and reliable content delivery. But as it has grown, so have the threats against it and the vexing challenges in deciding what to trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, AI is pushing those concerns into overdrive. A <a href="https://www.cyberark.com/press/cyberark-establishes-artificial-intelligence-center-of-excellence-to-combat-attacker-innovation-with-identity-security-innovation/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20recently%2Dpublished,cited%20as%20the%20%231%20concern.">2023 study by CyberArk</a> found that 93% of security professionals expect AI-enabled threats to affect their organization in 2023—with AI-powered malware cited as the #1 concern. No less an industry luminary than Marc Andreessen recently said that <a href="https://twitter.com/tsarnick/status/1775332956447674633">the war against detecting AI fakes was unwinnable</a>—our only solution was to find a way to “invert the problem” by being able to prove <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">content authenticity</a>.</p>



<p>Why, after 30 years of steadily compounding security issues, does industry not yet have a fix? Why, with technologies like <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en">DNSSEC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>, and industry bodies like <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA/Browser_Forum">CA/Browser Forum</a>, do we still have daily headlines about data breaches, ransomware attacks, identity theft, and malware infestations? Why, with the explosive interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence">generative AI</a>, are many experts more worried about it being used to attack us than to protect us?</p>



<p>The answer is the reason the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation</a> was founded four years ago. In short, authenticity, confidentiality, and metadata privacy features were never built into the core fabric of the Internet. To solve the root of this problem and not the symptoms, we need a next-generation trust layer on top of the existing Internet.</p>



<p>The heart of this layer is a protocol that is to digital trust what the Internet Protocol (IP) is to digital data. That is the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification">ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol</a> (TSP).</p>



 Where can I get a high-level overview of TSP? 



<p>First, start with <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">this blog post</a> we published in January 2023 when we launched the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force (TSPTF). It explains the overall purpose of the TSP and where it fits in the ToIP stack.</p>



<p>Second, read the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/08/31/mid-year-progress-report-on-the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">Mid-Year Progress Report on the ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol</a>, published last August 2023 to summarize the seven pillars of the TSP design. With the exception of some terminology evolution, these seven pillars have not changed as we worked through multiple stages of Working Drafts over the past seven months.</p>



<p>Today we are pleased to announce the release of the first <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification">Implementers Draft</a>.</p>



 What does the Implementers Draft cover? 



<p>This table summarizes the 10 major sections of the specification:</p>



Verifiable Identifiers (VIDs)VIDs are the first of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/08/31/mid-year-progress-report-on-the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">seven pillars</a> — cryptographically-verifiable identifiers that provide technical trust in the TSP. Covers: why they are necessary, how they provide access to public keys and ToIP endpoint addresses, how they are verified, and how keys can be rotated.MessagesTSP is a message-based asynchronous communication protocol. Covers: message envelopes, payloads (confidential, non-confidential, headers), signatures, relationship setup and out-of-band introductions.Nested MessagesTSP messages can be nested one or two layers to achieve metadata privacy. Covers: payload nesting, nested relationship VIDs.Messages Routed through IntermediariesTSP messages can be routed through intermediaries for several reasons, e.g., asynchronous delivery, reliability, and performance. However the primary focus is metadata privacy protection. Covers: message routing, direct neighbor relationships, endpoint-to-endpoint (“tunneled”) messages, private VIDs, single intermediaries, two-or-more intermediaries.Multi-Recipient CommunicationsTSP messages may be sent to multiple recipients. Covers: multi-recipient lists and anycast intermediaries.Control Payload FieldsTSP messages can be multi-purpose, so rather than dedicated control messages, the specification defines control payloads. Covers: relationship formation (parallel, nested, third-party introductions), relationship events (key updates, routing info, and relationship cancellation).Cryptographic AlgorithmsThe authenticity and confidentiality properties of TSP relies on public/private key cryptography. Covers: public key signatures, public key authenticated encryption, encryption and decryption primitives, Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE), Libsodium Sealed Box.Serialization and EncodingTSP uses <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">Composable Event Streaming Representation</a> (CESR) for message serialization and encoding. CESR supports popular data encoding formats including JSON, CBOR, MsgPak, and others. Covers: envelope encoding, payload encoding (non-confidential, confidential, nested), signature encoding.TransportsTSP’s authenticity, confidentiality and metadata privacy properties are designed to be independent of the choice of transport protocol. Covers: transport service interface, transport mechanism examples.Appendix A: <br>Test Vectors(Still being completed) Test vectors for common use cases. Covers: direct mode messages, direct mode nested messages, routed model messages.



 How does TSP differ from other trust protocols? 



<p>Proposing a fundamental new Internet-scale protocol for digital trust is an ambitious undertaking. Why did the ToIP Foundation take this path? Let’s start by looking at related efforts in this area.</p>



 Related protocols 



<p>This table summaries other well-known protocols that address various facets of digital trust:</p>



OpenID Connect (OIDC)An authentication layer on top of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth#OAuth_2.0">OAuth 2.0</a> authorization framework specified by the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> as a RESTful HTTP API using JSON as a data format. Supports basic user profile information access; optionalYeahHighlight features include encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID providers, and session management.OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VC)A family of protocols from the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">OpenID Connect Working Group</a> built on top of OIDC for issuance (OID4VCI) and presentation (OID4VP) of verifiable digital credentials, plus a wallet-based user authentication protocol (SIOP).DIDCommSpecified by the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm Working Group</a> of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF), DIDComm is a peer-to-peer secure messaging protocol in which the endpoints are specified by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> (decentralized identifiers).TLS (Transport Layer Security)A cryptographic protocol from the IETF best known for enabling secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> browser connections; also widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP. Provides security, confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity through the use of X.509 digital certificates.MLS (Message Layer Security)Specified by the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/">MLS Working Group</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">IETF</a>, MLS is a security layer for end-to-end encrypted messages in arbitrarily sized groups. Its security properties include message confidentiality, message integrity and authentication, membership authentication, asynchronicity, forward secrecy, post-compromise security, and scalability.RCS (Rich Communications Services)A text-based mobile messaging protocol specified by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSMA">GSMA</a> to replace SMS messages with a richer feature set including in-call multimedia. RCS does not natively support end-to-end encryption; Google added it using the Signal Protocol in their own implementation. Apple has said it will support RCS once GSMA standardizes end-to-end encryption.Signal ProtocolA non-federated cryptographic protocol specified by the <a href="https://signalfoundation.org/">Signal Foundation</a> that provides end-to-end encryption for voice and instant messaging conversations. The protocol combines the Double Ratchet Algorithm, prekeys, and a triple Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (3-DH) handshake.Matrix ProtocolAn application layer communication protocol for federated real-time communication specified by the <a href="https://matrix.org/about/">Matrix Foundation</a>, it provides HTTP APIs for securely distributing and persisting messages in JSON format over an open federation of servers. It can integrate with standard web services via WebRTC to facilitate browser-to-browser applications.DNSSECA suite of extension specifications from the IETF for securing data exchanged in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System</a> (DNS). The protocol provides cryptographic authentication of data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality.ISO/IEC 14443-4:2018A half-duplex block transmission protocol designed for a contactless environment, it defines the activation and deactivation sequence of the protocol. It is intended for use with other parts of ISO/IEC 14443 and is applicable to proximity cards or objects of Type A and Type B.



 Related cryptographic data structures 



<p>Protocols are not the only ingredient required for Internet-scale digital trust. This table summarizes some of the standard cryptographic data structures that have been developed:</p>



X.509 digital certificatesAn ITU standard defining the format of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate">public key certificates</a> used in many Internet protocols, including TLS, as well as&nbsp; digital signatures. An X.509 certificate binds an identity (a hostname, or an organization, or an individual) to a public key using a digital signature. A certificate is signed either by a certificate authority (CA) or self-signed. X.509 also defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">certificate revocation lists</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification_path_validation_algorithm">certification path validation algorithm</a>.Encrypted/signed PDF filesPortable Document Format, originally developed by Adobe, became an ISO standard in 2008. A PDF file may be encrypted; PDF 2.0 defines 256-bit AES encryption as the standard but also defines how third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF. ISO 32000-2 defines how PDF files may be digitally signed for secure authentication.Verifiable digital credentialsWith the emergence of digital wallets, multiple formats for cryptographically verifiable digital credentials have been developed, including the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a>; <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#!iso:std:69084:en">ISO mDL/mDOC</a>; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">IETF SD-JWTs</a>; <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/anoncreds">Hyperledger AnonCreds</a>; and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2024/03/21/authentic-chained-data-containers-acdc-task-force-announces-public-review/">ToIP Authentic Chained Data Container (ACDC)</a>.C2PA content credentialsThe <a href="https://c2pa.org/">C2PA</a> standards define a model for binding cryptographically verifiable provenance information to digital media content together with a model for evaluating the trustworthiness of that information.



 How and why is TSP different? 



<p>As the sections above show, many thousands of person-hours have been invested in protocols and cryptographic data structures designed to address the Internet’s multitude of security, confidentiality, and privacy issues. So why have the members of the ToIP Foundation spent four years developing TSP?</p>



<p>The fundamental reasons are summarized in this table:</p>



Minimalist design as a spanning layer for higher-layer protocolsThe single most important design goal for the TSP—and the biggest differentiator from the protocols listed above (with the possible exception of DIDComm)—is the critical role of a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050415042854/http://www.csd.uch.gr/~hy490-05/lectures/Clark_interoperation.htm">spanning layer</a> in a protocol stack. The reasons it must be “as simple as possible but no simpler” is explained at length in Principle #3 of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a>. The TSP does not include many of the features of the protocols above precisely because it is designed so those features can be provided in higher-level protocols. The benefit is that all of those higher-level protocols can be much simpler and more future-proof because they automatically inherit all the technical trust features achieved at the TSP layer.Decentralized peer-to-peer architectureBy building on HTTP and RESTful APIs, the OpenID family of protocols are inherently Web-centric (client/server). The TSP does not make that architectural assumption. Like the IP protocol, it can work between any two peers across any kind of network or software architecture.VIDs &amp; DIDsLike DIDComm, all TSP endpoints use cryptographically verifiable identifiers (VIDs) such as those defined by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) specification. VIDs not only support full decentralization, but they provide portability and cryptographic agility for lifetime relationship management.Public Key Authenticated Encryption and SignatureTSP combines modern Public Key Authenticated Encryption and Public Key Signature to provide the strongest protection against both key compromise impersonation and sender impersonation. This is achieved by using either IETF RFC9180 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9180/">HPKE</a> (Hypbrid Public Key Encryption) defined Auth Mode primitives, or HPKE Base Mode or Libsodium Sealed Box primitives enhanced with an <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2001/079">ESSR</a> (Encrypt Sender Sign Receiver) pattern.Payload agilityTSP uses the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR</a> text-binary dual encoding format that supports composability of both text and binary primitives—including JSON, CBOR, and MsgPak—in the same message.Cryptographic agilityAnother key feature of <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR</a> is code tables for all types of cryptographic primitives. For example, it can transmit any of the cryptographic data structures listed above. This enables TSP ecosystems to standardize on precise signature and encryption algorithms yet still evolve them over time.Transport independenceAlthough the name “Trust Over IP” suggests a dependence on the TCP/IP stack for transport, in fact a core design goal of TSP is to provide end-to-end authenticity, confidentiality, and metadata privacy entirely independent of the underlying transport protocol.



 What implementation projects have been announced? 



<p>In parallel with the first Implementers Draft, at next week’s <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> #38 we will be announcing the first two TSP implementation projects—each one led by one of the primary authors of the TSP specification:</p>



 
 A Rust open source implementation led by co-author Wenjing Chu is being proposed as a new project at the <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">OpenWallet Foundation</a> (OWF) sponsored by OWF Premier members Futurewei, Gen, and Accenture. 



 A Python open source implementation is being developed by co-author Sam Smith and his colleagues at the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust">Web of Trust GitHub community project</a>. 
 



<p>If you are interested in contributing to either of these projects or starting your own, we welcome your collaboration. Just contact us via the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/contact/">ToIP contact page</a> or <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-tsp-specification?tab=readme-ov-file">GitHub</a>.</p>



 What kind of feedback are we seeking on this draft? 



<p>As always, we would like feedback on the usual questions about any new protocol specification:</p>



 
 Is the spec clear and understandable?&nbsp; 



 Are there any missing sections?&nbsp; 



 Are there places where more examples or illustrations would be helpful? 



 Are there specific test vectors you would like to see added? 
 



<p>In addition, we are specifically looking for your feedback in the following areas:</p>



 
 How would you imagine using the TSP? How can it enhance what you already have? What types of trust task protocols are you most interested in layering over the TSP? 



 Does the TSP provide the baseline capabilities you need to support your planned trust task protocol(s)? 



 Does the TSP enable your solution to be more decentralized? 



 What types of VIDs do you plan to implement support for? 



 What types of transport protocols do you intend to bind to? 



 What cryptographic algorithms do you want or need to use? 



 What problems are you trying to solve in your tech stack that are not addressed by existing solutions and can or should be addressed by TSP? 



 Are there other protocols in development that we are not aware of that may conflict or complement TSP? 
 



 How can you provide feedback?

   Self-sovereign identity centers on placing data control squarely in the hands of individuals. The goal shared by all stakeholders is to rectify a mistake that has grown exponentially since the late 90s—the dominance of certain companies over personal information. To enact significant change, collaboration is critical. This collaboration involves the government and the private sector working togeth

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, April 10, 2024 –</p>
<p>Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Assistant Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, Edge, and Ecosystem for Research Networking (ERN) Steering Committee member, is joining an esteemed group of scientific and cyberinfrastructure researchers at the Ecosystem for Research Networking (ERN) Summit 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ecosystem for Research Networking Summit provides the scientific and cyberinfrastructure research community an opportunity to come together and discuss ERN mission and accomplishments, hear from domain researchers and CI professionals at smaller institutions about the the successes and challenges related to leveraging local, regional, and national resources for projects, and learn about funding resources and partnership opportunities, as well as regional and national communities.</p>
<p>This year’s summit will be held April 11-12, 2024 at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center in Pittsburgh, PA. There will be open discussions and conversations on focus areas and policies as they pertain to areas of community interest including AI, quantum, Big Data, cybersecurity and protecting data, research instruments, workforce development, applications for ERN, education and training.</p>

		<p>Featuring a keynote speech titled Re-imagining American Innovation: Bridging the Gap to Unlock America’s Stranded Brilliance presented by Dr. James Martin, NSF Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering Committee member, and Vice Chancellor for STEM Research and Innovation at the University of Pittsburgh, the two-day summit will also include domain researchers and CI professionals at smaller institutions about the successes and challenges related to leveraging&nbsp; local, regional, and national resources for projects, and learn about funding resources and partnership opportunities, as well as regional and national communities. In addition to representation from small schools, HBCU’s, and MSI’s, we are grateful to National Science Foundation ( NSF) colleagues who will also be in attendance, providing opportunities for interaction between attendees and the NSF program directors. The full Summit agenda is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sQif6TaQmB8wEFprHWWn26NU_fFXK6Xd/edit">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Elaborates Dr. Barr von Oehsen, Director of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, “Scientific discoveries have always been driven by advances in instruments of observation. Today, experimental tools are more advanced and more costly to construct and maintain, and the interpretation and simulation of data is more dependent on the use of cutting-edge computing resources, services, and knowledge. Consequently, many academic institutions lack access to these facilities. Our aim is to democratize access to research instruments, and the ERN Summit provides a platform for devising strategies to achieve this objective.”</p>

<p>By Francis Beland, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>The role of audit and assurance in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting is crucial for enhancing the credibility, reliability, and accuracy of ESG disclosures. As investors, regulators, and other stakeholders increasingly rely on ESG information to make informed decisions, the demand for high-quality, verifiable ESG data grows. </p>



<p>Auditors and assurance providers play a key role in verifying ESG reports, ensuring they meet established standards and guidelines, and providing stakeholders with confidence in the reported information. Integrating OASIS Open standards such as UBL, OData, ebXML or STIX/TAXII can significantly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of audit and assurance processes in ESG reporting.</p>



<p>Enhanced Data Exchange and Interoperability</p>



 
 UBL and ebXML facilitate standardized electronic business document exchange.

 Unpacking the foundations of Verifiable Credentials Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Did you ever consider that looking at a tree only reveals half of its story? Much like a tree’s roots, which stretch as a wide and deep as its branches, the visible aspect of technology barely scratches the&nbsp;surface.</p><p>In this post, we’re going to look at the the underpinnings to technologies such as microcredentials, particularly those based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a>. We share two crucial insights: the importance of understanding the ideological foundations we use, and how seemingly-similar technologies can differ significantly beneath the&nbsp;surface.</p><p>The old adage ‘technology is not neutral’ may be true but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Technologies achieve widespread use do so because of rich, complex backgrounds.</p> The Role of Standards <p>In our everyday lives, we interact seamlessly with technologies that allow us to pay for a coffee with our smartphones using Apple or Google Wallet. We scan QR codes to find a link to websites. We use digital boarding&nbsp;passes.</p><p>All of these examples are built upon standards — agreements on how technologies should operate, which are developed collaboratively by individuals and organisations. These people either have a deep interest in the topic, work on it professionally, or&nbsp;both!</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>The aim behind Verifiable Credentials is for them to be integrated into society to the same extent as payment methods and boarding passes. The difference is that they help us prove our identity and our achievements.</p><p>As we highlighted in a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-to-find-the-right-mental-models-for-your-audience-c68097a7f0ed">previous post</a>, standards ensure consistency:</p><blockquote>A standard can be just the usual way of doing something. A standard can also be a reference to make sure things can be understood in the same way, no matter where or what is referencing the standard.</blockquote><blockquote>For example a kilogram in France is the same as kilogram in Germany, and a kilogram of feathers weighs the same as a kilogram of bricks. The kilogram is the standard, but where it is applied or what it is used for is up to whoever is using&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>This consistency is of critical importance for credentials to remain valid and recognised, long outliving the organisations that initially adopt&nbsp;them.</p> Community Interaction <p>Standards don’t spontaneously arrive, but are rather the fruits of community interaction. This collaboration happens in formal settings such as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> or the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>, or through more informal groups, as was the case with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>. The latter laid the foundation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a> apps such as <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>.</p><p>The drive to develop Verifiable Credentials has been fueled by various needs, from decentralising proof of identity, to enable the issuing of trusted documents such as passports and degrees at scale. There are also those who looking to Verifiable Credentials to finally deliver on the dream of <a href="https://badges.community">Open Recognition</a>.</p><p>Diversity within communities developing standards is vital. Without a range of perspectives, there is the risk that the resulting technologies serve only a fraction of its potential users. When we’re talking about proof of identity and achievement, this is an important consideration.</p> The Importance of&nbsp;Ideology <p>Ideologies shape the vision and goals of a community, and encompass systems of beliefs and values. In the context of Verifiable Credentials, ‘Open’ (or openness) is a key ideology. This is not just in the sense of Open Source code but in terms of broader principles around transparency, inclusivity, adapability, collaboration, and the importance of community.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Going back to the tree analogy at the top of this post, a microcredential issued using the Verifiable Credentials standard is deeply rooted in community consensus and open standards. This contrasts with other credentialing methods which may use proprietary technologies, lack adherence to standards, and ignore the broader ethos of openness.</p><p>So, to embrace the full potential of technologies built on Verifiable Credentials, we need to dig beneath the surface. We must understand and appreciate that complex supporting structure of community, standards, and ideology. This understanding helps guide us towards contributing to a more just, inclusive, secure, and adaptable digital ecosystem.</p> Conclusion <p>In examining the foundations of Verifiable Credentials, we uncover a complex blend of ideology, standards, and community collaboration. These core elements go beyond mere technical specifications, and help define the technology’s purpose and potential.</p><p>As we explore the underlying principles of technologies such as microcredentials, it’s evident that our interaction with these technologies should extend deeper than their surface-level function. Embracing values of openness, inclusivity, and collective effort, we can contribute to a digital landscape that safeguards individual rights while promoting innovation and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>We all need to dig deeper, explore the ideological foundations, understand the importance of standards, and actively participate in the communities that build our world. <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact">Reach out to us</a> and let’s work together to help steer towards a future where digital credentials support and empower everyone.</p><p><a href="https://dajbelshaw.medium.com/">Doug Belshaw</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@LauraHilliger">Laura Hilliger</a> collaborated closely, as they tend to do, on this&nbsp;post.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">Examining the Roots</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>by Andy Parsons, Sr. Director, Content Authenticity Initiative </p><p>Faced with a newly chaotic media landscape made up of generative AI and other heavily manipulated content, alongside authentic real photographs, video, and audio it is becoming increasingly difficult to know what to trust. &nbsp;</p><p>Understanding the origins of digital media and if/how it was manipulated - as well as sharing that information with the consumer is now possible through Content Credentials, the global open technical specification developed by the&nbsp;<a href="https://c2pa.org/">C2PA</a>, a consortium of over 100 companies working together within the Linux Foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>Implementation of Content Credentials is on the rise with in-product support released and soon-to-be released by Adobe, Open&nbsp;AI, Meta, Google, Sony, Leica, Microsoft, Truepic, and many other companies. &nbsp;</p><p>As this technology becomes increasingly commonplace, we’re seeing criticism circulating that relying solely on Content Credentials’ secure metadata, or solely on invisible watermarking to label generative AI content, may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of misinformation.&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, we agree.&nbsp;</p><p>That is why, since its founding in 2021, the C2PA has been hard at work creating a robust and secure open standard in Content Credentials. While the standard focuses on a new kind of “signed” metadata, it also specifies measures to make the metadata durable,&nbsp;or able to persist in the face of screenshots and rebroadcast attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>Content Credentials are sometimes confusingly described as a type of watermark, but watermarking has a specific meaning in this context and is only one piece in the three-pronged approach represented by Content Credentials. Let’s clarify all of this.&nbsp;</p><p>The promise of Content Credentials is that they can combine secure metadata, undetectable watermarks, and content fingerprinting to offer the most comprehensive solution available for expressing content provenance for audio, video, and images.</p>  <p>Secure metadata: This is verifiable information about how content was made that is baked into the content itself, in a way that cannot be altered without leaving evidence of alteration. A Content Credential can tell us about the provenance of any media or composite. It can tell us whether a video, image, or sound file was created with AI or captured in the real world with a device like a camera or audio recorder. Because Content Credentials are designed to be chained together, they can indicate how content may have been altered, what content was combined to produce the final content, and even what device or software was involved in each stage of production. The various provenance bits can be combined in ways that preserve privacy and enable creators, fact checkers, and information consumers to decide what’s trustworthy, what’s not, and what may be satirical or purely creative. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Watermarking: This term is often used in a generic way to refer to data that is permanently attached to content and hard or impossible to remove. For our purposes here, I specifically refer to watermarking as a kind of hidden information that is not detectable by humans. It embeds a small amount of information in content that can be decoded using a watermark detector. State-of-the-art watermarks can be impervious to alterations such as the cropping or rotating of images or the addition of noise to video and audio. Importantly, the strength of a watermark is that it can survive rebroadcasting efforts like screenshotting, pictures of pictures, or re-recording of media, which effectively remove secure metadata.</p>  <p>Fingerprinting: This is a way to create a unique code based on pixels, frames, or audio waveforms that can be computed and matched against other instances of the same content, even if there has been some degree of alteration. Think of the way your favorite music-matching service works, locating a specific song from an audio sample you provide. The fingerprint can be stored separately from the content as part of the Content Credential. When someone encounters the content, the fingerprint can be re-computed on the fly and matched against a database of Content Credentials and its associated stored fingerprints. The advantage of this technique is it does not require the embedding of any information in the media itself. It is immune to information removal because there is no information to remove.</p>  <p>So, we have three techniques that can be used to inform consumers about how media came to be. If each of these techniques were robust enough to ensure the availability of rich provenance no matter where the content goes, we would have a versatile set of measures, each of which could be applied where optimal and as appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, none of these techniques is durable enough in isolation to be effective on its own. Consider:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Even if Content Credentials metadata cannot be tampered with without detection, metadata of any kind can be removed deliberately or accidentally.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Watermarking is limited by the amount data that can be encoded without visibly or audibly degrading the content, and even then, watermarks can be removed or spoofed.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Fingerprint retrieval is fuzzy. Matches cannot be made with perfect certainty, meaning that while useful as a perceptual check, they are not exact enough to ensure that a fingerprint matches stored provenance with full confidence.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But combined into a single approach, the three form a unified solution that is robust and secure enough to ensure that reliable provenance information is available no matter where a piece of content goes. This single, harmonized approach is the essence of durable Content Credentials. &nbsp;</p><p>Here is a deeper dive into how C2PA metadata, watermarks, and fingerprints are bound to the content to achieve permanent, immutable provenance. The thoughtful combination of these techniques&nbsp;leverages the strengths of each to mitigate the shortcomings of the others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Let’s look at how this works. First, the content is watermarked using a mode-specific technique purpose-built for audio, video, or images. Since a watermark can only contain an extremely limited amount of data, it is important to make the most of the bandwidth it affords. We therefore encode a short identifier and an indicator of where the C2PA manifest, or the signed metadata, can be retrieved. This could be a Content Credentials cloud host or a distributed ledger/blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, we compute a fingerprint of the media, essentially another short numerical descriptor. The descriptor represents a perceptual key that can be used later to match the content to its Content Credentials, albeit in an inexact way as described earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, the identifier in the watermark and the fingerprint are added to the Content Credential, which already includes data pertaining to the origin of the content and the ingredients and tools that were used to make it. Now we digitally sign the entire package, so that it is uniquely connected to this content and tamper evident. And finally, the Content Credential is injected into the content and stored remotely. And just like that, in a few milliseconds, we have created a durable Content Credential.&nbsp;</p><p>When a consumer of this media wishes to check the provenance, the process is reversed. If the provenance and content are intact, we need only verify the signed manifest and display the data. However, if the metadata has been removed, we make use of durability as follows:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Decode the watermark, retrieving the identifier it stores.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Use the identifier to look up the stored Content Credential on the appropriate Content Credentials cloud or distributed ledger.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Check that the manifest and the content match by using the fingerprint to verify that there is a perceptual match, and the watermark has not been spoofed or incorrectly decoded.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Verify the cryptographic integrity of the manifest and its provenance data.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Again, within a few milliseconds we can fetch and verify information about how this content was made, even if the metadata was removed maliciously or accidentally.&nbsp;</p><p>This approach to durability is not appropriate for every use case. For example, if a photojournalist wishes to focus primarily on privacy, they may not wish to store anything related to their photos and videos on any server or blockchain. Instead, they would ensure that the chain of custody between the camera and the publisher is carefully maintained so that provenance is kept connected and intact, but not stored remotely.&nbsp;</p><p>However, in many cases, durable Content Credentials provide an essential balance between performance and permanence. And although technology providers are just beginning to implement the durability approach now, this idea is nothing new. The C2PA specification has always had the facility under its affordances for “soft bindings.” &nbsp;</p><p>We recognize that although Content Credentials are an important part of the ultimate solution to help address the problem of deepfakes, they are not a silver bullet. For the Content Credentials solution to work, we need it everywhere — across devices and platforms — and we need to invest in education so people can be on the lookout for Content Credentials, feeling empowered to interpret the trust signals of provenance while maintaining a healthy skepticism toward what they see and hear online. &nbsp;</p><p>Malicious parties will always find novel ways to exploit technology like generative AI for deceptive purposes. Content Credentials can be a crucial tool for good actors to prove the authenticity of their content, providing consumers with a verifiable means to differentiate fact from fiction. &nbsp;</p><p>As the adoption of Content Credentials increases and availability grows quickly across news, social media, and creative outlets, durable Content Credentials will become as expected as secure connections in web browsers. Content without provenance will become the exception, provenance with privacy preservation will be a norm, and durability will ensure that everyone has the fundamental right to understand what content is and how it was made.&nbsp;</p>

             <p>It is estimated that anaesthetic gases account for around 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year across NHS and private hospitals across the UK (covering England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). These highly volatile gases make up 2% of the National Health Service’s (NHS) total carbon footprint and 15-20% of a theatre’s carbon footprint for each operation in England alone.</p>

<p>SageTech Medical’s circular economy solution safely captures available volatile anaesthetic agents in a reusable capture canister (SID-Can) is recovered, processed and recycled back into a usable drug form to minimise the environmental impact.</p>

 Using a design workshop to jump start your&nbsp;CoP <p>At the end of the month, we’ll be gathering a number of community-based organisations, interns and faculty in an online design workshop to jump start a Community of Practice together with Cal State University and <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>. This community, supported through the <a href="https://www.internetforall.gov/funding-recipients/california-state-university-dominguez-hills">Internet for All</a> programme, will provide an online space for those promoting access and training in digital technologies in the CSUDH community.</p><p>We know that building a thriving and supportive online community requires some deliberate efforts. In this blog post, we explore the idea of a “minimum viable community of practice” (MVCoP). Once again, we dive into our Architecture of Participation (AoP) framework, and discuss running design workshops to empower individuals to co-design their community.</p>header in the budding CoP on <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a> What is a&nbsp;MVCoP? cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Let’s start with the value of a Community of Practice. Communities of Practice (CoPs) are important for people to network, share knowledge, and learn from each other. They play a vital role in supporting lifelong learning and helping people level up throughout their careers. By connecting with like-minded peers who share similar interests and expertise, people can tap into a vast pool of collective wisdom and experience. Through active participation in discussions, collaborative projects, and sharing of best practices, community members continuously learn from each other, gaining new insights, perspectives, and opportunities.</p><p>Communities of practice not only foster professional growth but also create opportunities for personal development, encouraging individuals to stay curious, adapt to change, and embrace a lifelong learning mindset. We develop real relationships in these communities, and we learn about belonging and acceptance.</p><p>But before all of that, we have to design spaces that are supportive, interesting, engaging and inclusive. This takes intention. A MVCoP is a community set up to encourage organic and collaborative growth and belonging.</p> The Bare Minimum&nbsp;AoP AoP from&nbsp;WAO<p>We’ve written extensively about one of the tools, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop">the Architecture of Participation (AoP)</a>, that we use to help us build thoughtful, inclusive and empowering communities. Briefly, because we really have written about this all over the internet, the AoP is 8 steps to help people cover all their bases when thinking about volunteering, contributing and facilitating communities.</p><p>But what are the key steps for building a Minimum Viable Community of Practice? Well, we think that the most important to start with&nbsp;are:</p>  Ways of working openly — Even at the very beginning, people need to see what’s happening within the community and how they can get involved. The open principles of transparency, inclusivity, collaboration and adaptability underpin community. Does the project have secret areas, or is everything out in the&nbsp;open?  Backchannels and watercoolers — We need places to share memes, make jokes and chat about the weather. These evolve organically, but including them in your MVCoP design suggests understanding of the social dynamics within groups of people. Are there ‘social’ spaces for members of the project to interact over and above those focused on project&nbsp;aims?  Celebration of milestones — Building a space where people belong means thinking of them as, you know, people. We need motivation and recognition. Does the MVCoP recognise the efforts and input of the community members?   Empowering Co-Design cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Running a design workshop is a great way to empower co-design within a community. By bringing together individuals with diverse perspectives, skills, and experiences, a design workshop creates a collaborative space where participants can actively contribute to shaping the emerging community.</p><p>We facilitate such workshops to encourage open dialogue, brainstorming, and hands-on activities. We aim to help people feel a sense of ownership and engagement because, after all, this is a community. This inclusive approach means that we can work together on the community’s mission, invitations and onboarding. Our intentions and goals are co-created and reflect the collective aspirations and needs of the&nbsp;group.</p><p>By actively involving community members in the design process, a design workshop not only strengthens the sense of belonging but also ensures that the resulting community is truly representative of its members’ interests, resulting in a more vibrant and sustainable community of practice.</p> Conclusion <p>Building a minimum viable community of practice (MVCoP) is a dynamic and iterative process that requires active involvement from community members. Empowering people to co-design their community will help that community evolve. The journey to a thriving community starts with small steps, but with dedication and collective effort, it can lead to a flourishing network of professionals supporting each other’s growth and&nbsp;success.</p><p>Need some community help?

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">Trust Registry Task Force</a> (TRTF) at the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation has released a new version of its ToIP <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-trust-registry-protocol/">Trust Registry Protocol Specification</a> as an Implementers Draft. This draft aims to elicit open public feedback from implementers of any type of online registry service or client software. Instructions for providing feedback are at the end of this post.</p>



 Background 



<p>The TRTF was established in the summer of 2021 in response to the sudden demand for cross-jurisdiction verification of digital health credentials during the COVID crisis. In the fall of 2021, the TRTF produced a preliminary version of the ToIP Trust Registry Protocol Specification to begin public experimentation with the protocol.</p>



<p>As the adoption of digital wallets and verifiable digital credentials has grown, so has the challenge for relying parties to verify the authorized issuers of those credentials. The same applies to credential holders, who need to judge which relying parties they can safely trust with their credential data.</p>



<p>These digital trust decisions are complicated—in both directions. To make them more accessible, participants need trusted sources of information. That’s the job of trust registries. A trust registry is a system of record that contains answers to questions that help drive trust decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of these systems of record already exist. For example, almost any legal jurisdiction has a method of registering and licensing all types of businesses and professionals (CPAs, lawyers, doctors, professional engineers, etc.) And there are hundreds of registries of accredited institutions—universities, hospitals, insurance companies, nursing homes, etc.</p>



<p>New trust registries are also emerging for new online communities, including social networks, blockchains, and peer-to-peer networks. The challenge is that the methods of accessing the information across all these different registries are wildly inconsistent—if such information is available online.</p>



 The Trust Registry Protocol V2.0 



<p>The ToIP Trust Registry Protocol (TRP) V2.0 aims to solve this problem by providing a simple and consistent way to discover who is authorized to do what within a specific digital trust ecosystem. In short, it enables parties to ask programmatically:</p>



<p>Does entity X hold authorization Y under ecosystem governance framework Z?</p>



<p>In addition to that core query type, the TRP V2 also supports queries to:</p>



 
 Assist integrators in retrieving information critical to interacting with the trust registry (e.g. get a list of supported authorizations, namespaces, or resources). 



 Assert the relationships of the queried trust registry with other trust registries, allowing the development of a registry-of-registries capability. 
 



<p>Currently, in this Implementers Draft stage, this question can be asked via a RESTful (OpenAPI Specification 3.1.0) protocol query. Future versions of the TRP may support other underlying protocol specifications (e.g. DIDComm co-protocols, ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is important to note that in V2, the TRP does not manage information inside the trust registry (i.e., the system-of-record). It is a read-only query protocol. Create, update, or delete operations may be specified in future protocol versions if demand exists.</p>



<p>To be clear, a trust registry does not create trust in itself. Your decision to trust the outputs from a trust registry is entirely yours. However, the information provided by trust registries is often required to build trust—especially between parties with no previous relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A trust registry does not create authority. The authority of a trust registry is an outcome of governance.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;– <a href="mailto:Jacques.Latour@cira.ca">Jacques Latour</a>, CTO, CIRA.ca (.ca top-level domain registry)</p>



 How to Provide Feedback 



<p>We invite feedback from implementers: systems integrators, developers, and product leaders who either need to share or access the information necessary to facilitate digital trust decisions within their ecosystem.</p>

It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes. The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:<br>– A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.<br>– A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.<br>– A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.</p>



<p>UBL v2.4 is a minor revision to v2.3 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 93.</p>



<p>The TC received three Statements of Use from Efact, Google, and Semantic [3].</p>

<p>ToIP invites the public to comment on their newly released document, Issuers Requirements Guide for Governance Framework of Verifiable Credentials.</p>



<p>The mission of the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation is to define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that combines cryptographic assurance at the machine layer with human accountability at the business, legal, and social layers.&nbsp; Part of that mission is to define generally accepted requirements for standard roles that play a critical part in accountability for digital trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Governance Stack Working Group has completed a new deliverable, the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Issuer-Requirements-Guide-V0.01-2024-01-30.pdf">Issuer Requirements Guide for Governance Frameworks of Verifiable Credentials (PDF)</a> and is soliciting public comment using our <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/public-review-process/">public review process</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/PDF-Deliverable-Review/issues/new/choose">this GitHub link</a>. While many schemes in the US, UK and Canada have focused on elements of identity credential issuance and verification, this is the first effort to define standard requirements for issuers of verifiable credential to ensure that their processes are transparent and consistent and meet the needs of relying parties and ecosystem governing bodies.</p>



<p>Verifiable credential ecosystems require both technical trust and human trust where the core requirements for the corresponding issuance processes are captured in this newly released document being circulated for public review and comment. Verifiable credentials are a type of digital representation of claims or attributes about a subject, which can be an individual, organization, or thing. These credentials are tamper-evident, cryptographically secure, and can be verified by relying parties without the need for a central authority.</p>



<p>The Governance requirements of an issuer in a verifiable credential ecosystem can be summarized as follows:</p>



 
 Issuance of Credentials: The issuer is responsible for creating and issuing verifiable credentials to subjects based on certain claims or attributes. These credentials are digitally signed by the issuer using their private key, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the information. 



 Trust and Reputation: The issuer’s reputation and trustworthiness are crucial in the verifiable credential ecosystem. Relying parties (such as service providers or verifiers) rely on the credentials being issued by reputable and trusted issuers. The credibility of the issuer is established through various mechanisms, such as being a well-known organization, being part of a recognized authority, or holding themselves accountable to the requirements of a governing authority. 



 Validation of Claims: Before issuing credentials, the issuer does its due diligence to validate the claims made in the credential. This validation process ensures that the information presented in the credential is accurate and can be trusted by relying parties. 



 Verification of Issuer and Holder: Issued credentials that contain links to the issuer and/or holder should be engineered so they can be cryptographically verified. 



 Privacy Considerations: Issuers need to handle personal data responsibly and in compliance with privacy regulations. They should only collect and use the minimum necessary data required to issue the credentials and should obtain explicit consent from the subjects. 



 Revocation and Expiry: For credentials that require expiration or revocation, issuers must have mechanisms in place to revoke or expire credentials if the claims become invalid or if the credentials are compromised. This is essential to maintain the trustworthiness of the digital trust ecosystem. 



 Interoperability: Issuers need to follow standardized formats and protocols to ensure that the issued credentials are interoperable and can be easily understood and verified by different relying parties. 



 Auditability and Accountability: Issuers should keep records of issued credentials for audit purposes, &nbsp;lifecycle maintenance, including updates to claims, or re-issuance for any reason and revocation. This enables traceability and accountability in case of disputes or issues with the credentials. 



 Transparency: The issuer should publicly disclose all the policies it follows in the process of claim and credential issuance and revocation. This disclosure should be included in a publicly available governance framework.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Elastos ($ELA) presents a compelling narrative in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, paralleling Bitcoin’s disinflationary ethos while charting a unique path through its technological integration and economic modelling. Let’s explore some of the key highlights of ELA and its economic model:</p>
 
 Merge Mining with Bitcoin: ELA’s <a href="https://ela.elastos.io/">merge mining with Bitcoin</a> allows it to benefit from Bitcoin’s substantial hashing power (580.74 EH/s), with ELA itself achieving an impressive 293.69 EH/s, roughly 50%. This synergy <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/ela-queen-of-bitcoin/">enhances security</a> while maintaining energy efficiency. 
 BPoS Validator System: The Elastos BPoS Supernodes add a secondary layer of security by verifying and signing each ELA mainchain block provided by Bitcoin miners. BPoS engages two participant groups: stakers and validators, with staking ELA to vote for validators and APR for both. 
 Fixed Maximum Supply: ELA caps at 28.22 million coins, with the final coins expected to be minted by December 2105. This fixed supply mirrors Bitcoin’s scarcity principle, foundational to its value. 
 Disinflationary Nature: ELA follows a 4-year halving cycle similar to Bitcoin, effectively cutting its annual inflation rate in half. This model ensures a gradual decrease in new ELA supply, enhancing scarcity and potential value over time. Like Bitcoin, ELA’s halving reduces the reward for block production, transitioning incentives towards transaction fees over time, and ensuring long-term network sustainability. The next halving is in December 2015. 
 Current Mining Dynamics: With a block generation time of every two minutes, ELA rewards are distributed among Bitcoin PoW miners (35%), BPoS validators (35%), and the CRC DAO treasury (30%). This distribution model incentivizes diverse participation in the network’s security and governance. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Significance of Merge-Mining with Bitcoin 
<p>Merge mining enables Bitcoin miners to mine both Bitcoin and Elastos by running Elastos code alongside, without additional costs or energy. This leverages Bitcoin’s vast hashing power (580.74 EH/s, with ELA at 293.69 EH/s) to secure both networks efficiently. By integrating Elastos’s mining process with Bitcoin’s infrastructure, miners can earn extra rewards in ELA, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship that enhances ELA’s security and economic incentives. This dual mining opportunity not only augments revenue for Bitcoin miners but also promotes a cooperative ecosystem, highlighting merge mining with Bitcoin as a strategically valuable feature for bolstering network security while being environmentally considerate. ELA today has roughly 50% of Bitcoins security protecting the network’s value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Earning APR with ELA. 
<p>What’s more, you can earn ELA as a community member with Bitcoins security provided. Here are three of the core ways:</p>
 1. Participate in Staking: 
 
 APR: Up to 2-3%. 
 Lockup Duration: 10 to 1000 days. 
 Equity Tokens: 1 staked ELA = 1 voting token. 
 Rewards: Based on amount and duration. 
 Profit Sharing: 25% to node owners, 75% to stakers. 
 Special Nodes: 12 CR Council nodes excluded from voting. 
 
<p>Re-Voting: Necessary at pledge end to continue earning. Here is a detailed guide on <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/bpos-staking-and-voting-guide/">how to stake.</a></p>
 2. Becoming a BPOS Validator: 
 
 APR: Up to 22%. 
 Entry Requirements: 2,000 ELA pledge, $6/month maintenance. 
 Rewards: 25% of block rewards. 
 Yield Factors: Staking amount and time. 
 Selection: Randomly chosen 36 nodes every 36 blocks. 
 Rewards Distribution: Automated by Elastos mainchain. 
 
<p>Here is a detailed guide on <a href="https://elastos.info/tutorial/bpos-node-registration-guide/">how to become a BPOS Validator.</a>&nbsp; Here is additional support on <a href="https://elastos.dev/nodes/requirements/">validator requirements.</a></p>
 3. Cyber Republic Council (CRC) DAO Member: 
 
 APR: Up to 35% (rewards and sidechain transactions). 
 Cyber Republic Consensus: Governance mechanism for community decisions, Elastos sidechain blockchain validation (EVM and Identity), and ecosystem development, utilizing a delegate model for decision-making and proposal voting. 
 CR Council Member Nodes: 12 community-elected delegates using ELA to vote become responsible for decision-making on community affairs, proposal recommendation, and voting. 
 Community Members: Rights include voting in elections, submitting proposals, and monitoring and impeaching council members. 
 Election and Term:
 
 Participants need Elastos DIDs and a 5,000 ELA deposit. 
 Election via ELA voting, top 12 candidates become council members. The election process starts one month (about 21,900 main chain blocks) before the current members’ term ends for seamless transitions. The next election term begins in April 2024. 
 One-year term, with provisions for impeachment and automatic removal under specific conditions. 
 
 
 Rewards and Responsibilities: Council members receive mainchain ELA rewards and Sidechain (EVM and DID) transaction revenue.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elastos and ELA combines Bitcoin’s disinflationary approach with its own technological advancements and economic strategies, enhancing its network security through merge mining with Bitcoin and offering a BPoS Validator System for additional security and APR. With a disinflationary model and a fixed supply limit of 28.22 million ELA, the ecosystem incentivizes participation through mining rewards distribution and provides APR earning opportunities via staking, BPoS validation, and the Cyber Republic Council (CRC) DAO governance. These features, alongside its economic policies, position Elastos as a distinctive and engaging platform in the cryptocurrency realm, aligning with Bitcoin’s ethos and security.

<p>On a scale of one to ten, how do you rate the&nbsp; <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=customer+experience+management">Customer Experience Management</a> (CEM) business?</p>
<p>I give it a zero.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that every service comes with a bonus survey—one you answer on a phone or fill out on a Web page? And that every one of those surveys is about rating the poor soul you spoke to or chatted with, rather than the company’s own crappy CEM system?</p>
<p>I always say yes to the question “Was your problem resolved?” because I know the human I spoke to will be punished if I say no.&nbsp; Saying yes to that question complies with <a href="https://twitter.com/dmarti/status/1702719520790479099">Don Marti</a>‘s tweeted advice: “5 stars for everyone always—never betray a human to the machines.”</p>
<p>The main problem with CEM is that it’s all about getting service to scale across populations by faking interest in human contact. You can see it all through McKinsey’s <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/the-ceo-guide-to-customer-experience">The CEO Guide to Customer Experience</a>. The customer is always on a “journey” through which a company has “touchpoints.”</p>
<p>Oh please.</p>
<p><a href="https://iuhealth.org/">IU Health</a>, my primary provider of health services, does a good job on the whole, but one downside is the phone survey that follows up seemingly every interaction I have with a doctor or an assistant of some kind. The survey is always from a robot that says it “will only take a few minutes.” I haven’t counted, but I am sure some of those surveys last longer than the interaction I had with the human who provided the service: an annoyingly looooong touchpoint.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2007/06/13/why-surveys-suck/">Why Surveys Suck</a> here, way back in 2007. In it, I wrote,&nbsp; “One way we can gauge the success of VRM is by watching the number of surveys decline.”</p>
<p>Makes me cringe a bit, but I think it’s still true.</p>
 
<p>The <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/create/a-hellscape-of-unhappy-people2c-some-on-phones-and-/6539279055434e699382ea55556b92ee?id=Eyv8KcRtGIyZKnlf8%2b0IIA%3d%3d&amp;view=detailv2&amp;idpp=genimg&amp;FORM=GCRIDP&amp;ajaxhist=0&amp;ajaxserp=0">image above</a> was created by Bing Creator and depicts “A hellscape of unhappy people, some on phones and others filling out surveys.”</p>

  <p>by Hany Farid, UC Berkeley Professor, CAI Advisor</p><p>News and trends shaping our understanding of generative AI technology and its applications.</p><p>Generative AI embodies a class of techniques for creating audio, image, or video content that mimics the human content creation process. Starting in 2018 and continuing through today, techniques to generate highly realistic content have continued their impressive trajectory. In this post, I will discuss some recent breakthroughs in a category of techniques that generate images, audio, and video from a simple text prompt.</p><p>Faces</p><p>A common computational technique for synthesizing images involves the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN). <a href="https://nvlabs.github.io/stylegan3/">StyleGAN</a> is, for example, one of the earliest successful systems for generating realistic human faces. When tasked with generating a face, the generator starts by laying down a random array of pixels and feeding this first guess to the discriminator. If the discriminator, equipped with a large database of real faces, can distinguish the generated image from the real faces, the discriminator provides this feedback to the generator. The generator then updates its initial guess and feeds this update to the discriminator in a second round. This process continues with the generator and discriminator competing in an adversarial game until an equilibrium is reached when the generator produces an image that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real faces.</p><p>Below are representative examples of GAN-generated faces. In two earlier posts, I discussed <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/how-realistic-are-ai-generated-faces">how photorealistic these faces are</a> and some techniques for <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/photo-forensics-for-ai-generated-faces">distinguishing real from GAN-generated faces</a>.</p>

  <p>Text-to-image</p><p>Although they produce highly realistic results, GANs do not afford much control over the appearance or surroundings of the synthesized face. By comparison, text-to-image (or diffusion-based) synthesis affords more rendering control. Models are trained on billions of images that are&nbsp; accompanied by descriptive captions, and each training image is progressively corrupted until only visual noise remains. The model then learns to denoise each image by reversing this corruption. This model can then be conditioned to generate an image that is semantically consistent with a text prompt like “Pope Francis in a white Balenciaga coat.”&nbsp;</p><p>From Adobe Firefly to OpenAI's DALL-E, Midjourney to Stable Diffusion, text-to-image generation is capable of generating highly photorealistic images with increasingly fewer obvious visual artifacts (like hands with too many or too few fingers).</p>

I’d love to see your generations inspired by it. <br><br>Here’s a prompt by the original creator Guerrero Art (Pablo Xavier): <br><br>Catholic Pope Francis wearing Balenciaga puffy jacket in drill rap… <a href="https://t.co/5WA2UTYG7b">pic.twitter.com/5WA2UTYG7b</a></p>— Kris Kashtanova (@icreatelife) <a href="https://twitter.com/icreatelife/status/1640583106255003650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2023</a></blockquote>



  <p>Text-to-audio</p><p>In 2019, researchers were able to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/the-weekly/deepfake-joe-rogan.html">clone the voice of Joe Rogan</a> from eight hours of voice recordings. Today, from only one minute of audio, anyone can clone any voice. What is most striking about this advance is that unlike the Rogan example, in which a model was trained to generate only Rogan's voice, today's zero-shot, multi-speaker text-to-speech can clone a voice not seen during training. Also striking is the easy access to these voice-cloning technologies through low-cost commercial or free open-source services. Once a voice is cloned, text-to-audio systems can convert any text input into a highly compelling audio clip that is difficult to distinguish from an authentic audio clip. Such fake clips are being used for everything from <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/january-2024-this-month-in-generative-ai-frauds-and-scams">scams and fraud</a> to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/fake-joe-biden-robocall-tells-new-hampshire-democrats-not-vote-tuesday-rcna134984">election interference</a>.</p><p>Text-to-video</p><p>A year ago, text-to-video systems tasked with creating short video clips from a text prompt like "Pope Francis walking in Times Square wearing a white Balanciaga coat" or "Will Smith eating spaghetti'' yielded <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/will-smith-parodies-viral-ai-generated-video-by-actually-eating-spaghetti/">videos of which nightmares are made</a>. A typical video consists of 24 to 30 still images per second. Generating many realistic still images, however, is not enough to create a coherent video. These earlier systems struggled to create temporally coherent and physically plausible videos in which the inter-frame motion was convincing.&nbsp;</p><p>However, just this month researchers from <a href="https://imagen.research.google/video/">Google</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/sora">OpenAI</a> released a sneak peek into their latest efforts. While not perfect, the resulting videos are stunning in their realism and temporal consistency. One of the major breakthroughs in this work is the ability to generalize existing text-conditional image models to train on entire video sequences in which the characteristics of a full space-time video sequence can be learned.</p><p>In the same way that text-to-image models extend the range of what is possible as compared to GANs, these text-to-video models extend the ability to create realistic videos beyond existing <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2315678121">lip-sync and face-swap</a> models that are designed specifically to manipulate a video of a person talking.</p><p>Text-to-audio-to-video</p><p>Researchers from the Alibaba Group released an impressive new tool for generating a video of a person talking or singing. Unlike earlier lip-sync models, this technique requires only a single image as input, and the image is then fully animated to be consistent with any audio track. The results are remarkable, including a video of <a href="https://humanaigc.github.io/emote-portrait-alive/">Mona Lisa reading a Shakespearean sonnet</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>When paired with text-to-audio, this technology can generate, from a single image, a video of a person saying (or singing) anything the creator wishes.</p><p>Looking ahead</p><p>I've come to learn not to make bold predictions about when and what will come next in the space of generative AI. I am, however, comfortable predicting that full-blown text-to-movie (combined audio and video) will soon be here, allowing for the generation of video clips from text such as: "A video of a couple walking down a busy New York City street with background traffic sounds as they sing Frank Sinatra's New York, New York." While there is much to be excited about on the content creation and creativity side, legitimate concerns persist and need to be addressed.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are clear and compelling positive use cases of generative AI, we are already seeing troubling examples in the form of people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/01/tech-bros-nonconsensual-sexual-deepfakes-videos-porn-law-taylor-swift">creating non-consensual sexual imagery</a>, <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/january-2024-this-month-in-generative-ai-frauds-and-scams">scams and frauds</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/fake-joe-biden-robocall-tells-new-hampshire-democrats-not-vote-tuesday-rcna134984">disinformation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Some generative AI systems have been accused of infringing on the rights of creators whose content has been ingested into large training data sets. As we move forward, we need to find an equitable way to compensate creators and to give them the ability to opt in to or out of being part of training future generative AI models.</p><p>Relatedly, last summer saw a historic strike in Hollywood by writers and performers. A particularly contentious issue centered around <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2315678121">the use (or not) of AI</a> and how workers would be protected. The writers’ settlement requires that AI-generated material cannot be used to undermine a writer’s credit, and its use must be disclosed to writers. Protections for performers include that studios give fair compensation to performers for the use of digital replicas, and for the labor unions and studios to meet twice a year to assess developments and implications of generative AI. This latter agreement is particularly important given the pace of progress in this space.</p>

<p>In the digital identity space, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/trust-establishment/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Trust Establishment</a> (TE) and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/credential-trust-establishment?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Credential Trust Establishment</a> (CTE) specifications play crucial roles in defining how trust is established and managed. CTE, in particular, is gaining traction as we approach the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW), with a plan to advance it to formal V1 status. This article focuses on the CTE, shedding light on its key features that make it a game-changer in building trust within digital credentials.</p><p>Core Aspects of CTE</p><p>CTE builds upon TE by enabling ecosystems to express their trust in the issuers of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and credentials. Credential validation steps of checking the integrity and revocation status are well known and understood, but there are not yet commonly-agreed-upon standards for evaluating the authority of a party to issue a credential’s claims.&nbsp;</p><p>Existing approaches have fallen short in one or more of the following areas:&nbsp;</p>  Ensuring the approach is sufficiently adaptable  Ability to express authorization for a specific role (not just general authorization)  Allows good performance and minimal resources, even eligible for offline use  Low-cost to implement, deploy, and use  <p>This is where CTE comes in: enabling ecosystems to express the credibility of participants, but in a way that meets the above needs. By doing so, it helps avoid “rent-seeking” behavior, in which an ecosystem participant tries to position themselves to collect transaction fees or similar.</p><p>Authority in the Ecosystem</p><p>CTE is non-prescriptive in its stance on defining who is an authority. It operates on the principle that authority is determined by an ecosystem’s existing trust structure, informing the acceptance and recognition of the credentials. This flexibility allows for wide adoption and adaptation, making it a practical solution for managing trust.</p><p>Governance and Flexibility</p><p>CTE introduces a practical governance model that is lightweight and adaptable. It serves ecosystems both large and small. It specifies roles such as credential issuance and verification, and allows grouping by schemas, or type of credential. This allows CTE to adapt well to a wide variety of use cases and simplifies the process of determining who is authorized to issue or verify credentials.</p><p>Trust on Demand</p><p>CTE includes flexible dials in cases where more fluidity is required. For example, instead of being statically included in the registry, an individual can hold credential(s) that assigns them a specific role, and the root authority of that credential corresponds to an entry/role in the registry. &nbsp; This method is not only efficient for offline use but also broadens the compatibility with different protocols, enhancing the flexibility and utility of the trust establishment process.</p><p>Impact</p><p>CTE is designed to counter rent-seeking behaviors and establish a solid trust foundation in digital credentials. It enables organizations and individuals to easily verify the legitimacy of credentials, providing a clear pathway for recognizing valuable credentials for professional development, for example. The specification’s governance model is straightforward and requires minimal technical investment, making it accessible and implementable across various industries.</p><p>How it can be used</p><p>In the wild, CTE files would be used by software representing companies and people. Companies and people will have a collection of governance files they use for different industries and purposes. In general, companies will be interested in software providing an immediate yes or no answer informing whether to accept or reject a credential. For individuals, however, software can use CTE files to advise on whether a credential is recognized by different parties. By indexing different CTE files, software can help individuals decide which ecosystems and credentials are most valuable for them.</p><p>Future Directions</p><p>As CTE heads towards v1, its potential to streamline the verification process and enhance the credibility of digital credentials is becoming increasingly apparent. DIF invites you to learn more about how CTE can revolutionize the digital identity field in providing a scalable, flexible, and trustworthy framework for managing digital credentials.</p><p>Learn more at:</p>  <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Internet Identity Workshop</a>  DIF virtual event (details coming soon)  <p>In summary, CTE is not just about establishing trust; it's about making the process more accessible, adaptable, and reliable for everyone involved in the digital identity ecosystem. Its forward-thinking approach to governance, authority, and risk mitigation positions it as a cornerstone specification in the evolving landscape of digital credentials.</p>

 Advocating for a more diverse future for the recognition of talents, skills, and aspirations CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Back in 2016, the Open Recognition Alliance created the <a href="https://openrecognition.org/bord/">Bologna Open Recogition Declaration</a> (BORD). This has helped the community organise around principles relating to the concept of Open Recognition for all. It emphasises the importance of building out technologies and infrastructure to enable Open Recognition, as well as advocating for policies which foster its development.</p><p>Eight years later, the <a href="https://badges.community">Open Recognition is for Everybody</a> (ORE) community has started work on a manifesto for Open Recognition. This will be part of the <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/Open_Recognition_Toolkit">Open Recognition Toolkit</a> and extends the BORD to help people envision and advocate for a future where Open Recognition is commonplace.</p> Unpacking Open Recognition <p>Let’s begin with defining&nbsp;terms:</p><blockquote>Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.</blockquote><blockquote>(<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">What is Open Recognition, anyway?</a>)</blockquote><p>We want to help people understand that traditional approaches to credentialing, while important for unlocking opportunities, are just one part of a wider recognition landscape.</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>For example, you could think of traditional credentialing — with courses, modules, and diplomas as like a greenhouse where growth conditions are carefully controlled. Only certain plants thrive in this environment, and they are pre-selected to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Open Recognition, on the other hand, is more like the garden that surrounds the greenhouse where a diverse array of plants grow naturally, adapt to their environment, and flourish in unique ways. Not only that, but there are many different gardens with different types of soil and varying atmospheric conditions.</p> Getting started with a manifesto <p>A manifesto is a call to action. It’s a way of allowing people to sign up to implement specific principles in order to work towards a better&nbsp;future.</p><p>To get started on that road, in a recent <a href="https://lu.ma/ore-community-calls">ORE community call</a> we asked two questions:</p>  What sucks that we want to do the opposite&nbsp;of?  What doesn’t exist that we want to bring into&nbsp;being?  <p>While these are only our first steps towards a manifesto with a subset of the community, we’re keen to share what we’ve discussed so&nbsp;far.</p> What sucks?   Simplifying complex systems — our digital landscape is cluttered with overly complex technologies and terminology. We aim to streamline these technologies, making open recognition accessible to everyone, not just the tech-savvy.  Clearing confusion and enhancing communication — there’s a tendency to overlook past contributions in the field, creating a cycle where new initiatives ignore the groundwork laid by predecessors. We want to provide clear, accurate information about Open Recognition to varied audiences.  Dismantling exclusivity — some forms of recognition and credentials are guarded as if they’re an exclusive membership available only to a select few. It’s important that we break down these barriers to create a more inclusive environment where everyone’s achievements are acknowledged.   What doesn’t&nbsp;exist?   Streamlined badge creation — we want to make creating badges for Open Recognition as easy as filling out a social media profile. This would encourage wider adoption and creativity in badge design/issuing.  Stories of success —examples and case studies help guide and inspire others. This could be part of the Open Recognition Toolkit, allowing stories to be shared and help provide practical and conceptual guidance to&nbsp;others.  Bridging spheres of learning — different forms of learning, for example formal and informal, tend to be siloed. As we know valuable skills can be acquired outside of traditional educational settings, we want to build a bridge to recognise the worth of both formal training and self-taught expertise.   Next steps <p>Creating a manifesto for Open Recognition involves creating something that resonates with a broad audience. It needs to be informative and upbeat, and have an ideological stance which advocates for a better future&nbsp;world.</p><p>Our next community call will continue the work we started this week, helping us work towards a plausible utopia for Open Recognition.

<p>By: FIDO staff</p>



<p>Passkeys hold the promise of enabling simpler, strong authentication. But first organizations, governments and individuals will have to adopt the technology – and some of them have questions.</p>



<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Demystifying Passkey Implementation on March 13, speakers from the FIDO Alliance, Intercede, IDEMIA, Yubico, Dashlane and 1Password as well as implementers including Amazon and Target, presented on their experiences implementing and working with passkeys. The virtual summit covered the technical perspective on passkeys from the FIDO Alliance, as well as use cases for passkeys in the enterprise, consumer authentication, and the U.S. government. Along the way, attendees asked lots of questions and got lots of insightful answers.</p>







<p>Fundamentally a key theme that resonated throughout the virtual summit was that passkeys are a password replacement – and it’s a replacement that can’t come soon enough.</p>



<p>“Passwords are still the primary way for logging on and they are still easily phished through social engineering and they tend to be very difficult to use and to maintain,” David Turner, senior director of standards development at the FIDO Alliance said. “The consequences are real and the impact is real to the world at large.”</p>



 Passkeys 101 



<p>During his session, Turner provided a high-level overview on what passkeys are and how they work.</p>







<p>Passkeys build upon existing FIDO authentication protocols and simplify the user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys can now be synchronized across devices through the use of passkey providers, removing the need for separate credentials on each device. Passkeys also enable new capabilities like cross-device authentication. Turner demonstrated how a QR code scanned on one device can securely connect to credentials stored on another nearby device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to synced passkeys there are also device-bound passkeys, that rely on technologies like a security key to provide the required credentials.</p>



 The State of Passkeys 



<p>The current and future state of passkey adoption was the topic tackled by</p>



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CEO of the FIDO Alliance.</p>



<p>There are now hundreds of services, including the major platform vendors Microsoft, Apple and Google, representing billions of users, that support passkeys at this point in 2024.</p>







<p>“If you are a service provider and you wish to deploy passkeys, you can do so with high confidence that your consumers will be able to leverage them,” he said.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance aims to drive passkey support over the coming years, in part by sharing best practices and success stories, which is a core part of what the virtual summit was all about.</p>



<p>Usability was emphasized as a key factor for widespread adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Usability is paramount. It must be front and center in what you do,” said Shikiar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance has released user experience guidelines and a design system to help companies implement passkeys in a user-friendly way. Future guidelines will address additional use cases. </p>







<p></p>



<p>Shikiar emphasized that passkeys are not about being a new addition to improve the security of passwords. His expectation is that passkeys will be seen as a true password replacement rather than just an attempt at bolstering existing authentication methods. He emphasized that the fundamental problem is passwords, and the goal should be replacing them, not just adding extra security layers on top of passwords. Shikiar wants people to stop thinking about multi-factor authentication factors and instead think about enabling phishing resistant identities.&nbsp;</p>



 Passkeys are on Target at Target 



<p>Passkeys are already in use at retail giant Target, helping to improve security and optimize authentication for its employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tom Sheffield, senior director cybersecurity at Target, said that the company has been leveraging FIDO for workforce authentication since 2018 and adopted it as a primary authenticator in 2021.</p>







<p>One of the ways that Target has been able to more easily enable passkey support across its platforms is via Single Sign On (SSO).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have a very robust SSO environment across our web application suite,” Sheffield said. “So for us, that made it very easy to integrate FIDO into the SSO platform, and then therefore every application behind SSO automatically got the benefit of it.”</p>



<p>In terms of how Target was able to get its users to adopt passkeys quickly, Sheffield said that the option was communicated to users in the login flow, rather than trying to explain to users what they should do in an email.</p>



<p>Overall, Sheffield emphasized that if an organization is using OTP (one time passwords) today for multi-factor authentication (MFA), any form of FIDO will provide significantly better user experience and security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There have not been many security programs that I’ve been part of in my 25-year career in this space that offer you security and user experience simultaneously,” he said. “So if you’re using anything other than FIDO you’ve got a great opportunity to up your game and provide a great experience for users which should make you a hero.”</p>



 Authenticating a Billion Customers with Passkeys at Amazon 



<p>Among the biggest consumer-facing websites that supports passkeys today is online giant Amazon.</p>







<p>Yash Patodia, senior manager of product management at Amazon, detailed how passkeys were rolled out to hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide. Patodia explained Amazon’s motivation noting that passwords are relatively easy for a bad actor to crack. He noted that passkeys help customers to authenticate more easily than other methods with a better user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amazon implemented passkeys using different APIs for web, iOS, and Android platforms. Now available across devices, Amazon’s goal is to drive awareness and increase passkey adoption among its customer base over the next year. In his view, passkeys are well suited for mass adoption and early indications from Amazon’s user base are very encouraging.</p>



<p>“If you’re a consumer facing company who has a big customer base, definitely explore this option,” he said.</p>



 Considerations for FIDO and Passkeys in the US Government&nbsp; 



<p>The U.S. Government is no stranger to the world of strong authentication, with many staffers already using PIV (Personal Identity Verification) smart card credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teresa Wu from IDEMIA and Joe Scalone from Yubico, who both serve on the FIDO Alliance’s Government Deployment Working Group (GDWG), provided an overview of how passkeys can complement PIV credentials and support a zero trust security model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As government agencies work to implement phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication, passkeys are an option that could provide a more seamless user experience than one-time passwords or hardware tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are not here to replace PIV, we are here to supplement and use FIDO where PIV is not covered,” said Wu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One area they see opportunities for FIDO is for federal contractors and employees who are not eligible for a PIV card due to their job functions. Currently these individuals rely on passwords for system access.</p>







<p></p>



 State of Passkey Portability Set to Improve 



<p>A critical aspect of user experience is the ability to change passkey providers and move from one provider to another, if that’s what the user wants to do.</p>



<p>With existing password managers and legacy passwords, the process of moving credentials isn’t particularly efficient or secure, according to Rew Islam from Dashlane and Nick Steele from 1Password. It’s a situation that the Credential Provider Special Interest Group within the FIDO Alliance is looking to solve with a new standard for securely porting passwords between different password/passkey management applications.</p>



<p>The group is developing a new Credential Exchange Protocol that will use hybrid public key encryption to securely transfer credentials; the effort also includes the development of a standardized data format for credential information.</p>



<p>“By having the standard credential format, it will allow for interoperability of sharing credentials between two different providers in different organizations,” Steele said.</p>



<p>A proof of concept demo for the credential exchange is currently set for May, during the FIDO Member Plenary in Osaka, Japan. Islam noted that the effort represents a real triumph for the power of FIDO to bring different competitive vendors together for common purpose.</p>



 Common Questions about Passkeys&nbsp; 



<p>The virtual summit was concluded with an ‘Ask Me Anything’ (AMA) session where attendees asked their most pressing questions on passkeys.</p>



<p>Among the big questions asked:</p>



<p>How should organizations consider choosing synced passkeys or device-bound passkeys from a security and usability perspective?</p>



<p>Turner answered that the first thing to make really clear is that synced passkeys are probably the right answer for the majority of use cases. That said, he noted that FIDO recognizes that there are some areas where people have a much higher risk profile, and in those cases the device- bound passkeys can provide an extra level of trust.</p>



<p>Can passkeys play a role in transaction signing?</p>



<p>Pedro Martinez from Thales responded that yes, passkeys can be used to sign transactions. He explained that the beauty of the FIDO protocol is that it is based on the signature of a challenge. As such, it’s possible to adjust the challenge in order to contain data related to a transaction that needs to be digitally signed.</p>



<p>When will passkeys be the default mode of authentication?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar said that he doesn’t think that all passwords will go away, but he is hopeful for a passwordless future.</p>



<p>“Sophisticated risk engines and anomaly detectors don’t really think twice about accepting a password,” he said. “But as passkeys become more prevalent and become the default all of a sudden using a password will be anomalous in and of itself.and I think that’s when we’ll be in the fabulous future when using a password is rightfully seen as a high risk and anomalous action.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON,&nbsp;March 22, 2024&nbsp;/PRNewswire/ — World Identity Network (WIN), the leading nonprofit organization advocating for universal identity rights, has released its groundbreaking documentary, Shadows in the Dark: Our Global Identity Crisis, exclusively on Amazon.</p>



<p>“Releasing this film to the public is a moment of great triumph for our organization,”&nbsp;says WIN Founder and CEO,&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Mariana Dahan. “We spent years interviewing undocumented persons and refugees. Telling their stories with the utmost care, precision, and nuance was a tremendous responsibility, and we could not be happier with the final result.”</p>



<p>Shadows in the Dark&nbsp;is a sprawling saga following the stories of undocumented individuals across&nbsp;the United States, the&nbsp;Middle East, and refugee camps in&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;and beyond. The documentary shines a light on those born in the shadows of the formal economy, at the margins of society, lacking common identity documents, such as birth certificates and passports.</p>



<p>The movie highlights the work that Dr.&nbsp;Mariana Dahan&nbsp;has conducted at The World Bank, as the initiator and first global coordinator of the Identification for Development (ID4D) agenda, which celebrates its 10-years anniversary this year.&nbsp;Shadows in the Dark&nbsp;offers a compelling analysis of the successes and the risks associated with this multi-billion dollars program.</p>



<p>The Emmy Award – winning film crew has interviewed decision-makers, technologists and human rights activists, advocating for universal identification and responsible use of digital technologies, such as biometrics, facial recognition and AI.</p>



<p>“Identity is at the heart of many of today’s global challenges,” says&nbsp;Shadows in the Dark Co-director,&nbsp;Brad Kremer. “It is the common thread in immigration and many of the conflict zones existing throughout the world. When Dr.&nbsp;Mariana Dahan&nbsp;approached me to do this film together, I knew it would be a journey of immense meaning. But directing this narration, and telling the stories of everyone this issue impacts, has exceeded all our expectations.”</p>



<p>Produced in partnership with the&nbsp;United Nations, the&nbsp;Human Rights Foundation&nbsp;and&nbsp;Singularity University,&nbsp;Shadows in the Dark&nbsp;features extensive interviews with displaced Ukrainian and Syrian refugees recounting their experiences with the asylum process, along with leading officials at the World Bank and the United Nations, and the founders building new digital identity solutions. The film likewise explores nuances surrounding surveillance, authoritarian regimes, and biometric systems, as well as a dialogue with a group of far-right border advocates in the United States.</p>



<p>“In many ways, this film is a culmination of my life’s work,”&nbsp;continues Dr. Dahan. “Having been born without a birth certificate in Soviet-era&nbsp;Moldova, at the border with&nbsp;Ukraine, I know firsthand how crucial identity is to the preservation of human rights. I encourage everyone to watch the film and learn more about this global issue impacting millions. Identity is the cornerstone of human civilization”.</p>

<p>The launch of<a href="https://swap.bel2.org/orders"> BeL2’s BTC Oracle</a> marks a critical juncture,&nbsp; a paradigm shift in how Bitcoin interacts with the broader ecosystem of decentralised applications (DApps) and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, as the first cryptocurrency, has long been critiqued for its limitations in scalability and flexibility, particularly in the context of smart contracts and DApps. The introduction of <a href="https://bel2.org/">BeL2</a> and its BTC Oracle addresses these critiques head-on by generating zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable secure, private, and efficient communication between Bitcoin and EVM blockchains. This development is crucial because it expands Bitcoin’s utility beyond being a mere store of value to a <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/how-bitcoin-and-elastos-are-redefining-our-world-part-1/">foundational layer</a> upon which complex decentralised applications can be built and managed directly.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Core 
<p>The core of this innovation lies in BeL2’s BTC Oracle. The BTC Oracle generates ZKPs to feed real-time Bitcoin transaction data into EVM smart contracts without compromising the privacy or security of the transactions. This functionality is revolutionary, as it allows for the creation of Bitcoin-denominated smart contracts across any EVM-compatible blockchain, vastly expanding the potential use cases and applications for Bitcoin in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space.</p>
<p>BeL2, or Bitcoin Layer 2, further extends this capability by providing a framework for developing and managing Bitcoin-native smart contracts. It represents the culmination of efforts to integrate Bitcoin more deeply into the ecosystem of decentralised applications, enabling novel financial products and services such as BTC lending, algorithmic stablecoin issuance, and more.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Mechanism 
<p>BeL2’s technology stack comprises a BTC Oracle that inputs Bitcoin-related data into EVM contracts, an upcoming ELA-powered relay network to decentralise and secure the data transmission, and the application layer where the actual development of Bitcoin-native smart contracts takes place.</p>
<p>This approach minimises reliance on intermediaries, reduces points of failure, and enhances the system’s overall resilience and efficiency. BeL2’s BTC Oracle is centred around enhancing Bitcoin’s utility and accessibility, involving innovative cryptographic techniques like ZKPs to deliver a comprehensive solution for Bitcoin and EVM blockchain interoperability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Impact 
<p>By enabling direct development on Bitcoin Layer 2, <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/ela-queen-of-bitcoin/">Elastos</a> is not just augmenting Bitcoin’s functionality; it is redefining the possibilities of the blockchain space. The ability for any EVM blockchain to leverage Bitcoin in smart contracts opens up new avenues for innovation, potentially increasing the market for Bitcoin-based applications sevenfold.</p>
<p>This development aligns with the broader trend of seeking solutions that respect the foundational principles of blockchain technology—decentralisation, security, and user sovereignty—while pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. It embodies a non-consensus, forward-thinking approach that challenges conventional limitations and opens up new opportunities for the entire crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the launch of Elastos’ BTC Oracle and BeL2 platform represents a significant milestone in the evolution of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. By addressing fundamental challenges of interoperability and functionality, Bitcoin’s value is not just in its scarcity and security but in its utility and integration into the decentralised web.</p>

     <p>To enhance the Swiss e-ID framework with selective disclosure while ensuring unlinkability, it’s imperative to incorporate advanced digital signature technologies such as BBS+ signatures. These technologies not only fortify the security of digital credentials but also significantly enhance user privacy. Such capabilities are crucial in minimizing the risk of personal data exposure and ensuring that users retain control over their information. It’s essential to continuously align our Trust Infrastructure with international cryptographic standards while remaining adaptable to emerging norms. This approach will facilitate interoperability across borders and sectors, ensuring that e-ID systems are both secure and universally recognized.</p>
<p>The parallel signatures model involves attaching multiple digital signatures to a single document or payload, with each signature providing different security or privacy features. This approach allows for a flexible and robust security framework, accommodating various cryptographic standards and privacy needs without compromising the integrity of the original document. It’s particularly useful in environments requiring adherence to diverse regulatory standards or in scenarios where resilience and both, high security and privacy are paramount. Cryptographic layering supports adaptiveness by incorporating multiple layers of cryptographic techniques within a system. This approach allows for the seamless integration and removal of cryptographic methods as needed by the Trust Ecosystem governance, enabling the system to adapt to evolving security threats and advancements in cryptographic research. It ensures long-term resilience and flexibility, allowing systems to maintain security without complete overhauls. Applying cryptographic schemes always mandates careful handling of private keys. Preventing their exposure is vital, even more so when using advanced schemes supporting derivative keys, as possible with BBS+. This underscores the need for strict security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the system’s integrity.</p>
<p>Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) represent a proven strategic model to operationalize digital trust and -identity solutions, combining public oversight with private sector efficiency and innovation. Such partnerships should be structured to encourage shared investment and risk, with a clear focus on public interest, global standards and local governance, protection of digital sovereignty and value-based adoption. These initiatives should be complemented by ongoing research into cryptographic innovations, preparing the ground for future advancements in e-ID security and privacy.</p>
<p>To address the challenges comprehensively and to build a continuously improving framework that is not only secure and compliant but also resilient and forward-looking, we must evaluate to invest in an independent body that accompanies the further progress in technology, governance and supports public and private sector adoption – to benefit from the opportunities of a trusted digital economy in the long term.</p>

<p>Marli Lichtman is Managing Director and Head, Digital Strategy and Controls at BMO Financial Group, <a href="https://www.bmo.com/">BMO</a>.</p>



<p>Follow Marli on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marli-lichtman/">LinkedIn</a></p>


 
 


<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>Let me work backwards, starting with my current role as Head of Digital Strategy and Controls at BMO. In this role, I lead two teams accountable for: (1) Strategy: defining and executing BMO’s “Digital First” agenda and (2) Controls: working in partnership with the Financial Crimes Unit to build and enhance digital controls to protect our customers against fraud. </p>



<p>I initially joined BMO’s Corporate Strategy Team in 2013 and since then have worked in progressively senior roles across Finance, Risk, Transformation and Business Operations. </p>



<p>Before joining BMO, I was a consultant in Oliver Wyman’s Finance and Risk Practice and prior to that, I worked in wealth management and earned my CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) designation. My first job out of school was at a boutique investment advisory firm. I graduated from Ivey at Western University with an Honours Business Administration (HBA) degree.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, did you visualize a dream job and if so, why?</p>



<p>I didn’t really know what I wanted to do when I was 20! I focused the early days of my career on finding opportunities where I could be challenged, learn as much as possible, maintain optionality to transition to other industries or career paths, and work with great people who would champion my career.</p>



<p>Have you encountered significant barriers in your career as a woman in leadership, and if so, what were they?</p>



<p>I have experienced many of the usual challenges you hear about concerning women in the workplace. However, my biggest barrier has been getting into my own head and thinking that I don’t deserve the positions I’ve been given (I mean, earned 😊). Through executive coaching, mentors, sponsors, and simply the experience of failing and rebounding, I’ve been able to overcome this (although I would be lying if I said I don’t experience imposter syndrome from time to time!).</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>It’s a constant juggling act, but I try to focus on 5 things: </p>



 
 Regular calendar reviews to “optimize” my time (e.g., which calls can I take from the car on my way to / from the office?)  



 Learning to say “no” and setting clear boundaries (applies to both work and personal life). 



 Finding time for self-care. 



 Working as a team with my partner who is also balancing a demanding schedule.  



 Living my values and knowing what’s important in life. 
 



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue digital trust and identity careers?</p>



<p>We need to start with education – What is Digital ID? What skillsets do you need to enter the space? Why is diversity so important? Who are female trailblazers in the space, and what has their career path looked like? Early exposure, encouragement, and mentorship are key to increasing female representation in this space.</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Build meaningful relationships. Earn the trust of your colleagues. Network within and outside of your industry. Ensure you have a mentor and a sponsor at your organization. Most importantly, stay true to yourself.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>While women have made considerable progress over the past decade, there is still more work to do. The next generation will continue to face the same challenges (e.g., gender bias, pay inequality, balancing personal life) but will benefit from increased female representation and sponsorship at Senior levels.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Be confident – you are in the field for a reason! Trust your instincts, and don’t be too hard on yourself.</p>

<p>We're thrilled to announce that <a href="https://oamo.io/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">Oamo</a> is partnering with <a href="https://ceramic.network/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">Ceramic</a> as a data provider on the platform. Oamo will issue tens of millions of publicly available credentials based on wallets’ on-chain activity and holdings. This is the first step in a broader initiative to develop and standardize the first decentralized point system, powered by Ceramic and Oamo’s credential models.</p><p>Oamo has been a big supporter of the Ceramic ecosystem from day one. By harnessing Ceramic's innovative DID (Decentralized Identifier) infrastructure and <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=oamo_announcement">ComposeDB</a> for zero-party data storage, they’re setting the foundation for a future where user data is private by design, perishable at will, and accessible only with explicit permission. Oamo and Ceramic are crafting a path toward a consensual and rewarding digital ecosystem.</p> The partnership so far <p>Since launching on Ceramic in Q3 2023, Oamo has witnessed remarkable results – over 65,000 Oamo Profiles have been created, with more than 200,000 Ceramic documents generated. Additionally, Oamo has distributed over 400,000 credentials spanning Web2 and on-chain behaviors, enriching the digital identity and access privileges of Oamo Profile users across various platforms.</p><p>Oamo credentials cover:</p>  On-chain activity across DeFi, NFTs, staking and gaming;  Wallet holdings including major ERC-20s and NFT collections; and  Social activity across Web2 platforms like Discord, Youtube and X.   Supercharging the Ceramic ecosystem <p>With this partnership and announcement, Oamo aims to enhance digital identity and engagement through:</p>  Credential Distribution <br>Oamo has indexed millions of EVM wallets’ behaviors and holdings, and will be distributing tens of millions of publicly available credentials to enrich user identities across platforms, ensuring the security and verification of online activities. These credentials can then be used to:Credentials issued will be maintained and updated monthly to include time decay and ensure they always represent the latest behaviors of the indexed wallets. Feedback from the community is welcome to develop new credentials that track the most relevant on-chain behaviors for builders in the ecosystem.  Compile specific wallet lists for airdrops.  Establish reputation frameworks based on behavioral data points.  Launch strategic user acquisition campaigns by identifying wallets in a specific target audience and contacting them via XMTP for example.    Decentralized Point System <br>Oamo will leverage its credential models to develop the first standardized decentralized point system on Ceramic, with each indexed wallet receiving its own scorecard based on its on-chain activity and holdings. Builders in the ecosystem will be able to leverage these scorecards and customize their own points system with their own credentials and Oamo’s.  Credential &amp; Points Management SDK<br>Oamo will release an SDK to allow any builder to search and leverage Oamo’s credentials and points system easily. This middleware will also allow builders to issue their own credentials and points based on their own models and app activity.   What’s in it for users <p>Anyone creating their Decentralized Identifier (DID) on the Ceramic Network (by creating an Oamo Profile, for instance) will be able to claim their credentials and scorecards seamlessly. This open and inclusive approach democratizes access to digital credentials, ensuring users from all backgrounds and levels of onchain experience can benefit from Ceramic’s ecosystem of builders.</p> What’s in it for developers <p>Oamo's vision includes diverse use cases, transforming how developers interact with consumers. The Oamo platform offers endless opportunities for various types of protocols and apps:</p>  DeFi Protocols<br>Easily find wallets matching their target audience, such as active liquidity providers on leading AMMs or active traders on DEXes across major EVM chains.  NFT Projects<br>Identify potential collectors based on their NFT holdings and distribute collections to the right user base.  Wallet Providers<br>Identify and reach whales holding specific token amounts across multiple chains.

<p>Open standards in artificial intelligence (AI) are important for a number of reasons:</p>



<p>Interoperability: Open standards allow different AI systems to work together seamlessly, regardless of who developed them or what platform they run on. This means that data and services can be shared across different systems, increasing efficiency and reducing costs.</p>



<p>Innovation: Open standards encourage innovation by providing a common framework for developers to work within. This can lead to the development of new AI tools and techniques that can benefit a wide range of users.</p>



<p>Transparency: Open standards can help increase the transparency of AI systems, making it easier for users to understand how they work and how they make decisions. This is particularly important in applications such as healthcare, finance, and legal, where transparency and accountability are critical.</p>



<p>Accessibility: Open standards can help make AI more accessible to a wider range of users, including those who may not have the resources to develop their own systems. This can help democratize access to AI technology and promote inclusivity.</p>



<p>Trust: Open standards can help build trust in AI by establishing a common set of ethical principles and technical standards that developers can adhere to. This can help address concerns around bias, privacy, and security, and promote responsible AI development and deployment.</p>

<p>The Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC) Task Force at the Trust Over IP Foundation is pleased to request public review of the following deliverables:</p>



 
 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) specification</a>&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/">Authentic Chained Data Containers specification</a>&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">Composable Event Streaming Representation specification</a>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Together, this suite of specifications provides a blueprint for creating truly decentralized, authentic, and verifiable ecosystems of identifiers, “credentials” [see footnote], and attestations.</p>



<p>The specifications describe a series of unique, innovative features:</p>



 
 Pre-rotation of keys, enabling truly unbounded term identifiers; 



 Cryptographic root-of-trust; 



 Chained “credentials” [see footnote] with fully verifiable proof of ownership and proof of authorship; 



 A serialization format that is optimized for both text and binary representations equally with unique properties that support lookahead streaming for uncompromised scalability. 
 



<p>This suite of specifications contains additional sub-specifications including Out-Of-Band Introductions, Self-Addressing Identifiers and a revolutionary “path signature’ approach for signed containers required to provide a comprehensive solution for <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-1-identifiers-ffb9091fd47a">Organizational Identity</a>.</p>



<p>With the launch of the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">vLEI Root of Official Trust</a> this suite of specifications saw its first production deployment through the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy">Python reference implementation</a> in 2022.</p>



<p>The Task Force expects feedback to be provided by April 20, 2024 via GitHub issues on the following repositories using the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/public-review-process/">ToIP Public Review Process</a>:</p>

  Most AI news is about what the giants (OpenAI/Microsoft, Meta, Google/Apple, Amazon, Adobe, Nvidia) are doing (seven $trillion, anyone?), or what AI is doing for business (all of Forbes’ AI 50). Against all that, personal AI appears to be about where personal computing was in 1974: no longer an oxymoron but discussed more than delivered. […]

 <p>Prompt: A woman uses personal AI to know, get control of, and put to better use all available data about her property, health, finances, contacts, calendar, subscriptions, shopping, travel, and work. Via Microsoft Copilot Designer, with spelling corrections by the author.</p> 
<p>Most AI news is about what the giants (<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/">OpenAI/Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://ai.meta.com/">Meta</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/technology/apple-google-ai-iphone.html">Google/Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-launches-ai-tools-to-rival-chatgpt-microsoft-and-google/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly.html">Adobe</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/">Nvidia</a>) are doing (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/09/openai-ceo-sam-altman-reportedly-seeking-trillions-of-dollars-for-ai-chip-project.html">seven $trillion</a>, anyone?), or what AI is doing for business (all of Forbes’ <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/?sh=68b7d3fa290f">AI 50</a>). Against all that, personal AI appears to be about where personal computing was in 1974: no longer an oxymoron but discussed more than delivered.</p>
<p>For evidence, look up “personal AI.” All the results will be about business (see <a href="http://Personal%20AI:%20The%20Technology%20Has%20Hit%20Its%20‘High-Tech%20High-Touch’%20Stage">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/public-ai-vs-private-ai-vs-personal-ai-whats-the-difference/">here</a>) or “assistants” that are just suction cups on the tentacles of giants (Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, Bixby), or wannabes that do the same kind of thing (Lindy, Hound, DataBot).</p>
<p>There may be others, but three exceptions I know are <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a>, <a href="https://www.personal.ai/">Personal AI</a> and <a href="https://pi.ai/talk">Pi</a>.</p>
<p>Personal AI is finding its most promoted early uses on the side of business more than the side of customers. <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/personal-ai/">Zapier</a>, for example, explains that Personal AI “can be used as a productivity or business tool.”</p>
<p>Kin and Pi are personal assistants that help you with your life by surveilling your activities for your own benefit. I’ve signed up for both, but have only experienced Pit,” or “just vent,” when I ask it to help me with the stuff outlined in (and under) the AI-generated image above, it wants to hook me up with a bunch of siloed platforms that cost money, or to do geeky things (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Python on my own computer. Provisional conclusion: Pi means well, but the tools aren’t there yet. [Later… <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2024/03/19/inflection-abandons-chatgpt-challenger-ceo-suleyman-joins-microsoft/">Looks like it’s going to morph into some kind of B2B thing</a>, or be abandoned outright, now that Inflection AI’s CEO, Mustafa Suleyman is gone to Microsoft. Hmm… will Microsoft do what we’d like in this space?]</p>
<p>Open source approaches are out there: <a href="https://www.opendan.ai/">OpenDAN</a>, <a href="https://khoj.dev/">Khoj</a>, <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/">Kwaai</a> , and <a href="https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/build-your-own-ai/">Llama</a> are four, and I know at least one will be at VRM Day and IIW.</p>
<p>So, since personal AI may finally be what pushes VRM into becoming a Real Thing, we’ll make it the focus of our next VRM Day.</p>
<p>As always, VRM Day will precede <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a> in the same location: the Boole Room of the <a href="https://computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a> in Mountain View, just off Highway 101 in the heart of Silicon Valley. It’ll be on Monday, 15 April, and start at 9am. There’s a Starbucks across the street and ample parking because the museum is officially closed on Mondays, but the door is open. We lunch outdoors (it’s always clear) at the sports bar on the other corner.</p>
<p>Registration is open now at <a href="https://vrmday2024a.eventbrite.com">this Eventbrite link</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://vrmday2024a.eventbrite.com">https://vrmday2024a.eventbrite.com</a></p>
<p>You can also just show up, but registering gives us a rough headcount, which is helpful for bringing in the right number of chairs and stuff like that.</p>

<p>Elastos today announced a partnership with <a href="http://iotex.io/">IoTeX</a>, to deliver ID verification and validation services across the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) specialists’ portfolio including <a href="https://depinscan.io/">DePINscan</a>, DePINasset and <a href="https://w3bstream.com/">W3bstream</a>.</p>
<p>DePINs lie at the intersection between crowd-sourced participation, funding and governance models and so-called Real World Assets (RWA) – tangible infrastructure such as buildings, equipment or other capital-intense assets.&nbsp; They offer a mechanism to recruit and reward participants to maintain these assets, through the Blockchain.&nbsp; When the latter is combined with a physical interface such as IoT, the contributions of these so-called physical ‘node managers’ can be tracked and, in turn, rewarded against tokens whose value itself increases with the development and use of the asset.</p>
<p>DePINscan provides a ready-to-use dashboard with essential visualizations for IoT projects and roll outs; while <a href="https://docs.w3bstream.com/introduction/readme">W3bstream</a> is a decentralized protocol that connects data generated in the physical world to the Blockchain world.&nbsp; IoTeX harnesses its innovative Roll-Delegated Proof of Stake (Roll-DPoS) consensus mechanism, designed to optimize speed and scalability for the seamless integration of IoT devices, while ensuring integrity throughout the entire process. Stakeholders cast their votes to elect specific block producers; block producers receive rewards for their contributions, which they subsequently share with the stakeholders who endorsed them.</p>
<p>Jonathan Hargreaves, Elastos’ Global Head of Business Development &amp; ESG, describes the partnership as Web3 ‘next frontier’.</p>
<p>“Extending the benefits of the SmartWeb in terms of disintermediation, transparency and privacy into the physical domain is a logical but nonetheless exciting next step.&nbsp; Our partnership with IoTeX means that entrepreneurs and businesses of any size will now have access to infrastructure that would otherwise be off limits to them, direct and on their terms.&nbsp; This epitomizes Web3’s promise to level the playing field, thanks to its unique ability to ensure irrefutable identity proof which actually requires neither party to relinquish control of the same,” he says.</p>
<p>Raullen Chai, IoTeX’s co-founder and CEO, explains that DePINs permit an entirely new generation of businesses and entrepreneurs to access and monetize global infrastructure – from buildings to cabling, for instance – that otherwise would be prohibitively expensive or inaccessible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our partnership with <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/how-bitcoin-and-elastos-are-redefining-our-world-part-1/">Elastos</a> represents an important milestone.&nbsp; Extending our offering to the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) offers some compelling advantages, including direct integration with ‘Layer 2’ Bitcoin, meaning that agreements can be embedded and reconciled direct in the World’s most popular and trusted digital currency.&nbsp; This is an essential capability as DePINs become more mainstream,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

To prove interoperability, and help build confidence that the solution doesn’t result in vendor lockin, participants have developed profiles and interoperability test suites to ensure they are able to exchange and verify trade credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) plays a similar role in ensuring interoperability within the travel supply chain (for example, when using verifiable credentials to <a href="https://standards.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AIDM/pages/645267971/IATA+Verifier+implementation+guide+-+Onboarding+using+VC?ref=blog.identity.foundation">onboard travel agents and intermediaries</a> to an airline's agency portal).&nbsp;</p><p>The Jobs for the Future Foundation has hosted a series of interoperability events (called “JFF Plug Fests”) to select profiles and develop test harnesses demonstrating that individuals can receive and share their credentials using their choice of conformant wallets, and that the flows work across conformant issuers and relying parties.</p><p>How DIF is working to make life easier for implementers&nbsp;</p><p>The interoperability challenges highlighted in this article matter for our members.&nbsp;</p><p>For one thing, it’s hard to build workable products, or viable ecosystems, on top of standards and protocols with divergent implementations.</p><p>There’s also a growing need for specific approaches to decentralized identity within different industries, regions, and use cases (such as the trade, travel and employment cases mentioned above).&nbsp;</p><p>Interoperability is a core part of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)’s mission.</p><p>Which is why DIF has hosted collaborative work to develop robust interoperability profiles for a number of years.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples include the JWT VC Issuance Profile, which describes the technical protocols, data formats, and other requirements to enable interoperable issuance of VCs from Issuers to Wallets (see <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jwt-vc-issuance-profile?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jwt-vc-issuance-profile</a> ), and the JWT VC Presentation Profile, which describes the technical protocols, data formats, and other technical requirements to enable interoperable exchange of VCs presentations between Wallets and Verifiers (see <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jwt-vc-presentation-profile?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jwt-vc-presentation-profile</a> ).&nbsp;</p><p>Taking a closer look at these examples, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/jwt-vc-issuance-profile/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#term:vc-data-model-v1.1">VC Data Model v1.1</a> defines the data model of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) but does not prescribe standards for transport protocol, key management, authentication, query language, et cetera. The same is true for DIDs.</p><p>A range of specifications are available, providing options for how these things (transport, key management, etc) are achieved, but if implementers have to support all possible specifications (and combinations), it would be a lot of work.</p><p>So a profile is a way to make choices and even restrictions for a certain use case, allowing all participants to establish interoperability.</p><p>Summary</p><p>Collaboration on interoperability is an essential part of the process of establishing a viable digital trust ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Interop profiles define specific requirements that must be followed by identity providers, relying parties, and other stakeholders.</p><p>DIF provides a neutral venue to collaborate on interop profile development.&nbsp;</p><p>Together with our working group tools, best practices and IPR protection, and our members’ subject matter expertise in decentralized identity technologies, DIF is the destination of choice to host this work.&nbsp;</p><p>Got a question? <a href="mailto:membership@identity.foundation">Email us</a> - we’ll be happy to discuss your requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>If the first two months of 2024 for Digital Identity NZ are anything to go by, this year is certainly turning out to be every bit as busy as 2023. It is a different kind of busy, with more collaboration and partnership engagement needed to ‘get things done’ in the digital identity domain, against a backdrop of regulation and economic headwinds.</p>



<p>A couple of weeks ago, the year’s first Coffee Chat saw good attendance as did last month’s Air New Zealand and Authsignal sponsored webinar on passkeys. This exclusive member-only event shared how DINZ members, Authsignal and Air New Zealand worked together to deliver a world class implementation of passkeys to secure Air New Zealand’s customers accounts. Speaking of Authsignal, founder and DINZ Executive Council Member Justin Soong wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/08/generative-ai-and-the-risk-around-digital-trust/?sh=69e6817c6dcf">this exceptional thought piece on AI published in Forbes last month</a>.&nbsp;And DINZ member SSS – IT Security Specialists&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reseller.co.nz/article/1355990/att-crowns-sss-it-security-specialists-as-its-apac-partner-of-the-year.html">received this accolade</a>!</p>



<p>Next week, members will receive a personal email from me seeking expressions of interest, particularly from digital ID service and attribute providers, to participate in an investigative sprint early next month from DINZ member PaymentsNZ’s. The aim is to surface the digital identity-related issues that people encounter in the payments industry, and develop best practice requirements to overcome them as part of PaymentsNZ’s Next Generation Payments programme. Stay tuned.</p>



<p>We kick off April with a lunchtime fireside chat; Digital Health Identity: History, current state and the future with two Te Whatu Ora specialists. There’s so much happening in this space. You can find out more and register&nbsp;<a href="https://events.humanitix.com/fireside-chat-digital-health-identity-history-current-state-and-the-future">here</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re getting the impression that April is the month for digital identity, you’re correct! Tuesday 9 April is World&nbsp;<a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/identity-management-day/">Identity Management Day</a>! While co-founded by the Identity Defined Security Alliance and the National Cybersecurity Alliance in the US in 2021, the day is recognised in many countries globally. In its fourth year, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/event/identity-management-day-2024/">2024 Virtual Conference</a>&nbsp;brings together identity and security leaders and practitioners from all over the world to learn and engage.</p>



<p>April is also a favourite time of year to publish research that helps to level-set our own strategies and plans, as DINZ did last year. This&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/70-of-australians-dont-feel-in-control-of-their-data-as-companies-hide-behind-meaningless-privacy-terms-224072">Australian research</a>&nbsp;forwarded by a public sector member, would probably show similar results in NZ, as reflected in DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://internetnz.nz/news-and-articles/internet-insights/">InternetNZ’s insights research</a>. And the<a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/.github/blob/main/profile/reference-implementation.md">&nbsp;EU digital wallet is taking shape</a>&nbsp;as it aims to showcase a robust and interoperable platform for digital identification, authentication and electronic signatures based on common standards across the European Union. We hope to continue our research and additional initiatives for 2024, and we’re continually looking for support in the way of sponsorship from our members. <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/01/18/sponsorship-opportunities-for-a-thriving-future/">Click here to find out how you can support DINZ’s research, and future ambitions</a>.</p>

<p></p>      MOBI Joins eSTART Coalition to Help Modernize Automotive Title and Registration Processes           <p>Coalition Advocates for Improvements to Streamline Auto Transactions</p>
          <p>Los Angeles — 14 March 2024. MOBI, a global nonprofit Web3 consortium, is excited to announce its participation in the Electronic Secure Title and Registration Transformation (eSTART) Coalition as a founding member. eSTART is a group of leading auto industry organizations united in advocating for modern solutions to replace the paper-based processes that currently dominate state and local DMV operations.</p>
<p>The eSTART Coalition focuses on three key areas of vehicle transactions:</p>
 
 Permitting electronic signatures on all title and registration documents; 
 Adopting tools for electronic submission and processing of title and registration; and 
 Enabling electronic vehicle records transfers. 
 
<p>Modernizing these processes will result in significant cost and time savings for consumers, state and local DMV operations, and industry participants.</p>
<p>Across the U.S., countless titling/registration service providers maintain unique databases and processes for vehicle registration and titling. While some of these jurisdictions have begun digitizing certain processes, many rely entirely on paper-based and manual workflows. This fragmented approach presents several pain points for Motor Vehicle Authorities (MVAs), private sector participants, and consumers, including:</p>
 
 Lack of standardized processes leading to inconsistencies in data management and accessibility. 
 Incurrence of substantial costs associated with paper-based systems, including storage, processing, and handling. 
 Prolonged processing times and increased risk of errors due to manual verification processes. 
 Missed opportunities for cost savings, efficiency gains, and enhanced customer experiences. 
 
<p>Addressing these pain points requires a solution that can be easily adopted across all jurisdictions rather than a solution that functions at a state, county or municipal jurisdiction level. MOBI and its members are collaborating on a Web3-enabled standardized solution to enhance efficiency and cross-border regulatory compliance in MVA operations with an interoperability framework rooted in self-sovereign data and identities. This unified framework serves as a common language, enabling organizations with diverse business processes and legacy systems to efficiently coordinate in a standardized manner without having to build and maintain new infrastructure.</p>
<p>The implementation of a standardized Web3 ecosystem offers a promising solution to streamline operations, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and greatly improve data permissioned-only-access. The ability to verify identities and transactions in a decentralized way can reduce odometer and titling fraud, eliminate the need for manual identity verification, improve insurance products, and enable more seamless remote transactions (e.g. online sales and road usage charging).</p>
<p>“We’re excited to be part of a coalition that not only shares our vision for a more streamlined and modern automotive industry but is actively working towards making it a reality,” said Tram Vo, MOBI CEO and Co-Founder. “MOBI and its members are proud to bring a unique Web3 standardized approach to this groundbreaking endeavor. Together, we’re setting the stage for a more efficient, interoperable ecosystem that empowers stakeholders through enhanced trust and data privacy for all.”</p>
<p>Other transportation industry organizations, including government agencies, industry partners, and associations, are encouraged to join the eSTART Coalition to advocate for these important changes. For more information about eSTART, please visit <a>www.estartcoalition.org</a> or contact <a href="mailto:info@estartcoalition.org.">info@estartcoalition.org.</a></p>
          <p>About MOBI</p>
<p>MOBI is a global nonprofit Web3 consortium. We are creating standards for trusted self-sovereign data and identities (e.g. vehicles, people, businesses, things), verifiable credentials, and cross-industry interoperability. Our goal is to make the digital economy more efficient, equitable, decentralized, and sustainable while preserving data privacy for users and providers alike.

<p><br>The world of technology has seen significant developments over the past few decades, largely driven by advancements in cryptography. These advancements have led to innovations including secure internet traffic through HTTPS and WireGuard; protected data storage via BitLocker, LUKS, and fscrypt; decentralized consensus records using Bitcoin and Ethereum; and privacy-focused messaging protocols like Signal and MLS (Messaging Layer Security).<br><br>However, despite these advances, our online identities remain controlled by third parties, whether we sign in to apps using Google or Facebook OpenID or manage "verified" accounts on platforms such as Twitter or Instagram. An emerging movement seeks to change this status quo by harnessing the transformative power of cryptography. Governments are also starting to recognize the value of self-sovereign identity (SSI)—a system in which individuals retain full control of their own digital identities.</p>

Together, Citopia and the ITN provide the necessary infrastructure for node operators to build out secure, seamless, globally compliant web services and applications. MOBI membership is required to operate a node on Citopia and/or the ITN. <a href="https://dlt.mobi/participate/">Contact us to learn more about becoming a node operator</a></p>
     <a></a>         Overview of the Pilot and the Problem It Solves           <p>Across the United States, there is a diverse array of jurisdictions (numbering in the thousands across states, counties, and municipalities) and titling/registration service providers, each maintaining unique databases and processes for vehicle registration and titling. Many states (AZ, DE, GA, FL, LA, MA, MD, NC, SC, PA, VA, and WI) <a href="https://www.autoremarketing.com/subprime/mandatory-elt-processing-gaining-momentum/">currently mandate</a> the use of electronic lien and title (ELT) systems. Other states have planned ELT mandates in 2024, or more generally are developing a digital approach to electronic vehicle titling. For example, New York and Idaho have or are developing processes for dealer reassignments electronically.</p>
<p>Each of these jurisdictions will maintain their own systems for these varied processes. The challenge lies in achieving interoperability between those systems through standardized communications and data reporting/exchange across jurisdictional, platform, and organizational lines while enabling each jurisdiction to maintain control over its processes. For example, today, each vehicle manufacturer or lender can have hundreds of unique identifiers assigned to them by different jurisdictions, creating confusion, mismanagement, and inefficiency.</p>
<p>Currently, secure digital authentication and communication rely on identifiers issued by centralized platforms to prove their credentials. However, in addition to being vulnerable to fraud, identity theft, and data leaks, centralized approaches to identity management fail to address the trust problems created by the rise of decentralized services, IOT, and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/05/hong_kong_deepfaked_cfo/">Generative AI</a>. As digitization advances, it will become increasingly challenging — and costly — to verify data authenticity, secure digital perimeters, and ensure cross-border regulation compliance. This is critical for state agencies like MVAs as well as dealers and lenders, who are responsible for executing the bulk of the registration/titling process.</p>
                    Stakeholders:    Vehicle Manufacturers (OEMs); Financial Institutions (FIs)/Lenders; Servicers; Dealerships; Motor Vehicle Authorities (MVAs)/Third-party Registration/Titling Providers (RTPs); State Authorized Inspectors; Third-Party Data Consolidators; Fleet Operators; Trade Associations; Vehicle Auctions; and Consumers.                 Our Innovative Solution       <p>Overcoming these challenges calls for a new solution. The White House’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">Federal Zero Trust Strategy</a> (2022) mandates that federal agencies and any organization that works with the federal government adopt a Zero Trust framework by the end of FY 2024. Zero Trust requires every entity to authenticate and validate every other entity for every single digital communication at all times. Since this is not possible at scale through Web2/centralized means, Web3 technologies and principles must be leveraged.</p>
<p>MOBI and its members have developed platform-agnostic standardized “universal translators” that work with any existing legacy system or web service to enable cross-industry interoperable communication through <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) decentralized identity and verifiable credential framework, called <a href="https://citopia.global/technology/">Citopia Passports</a> (Web3 Plug-and-Play). Citopia Passports ensure that organizations’ and customers’ data privacy, which is key for complying with comprehensive data privacy laws being passed by many states (e.g., <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CA</a>, <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2022/act/Pa/pdf/2022PA-00015-R00SB-00006-PA.PDF">CT</a>, <a href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/senatedemocrats/Documents/230620%20SB%20619.pdf">OR</a>, <a href="https://www.dwt.com/-/media/files/blogs/privacy-and-security-blog/2023/07/hb00004f.pdf?rev=d2ece1e4cc0c4a708453ab079b7f00f4&amp;hash=57F39986BC8C2DA88C7F985640CB495A">TX</a>, <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/SB0227.html">UT</a>, <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title59.1/chapter53/">VA</a>).</p>

<p>Zero Trust Authentication: Cross-industry interoperability requires claims and identities to be verified for each transaction to ensure maximum security. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">Read the Federal Zero Trust Strategy</a></p>
    
<p>Infosec &amp; Selective Disclosure: Participants must be able to selectively disclose information for transactions at the edge. Verification must be done at the moment of transaction to eliminate the need for PII storage.</p>
    
<p>Scalability and Extensibility: Cross-industry interoperability requires a shared standards-based framework to enable the creation of globally scalable multiparty applications.</p>
          
<p>Data Privacy Compliance: Cross-industry interoperability requires (1) compliance with existing global data privacy regulations and (2) the flexibility to comply with future directives.</p>
    
<p>Global Standards: Cross-industry interoperability requires a standardized system for frictionless data exchange and collaboration while allowing stakeholders to retain their legacy systems.</p>
    
<p>Decentralization: Cross-industry interoperability requires a community-owned and -operated infrastructure to (1) prevent monopolization and (2) enable consensus-based trust.</p>
                     Web3 Plug-and-Play   <p>Citopia Passports utilize W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) standards. This creates an interoperability framework that provides:</p>
  <a href="https://citopia.global/technology/">Explore Citopia Passports</a>        
<p>Decentralized, trusted identities</p>
    
<p>Digital credential issuance/verification</p>
    
<p>Interoperable communication between each stakeholder’s centralized databases</p>
    
<p>A bridge between jurisdictions, organizations, and platforms allowing each stakeholder to keep their legacy systems</p>
            <p>The result is the reduction of errors, streamlined operations, increased efficiency, and reduced costs, as well as greatly improved data permissioned-access. More generally, this cross-industry, platform-agnostic, universal interoperability is part of what has motivated government interest worldwide in implementing and adopting standards-based digital identity and credential systems (e.g., the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/preventing-forgery-and-counterfeiting-certificates-and-licenses">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) in the US; <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/digital-identity-leveraging-the-ssi-concept-to-build-trust">European Union Agency for Cybersecurity </a>(ENISA) and<a href="https://essif-lab.eu/"> European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework</a> (ESSIF) in the EU).</p>
   Proposed Stakeholder Meeting   <p>MOBI is proposing a two-part meeting in the first half of 2024: part one being a meeting between the association stakeholders (e.g. AAMVA, NADA, ATAEs, NIADA, AFSA, MOBI) and their representative members, and part two being a meeting including the titling service providers. The goals of the meeting are:</p>
 
 to bring together the key stakeholders to assess the pain points, needs/requirements, and path forward to achieve interoperability between the numerous centralized systems for registration/titling 
 to jointly address the opportunity to develop standardized communication between each stakeholder to achieve interoperability for registration/titling processes 
 to discuss how secure, verifiable digital identifiers and claims (using open-standard Web3 technologies) can address fundamental problems, such as each lender having hundreds of different identifiers assigned to them by different jurisdictions 
 to finalize the scope and scale of the Standardized Web3 Solution for Titling/Registration Pilot 
 
   Pilot Planning   <p>In Phase 1 of the Pilot, the FSSC WG will demonstrate privacy-preserving cross-industry interoperability for Titling/Registration via standardized universal identifiers and communication/claims without the need to build new infrastructure. This will involve working with MVAs, lenders, dealers, OEMs, and service providers to demonstrate interoperability across different legacy systems and jurisdictions. At the end of Phase 1, stakeholders will have successfully created Citopia Passports and be able to use their Citopia Passport to easily authenticate each other’s identifiers and claims (such as lien release, odometer disclosures, insurance validation, etc.). Stakeholders will be able to examine the code and outputs to verify that all transactions/communications are private and only visible to the intended recipient.</p>
<p>In Phase 2 of the Pilot, each stakeholder will have the opportunity to run nodes, conduct research and development for their own applications, and actively participate in the pilot for a duration of 6-12 months. The FSSC WG will determine the final scope of Phase 2 after the conclusion of Phase 1.</p>

  In 'Securing Your Digital Future,' Part 1 of this three-part series unveils 
the pivotal role of the Blinding Identity Taxonomy (BIT) and its 
Supplementary Document in fortifying data privacy. Emphasizing the critical 
need to protect sensitive personal data, we explore the foundation of data 
semantics—bolstered by the BIT framework crafted by the Human Colossus 
Foundation and backed by Kantara

<div class='wrap'>

 Part 1: Understanding the Semantic Foundation of Privacy: The Critical Role of BIT and Its Supplementary Document in Data Protection <p>In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, the significance of data protection has never been more pronounced. Recent developments, such as the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/02/28/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-sweeping-executive-order-to-protect-americans-sensitive-personal-data/">presidential order</a> issued by the White House on February 28th, 2024, to prevent access to sensitive personal data by overseas 'bad actors,' underscore the urgency of safeguarding personal information from exploitation. This context sets the stage for a pivotal conversation on protecting sensitive data from a data semantics perspective—the cornerstone of understanding and interpreting data correctly across diverse systems and stakeholders.</p><p>Data semantics supports data interpretability, clarity, and consistency in the digital realm. It includes utilizing data models, vocabularies, taxonomies, ontologies, and knowledge representation to accurately recognize and interpret <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/pii#:~:text=Personally%20identifiable%20information%20(PII)%20is,email%20address%20or%20phone%20number.">Personally Identifiable Information</a> (PII) and sensitive data, ensuring that digital entities comprehend the sensitivity of this information, irrespective of their domain. The <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/blinding-identity-taxonomyreducing-the-risk-of-identifying-governing-entities-in-blinded-datasets">Blinding Identity Taxonomy</a> (BIT) emerges as a beacon of guidance in data protection, supporting the fight against intrusive surveillance, scams, blackmail, and other privacy violations.</p> Celebrating the BIT and Its Evolution <p>Developed by the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/">Human Colossus Foundation</a> (HCF) and supported by <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, the <a href="https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/Blinding-Identity-Taxonomy-Report-Version-1.0.pdf">BIT</a> provides a robust framework for identifying and flagging sensitive information within data sets. Its purpose is not just to adhere to privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA but to fortify the semantic understanding of what constitutes 'sensitive data.' The BIT involves a nuanced comprehension of data attributes that, if mishandled, could lead to privacy breaches or misuse.</p><p>With notable contributions from Paul Knowles, Chair of the HCF <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/decentralised-semantics-wg">Decentralised Semantics WG</a>, the BIT Supplementary Document significantly enhances the comprehension of the taxonomy. As an active contributor to the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/dde-launch">Dynamic Data Economy</a> (DDE), HCF transferred the intellectual property rights of the newly released BIT Supplementary Document on December 13th, 2023, to Kantara Initiative, a global community focused on improving the trustworthy use of identity and personal data. Although not yet incorporated into regulations like GDPR, CCPA, or similar national regulations as an official appendix, the BIT Supplementary Document's publication as an official Kantara Initiative report on March 5th, 2024, significantly enhances the BIT's utility by offering detailed insights into the BIT categories.</p><p>The release of the BIT Supplementary Document marks a significant advancement in this journey. Offering detailed insights into the 49 BIT categories, it serves as an indispensable manual for practitioners aiming to navigate the complexities of data protection. It not only enumerates what constitutes sensitive information but also elaborates on how to interpret and handle this data, ensuring semantic integrity across systems. The BIT is the world's most comprehensive taxonomy for preventing re-identification attacks, with the Supplementary Document adding further depth and clarity.</p> Flagging Sensitive Attributes: A Semantic Safeguard <p>As the BIT report recommends, flagging sensitive attributes in a schema capture base is a practice rooted in semantic precision. This approach enables data protection officers and schema issuers to identify elements that demand cryptographic encoding, thereby minimizing the risk of re-identifying a data principal, where flagging acts as semantic annotation, marking data with an additional layer of meaning—its sensitivity or risk level, which aids in compliance with data protection regulations and enhances the semantic coherence of data handling practices.</p><p>By utilizing the BIT and its Supplementary Document, practitioners have a common guideline for determining which attributes to flag. This standard practice ensures that sensitive data is understood and interpreted consistently, avoiding ambiguities that could lead to data breaches. The BIT framework empowers practitioners to embed data protection principles directly into their semantic models, making privacy a foundational aspect of data interpretation.</p> Conclusion: The Semantic Imperative for Data Protection <p>In a digitally interconnected world, we cannot overstate the importance of data semantics as we navigate the complexities of data protection. The BIT and its Supplementary Document offer a comprehensive framework for understanding and protecting sensitive data, grounding data protection in semantic precision. As we move forward, we encourage individuals, organizations, and ecosystems to embrace these tools, ensuring that sensitive information is flagged, protected, and interpreted carefully.</p>

The BIT is accessible in <a href="https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/Blinding-Identity-Taxonomy-Report-Version-1.0.pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/Blinding-Identity-Taxonomy-Report-Version-1.0.html">HTML</a> formats, catering to diverse user preferences. Those seeking deeper insights can download the BIT Supplementary Document in PDF format from Kantara Initiative's <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/reports-recommendations/">Reports &amp; Recommendations</a> page. This invaluable resource resides under the 'Kantara Initiative Reports' section, clearly labeled as "Supplementary Report to Blinding Identity Taxonomy Report," ensuring straightforward access for all interested parties.</p>

 Motivation 



<p>Previously Mercari was using passwords and faced with real-time phishing attacks, added SMS OTPs as an authentication method to protect their users. While this improved their security, it did not completely eliminate real-time phishing attacks. Sending a high volume of SMS OTPs was also both expensive and not very user-friendly.</p>



<p>Mercari also had a new service Mercoin, a platform for buying and selling Bitcoin with the user’s available balance in Mercari, which had strong security requirements and <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys">passkeys</a> met their needs.</p>



<p>Because passkeys are bound to a website or app’s identity, they’re safe from phishing attacks. The browser and operating system ensure that a passkey can only be used with the website or app that created them. This frees users from being responsible for signing in to the genuine website or app.</p>



<p>Requiring users to use extra authentication methods and perform additional action is an obstacle when what users actually want is to accomplish something else using the app.</p>



<p>Adding passkey authentication removes that additional step of SMS OTP and improves user experience while also providing better protection for users from real-time phishing attacks and reducing the cost associated with SMS OTPs.</p>



 Results 



<p>900,000 Mercari accounts have registered passkeys and the success rate of signing in with them is 82.5% compared to 67.7% success rate for signing in with SMS OTP.</p>



<p>Signing in with passkeys has also proved to be 3.9 times faster than signing in with SMS OTP–Mercari users on average take 4.4 seconds to sign in with passkeys, while it takes them 17 seconds to do the same with SMS OTP.</p>







<p>The higher the success rate of authentication and the shorter the authentication time, the better the user experience and Mercari has seen great success with implementing passkeys.</p>

 Celebrating Open Education Week&nbsp;2024 <p>A couple of days ago we ran our fourth Community Conversations session. This one was timed to coincide with <a href="https://www.oeglobal.org/activities/open-education-week/">Open Education Week</a>, an initiative of OE Global created as “an annual celebration [and] opportunity for actively sharing and learning about the latest achievements in Open Education worldwide”.</p><p>Our focus was on managing knowledge in communities. The version in the video above is a shortened version of the session, which we recorded without the activities. This blog post contains most of the information in the recording.</p> What is Knowledge? <p>Community is key to open education, with an often-overlooked aspect of community management and evolution being how knowledge is stewarded within such networks.</p>Image by <a href="https://www.gapingvoid.com/semiotic-management-systems/">gapingvoid</a><p>Let’s start with the above image, showing the difference between terms and concepts that are sometimes used interchangeably, but actually mean different things.</p><p>When we talk about community knowledge we’re talking about connecting the dots between information being shared between members. This can turn into insight through a process of reflection, and wisdom by connecting together different insights.</p><p>In practice, nothing is ever as simple as the process shown in the above diagram. However, it’s a convenient way to tease apart some of the subtleties.</p> A Simple, Homely&nbsp;Example <p>I went on holiday with my family recently. We ‘favourited’ some places on Google Maps as part of our planning, to help us navigate while we were there, and to be able to share what we enjoyed with others afterwards.</p>Screenshot of Google Maps showing ‘favourited’ and ‘bookmarked’ places in Faro,&nbsp;Portugal<p>What’s represented on the above screenshot is a bunch of data arranged on a map. When you click on each point, there is further information about each place. If I put these together into an itinerary, this could be considered a form of knowledge.</p><p>This is a form of community knowledge management on a very small scale: the community represented by my nuclear family, my extended family and friends, and potentially those people who might in future ask for recommendations on what to do in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faro%2C_Portugal">Faro</a>, Portugal.</p><p>Other proprietary tools that might be used to store data and information with others include <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> and <a href="https://pinterest.com">Pinterest</a>. You are curating these things as individuals for a particular purpose, but there is not necessarily an effort to connect together the dots in any meaningful way.</p> Community Knowledge Management <p>So, what’s the difference between what we’ve discussed so far and managing knowledge within communities?</p><p>In this case, we’re specifically talking about Communities of Practice, which we discuss in the <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">first three Community Conversations workshops</a>. Briefly put, they can be defined in the following way:</p><blockquote>“Communities of Practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.” (Etienne&nbsp;Wenger)</blockquote><p>Harold Jarche has a very clear diagram that he uses regularly in his work around Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) to explore the differences between the spaces in which we interact:</p>Image via <a href="https://jarche.com/pkm/">jarche.com/pkm</a><p>We’re interested in the middle oval in this diagram, with Communities of Practice (CoPs )overlapping with ‘Work Teams’ and ‘Social Networks’. While we might build knowledge within the walls of our organisations, and share things online with strangers, CoPs are intentional spaces for us to build knowledge between organisations with people we get to know better over&nbsp;time.</p><p><a href="https://rosie.land/posts/community-knowledge-management/">Rosie Sherry</a> defines Community Knowledge Management in the following way:</p><blockquote>Community Knowledge Management is a process for collaboratively collecting information, insights, stories and perspectives with the goal of supporting a community and the ecosystem with their own learning and growth. (Rosie&nbsp;Sherry)</blockquote><p>Although she doesn’t mention it explicitly, the inference is that by “collecting information, insights, stories, and perspectives” the idea is that we not only share knowledge, but we also co-create it.</p> Tools for Community Knowledge Management <p>The new version of the Participate platform, to which we are migrating the ORE community, is organised around three types of ‘thing’: Badges, Events, and&nbsp;Docs.</p><p>This is useful for keeping communities organised. But what if you’ve got a lot of information — books worth, almost, and you need to organise that? In this case, it’s worth looking at another tool to augment your community’s ‘home’ and which provides some more specialised features.</p><p>As you would expect from an organisation entitled <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a>, we’re interested in working openly, using openly-licensed resources, open source tools, and cooperating with others. That means we’re going to point towards Open Source software in this section that we know, have used, and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Here are three examples of the types of platforms which can host knowledge created in&nbsp;CoPs:</p>  Wikis — everyone knows Wikipedia, but any organisation or community can have a wiki! You can use the same software, called <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>, or use many other alternatives (we use&nbsp;<a href="https://js.wiki/">wiki.js</a>)  Forums — these are easily searchable so can be used to capture useful information as part of conversations. We’re big fans of <a href="https://discourse.org">Discourse</a> and have used it for several clients projects.  Learning Management Systems (LMS) — can be used to capture information, especially if your community is based around educational resources. Our go-to for this is&nbsp;<a href="https://moodle.org">Moodle</a>.  <p>For the sake of brevity, and to point to our own example, we’re going to show our use of MediaWiki to form <a href="https://badge.wiki">Badge Wiki</a>. This has been around for over six years at this point, and serves as a knowledge base for the Open Badges and wider digital credentials community.</p> Community Knowledge Contribution <p>There are behaviours around this knowledge repository that overlap with those inside the main community platform. But there are also others, specific to it. For&nbsp;example:</p>  Community Calls specifically focused on discussing and planning elements of Badge&nbsp;Wiki.  Barn raisings which focus on co-creation of pages to help establish the knowledge base.  Asynchronous discussions to talk about strategy, and catch up between synchronous events such as the previous&nbsp;two.  Pro-social behaviours are encouraged and recognised through the use of&nbsp;badges.  <p>To dig into the last of these, we know that there are all kinds of reasons why people contribute to Open Source and community projects. We just want to give them a reason to keep doing&nbsp;so.</p>Image taken from work WAO did with Greenpeace. See more in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/10-reasons-why-people-contribute-to-open-source-d13b86b1e9d3">this&nbsp;post</a>.<p>We created a range of badges specifically focused on the community knowledge base. There are attendance badges, for example with the barn raising (and attending multiple times) but also for particular actions such as authoring pages, tidying up existing content, and making it look&nbsp;better!</p>Images CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>Once you’ve got a knowledge base, you can run projects on top of it. So when an ORE community member mentioned that it would be useful to have a ‘toolkit’ for helping people understand Open Recognition… Badge Wiki was the obvious place for it to&nbsp;live!</p><p>We launched v0.1 of the <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/Open_Recognition_Toolkit">Open Recognition Toolkit</a> at the ePIC 2023 in Vienna. As it’s a wiki, this can be easily iterated over time with multiple authors — who can contribute as little or as much as they&nbsp;want.</p><p>There’s so much more we could say, but there’s no substitute for practice! Whether you’re planning to start a new community, in the midst of setting one up, or stewarding an existing one, it’s important to think about good practices around Community Knowledge Management.</p><p>Being intentional and inclusive about what kind of knowledge is captured and shared within communities is crucial. It’s powerful to pool resources and to help generate insights; it helps to provide impact. It also helps fulfil the needs of different members of the community and helps increase the diversity and richness of who gets involved — and&nbsp;how.</p><p>If you would like a thought partner for this kind of work, why not get in touch and have a chat with the friendly people at <a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a>?

  We built a Web3 points application on Ceramic to explore the design considerations a successful system requires.

<p>We've made the case in a recent <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/points-how-reputation-tokens-collide-where-it-goes-from-here/">blog post</a> that web3 point systems align the incentives of platforms and their users, acting as reputation systems that allow participants to draw inferences between who's creating value and who's likely to receive rewards for their actions. More importantly, these systems help participants understand what user interactions matter to applications using points. And while points often manifest as objects referred to by different names (badges and attestations, for example), there's a commonality across these implementations relevant to their verifiability. </p> Why Points and Ceramic? <p>Points data requires properties allowing consumers of points (traditionally the same applications issuing them) to trust their provenance and lineage. This is unsurprisingly why most Web3 points systems today are built on centralized rails - not only is a simple Postgres instance easy to spin up, but the only data corruption vulnerability would result from poor code or security practices.</p><p>For readers familiar with Ceramic's composability value proposition, it's likely obvious why we view web3 point systems (and reputation systems more broadly) as ideal Ceramic use cases. Not only does Ceramic offer rich query capabilities, data provenance and verifiability promises, and performance-related guarantees, but both end users and applications benefit from portable activity. We foresee an ecosystem where end users can leverage the identity they've aggregated from one application across many others. In turn, applications can start building on user reputation data from day one.</p><p>To put this into practice, we built a scavenger hunt application for EthDenver '24 that allowed participants to collect points based on in-person event attendance. </p> A Scavenger Hunt for Points <p>Ceramic was officially involved in 8 or so in-person engagements this year at EthDenver, some of which were cosponsored events (such as <a href="https://lu.ma/proofofdata?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Proof of Data</a> and <a href="https://lu.ma/opendataday1?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Open Data Day</a>), while others were cross-collaborations between Ceramic and our partners (for example, driving participants to check in at official partner booths at the official EthDenver conference location). The idea was simple - participants would collect points for checking in at these events, and based on different thresholds or interpretations of participant point data (for example, participants with the most event check-ins) would be eligible for prizes.</p><p>To make this happen, we ideated on various patterns of data control and schema design that presented the best balance of trade-offs for this use case. In simple terms, we needed to:</p>  Track event attendance by creating or updating abstractions of that activity in Ceramic  Provide a crypto-native means for participants to self-identify to leverage Ceramic-native scalar types  Secure the application against potential spoofing attempts  Collect enough information necessary to perform creative computation on verifiable point data  <p>We were also presented with several considerations. For example, should we go through the effort to emulate a user-centric data control design whereby we implement a pattern that requires additional server-side verification and signed data to allow the end user to control their Ceramic point data? Or what's the right balance of data we should collect to enable interesting interpretations (or <code>PointMaterializations</code>) to be made as a result of computing over points?</p> Architecting Document Control <p>Before we jump in, reading our blog post on <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/data-control-patterns-in-decentralized-storage/">Data Control Patterns in Decentralized Storage</a> would help provide useful context. As for the problem at hand, two options stand out as the most obvious ways to build a verifiable points system on open data rails:</p>  Reconstruct the approach that would be taken on traditional rails (the application is the author and controller of all points data they generate). This makes the data easy to verify externally based on the Ceramic document controller (which will always be the same), and data consumers wouldn't have to worry about end users attempting to modify stream data in their favor  Allow the end users to control their points data on Ceramic. In this environment, we'd need a flow that would be able to validate the existing data had been "approved" by us by verifying a signed payload, then update the data and sign it again before having the user save the update to their Ceramic document, thus ensuring the data is tamper-evident  <p>You might've guessed that the second option is higher-touch. At the same time, a future iteration of this system might want to involve a data marketplace that allows users to sell their points data, requiring users to control their data and its access control conditions. For this reason and many others, we went with #2. We'll discuss how we executed this in the sections below.</p> What Data Models Did We Use? <p>When we first started building the scavenger hunt application the <code>SET</code> accountRelation schema option had not yet been released in ComposeDB (important to note due to the high likelihood we would've used it). Keep that in mind as we overview some of the APIs we built to check if existing model instances had been created (later in this article).</p><p>In discussing internally how points data manifests, we decided to mirror a flow that looked like trigger -&gt; point issuance -&gt; point materialization. This means that attending an event triggers issuing point data related to that action. In response, that issuance event might materialize as an interpretation of the weight and context of those points (which could be created by both the application that issued the points and any other entity listening in on a user's point activity). </p><p>As a result, our ComposeDB schemas ended up like this:</p> <code>type PointClaims
  @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A point claim model") 
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["issuer"] }])
  {
  holder: DID! @documentAccount
  issuer: DID! @accountReference
  issuer_verification: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
  data: [Data!]! @list(maxLength: 100000)
}

type Data {
  value: Int!
  timestamp: DateTime!
  context: String @string(maxLength: 1000000)
  refId: StreamID
}

type PointMaterializations
  @createModel(
    accountRelation: LIST
    description: "A point materialization model"
  )
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["recipient"] }]) {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  context: String @string(maxLength: 1000000)
  value: Int!
  pointClaimsId: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "PointClaims")
  pointClaim: PointClaims! @relationDocument(property: "pointClaimsId")
}</code> <p>To provide more context, we built the application to create a new <code>PointClaims</code> instance if one did not already exist for that user, and update the existing <code>PointClaims</code> instance if one already existed (and, in doing so, append an instance of <code>Data</code> to the "data" field). I mentioned above that the <code>SET</code> accountRelation option would've likely come in handy. Since we were hoping to maintain a unique list of <code>PointClaims</code> that only had 1 instance for each user (where the issuer represents the DID of our application), <code>SET</code> would've likely been the preferred way to go to make our lives easier.</p><p>You'll also notice that an optional field called "refId" that takes in a <code>StreamID</code> value exists in the <code>Data</code> embedded type. The idea here was that issuing points might be in response to the creation of a Ceramic document, in which case we might want to store a reference pointer to that document. For our scavenger hunt example, this was the case - points were issued in recognition of event attendance represented as individual Ceramic documents:</p> <code>type EthDenverAttendance
  @createModel(
    accountRelation: LIST
    description: "An attendance claim at an EthDenver event"
  )
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["recipient"] }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["event"] }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["latitude"] }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["longitude"] }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["timestamp"] }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: ["issuer"] }]) {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  issuer: DID! @accountReference
  recipient: String! @string(minLength: 42, maxLength: 42)
  event: String! @string(maxLength: 100)
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
  timestamp: DateTime!
  jwt: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}</code> <p>Finally, take a look at the "issuer_verification" field in <code>PointClaims</code> and "jwt" field in <code>EthDenverAttendance</code>. Both fields were allocated to store the data our application verified + signed, represented as a base64-encoded string of a JSON web signature. For <code>PointClaims</code>, this entailed just the values within the "data" array (involving a verification, updating, and resigning process each time new point data needed to be appended).</p> Issuing Points - Data Flow <p>For the remainder of the article, feel free to follow along in the following public code:</p> <code>https://github.com/ceramicstudio/fluence-demo</code> <p>You'll notice two environment variables (SECRET_KEY and STRING) scoped only for server-side access, the first of which is meant to contain our secret 64-character seed from which we'll instantiate our application's DID (to be used for filtering <code>PointClaims</code> instances for documents where our application's DID is the issuer, as well as for verifying and signing our tamper-evident fields). To explain STRING, it might be helpful at this point if I dive a bit deeper into what we built to support the user flow.</p><p>Private PostgreSQL Instance (for Whitelisted Codes)</p><p>You'll notice that a <code>findEvent</code> method is called first in the <code>useEffect</code> lifecycle hook within the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/fluence-demo/blob/main/src/components/index.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">main component</a> rendered on our post-login screen, which subsequently calls a <code>/api/find</code> route (which uses our STRING environment variable to connect to our PostgreSQL client). For this application, we needed to quickly build a pattern where we were able to both issue and verify codes corresponding to each in-person event that had been generated beforehand. This ties back to our planned in-person flow:</p>  Participant scans a QR code or taps an NFC disc that contains the URL of our application + a parameterized whitelisted code that hasn't yet been used  The application checks the database to ensure the code hasn't yet been used  <p>While in theory this part could've been built on Ceramic with an added layer of encryption, it was easier to stand this up quickly with a private Postgres instance.</p><p>Determining Participant Eligibility</p><p>If the call to <code>/api/find</code> determines that the code has not been used, <code>findEvent</code> then calls a <code>createEligibility</code> method, passing in the name of the event as the input variable. Notice that the first thing we do is call a <code>getDID</code> method, which calls a <code>/api/checkdid</code> server route that uses our SECRET_KEY variable to instantiate a DID and send us back the did:key identifier. </p><p>This is the second check our application performs to prevent cheating, whereby we query ComposeDB for <code>EthDenverAttendance</code> instances, filtering for documents where the signed-in user is the controller, where the event is the string passed into <code>createEligibility</code>, and where our application is the issuer (as evidenced by the DID). </p><p>Finally, if no matching document exists, we determine that the participant is eligible to create a badge. </p><p>Generating Points Data</p><p>While there's plenty to discuss related to generating and validating badge data, given that the pattern is quite similar when issuing points, I'll focus on that flow. The important thing to know here is that within both our <code>createBadge</code> and <code>createFinal</code> methods found in the same component mentioned above call an <code>issuePoint</code> method if a badge was successfully created by the user, passing in the corresponding value, context, and name of the event corresponding to that issuance.</p><p>What happens next is a result of our decision to allow the end user to control their points-related data, such that we:</p>  Call an API route to access our application's DID  Call yet another <code>/api/issue</code> route, where we   Query <code>PointClaims</code> to see if one already exists or not for the end user where our application is also the issuer     <code>const authenticateDID = async (seed: string) =&gt; {
    const key = fromString(seed, "base16");
    const provider = new Ed25519Provider(key);
    const staticDid = new DID({
      resolver: KeyResolver.getResolver(),
      provider
    });
    await staticDid.authenticate();
    ceramic.did = staticDid;
    return staticDid;
}
// we'll use this both for our query's filter and for signing/verifying data
const did = await authenticateDID(SECRET_KEY);
const exists = await composeClient.executeQuery&lt;{

  }</code> <p>Does this sound a bit tedious? This is the same pattern we're using for issuing and verifying badges as well. And yes, it is verbose compared to what our code would've looked like had we decided not to go through the trouble of allowing our participants to control their Ceramic data.</p><p>Creating Manifestations</p><p>As mentioned above, <code>PointMaterializations</code> represent how points manifest in a platform for reward structures (like a new badge, an aggregation for a leaderboard, or gating an airdrop). Most importantly, the <code>PointMaterializations</code> collection is a new dataset built from our composable piece <code>PointClaims</code>. </p><p>To create <code>PointMaterializations</code>, we use an event-driven architecture, leveraging our MVP EventStream feature. When <code>PointClaims</code> instances are written to Ceramic, we will receive a notification in another application, in this case, a <a href="https://fluence.dev/docs/build-mvm/introducing_fluence?ref=blog.ceramic.network#compute-function">Fluence compute function</a>. </p><p>Our compute function works like this</p>  Determine that the notification is for the model (<code>PointClaims</code>) and the issuer is the DID of our application.  Extract from the notification content the <code>PointClaims</code>  Verify that the <code>issuer_verification</code> is valid for the <code>data</code> field in <code>PointClaims</code>  If the subject of the <code>PointClaims</code> (the document owner) has an existing PointMaterializations, retrieve it, otherwise create a new one.  For the context of the <code>PointMaterializations</code> calculate a new value  <code>unique-events</code> : tally all the <code>context</code> unique entries in the <code>data</code> field  <code>all-events</code> : tally all the entries in the <code>data</code> field  <code>first-all-events</code> : similar to all events, we check all unique <code>context</code> entries in the <code>data</code> field. If they have attended all the events, we then record the latest first event check-in as the value, so that we can rank users by that time    <p>If you want to view the Rust code that implements the sequence above, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/3box/ceramic-fluence/blob/main/calculator/src/calculator.rs?ref=blog.ceramic.network">compute repository</a>. </p><p>At the time of writing, the EventStream MVP does not include checkpointing or reusability, so we have set up a checkpointing server to save our state and then use a <a href="https://github.com/3box/ceramic-fluence/blob/main/fluence/src/spells/event_joiner_periodic/spell.aqua?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Fluence cron job</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/fluencelabs/spell?ref=blog.ceramic.network">spell</a>, to periodically run our compute function. In the future, we hope to trigger Fluence compute functions from new events on the EventStream.</p> What We Learned <p>This exercise left our team with a multitude of valuable learnings, some of which were more surprising than others:</p> Wallet Safety and Aversion to Wallet Authentication <p>We optimized much of the flow and the UI for mobile devices, given that the expected flow required scanning a code/tapping a disc as the entry point to interact with the application. However, throughout EthDenver and the various events we tried to facilitate issuing points, we overwhelmingly noticed a combination of:</p>  Participants intentionally do not have a MetaMask/wallet app installed on their phones (for safety reasons)  If a participant has such a wallet app on their phone, they are VERY averse to connecting it to our scavenger hunt application (particularly if they haven't heard of Ceramic previously)  <p>This presents several problems. First, given that our flow required a scanning/tapping action from the user, this almost entirely rules out using anything other than a phone or tablet. In a busy conference setting, it's unreasonable to expect the user to pull out their laptop, hence why those devices were not prioritized in our design.</p><p>Second, the end user must connect their wallet to sign an authentication message from Ceramic to write data to the network (thus aligning with our user-centric data design). There's no other way around this.</p><p>Finally, our scavenger hunt application stood ironically in contrast with the dozens of POAP NFC stands scattered throughout the conference (which did not require end users to connect their wallets, and instead allowed them to input their ENS or ETH addresses to receive POAPs). We could've quite easily architected our application to do the same, though we'd sacrifice our user-centric data design.</p> SET Account Relation will be Useful in Future Iterations <p>As explained above, the <code>PointsClaims</code> model presents an ideal opportunity to use the SET accountRelation configuration in ComposeDB (given how we update an existing model if it exists). </p> Data Verifiability in User-Centric Data Design Entails More Work <p>Not a huge shocker here, and this point is certainly relevant for other teams building with <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/examples/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Verifiable Credentials</a> or <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EAS Off-Chain Attestations</a> on Ceramic. While there are plenty of considerations to go around, we figured that our simple use of an encoded JWT was sufficient enough for our need to validate both the originating DID and the payload. It was hard to imagine how we would benefit from the additional baggage relevant to saving point-related VCs to ComposeDB.</p> Interested in Building Points on Ceramic? <p>If your team is looking for jam on some points, or you have ideas for how we can improve this implementation, feel free to contact me directly at mzk@3box.io, or start a conversation on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Forum</a>.

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic threatened to derail supply chain management completely. Or did it?</p> <p>Yossi Sheffi, distinguished MIT professor and an expert with 49 years in supply chain management, breaks down supply chain resilience into five levels and argues that supply chain managers were unsung heroes during the pandemic. Yossi also touches on balancing resilience with sustainability, pointing out that while essential, both can introduce short-term costs and competitive imbalances. He underscores the delicate balance companies must strike between cost management and maintaining multiple suppliers for risk mitigation.</p> <p>He expounds on the role of AI in supply chains, emphasizing the importance of leveraging artificial intelligence for identifying alternative suppliers and predictive analysis. The conversation also delves into the roles of machine learning, large language models, and robotics in evolving supply chains. Despite skepticism about fully autonomous applications like pilotless planes, Yossi highlights ongoing experiments with AI as potential co-pilots. The episode concludes with reflections on the rapid technological evolution impacting the professional landscape and the fabric of daily life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Key takeaways:&nbsp;</p>     <p>Resilience in supply chains is crucial for navigating disruptions and maintaining operational continuity.</p>     <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is vital for supply chain management despite potential challenges.</p>     <p>Supply chain resilience and sustainability are critical concerns, as are the investments in these areas.</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1 US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guest:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yossi-sheffi-b38b731/">Yossi Sheffi on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>Check out Yossi’s book - <a href="https://sheffi.mit.edu/magicbelt">The Magic Conveyor Belt: Supply Chains, A.I., and the Future of Work</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The advantages are many. Let’s start by saying that Passkeys are more secure than traditional passwords. These are fraud resistant and follow standards Fast Identity Online (FIDO )established by the FIDO Alliance, a global organization of which the Sony Group (owner of PlayStation) is part. The FIDO Alliance is responsible for defining and promoting the more advanced authentication standards for a wide range of devices and platforms. The goal is to reduce the dependence on passwords, which are considered an obsolete method in contemporary times. These standards are supported by leading companies and institutions in the technology sector, with which PlayStation itself has collaborated to offer an optimal access experience.</p>

 <p>A customer looks at a market where choice rules and nobody owns anybody. Source: Microsoft Copilot | Designer</p> 
<p>I’m in a discussion of business constituencies. On the list (sourced from the writings of <a href="https://substack.com/@dougshapiro">Doug Shapiro</a>) are investors, employees, suppliers, customers, and regulators.</p>
<p>The first three are aware of their membership, but the last two? Not so sure.</p>
<p>Since ProjectVRM works for customers, let’s spin the question around. Do customers have a business constituency? If so, businesses are members by the customer’s grace. She can favor, ignore, or more deeply engage with any of those businesses at her pleasure. She does not “belong” to any of them, even though any or all of them may refer to her, or their many other customers, with possessive pronouns.</p>
<p>Take membership (e.g. Costco, Sam’s Club) and loyalty (CVS, Kroger) programs off the table. Membership systems are private markets, and loyalty programs are misnomered. (For more about that, read the “Dysloyalty” chapter of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527/">The Intention Economy</a>.)</p>
<p>Let’s look instead at businesses that customers engage as a matter of course: contractors, medical doctors, auto mechanics, retail stores, restaurants, clubs, farmers’ markets, whatever. Some may be on speed dial, but most are not. What matters in all cases is that these businesses are responsible to their customers. “The real and effectual discipline which is exercised over a workman is that of his customers,” Adam Smith <a href="https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/smith1776_1.pdf">writes</a>. “It is the fear of losing their employment which restrains his frauds and corrects his negligence.” That’s what it means to be a customer’s constituent.</p>
<p>An early promise of the Internet was supporting that “effectual discipline.” For the most part, that hasn’t happened. The “one clue” in&nbsp;<a href="https://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> said “we are not seats or eyeballs or end users or consumers. we are human beings and our reach exceeds your grasp. deal with it.” Thanks to ubiquitous surveillance and capture by corporate giants and unavoidable platforms, corporate grasp far outreaches customer agency.</p>
<p>That’s one reason ProjectVRM has been working against corporate grasp since 2006, and just as long for customer reach. Our case from the start has been that customer independence and agency are good for business. We just need to prove it.</p>

<p>The OASIS Board of Directors are integral to the organization's success. Read our Q&amp;A to gain a better sense of who they are and why they serve the OASIS community.</p> 


<p>Meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jautauwhite/">Jautau “Jay” White, Ph.D.</a>, an accomplished leader with a strong focus on people and teamwork. With two decades of experience, he specializes in building top-notch teams and programs that enhance information security and cybersecurity while reducing risks and ensuring compliance. His expertise spans AI/ML vulnerabilities, supply chain security, data privacy, cybersecurity, and more.</p>



<p>What can you tell us about your current role?<br>At Microsoft, my role involves supply chain security and open source strategy work. My main function is to be the subject matter expert on cybersecurity and information security matters, and take that knowledge and use it to communicate internally to extrapolate ideas, initiatives, and strategies that can be worked on in a collaborative environment such as open source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A large part of my job is going out into the open source ecosystem to see what communities are already in place and to help build communities around work that’s for the betterment of mankind. I seek out opportunities that align with Microsoft’s ongoing projects, identifying areas where Microsoft wants to invest its efforts and finding where those efforts are already underway. We initiate projects within Microsoft and leverage open source collaboration to crowdsource innovative solutions from open source communities. I bring those insights back to Microsoft, advocating for the adoption of these solutions, saying “This is already being done, why don’t we use this?” or “Why don’t we get involved with that?” That’s a large part of my job. I love what I do mainly because it takes everything I’ve learned throughout my entire career to do it.</p>



<p>What inspired you to join the OASIS Board?<br>I love standards, specs, and policies. Having had a hand in writing standards and then using them throughout my entire career, joining the OASIS Board was an excellent opportunity. One of the things I think that I liked most was the fact that I had to run for the board seat. I campaigned and talked to community members and staff; I really put myself out there and I enjoyed that immensely.</p>



<p>I love what OASIS does in terms of the international community. I love its recognition. There are so many specs and technologies that are being used today that people don’t even know originated in OASIS and I just love that I get a chance to be part of it.</p>



<p>Prior to serving on the OASIS Board, were you involved in open source or open standards?&nbsp;<br>For the past few years, I’ve been involved with the Linux Foundation, especially their Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) project. I currently sit on OpenSSF’s Technical Advisory Council (TAC) and I lead a few working groups and special interest groups there as well. Getting involved with OASIS was the next evolution. OASIS does such an amazing job bringing standards and specs to market. I’ve always felt that I want to be involved in this part, because the regulatory part is where I thrive.</p>



<p>What skills and expertise do you bring to the OASIS Board and how do you hope to make an impact?<br>I bring extensive cyber and security knowledge. Unlike many individuals who specialize in one area for the entirety of their careers, I’ve navigated through many roles inside of cyber and information systems. I’ve been a network engineer, a systems admin, a desktop support engineer, and a penetration tester. Also, I’ve done physical security assessments, admin security assessments, and I’ve installed firewalls. I have a software engineering degree, so I’ve written programs. There are so many different places that I’ve touched throughout my entire career across government, healthcare, finance, and professional services sectors. My experiences have enabled me to approach situations from different vantage points and engage meaningfully in conversations. I’m excited to learn about emerging standards and specs from diverse industries.</p>



<p>Why are you passionate about the OASIS mission to advance technology through global collaboration?<br>Global collaboration is key. I spent my last few years working in open source, and it’s so important to work collaboratively. I coined the phrase, “strategically competing through partnership and collaboration.” A lot of these major companies are competitors in nature, but there’s so much out there right now that is affecting every single one of our businesses at the same time, that we have to come together to build these standards, technologies, controls, and safeguards so that our joint customer base remains safe. Trust is huge and our customers have to trust each and every one of us equally.</p>



<p>What sets OASIS apart from other organizations that you’ve worked with in the past?&nbsp;<br>The way OASIS is constructed around Technical Committees and Open Projects is still relatively new to me. I think where OASIS shines is how standards get created and brought to market. That’s the niche.</p>



<p>What would you say to companies that want to bring their projects to OASIS?<br>It would totally be dependent on what that company wanted. If they want to create a spec or a standard around a tool that’s being created, I would definitely say go to OASIS.</p>



<p>Do you have an impact story about your work in open source or open standards?<br>I take great pride in establishing a Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) working group in the OpenSSF where there wasn’t one before. Additionally, I’m proud of the AI work that I’ve been able to bring to Microsoft.</p>



<p>At OASIS, I’m excited to be one of the founding members of the <a href="https://openeox.org/">OpenEoX Technical Committee</a> alongside Omar Santos. I’m extremely excited about OpenEoX’s potential; I think it’s going to be huge in the industry because there isn’t a standard for end-of-life and end-of-support. There’s nothing out there that allows customers to understand when new releases are coming in, when they’re going out, and how things are deprecated. Having been a part of OpenEoX since its inception and participating in the initial meetings thus far has been incredibly fulfilling.</p>



<p>Can you tell me about any exciting changes or trends in open source and standards?<br>The AI space is extremely large and there’s so much room to play in it. I don’t want us to get consumed by one area over the other. There are so many different specs and standards that can be created and I want us to be open to all the possibilities and open to the entire knowledge space.</p>



<p>Where do you see standards going in the future?<br>I see standards becoming more prevalent with respect to these different government regulations coming in. We have more and more regulatory requirements coming out that are beginning to drive standards, for example the EO from the White House, the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and a policy that’s coming out in Germany. I can see that gap closing where you’ll have a standard that could even drive a regulatory requirement at some point which will be something weird to see.</p>



<p>What’s a fun fact about you?<br>I ride motorcycles and I like to work on cars and bikes. More than anything, I enjoy getting under the hood of a car or lifting the bike up and taking it apart and putting it back together.</p>

<p>David Birch is a keynote speaker, a published author on digital money and digital identity, fintech columnist, social media commentator and an international advisor on digital financial services. A recognised thought-leader in digital identity and digital money, he was named one of the global top 15 favorite sources of business information by Wired magazine.&nbsp;</p><p>What was the career path that led to you becoming a thought leader on digital money and identity?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s quite straightforward. I started out in the world of secure electronic communications. I was working in primarily in defence and safety-critical communications when suddenly the financial sector needed to know about this stuff too, which took me into the world of finance and payments.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d edited a book about digital identity and then I was encouraged by the economist Dame Diane Coyle to write <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Identity-Money-Perspectives-David-Birch/dp/1907994122?ref=blog.identity.foundation#:~:text=This%20book%20argues%20that%20identity,phones%20are%20the%20key%20technologies.">Identity Is The New Money</a>. She was the person who pushed&nbsp; me to have a go at writing a book myself. The timing was good, as others were talking about similar ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>The book helped people to rethink some of the problems, and I think it’s stood the test of time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s been ten years since you published Identity Is The New Money. Is this a reality today?&nbsp;</p><p>On one level it is. Some time ago I started to realize that the big problems in payments were identity problems, not payment problems. It doesn't matter if it's push payment fraud or whatever, the problems all come from the lack of identity infrastructure. Why is Elon Musk spending so much on money transmitter licenses, KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering)? Is it because he wants to earn a tiny slice when you pay a friend for concert tickets, or is it because he wants to know who you are and what you’re into? The data about a payment is much more valuable than the transaction fee.&nbsp;</p><p>But in the sense in which I meant ‘identity is the new money’, it still isn't, and that’s surprising.</p><p>What needs to change?&nbsp;</p><p>The lack of privacy is one area. Digital payments are too intrusive, though a lot of people don't care. I get a lot of messages about how terrible it would be for CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) to include not-yet existent features such as the ability to block your spending on certain things, yet when it’s Visa or Twitter being able to see everything you buy, no-one seems bothered.&nbsp;</p><p>Authentication is another area. It bugs me that 10 years later I'm still doing password resets. Recently I needed to book a hotel room, so I tried logging into a brand where I've got points. I got the password wrong and didn’t want to wait for the reset email. Instead I logged into a different brand and booked a room. My product choice was based on which password I remembered!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Do you see a role for decentralized identity in fixing these issues?&nbsp;</p><p>I like the underlying standards, Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials. But the implementation isn’t there yet. From the history of Bitcoin we can see that people lack the competence to manage their keys. When I drop my phone in the canal, how do I get all my stuff back? In a centralized world it’s easy. I buy a new phone and Apple puts all the pictures back. I’ve got my 2FA (2-Factor Authentication) device, so I can easily log into my bank again.&nbsp;</p><p>Otherwise, I'd have to put my secret key on a memory stick and bury it in a biscuit tin in the back garden. For 99 per cent of the population that will never work.&nbsp;</p><p>How can we overcome these challenges?&nbsp;</p><p>I believe the answer is custodial SSI (Self Sovereign Identity), whereby I generate the key on my app and my bank looks after it. That looks like a viable option to me, because banks know how to securely manage keys in distributed hardware, so I trust them not to lose the key. If they do, there’s recourse, as they’re regulated.&nbsp;</p><p>Do I want to control my digital identity? Absolutely. Do I want to hold the keys? No, I want my bank to do it for me.&nbsp;</p><p>What makes you believe people will trust their bank with the keys to their digital identity?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s trust in the legal sense, and then there’s trust in the everyday sense: I trust that my personal data won’t be looted, that I won’t lose access if I lose my phone… I trust the system to regulate my bank and ensure they don’t do stupid things. In the mass market, that’s the kind of trust that matters — the belief that if something goes wrong, it will get fixed.&nbsp;</p><p>What does a good digital identity experience look like, in your view?&nbsp;</p><p>When I log in to the airline, it should ask “Which ID would you like to use?” If I want to use my Avios app, I should be able to. It might call my EU wallet in the background, but I don't see that, everything is embedded. Personally I'd like to never think about managing my identity again.</p><p>In June 2023 you stated that the lack of mass-market digital identity is a drag on the economy. Have you seen much progress since then?&nbsp;</p><p>Lots of companies are experimenting. But is anything mainstream happening? We’re not there yet. For example, I can’t download my Barclays ID and use it to log into my HSBC account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We’re starting to see people storing mDLs (mobile driving licenses) in their Apple wallet, and the EU Digital Identity Wallet is on the horizon. Whether it gets traction or not, it’s driving forward research and development. Does that mean the EU wallet will be all-conquering? I don't know.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ve talked about how machine customers or ‘custobots’ will revolutionize ecommerce. Can you expand on this a bit please?&nbsp;</p><p>I think there’s a good chance this will happen, starting with financial services. A bot can probably do a better job of managing my finances than I can. On April 6 (the start of the UK tax year) I’ll be looking at what are the best ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts). I will spend hours faffing about, researching, applying, waving my phone in front of my face to prove it’s me, figuring out which account to transfer money from… It’s the kind of thing that could be done in nanoseconds by AI.&nbsp;</p><p>I might choose the Martin Lewis bot or the Waitrose bot to do this for me. The idea that they could be regulated by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) and operate under relevant duty of care legislation, with the co-ordinated goal of delivering my financial health, is appealing.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve also proposed that companies will soon need to provide APIs to support the needs of custobots rather than people.</p><p>Where is digital identity headed, in your view?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s energy arriving into the space from two unexpected quarters. One is CBDCs. There’s a need for identity coming from that side, and pressure to get it fixed. The other area is the metaverse. People looked at the lack of obvious progress following Meta’s early pronouncements and thought, it’s not going anywhere. That’s the wrong lesson to take away. For example Apple Vision Pro (Apple’s extended reality headset) is out and there will be no shortage of people wanting to buy it.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital identity is fundamental to make the metaverse a safe space. Assuming this is done right and the metaverse has an identity layer built in from the start, it could become a safer, less expensive, and therefore more desirable, place to transact than the “real world”.&nbsp;</p><p>Money in the Metaverse: Digital Assets, Online Identities, Spatial Computing and Why Virtual Worlds Mean Real Business will be published in late April 2024.

		<p>Beginning his career as a student assistant in technology services, Michel Davidoff was responsible for pulling thin and thick ethernet at Sonoma State University. Upon leaving the University ten years later, Davidoff was in the role of Director of Networking and Telecommunication. “I was responsible for the campus network that we had grown from around three hundred devices to well over 10,000,” says Davidoff. “I left Sonoma State in 2002 and set my sights on California State University (CSU) Chancellors’ Office. They had started a technology strategy program that included at its core digital equity. The Trustees of CSU were looking to implement the Information Technololgy Strategy (ITS) that was represented as the pyramid. IT infrastructure was at the base of the pyramid, the center, called middle world, included initiatives and projects including security and identity management, and the top was student success. CSU’s visionaries, including leadership and trustees, understood very early on the importance of technology to enable education. I was invited to participate in a system wide initiative to determine the standards for the bottom of the pyramid. Following this meeting, I was eager to help further advance this initiative and joined CSU in a new and exciting role.”</p>
<p>Finding Cost-Effective Solutions<br>
Tasked with helping create a consortium of 23 directors of networking at CSU, Davidoff began building working groups of experts. “Along with being a process facilitator for the consortium, I also created guidelines for writing RFPs, particularly outlining the functional requirements,” explains Davidoff. “A large part of my job at CSU was to provide accurate financial projections, both internal and external, and maintain connectivity for all 23 campuses. In 2006 as wireless technology became more prominent, I was tasked with integrating wireless into each campus. Without more money in the budget to do so, I had to get creative.”</p>
<p>“We began by creating a strategy for network rightsizing,” continues Davidoff. “Since I had the data of every single closet at CSU, I knew that more than 50 percent of the switches were not being used, but because of the fear of not having enough as they grow, the network had been built significantly bigger than necessary. I developed a process that if a port has not been used in 90 days, it will not be refreshed. That freed about 50 percent of the budget delegated for switching and routing. We were able to deploy wireless techology on the campuses, and through a RFP, develop the functional requirements. Later when we needed to enhance and standardize security, we went through a similar process and selected a firewall vendor, and became much more systematic and methodical about the deployment process.”</p>
<p>Spanning over two decades, Davidoff’s career at CSU allowed him to become well versed in delivering scalable, ground-breaking strategies and solutions for large scale infrastructure deployments. “I am proud of our accomplishments at CSU, and I believe I was able to bring a few key things to the University,” shares Davidoff. “First, is that collaboration works, even if it might be a little slower. Working together and developing RFPs can offer tremendous cost savings, in fact, at the end of my career, most of the equipment we purchased was at discounts greater than 80 percent.&nbsp; My job was to create the most efficient administrative process that requires the least amount of money, while providing an exceptional student learning experience.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“We need to eliminate complexity to enable innovation. If we keep this complexity in our environment, every time someone wants to innovate, we need to change all these features and configurations. Many vendors or wireless controllers have hundreds of different features and it’s difficult to develop best practices. We need a deterministic network and not a non-deterministic network in order to predict the performance.”</p>

		<p>Encouraging Collaboration<br>
Over the years, Davidoff was responsible for security, log management, and later in 2014, developing the cloud strategy for CSU. “For the next three to four years, I developed the CSU cloud strategy and I believe the biggest selling point for leadership was, unlike networking, the Cloud was a new technology,” explains Davidoff. “Instead of several experts from Amazon Cloud and several Azure experts at CSU, I suggested creating a small team that focused on cloud technology and how to make it the most efficient and automated. Throughout my career, I’ve seen the value of collaboration, especially when making important decisions on how the campus is going to run and ensuring systems are as efficient as possible. From a long-term strategic standpoint, I am a believer in the wisdom of the group, rather than the wisdom of the individual. If everyone feels they have a voice, a successful outcome is more likely. This approach was aligned with my approach that we don’t give a campus a budget, we give them a solution.”</p>
<p>A day after Davidoff was set to retire in March 2020, CSU shut down its physical campuses due to the pandemic. “Leadership knew CSU must prepare for remote learning and I began doing a lot of research, along with forming a working group,” explains Davidoff. “We selected a small company to help us teach online in case we would need to offer remote classes. Part of the contract included free licenses for half a million students for up to ten years, as well as licenses for every faculty and staff member. We trained everyone on the software and ensured we could operate online. When the pandemic hit, CSU was the first university system in the U.S. without any downtime because our processes and strategies were ready to go.”</p>
<p>Bringing Insights to a New Role<br>
After retiring, Davidoff began thinking about where he could have an even larger impact on education and helping students. “It became clear that technology companies, especially in the networking domain, are a place where I could make my mark in creating efficient technology solutions,” shares Davidoff. “I learned of a new company, Nile, and I wanted to bring my knowledge and unique perspective of higher education infrastructure and my vast experience in over two hundred network deployments. I knew I could share how the customer thinks because I had been the customer for thirty years.”</p>

		<p>Joining Nile as the Chief Strategist of Education early last year, Davidoff aligns the company’s strategy with an educational lens to ensure all technology and services deliver a superior connectivity experience. “I love the thought leadership part of my role at Nile and writing papers about rethinking networking and higher education,” says Davidoff. “I talk to a lot of students and gather valuable insights about today’s learning expectations. Nile modernizes IT operations through the delivery of a new wired and wireless enterprise network and as a leader in enterprise Network as a Service (NaaS), it allows institutions to stabilize their budgets. From a financial perspective, you’re able to buy a service that assures capacity, availability, and performance. Organizations can plan how much money is needed every year, instead of seeing a huge spike in the budget five years from now to replace the network or to replace routing. Plus, most importantly, using Nile services helps free up staff to focus on other initiatives, like classroom technology or digital transformation.”</p>
<p>“Normally, if an institution purchases a technology solution from a vendor, that system is at max performance on day one,” continues Davidoff. “Six months later, your firewall is upgraded, your core router is not at current code, and you added ten new features. Your capacity and features are now starting to degrade. Without the time to take care of all the maintenance that needs to happen, your investment keeps losing value over time.”</p>
<p>Davidoff says many organizations are not sufficiently leveraging automation in order to efficiently run and maintain the network while creating complexity that no human can solve. “We need to eliminate complexity to enable innovation. If we keep this complexity in our environment, every time someone wants to innovate, we need to change all these features and configurations. Many vendors or wireless controllers have hundreds of different features and it’s difficult to develop best practices. We need a deterministic network and not a non-deterministic network in order to predict the performance.”</p>
<p>Partnering with Edge<br>
Recognizing the important role networking infrastructure plays in the evolution of IT, Edge recently released an RFP to prospective vendors who could provide a NaaS to member organizations. The goal was to provide Edge members with NaaS services that allow these institutions to focus on promoting capabilities and skills, while reducing costs, promoting efficiencies, and improving security. Davidoff led Nile’s response to the RFP and was recently awarded a master contract with Edge (CBTS was the other awardee). “The Edge team works hard to stay at the forefront of innovation in the marketplace,” says Dan Miller, Associate Vice President, EdgeMarket. “In the world of enterprise networking, Nile represents an entirely new approach that enables organizations to offload the often overwhelming complexities of network management while reaping the benefits of a financially predictable, highly adaptable, and supremely secure network environment. We’re proud to have Nile as a new awardee and partner in our fast-growing EdgeMarket co-op.”</p>
<p>Nile helps higher education institutions deliver an uninterrupted wired and wireless experience with a performance guarantee for coverage, availability, and capacity. “Nile can help free up capital and resources to focus on meeting the demands of modern education,” says Davidoff. “We want to help institutions deliver on their mission and provide the strategic value that leadership is looking to achieve. Nile aims to help organizations break free from the traditional constraints of legacy network infrastructures and use IT resources to strategically enhance learning in a digital era.”</p>

		<p>As education institutions and public sector organizations continue to navigate through the critical process of adapting their IT organizations for the digital age, many look for innovative ways to align team members and streamline processes to help advance these objectives. To create an effective strategy, Christopher Markham, Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer, Edge, says starting with a few basic questions can help frame the conversation in how to move forward. “An important question to begin with is how does your organization view information technology? Do you view IT more as an engineering operation or as a service operation? Leadership must also determine if IT is viewed as an art or science, because there are plenty of institutions where IT is expected to be the primary change agent or innovator, not just in the administrative side of the house, but in educational technologies.”</p>
<p>“Organizations should also explore their return on investment from IT, including technology assets and staff,” continues Markham. “Do you have a return on investment and a rate of return? In addition, leadership must explore if technology is informing the business process both on the administrative and academic side, or is technology being informed by those business processes.” Achieving alignment across an IT organization involves several core axioms, including:</p>
 
 Authority and accountability must match 
 Specialization and teamwork 
 Precise domains and clear boundaries 
 The basis of a substructure 
 Avoid conflicts of interest 
 Cluster by professional synergies 
 Business within a business 
 
<p>“The golden rule is that authority and accountability in an IT organization must match,” says Markham. “You want to define clear boundaries with no overlaps or gaps and divide a function into groups based upon its strengths. In addition, cluster groups under a common leader based on similar professions. Institutions must also view higher education and information technology as a business. Faculty, students, and staff are considered customers and every manager is an entrepreneur. An entrepreneur is anyone who brings together all the different pieces to ensure service delivery of IT and high-quality services and solutions.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“IT governance, funding and financial management, and enterprise data and data governance are among the top technology-related domains that impact digital transformation readiness.” </p>

		<p>Achieving Digital Transformation Readiness<br>
The first principle of aligning authority and accountability is of top importance and what Markham calls the golden rule in IT organizational design. “This alignment is essential to the success of every IT organization and institution that it is serving. In a particular case study, a CIO appointed a few process owners at the suggestion of process improvement consultants. Each was assigned a process that engaged people from various parts of the organization in producing a specific service. These process owners had authority over those processes, and while they were collaborative and involved stakeholders in designing and implementing the new processes, they were not process facilitators who served others by bringing teams to consensus on how they’ll work together. Process owners didn’t have matching accountability for their effectiveness of those processes and weren’t always the individuals accountable for delivering those services. They were accountable for the delivery of services, but they didn’t have the power to determine the processes they used to do their jobs.”</p>
<p>“If these service delivery groups failed, there was no way to know whether it was due to their own poor performance or due to a bad process,” continues Markham. “Nonetheless, they took the blame. Process owners implemented detailed, rigorous business processes and succeeded at their mission, but the organization became bureaucratic, slow, and inflexible as a result. This structure violated the golden rule. In re-envisioning and restructuring an IT organization, the CIO needs to decide the rules of the game and create the organizational ecosystem, including the group structure, the resource governance process, and the culture.”</p>
<p>Increasing the Pace of Innovation<br>
Once the right structure is in place, leaders can take the opportunity to adjust domains as needed, arbitrate any disputes, create a healthy environment for teamwork, and develop talent through recruiting, inspiring, and coaching efforts. “Leaders should manage performance including negotiating staff’s objectives, giving frequent feedback, measuring the results, deciding rewards, and managing performance problems,” says Markham. “CIOs can leverage performance programs and evaluations to restructure, reorganize and incentivize.&nbsp; They must also manage commitments and resources which includes assigning work within the group and coordinating shared decisions, like common methods and tools and professional practices. In addition, the CIO must make decisions when consensus cannot be reached.”</p>
<p>Markham shares another case study where the CIO in a large insurance company was tasked with addressing complaints from the business executives regarding the IT department’s opacity, unresponsiveness, and poor understanding of their business strategies. “The leadership in this organization was frustrated that they couldn’t control IT’s priorities and did not understand why many of the requests were not being fulfilled. There was a trend toward decentralization and many business units had started their own small IT groups, which the CIO disparagingly called Shadow IT. These groups only existed because business units did not want to do business with corporate IT. In response, the CIO dedicated a group to each business unit and divided his engineering staff among them. Each group was relatively self-sufficient with all the skills needed to deliver.”</p>
<p>“The senior managers also served as the primary liaisons to those business units,” continues Markham. “The CIO felt this structure would appease the business units and stave off further decentralization, while holding senior managers accountable for business results and client satisfaction. Unfortunately, technical specialists were needed throughout the organization, and since technology subspeciality was scattered among the various client-dedicated groups, this limited their professional exchange. When the sales team, for example, ran into technical challenges, they may not have known that someone in another group already had encountered that issue and knew a solution. Their peers were busy with other priorities, costs rose, and response time slowed, and everyone was reinventing solutions to common problems. Meanwhile, there was little impetus for standards, and individual teams built systems that were optimal for their specific clients, not for the enterprise as a whole.”</p>
<p>Markham continues, “The pace of innovation also slowed, and the organization could not hire an expert in an emerging technology until demand grew across the whole enterprise. As a result, business opportunities to build customer loyalty were missed and the impacts extended beyond IT’s performance. Over time, the structure led to multiple general ledger systems and multiple records for the same customer. Synergies were lost as the company lost a single view of its customers, resources, and suppliers.”</p>
<p>Including productivity specialists can bring efficiency to an IT organization which can translate into cost savings for return on investment. “Specialists have ready answers and don’t have to climb the learning curve with each new challenge,” says Markham. “Quality specialists know the latest methods and technologies in their field and understand how their products are more capable and have lower lifecycle costs. Competence and experience deliver results with fewer risks. Innovation specialists can keep up with the literature and be the first to learn about emerging technologies and techniques.&nbsp; As a result, the pace of innovation improves. Since they are confident in their abilities, specialists experience less stress, are more productive, and are more likely to excel in their career.”</p>

		<p>Driving Organizational Change<br>
Creating an IT strategy that optimizes processes and technology and fosters a culture of innovation includes several domains of enterprise architecture. “IT governance, funding and financial management, and enterprise data and data governance are among the top technology-related domains that impact digital transformation readiness,” says Markham. “Each of these domains represent specializations of the IT reference disciplines or olive branches from those IT reference disciplines, and the business architecture is an olive branch with each of the functional offices in both administration and academics. But without labeling these domains properly as a CIO, it’s very difficult to reorganize, restructure, or re-envision your organization. The cost of overlapping these domains and clustering by professional synergies is reduced specialization, redundant efforts, confusion, product disintegration, less innovation and teamwork, and lack of entrepreneurship.”</p>
<p>Edge’s E360 assessment is designed to provide a holistic, 360-degree view of an institution’s current-state technology program with a focus on the technology-related domains. Taking a diagnostic and prescriptive approach to evaluating the technology organization, Edge looks at four key areas. “We first identify any unreliable processes and if there is reduced specialization as a result of these gaps,” explains Markham. “We also look if that reduced specialization leads to conflicts of interest. The E360 assessment also focuses on the professional exchange between the domains, if there are domain overlaps, the level of coordination, and whether it is a whole business. Lastly, we explore the substructure and the results of reduced specialization, domain overlaps, and inappropriate biases. E360 produces a final report that not only includes outcomes and analysis, but a three-year roadmap for an IT organization to drive organizational change, improve their technology landscape, and achieve digital transformation goals successfully.”</p>

		<p>In an age where data collection and analysis continue to grow in importance in nearly every industry, many organizations seek innovative and affordable ways to store data and expand their networking capabilities. In the education community, not every institution is equipped with a large IT infrastructure or the space to host servers, networking equipment, and data storage. To help address this need, Edge offers affordable colocation services where member institutions can receive data center support and colocation space for disaster recovery and business continuity. “Colleges and universities have always had the responsibility to design, build, and run data centers on college campuses,” says Bruce Tyrrell, Associate Vice President Programs &amp; Services, Edge. “Unfortunately, the physical infrastructure, including commercial power, backup generators, and environmental services are extremely expensive and complex to deploy, especially in a typical college campus environment that was not designed for these requirements. Our colocation services are an enhancement of our members’ existing connectivity to the Edge network. By leveraging their existing last mile connections, members have the ability to place hardware at one of several locations around the region.”</p>
<p>With Edge maintaining high availability colocation data centers throughout the Northeast region, several members are choosing to exit the owned data center space and move their hardware to an off-campus location. “Many institutions are relocating hardware to a purpose-built facility that has been professionally engineered and constructed with the desired features,” says Tyrrell. “Access to these features is included in the monthly recurring costs for space outsourcing and using a colocation provider can help reduce the need for additional staff to handle the physical management of those environments.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				   
 
	 
		<p>Benefits of Colocation<br>
From their optical network, Edge can build connections for members from their campuses directly into the colocation facilities. “Member institutions can choose to place hardware infrastructure at the enterprise grade colocation facility on the campus of Montclair State University at a significant discount over commercial space,” explains Tyrrell. “Colocation is available along our optical network and provides access to 165 Halsey Street in Newark, New Jersey Fiber Exchange (NJFX), which is in Wall Township adjacent to the Tata international cable landing station, and at 401 N Broad Street in Philadelphia. Members can also access the Digital Realty colocation at 32 Avenue, the Americas in Manhattan. Edge is expanding our colocation capability by adding the colocation facility at Data Bank in Piscataway, New Jersey, a bespoke water-cooled facility designed with High Performance Computing in mind.”</p>
<p>Colocation data centers allow members to store their equipment in a secure location with a public IP address, bandwidth, and power availability. These locations also include backup power in the event of an outage. “An organization can use Edge colocation services to extend their internal infrastructure into a professional collocation space from an end user point of view,” says Tyrrell. “The Edge model is unique in that the bandwidth provided to our members is not shared with any other organization, and since this extension is transparent, students, faculty, and staff do not realize their data is traveling off campus and out to a data center and back—the data transfer only takes microseconds.”</p>
<p>With Edge as the provider of the bandwidth, both internally connected to the campus, as well as externally via their internet connections, these connections are designed to scale and burst. “Unlike a cloud environment, where there is an increased cost for bursting when an organization’s computing resources reach their max, a colocation environment offers costs that are fixed,” explains Tyrrell. “An organization rents a cabinet and purchases hardware to store in this cabinet. Edge fixes the cost of transport and internet capacity which can allow for greater budget predictability. This is different from the Cloud, where once an application is placed in the Cloud, upticks in utilization for those apps can have a direct impact on the monthly expense to operate those services. For some institutions, having a fixed monthly budget for colocation services is easier to operationalize from a financial perspective.”</p>

		<p>Onboarding and Support<br>
When an institution selects colocation services, Edge’s engineers help walk the member’s IT team through the ins and outs of the processes and can accompany them to colocation facilities to familiarize them with the data centers. “Edge acquires the space, coordinates the connectivity, and assists in providing remote and physically secured access to the cabinets or gauges,” says Tyrrell. “We also handle all the administrative pieces like billing and passing along clean invoices to the member. Since colocation facilities can often be complex and intimidating, Edge can visit the facilities with you during the onboarding process.”</p>
<p>“Colocation is a unique environment that can be complex from both an operational and an acquisition perspective,” continues Tyrrell. “Edge has decades of experience in operating these environments and we stand ready to assist our members with transitioning hardware and application into these professionally maintained tier three colocation facilities. Once the transition has been made, members are better positioned to weather the storms and unforeseen outage conditions that have been known to impact on campus data centers. This resilient infrastructure can provide peace of mind and a cost-friendly way to optimize resources and meet the growing demands of today’s higher education community.”</p>

		<p>With the age of artificial intelligence (AI) well underway, how we work, learn, and conduct business continues to transform and open the door to new opportunities. In the classroom, AI can be a powerful teaching tool and support innovative and interactive learning techniques and critical thinking. Dr. C. Edward Watson, Associate Vice President for Curricular and Pedagogical Innovation with the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U) and formerly Director of the Center for Teaching and Learning at the University of Georgia, explores how AI is revolutionizing the future of learning and how educators can adapt to this new era of human thinking in his new book, Teaching with AI: A Practical Guide to a New Era of Human Learning (Johns Hopkins University Press).</p>
<p>“AI is a significant game changer and is presenting a new challenge that is going to be dramatically different from past disruptive innovations,” says Watson. “Goldman Sachs and other sources estimate that two-thirds of U.S. occupations will be impacted by AI.1 With a vastly accelerating expectation within the workforce that new graduates will be able to leverage AI for work, there is a growing pressure on institutions of higher education to ensure students become well-versed in AI techniques. This new learning outcome for higher education is being termed AI literacy.”</p>
<p>AI is also introducing a new academic integrity challenge including how to accurately determine if students are using AI to complete assignments. Along with Teaching with AI co-author, José Antonio Bowen, Watson explores crucial questions related to academic integrity, cheating, and other emerging issues in AI-powered education. “The real focus of the book is how to create assignments and practices that increase the probability that students will engage with the work rather than turn to AI, as well as ways to partner with AI and use these tools in meaningful and impactful ways. Instead of fearing AI and how students may misuse it, the education community must employ logical pedagogical practices within the classroom that encourage our students to become competent partners with AI, including building AI literacy skills that will help them on their future career paths.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“I look forward to discussing the higher education landscape at EdgeCon and exploring suggestions for how we might move forward. We need to acknowledge that AI is going to be an important thread in the education and research industries. Disruption is not always a bad thing, especially in the workforce. AI can help improve efficiencies, reduce costs, increase productivity, and create new job opportunities. In the higher education setting, these tools have the potential to offer personalized learning experiences, strengthen retention, and resolve accessibility issues. Along with the potential challenges this type of technology may introduce, we must also look at the positive opportunities that will arise and how we can better prepare our students for the world that is already waiting for them.”</p>

		<p>AI in the Classroom and Beyond<br>
With over twenty-five years of experience in faculty and instructional development, Watson is nationally recognized for his expertise in general education, active learning, classroom practice, course design, faculty development, student learning, and learning outcomes assessment. “I believe in the transformative opportunities that higher education can provide individuals, especially first-generation students like myself,” shares Watson. “When I entered a master’s program in English, I became increasingly interested in the puzzle of how learning works. I wanted to better understand how to make learning more meaningful for students, how to engage them, and how to ensure what I’m teaching is not just memorized for an exam, but will be remembered and utilized long after the course is completed. As I advanced in my career, I was able to take what I learned helping students in my own classroom to provide programming and opportunities that could benefit the breadth of higher education.”</p>
<p>Even though change can be slow within the education community, Watson says the dramatic, fast shifts happening in the industry are causing many institutions to take notice. “Unfortunately, as higher education begins to adapt, AI is creating new digital inequities. Many institutions are struggling to determine how to best serve their students given the new challenges and opportunities. Institutions will need leaders who continue to explore how advancements like AI are changing their world and the ways in which they can harness and manage AI as a powerful teaching tool.”</p>
<p>“To begin to understand AI and its capabilities, I recommend that faculty copy and paste a current assignment into two or three different AI tools to better understand the opportunities, restrictions, and surprises. This can provide insight into ways to improve the assignment and to make it better aligned with the way students might be expected to complete similar work in the real-world post graduation. I think going forward, we will see AI more deeply integrated within systems we already depend upon. For instance, within learning management systems (LMS), it’s foreseeable that when tudents submit assignments, the AI-assisted LMS will check for AI, plagiarism, and may even grade and provide customized feedback using a faculty designed rubric.”</p>
<p>From a teaching perspective, AI can also be beneficial in helping instructors create rubrics and improve the quality of their course syllabus and assignments. “I hope more faculty look at AI as a toolbox, rather than something to fear,” says Watson. “Teachers are still the experts in their field, and AI can help them elevate their courses and find new ways to improve the learning experience. AI is not a search engine; it is more like a knowledgeable colleague. Using it is more about prompt engineering and having a conversation that fine tunes the results. Faculty should see AI as an idea generator that could be leveraged and helpful with many aspects of the classroom and beyond.”</p>
<p>ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022, is a common AI tool used to automate tasks, compose essays and emails, and have human-like conversations. According to a recent survey conducted by Study.com, 89 percent of students over the age of 18 have used ChatGPT to help with homework, while 48 percent confessed they had used it to complete an at-home test or quiz.2 “While many students are familiar with AI tools like ChatGPT, not all educators are aware of its prevalence, causing a disconnect,” says Watson. “Showing faculty how this tool can be useful is key and encouraging them to have open and honest conversations with students about how AI can be used as a tool of learning, rather than a way to cheat on their schoolwork is now an essential early-in-the-semester conversation. Instead of approaching AI with how it is breaking your pedagogy, consider how AI is relevant for what you would like to accomplish in preparing your students for the future.”</p>

		<p>Adapting Higher Education in a New Era<br>
With a theme of Excelling in a Digital Teaching and Learning Future, EdgeCon Spring 2024 will welcome Dr. Watson as a keynote speaker to explore how higher education is evolving and ways to overcome the challenges the industry is facing. “A recent Gallup survey shows a steep decline in how higher education is perceived in this country3,” says Watson. “Less than half of Americans have confidence in higher education. All of us within our industry should consider how we can positively impact this national perception of higher education as there are ramifications. Not preparing students for what will certainly be an AI-enhanced career or recklessly using AI detection tools in ways that might unjustly accuse significant numbers of students of cheating can be significantly dangerous for higher education. Combining such practices with the ongoing student debt crisis and a politically polarized higher education dynamic, and more and more students will question if higher education is still as important as it once was. Already many ask if higher education is still a cornerstone of the American Dream.”</p>
<p>“I look forward to discussing the higher education landscape at EdgeCon and exploring suggestions for how we might move forward,” continues Watson. “We need to acknowledge that AI is going to be an important thread in the education and research industries. Disruption is not always a bad thing, especially in the workforce. AI can help improve efficiencies, reduce costs, increase productivity, and create new job opportunities. In the higher education setting, these tools have the potential to offer personalized learning experiences, strengthen retention, and resolve accessibility issues. Along with the potential challenges this type of technology may introduce, we must also look at the positive opportunities that will arise and how we can better prepare our students for the world that is already waiting for them.”</p>

<p>“Standardization plays a pivotal role in establishing secure and sustainable systems, which are crucial for the evolving digital landscape,” noted Joaquin Sufuentes, CES-TC co-chair, of Intel. “As the CES-TC sets its course, it signifies the collective dedication of OASIS members to lead the charge in technological advancement that directly enriches industries and end-users. The TC’s work will extend to smart contracts that drive logic functions, process automation, and role-based entitlements within the blockchain context.”</p>



<p>“TC contributions will focus on the data schemas and ontologies that define the attributes and entities and a REST API model for putting the data into and getting the data from blockchain or other distributed infrastructure,” said Tom Dodson, CES-TC co-chair, of Intel. “Through standardized approaches, we are empowering industries with the tools necessary to navigate the complexities of the digital age.”</p>



<p>Participation in the OASIS CES-TC is open to all through <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OASIS-OPEN-MEMBERSHIP-AGREEMENT_2024_TC.pdf">membership in OASIS</a>. The profile for the types of contributors to the CES-TC include business stakeholders responsible for product delivery, technical experts managing integrations, supply chain professionals, data specialists focusing on ontologies, government representatives concerned with traceability, and industry professionals driving digital transformations.</p>



<p>Support for the CES-TC<br>Cisco<br>“The OASIS CES-TC represents a great advancement in standardizing and securing the supply chain of the digital age. By focusing on the development of universally accepted data schemas, APIs, and smart contract specifications, this effort is laying the groundwork for transparency, efficiency, and security in supply chain management. I fully support CES-TC’s efforts to create a more resilient and trustworthy digital ecosystem.”<br>– Omar Santos, Distinguished Engineer, Cisco | OASIS Board of Directors</p>



<p>Intel<br>“Working as an ecosystem for the benefit of customers and end users of our computing products requires that we operationalize how we collaborate with data in real time to build more efficient operations and new revenue services. We want to standardize and scale the ability to share the right data and signals.”<br>-Paul Dumke, Senior Director, Ecosystem Strategy &amp; Operations, Intel Corporation</p>



<p>Micron<br>“The storage and memory business is complex and competition is fierce. Micron’s success depends on our ability to innovate, and with more than 50,000 lifetime patents, we take innovation very seriously. The value chain ecosystem is no exception. Ecosystem innovation is the next frontier and Micron is thrilled to be on this journey with our fellow CES-TC members.”<br>-Matt Draper, Senior Director of Micron Supply Chain Optimization</p>

<p>EMVCo released a white paper with FIDO Alliance’s inputs, “<a href="https://www.emvco.com/resources/emv-3-d-secure-white-paper-use-of-fido-data-in-3-d-secure-messages/">EMV® 3-D Secure White Paper – Use of FIDO® Data in 3-D Secure Messages</a>,” which explains how the use of FIDO authentication data in EMV 3DS messages can streamline e-commerce checkout while reducing friction for consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authentication flows are evolving, and merchants are increasingly building seamless experiences based on FIDO standards for device-based authentication, where a trusted device is bound to a payment credential to ensure the credential is being used by the verified cardholder. Consequently, it has become apparent that in some scenarios the issuer may require more data to assess risk and validate the authentication cryptographically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This paper addresses these scenarios by providing a data structure that allows for a chain of trust to be established between cardholder authentication, FIDO enrolments and FIDO authentication, hence giving issuers increased control and insight into the authentication process as well as validate authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the EU, where payment authentication is required as per PSD2 SCA, this industry-wide guidance can provide assistance to enabling more device-based authentication in a standardized way using globally known authentication standards such as FIDO while using widely accepted authentication rails such as EMVCo.</p>



<p>Read the full <a href="https://www.emvco.com/resources/emv-3-d-secure-white-paper-use-of-fido-data-in-3-d-secure-messages/">white paper</a> on the EMVCo website to learn more.</p>

<p>2023 demonstrated that we still have a lot of work to do when it comes to protecting Americans from identity theft and identity-related cybercrime. The GAO and FinCEN together documented more than $300 billion in identity-related cybercrime, DHS’ Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) outlined how weaknesses in legacy authentication tools enabled adversaries to launch a wave of high-profile attacks, and millions of Americans struggled to recover from identity theft. Meanwhile, the introduction of new tools powered by biometrics and AI to help block attacks also raised concerns about equity and bias, and in the physical world, many Americans still struggle to get foundational credentials that they need to prove who they are. As 2024 kicks off, these issues will all continue to be front and center.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Thursday, January 25th in Washington DC, the Better Identity Coalition, FIDO Alliance, and the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) joined forces to present a full-day policy forum looking at “Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead.”</p>

<p>Points have taken Web3 by storm in the last six months, catalyzed by projects like Blur and EigenLayer rewarding users with points on the way to seizing the NFT market and amassing $7 Billion TVL respectively. More than <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/277823/crypto-projects-115b-points?ref=blog.ceramic.network">115 Billion points</a> have been given out by Web3 projects so far, according to Tim Copeland at The Block.</p><p>There are two ways to look at points:</p>  As a precursor to an airdrop. Projects use points ahead of a token to generate interest, signal what they care about and will reward, more effectively target engagement, and navigate legal risks associated with tokens.  As a measure of quantifiable reputation. Points ascribe a value to user activity, just like many reputation systems have before: traditional loyalty programs, Reddit karma, check-ins, credentials. They can signal legitimacy in pseudo-anonymous systems and — because they’re more quantitative than, for example, verifiable credentials — standing within the community.  <p>Both of these are right. Points align the incentives of the platform and the user base, like all reputation systems. And they forecast who is creating value and is likely to be rewarded. By understanding how these two intersect, we can forecast where Web3 will go far beyond today’s points craze.</p> Points are quantifiable like money, enduring like reputation <p>Tokens were the first major innovation of Web3 and the primary incentive. They offer fully quantifiable value, are transactional, and require no additional context. They work as “one time games.” Reputation is how social systems achieve repeat game use cases, rewarding ‘good behavior’ of an actor (e.g. following contracts and policies, not cheating counterparties) with access and benefits over the long term. Reputations are non-fungible — for them to establish trust, it has to be hard to buy reputation.</p><p>Points are proof of activity that act as a building block for reputation (and in Web3, often carry the suggestion of future value). **All reputations come with some benefit. Usually, they’re more subtle than financial rewards. Reputations might gain access to a service (credit score) or club (referral), earn discounts (loyalty programs) or introductions (dating), convince counterparties to transact (Uber rating, credit lending), and build trust with customers (influencers, corporate brands). Reputations are less measurable than financial assets, but often more valuable.</p><p>For Web3 to grow into social and other non-financial use cases, more robust reputations are needed. Points are not an isolated mechanism to forecast token earnings — they are one point on a broad spectrum of token (financial) and reputational rewards that Web3 will keep innovating on.</p> Points as part of the evolution of Web3 reputation <p>Reputation naturally starts in the most discrete, high-value places and evolves to more broad ones.</p> 1. B2C “Badges” <p>The earliest forms of reputation helped networks solve discrete pressing problems: anti-sybil and KYC. This involved a business or service issuing badges to users for achieving important milestones. For example, <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/gitcoin-passport-on-ceramic-enabling-trustworthy-beta-round-donations/">Gitcoin Passport stamps prevent sybil attacks</a> in Grants rounds for Ethereum and other ecosystems. The meaning of the badge is objective and clearly denominated.</p> 2. Attestations <p>After discrete badges, platforms needed reputation for a wider variety of activities and credentials: history of contribution, trust as a delegate, skills in a DAO, proof of activity. Attestations are still clearly denominated, but rather than signifying a clear milestone like badges they’re more continuous.</p><p>This also started B2C (for example, participating in an event, completing a certain step in a user flow, etc.) <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network#ceramic-network">EAS</a> has emerged as a standard for issuing these, used natively in the Optimism stack and widely in Ethereum. Increasingly, attestations are community-driven as well. Open platforms let users create and verify claims. For example, Metamask is working on a review and reputation system for Snaps.</p> 3. Points: scored activity <p>On-chain transactions, B2C badges, and attestations are all cryptographically verifiable actions. Users do something that has provable provenance and time, whether that’s on-chain or off-chain signed data.</p><p>Point systems specify which of these activities have value in their system (and how much), tabulate them over time for each identity, and ascribe a numeric ‘point’ value to them. Points create a quantifiable reputation that continuously aggregates the previous forms.</p> 4. Events: all activity <p>There’s no reason to believe the evolution will stop with points. At scale, all of a user’s activities in Web3 apps and platforms will be recorded as cryptographically verifiable events. This might be likes on a cast, messages on a forum, contributions to a codebase, visits to a blackbird restaurant, etc.</p><p>These are all events, and they all have value — but it’s not always known up-front what that value is. Some might have value in driving community engagement, others in improved analytics for products or targeting for ads, some as inputs into reputation systems. Because all will be cryptographically recorded, they can be referenced any time in the future.</p><p>Points will dominate for now, but before long we’ll see a huge increase in retroactive airdrops, activations, rewards, access, and other forms of value awarded to users based on a much broader history of their events — not just those that are made explicit up-front via point systems.</p> Infrastructure for points, events, and trust <p>All of these forms of reputation serve to reward users. Web2 used points exhaustively, but Web3 can uniquely do it openly and with composability. By making every event driving points both transparent and verifiable, events and points can be leveraged across platforms and have trust built in. This trust can reinforce future rewards, encourage more activity, and enable cross-platform point innovation.</p><p>Unfortunately, while points are proliferating, to date most haven’t tapped into this unique Web3 possibility — most have been tabulated on centralized databases, putting rewards at risk.</p> Data ledgers vs. asset ledgers <p>Financial blockchains were built to be asset ledgers, not point or event ledgers. They’re designed for scarcity; e.g., they must protect against double-spend as a core principle. Points are not bought, sold or traded like assets — they’re earned. They’re best served — fast, cheaply, scalably — on a data ledger.</p><p>Data ledgers, for data that is not scarce, operate with different principles. They must still offer strong verifiability and composability; but they don’t have to protect against double spend, and they must scale many orders of magnitude beyond asset ledgers. There are exponentially more data transactions than asset transactions in any web service.</p><p>Ceramic is the first <code>decentralized data ledger</code> with the scale, composability, and trust guarantees required to be a system of record for points and events. It’s built to enable the scaling of Web3 beyond financial transactions to richer experiences, including those powered by attestations, points, and the billions of events that are coming to enable a data-rich Web3.</p> Building with Points <p>If you’re thinking about a point system for your product, or how to advance point-enabled experiences, please reach out to <a href="mailto:partners@3box.io">partners@3box.io</a>.</p><p>If you are interested in emerging standards for points, reach out to us on the Ceramic <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">discord</a> to learn more about our working group. </p><p>If you’ll be at EthDenver next week, come talk points, reputation and verifiable data with us at <a href="https://lu.ma/proofofdata?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Proof of Data</a>.</p>

<p>Mailchain, founded in 2021, aims to revolutionize decentralized identity and communication with its services, including Vidos and the Mailchain Communication Protocol. These offerings streamline management of, and interaction with, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), ensuring secure, efficient, and compliant operations across various industries, simplifying the integration and adoption of decentralized identity technologies.</p><p>What is Mailchain, and how did it come into existence?&nbsp;</p><p>I always had a passion for startups. In 2016 I joined the team at AWS (Amazon Web Services) that helps startups with technology and go-to-market strategy, for example by introducing them to other AWS customers.&nbsp;</p><p>The blockchain landscape was evolving at the time and my soon-to-be co-founders (who I met at AWS) and I started tracking the space closely. We noticed that it wasn’t possible to communicate privately between blockchain addresses without providing an additional piece of information, like an email address. So we sent some encrypted messages with the transaction data as an experiment.&nbsp;</p><p>This grew into a side project. It was open source and had quite a few contributors, but we realized we needed something more scalable that wasn't dependent on blockchain protocols, with the associated gas fees and speed constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in 2021 we set out to build Mailchain, a protocol that enables people to communicate privately using any blockchain address.&nbsp;</p><p>With our SDK, developers can easily add web3 email to their own projects and applications, allowing them to engage with their users in a truly web3 way.</p><p>It’s an interesting strategy to focus on upgrading email with web3 capability. Why did you choose this route?&nbsp;</p><p>There are over <a>3.9 billion</a> active email users today. Each user’s inbox paints a rich picture of who they are. It stores their online actions, communication habits, spending behavior, even their thoughts, ideas, and feelings.&nbsp; And everybody wants to keep that information private.</p><p>‍Web3 on the other hand is underpinned by the principles of decentralization, privacy and digital property rights, using wallets and blockchain addresses as identities. But there’s no native way to communicate privately using these addresses. The workaround is to use another communication channel, whether that’s email, instant messaging or social media.</p><p>With Mailchain, users enjoy the privacy and other benefits of a digital identity wallet without needing to leave their email inbox. For instance, people can authenticate with a Web3 application by clicking a link in their inbox. Upon clicking the link, the system creates a self-signed Verifiable Credential (VC). The app knows who should be signing it, and is able to verify the user.&nbsp;</p><p>This use case came from a customer who needed to prevent Zoom-bombing (unauthorized intrusion into a private video conference call). Another use-case is universities selling remote courses. They don’t want people who are not enrolled joining the sessions, or others joining on behalf of those who are enrolled — particularly when it comes to exams.&nbsp;</p><p>How did decentralized identity become part of the Mailchain story?&nbsp;</p><p>We wanted to enable the community, so we open-sourced as much of the codebase as we could.&nbsp;</p><p>We started to see people using Mailchain for authentication, and realized identity was vital to what they were trying to achieve. These developers needed tools to manage user identities. It was early in the adoption cycle and there were a lot of gaps.&nbsp;</p><p>We also started hearing people talking about DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials).&nbsp; We saw a pattern between VCs and our previous work with NFTs. So, we went deep into the W3C standards and looked at how they were being used in the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, we didn’t know if we wanted to put people’s Mailchain IDs on-chain. We were looking for a standard way to construct the IDs and convey related attributes, such as the authorized senders for a blockchain address.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, we saw an opportunity to converge on a standardized approach. We also wanted to extend what we built to help other developers in the ecosystem, so we created <a href="https://vidos.id/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Vidos</a>, a suite of managed services to help people building with DIDs and VC related applications.&nbsp;</p><p>Tell us more about the tools you’re building, and how they promote adoption, and interoperability, of decentralized identities </p><p>Our first service is the Vidos Universal Resolver. DID resolution forms a core part of any interaction with VCs and needs to be reliable and performant. It’s also something that developers and ops teams shouldn’t need to spend time deploying and managing. The service takes away this burden so deploying a resolver is simple and just requires adding the API details to an application.</p><p>The service comes with uptime guarantees and offers granular policy and permissions features, helping organizations meet their own availability and compliance requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>This helps organizations who are not just issuers (of credentials such as course certificates and educational qualifications). They may also need to verify other credentials (such as proof of identity, age, etc.), which potentially involves resolving DIDs on multiple networks and services.&nbsp;</p><p>We also have other services coming later in the year that will facilitate credential verification with similar compliance and logging features.&nbsp;</p><p>You mentioned go-to-market strategy as an area of personal interest. Can you tell us a bit about your own strategy?&nbsp;</p><p>The DID resolution and Mailchain audiences are different. For Vidos, we’re working with enterprises and closing some gaps where technology is not available today. Mailchain is largely feature complete.&nbsp;</p><p>Vidos is a good fit with Mailchain because there’s strong interest in enabling Web3 communication, whether that’s machine-to-machine messages triggered by blockchain transactions or certain types of business communication.&nbsp;</p><p>We need to ground this in the real world, so developing SaaS (Software as a Service) products to move the entire ecosystem forward is what we think is most important right now.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d like to think that building on W3C standards ensures we don’t get ruled out of any geographic&nbsp; markets. The DID resolver is intended to be multi-region. Customers can already deploy into the UK and EU. We will stand up services elsewhere, as needed.&nbsp;</p><p>What market signals do you see?&nbsp;</p><p>The market never moves fast enough for an entrepreneur! But we’re seeing strong signs. It’s becoming a priority for enterprises to see how they can move beyond identity federation.&nbsp; Regulatory change and fraud are also encouraging supply chain actors and financial institutions to look at how they can use decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re seeing this pop up in different places, for example it’s good to see LinkedIn verifying humans on the platform. There are certainly tail winds.&nbsp;</p><p>What is the value of DIF membership to Mailchain?&nbsp;</p><p>We’re hoping to collaborate with industry participants, to make sure what we build is right for the use cases we’re targeting, starting with the Vidos Universal Resolver for DIDs, as well as to learn from others building in the space.&nbsp;</p><p>We also want to contribute back to what’s a very useful and sensible set of standards, whether that’s ideas in the working groups and/or contributing packages or libraries.</p><p>It’s a great time to be involved in DIF. The standards are reaching a stage where they are mature enough. The opportunity is now!</p>

 In this&nbsp;latest contribution to the ongoing dialogue surrounding Switzerland’s E-ID initiative, DIDAS has released a comprehensive document that critically evaluates the current technological proposals for the Swiss trust infrastructure. This document underscores DIDAS’s commitment to a principle-based, collaborative methodology in developing a secure, adaptive E-ID ecosystem, echoing the necessity for an approach that is both inclusive and forward-thinking. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>It&nbsp;focuses on the existing scenarios’ technological shortcomings,&nbsp;and is&nbsp;proposing an ‘A+’ scenario that better aligns with EU standards, addresses aspects of privacy (specifically unlinkability and correlation)&nbsp;and fosters iterative development. This approach champions not only secure cryptographic practices but also advocates for the coexistence of various credential types, ensuring a flexible, future-proof infrastructure.</p>
<p>The imperative for cryptographically safe owner binding, a cornerstone for qualified digital identities&nbsp;are further aspects. The document elucidates the necessity for&nbsp;cryptographic primitives embedded directly within the secure elements of devices,&nbsp;particularly for high levels of assurance. This technical requirement is not merely a suggestion but a mandatory prerequisite to&nbsp;prevent&nbsp;any potential misuse or impersonation attempts.&nbsp;It&nbsp;confines of a device’s silicon is highlighted as a critical measure to prevent the unauthorized replication of private keys, ensuring that the sanctity of digital identities remains inviolable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the document highlights the urgency of action, urging stakeholders to lead the way in establishing a continuously evolving, privacy-centric E-ID framework.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also&nbsp;aimed at striking a balance between Swiss-specific requirements and EU interoperability, setting a precedent for digital identity management.</p>
<p>DIDAS’s insights into governance structures and the collaborative design of the trust infrastructure serves&nbsp;as a&nbsp;high level&nbsp;guide for policymakers, technologists, and industry stakeholders, emphasizing the collective responsibility in shaping a digital identity ecosystem that is secure, user-centric,&nbsp;adaptable by private sector businesses and aligned with broader societal values and international standards.</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>Biometrics hit the news again earlier this month.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z82kjTQyQv0">TV1’s 7 Sharp</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.1news.co.nz/2024/02/08/foodstuffs-facial-recognition-tech-trial-concerns-privacy-commissioner/">1News</a>&nbsp;together with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/508613/privacy-commissioner-keeps-close-eye-on-supermarkets-facial-recognition-trial">RNZ news</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/350171964/foodstuffs-store-facial-recognition-trial-will-cut-down-crime">online</a>&nbsp;and several&nbsp;<a href="https://www.odt.co.nz/business/shops-itching-use-facial-recognition-retail-nz">print</a><a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/privacy-commissioner-promises-to-closely-monitor-foodstuffs-facial-recognition-trial/3JXFUBVGJVE47AA2GTVC5E6ASM/">media</a>&nbsp;carried the story of Foodstuffs North Island’s trial of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nist.gov/glossary-term/5441">Facial Recognition</a>&nbsp;in 25 of its stores to see if it reduces retail crime. In addition,&nbsp;<a href="https://waateanews.com/2024/02/09/high-mistake-rate-expected-in-shoplifter-face-check/">Māori, Pasifika and People of colour</a>&nbsp;have&nbsp;<a href="https://taiuru.co.nz/facial-recognition-and-artificial-intelligence-profiling/">concerns</a>&nbsp;of bias. Naturally the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/publications/statements-media-releases/privacy-commissioner-to-keep-a-close-eye-on-foodstuffs-north-island-frt-trial/">Office of Privacy Commissioner</a>&nbsp;(OPC) is closely monitoring the trial. I have no special insight but from the links above I deduce that the trial stores run their CCTV feed through facial image matching software set at a high 90% threshold, matching it against that particular store’s database of known and convicted offenders. If a possible match is made, specially trained ‘super recognisers’ visually inspect both enrolled and detected images which in itself should eliminate racial bias while the rest of the feed is deleted.</p>



<p>Permanent deletion being not straightforward and the ‘no sharing’ rule between stores are matters that OPC likely monitors along with the trial’s effectiveness of reducing retail crime. While&nbsp;<a href="https://internationalsecurityjournal.com/facial-biometrics-shops-recfaces/">emerging anecdotal evidence overseas suggests its effectiveness</a>, direct comparative research is needed.</p>



<p>CCTV and facial recognition are widely used for crime detection in public places, we are all using facial recognition every day on our phones, when we cross the border using Smart Gate, or when we use a browser on our PC, so you might ask why all the fuss?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are large notices in-store, it’s private property and people can choose to shop elsewhere. The additional use of image software in stores improves matching processes traditionally done by humans, albeit with potential human error. FR software and camera quality continuously improves while human-based matching has limitations. Perfection is challenging, but by combining human and technological efforts we can improve outcomes.</p>

<p>The Veramo User Group has kicked into action with a well-attended and productive first meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>The meeting on 15th February provided context for the origins of the popular Javascript framework and its subsequent donation to DIF, and surfaced a range of questions, ideas, use cases and feedback from current and prospective users, plus success stories including an Enterprise solution built on top of Veramo, now in full production.&nbsp;</p><p>After an initial round of introductions, the Veramo Labs team provided an overview of the project’s history and current status, and the goals of the User Group.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideas shared by participants included a registry of plugins that is actively maintained by the community, additional development languages and a 12-month roadmap of planned new features.&nbsp;</p><p>“The team’s goal has been from the beginning to grow the project by growing the community,” Veramo co-founder and group co-chair Mircea Nistor commented during the meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>“Prior to donating Veramo to DIF, we had previously donated other libraries, and we saw more adoption and contributions happening on these libraries. We’d love to see the same kinds of activities happening within the Veramo User Group,” he added.</p><p>“To make this into a community project, it needs the original team to be no longer exclusively in charge. The Veramo framework and plugins already contain enough functionality to get people started in this space. We hope to see many new GitHub issues coming from the User Group, and for those with bandwidth to take them on” said Senior Engineer at Consensys Identity and group co-chair Nick Reynolds.</p><p>The plan is to start reviewing GitHub issues and Pull Requests (PRs) at next week’s meeting, which is at 09:00 PST / Noon EST / 18:00 CET on Thursday, 22 February. The User Group is open to all, the meeting link can be found in the <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=decentralized.identity%40gmail.com&amp;ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF calendar</a>. </p><p>In the meantime, interested parties are welcome to join the community on Discord. The new Veramo User Group channel on DIF’s Discord server is recommended for meeting follow-ups and agenda items, and the Veramo Labs Discord server is the place to head for specific technical questions.</p><p>The Veramo Labs team is hoping for the community to participate in leading the User Group within the next six months.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by Hany Farid, UC Berkeley Professor, CAI Advisor</p><p>News and trends shaping our understanding of generative AI technology and its applications.</p><p>In May of 2019, a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctored-nancy-pelosi-video-highlights-threat-of-deepfake-tech-2019-05-25/">manipulated video</a> of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi purportedly slurring her words in a public speech racked up over 2.5 million views on Facebook. Although the video was widely reported to be a deepfake, it was what we would today call a “cheap fake.” The original video of Speaker Pelosi was simply slowed down to make her sound inebriated — no AI needed. The cheap fake was, however, a harbinger.</p><p>Around 2 billion citizens will vote this year in some 70 elections around the globe. At the same time, generative AI has emerged as a powerful technology that can entertain, <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/january-2024-this-month-in-generative-ai-frauds-and-scams">defraud</a>, and deceive.</p><p>Today, nearly anyone can use generative AI to create hyper-realistic images from only a text prompt, clone a person's voice from a 30-second recording, or modify a video to make the speaker say things they never did or would say. Perhaps not surprisingly, generative AI is finding its way into everything from local to national and international politics. Some of these applications are used to bolster a candidate, but many are designed to be harmful to a candidate or party, and all applications raise new and complex questions.</p><p>Trying to help</p><p>In October of last year, New York City Mayor Eric Adams used generative AI to make robocalls in which he spoke Mandarin and Yiddish. (Adams only speaks English.) The calls did not disclose that the voice was AI-generated, and at least some New Yorkers believe that Adams is multilingual: "People stop me on the street all the time and say, ‘I didn’t know you speak Mandarin,’" Adams said. While the content of the calls was not deceptive, some claimed that the calls themselves were deceptive and an unethical use of AI.</p><p>Not to be outdone, earlier this year Representative Dean Phillips deployed a full-blown OpenAI-powered interactive chatbot to bolster his long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination in the upcoming presidential primary. The chatbot disclosed that it was an AI-bot and allowed voters to ask questions and hear an AI-generated response in an AI-generated version of Phillips's voice. Because this bot violated OpenAI's terms of service, it was eventually taken offline.</p><p>Trying to harm</p><p>In October of last year, Slovakia — a country that shares part of its eastern border with Ukraine — saw a last-minute and dramatic shift in its presidential election. Just 48 hours before election day, the pro-NATO and Western-aligned candidate Michal Šimečka was leading in the polls by some four points. A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/politics/election-deepfake-threats-invs/index.html">fake audio</a> of Šimečka seeming to claim that he was going to rig the election spread quickly online, and two days later the pro-Moscow candidate Robert Fico won the presidential election by five points. It is impossible to say exactly how much the audio impacted the election outcome, but this incident raised concerns about the use of AI in campaigns.</p><p>Fast-forward to January of this month when the state of New Hampshire was holding the nation's first primary for the 2024 US presidential election. On the eve of the primary, more than 20,000 New Hampshire residents received robocalls impersonating President Biden. The call urged voters not to vote in the primary and to "save your vote for the November election." It took two weeks before New Hampshire’s Attorney General <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/tech/nh-ag-robocall-update/index.html">announced</a> that his office identified two businesses behind these robocalls.&nbsp;</p><p>The past few months have also seen an increasing number of viral images making the rounds on social media. These range from faked images of Trump with convicted child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and a young girl, to faked images of Biden in military fatigues on the verge of authorizing military strikes.&nbsp;</p><p>On the video front, it is becoming increasingly easier to combine fake audio with video to make people say and do things they never did. For example, a speech originally given by Vice President Harris on April 25, 2023, at Howard University was digitally altered to replace the voice track with a seemingly inebriated and rambling Harris.</p><p>And these are just a few examples of the politically motivated deepfakes that we have already started to see as the US national election heats up. In the coming months, I'll be <a href="https://farid.berkeley.edu/deepfakes2024election/">keeping track of these examples</a> as they continue to emerge.</p><p>Something in between</p><p>In the lead up to their election earlier in February, a once-feared army general, who ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for more than three decades, was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/12/asia/suharto-deepfake-ai-scam-indonesia-election-hnk-intl/index.html">AI resurrected</a> with a message for voters. And, in India, former Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam – deceased since 2018 – was <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/how-ai-is-used-to-resurrect-dead-indian-politicians-as-elections-loom/ar-BB1i8gQJ">AI resurrected</a> with an endorsement for his son, the sitting head of the state of Bengaluru. I expect this type of virtual endorsement will become an (ethically complex) trend.</p><p>Looking ahead</p><p>There are <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/passive-versus-active-photo-forensics-in-the-age-of-ai">two primary approaches</a> to authenticating digital media. Reactive techniques analyze various aspects of an image or video for traces of implausible or inconsistent properties. <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/from-the-darkroom-to-generative-ai">Learn more</a> about these photo forensics techniques in my series for the CAI. Proactive techniques, on the other hand, operate at the source of content creation, embedding into or extracting from an image or video an identifying digital watermark or signature.&nbsp;</p><p>Although not perfect, these combined reactive and proactive technologies will make it harder (but not impossible) to create a compelling fake and easier to verify the integrity of real content. The creation and detection of manipulated media, however, is inherently adversarial. Both sides will continually adapt, making distinguishing the real from the fake an ongoing challenge.</p><p>While it is relatively straightforward to regulate AI-powered non-consensual sexual imagery, child abuse imagery, and content designed to defraud, regulating political speech is more fraught. We, of course, want to give a wide berth for political discourse, but there should be limits on activities like those we saw in New Hampshire, where bad actors attempt to interfere with our voting rights.&nbsp;</p><p>As a first step, following the New Hampshire AI-powered robocalls, the Federal Communications Commission quickly <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-makes-ai-generated-voices-robocalls-illegal">announced</a> a ban on AI-powered robocalls. While the ruling is fairly narrow and doesn't address the wider issue of AI-powered election interference or non-AI-powered interference, it is a reasonable precaution as we all try to sort out this brave new world where anybody's voice or likeness can be manipulated.</p><p>As we continue to wrestle with these complex questions, we as consumers have to be particularly vigilant as we enter what is sure to be a highly contentious election season. We should be vigilant not to fall for disinformation just because it conforms to our personal views, we should be vigilant not to be part of the problem by spreading disinformation, and we should be vigilant to protect our and others' rights (even if we disagree with them) to participate in our democracy.</p>

<p>There has been considerable press, a number of papers, and several formal initiatives concerned with quantum computing’s impact on cryptographic algorithms and protocols. Most standards development organizations are addressing concerns about the impact on the security of the currently deployed cryptographic algorithms and protocols. This paper presents FIDO Alliance initiatives that address the impact of quantum computing on the Alliance’s specifications and how the FIDO Alliance is working to retain the long-term value provided by products and services based on the FIDO Alliance specifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This paper is directed to those who have or are considering FIDO-enabled products and solutions but have concerns about the impact of Quantum Computing on their business. This paper will focus, from a high-level approach, on the FIDO Alliance’s acknowledgment of issues related to Quantum Computing and explain how the FIDO Alliance is taking appropriate steps to provide a seamless transition from the current cryptographic algorithms and protocols to new PQC (or quantum-safe) algorithms in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Despite their shortcomings, passwords have been a necessary evil; an unavoidable reality. No wonder online services have struggled to get rid of passwords for nearly three decades. Not anymore! Passkeys have emerged as a modern form of authentication, offering a superior user experience and higher security. With over 8 billion accounts already protected by passkeys, the question for service providers isn’t “if” they should be adopting passkeys, rather “when” and “how”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the webinar attendees were able to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Learn why this standards-based approach is gaining such rapid traction&nbsp;

 How to run an impactful workshop using our free&nbsp;template <p>Recently, we ran a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Change">Theory of Change</a> workshop for the team at the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium</a>, which is hosted by <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>. We’ve found that organisations and projects that are looking to create big impact can benefit from this way of seeing into the&nbsp;future.</p><blockquote>Theory of Change (ToC) is a methodology or a criterion for planning, participation, adaptive management, and evaluation that is used in companies, philanthropy, not-for-profit, international development, research, and government sectors to promote social change. (Wikipedia)</blockquote><p>In this post we’ll outline what this kind of session aims to achieve, share a template which you can re-use, and explain how to make best use of&nbsp;it.</p><p>We’ve become pretty good at running these kinds of workshops for all kinds of clients, large and small, and find them particularly useful in charting a course for collaborative working. Thanks goes to <a href="https://outlandish.com/">Outlandish</a> for introducing this approach to&nbsp;us!</p><a href="https://whimsical.com/theory-of-change-VLrJHYoPmdJF17Xyb4H5ox@7YNFXnKbYzgCBz2QRZSh2">ToC workshop template</a> by <a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a><p>Note: around seven people is ideal for this kind of workshop. We run this workshop remotely, but there’s no reason why it couldn’t be done in&nbsp;person.</p> 🥝 At the&nbsp;Core <p>The template has several sections to it, but at the core is the triangle of Final goal, Outcomes, and Activities. You work through these in turn, first defining the goal, moving onto outcomes to support that goal, and then activities which lead to the outcomes.</p>The core of the ToC&nbsp;approach<p>One of the first things to figure out as a team is the timeframe for the work you are doing together. In terms of the final goal, is that to be achieved in six months? a year? 18 months? three&nbsp;years?</p><p>Write that down on the sticky note at the top left-hand corner just to remind everyone.</p> ⛏️ Breaking down the&nbsp;goal <p>The final goal can be difficult to write, so we’ve broken it down into three sections to make it easier for participants:</p><p>Before asking people to contribute ideas, we run through some examples from our own experience. The first row relates to work over around six months, the second over about 18 months, and the third over about three&nbsp;years.</p><p>Next, we use the section to the right hand side where each individual participant can take some time to write down what they think the organisation does (or should) do, to influence their stakeholders, to have the desired impact in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>They can approach these boxes in any order — for example, some people find it easier to go straight to the impact and then work backwards.</p><p>Once everyone has written something in all of the boxes, we go around and ask everyone in turn to explain what they’ve written. This adds some&nbsp;context.</p><p>Then, we go around again, and ask everyone to point to things that other people have written that they definitely agree with. This sets the scene for combining ideas into a collaborative final&nbsp;goal.</p> ✅ Good enough for now, safe enough to&nbsp;try <p>After a quick break, participants are ready to collaborate on a combined final goal. We ask if anyone would like to have a go at filling in one of the boxes. They can do this directly themselves, or we can screenshare and fill it in for&nbsp;them.</p><p>After some discussion and iteration of what’s been written, we move onto the other boxes. It’s worth mentioning that the most important thing here is facilitated discussion, which means timeboxing in a way that doesn’t feel&nbsp;rushed.</p><p>The phrase to bear in mind is “good enough for now, safe enough to try” which is a slightly different way of “perfect is the enemy of&nbsp;good”.</p> 🔍 Identifying the&nbsp;Outcomes <p>Getting the goal agreed on by the team is 80% of the work in this session. In our experience, it’s entirely normal for this to take an entire 90-minute session, or even&nbsp;longer.</p><p>Moving onto the outcomes, these are statements which support the goal. They are change or achievements that need to happen to help it be achieved; they should be written in a way that it’s possible to say “yes that has happened” or “no it has&nbsp;not”.</p><p>For example, “the world is a better place” is not an example of a well-written outcome, but “more people agree that the city is a safer place to live” would&nbsp;work.</p><p>Other examples of decent outcomes from different kinds of work might&nbsp;be:</p>  Local biodiversity is enhanced and pollution is&nbsp;reduced.  Parents demonstrate improved understanding of internet safety and digital citizenship.  Economic diversity within neighbourhoods is increased.  <p>There are several ways we’ve run this part of the workshop, from full-anarchism mode where people just ‘have at it’ through to taking it in turns in an orderly way to add (and then discuss) an&nbsp;outcome.</p> 🚣 Getting to the Activities <p>People new to ToC workshops often conflate Outcomes and Activities. The easiest way to tell the difference is to ask whether it’s something we’re working towards, or whether it’s something we’re&nbsp;doing.</p><p>So, for example, if we take the outcome “Local biodiversity is enhanced and pollution is reduced” some supporting activities might&nbsp;be:</p>  Introduce incentives for creating wildlife-friendly spaces, such as green roofs and community gardens.  Run regular river and park clean-up operations to remove pollutants and&nbsp;litter.  Enforce stricter regulations on industrial emissions and waste management.  Offer subsidies for businesses that implement green practices that reduce pollution and enhance biodiversity.  Promote the use of environmentally friendly pesticides and fertilisers in local farming and gardening.  <p>Again, we’ve run workshops where we’ve just had a free-for-all, others where it’s been more orderly, and then others where teams have gone away and come up with the activities outside the&nbsp;session.</p><p>Some, in fact, have taken the existing activities they’re engaged with and tried mapping those onto the outcomes. It’s an interesting conversation when those activities don’t&nbsp;map!</p> 💡 Final&nbsp;thoughts <p>A ToC workshop is a powerful way to chart a course together. It’s a collaborative endeavour for a small group to spend time on. What’s important is strong facilitation, as without it, participants can spend too much time (or not enough!) sharing their thoughts.</p><p>If you would like to explore WAO running a ToC workshop for your organisation, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">get in touch</a>!

Let us know if we missed anyone. Enjoy! :)</p>  Ceramic's Data Feed API opens for alpha testing<br>The Data Feed API is a set of new Ceramic APIs that enable developers to subscribe to the node's data change feed, allowing them to build Ceramic-powered databases and indexing solutions. A number of ecosystem partners are already in testing as we gear up for an early release before EthDenver!    ComposeDB now supports interfaces<br>Interfaces enable standardized data models for interoperability. By defining essential fields that must be shared across models, interfaces facilitate data integration and querying across different models. This is vital for ensuring data consistency, especially in decentralized systems like verifiable credentials. For a detailed overview, see <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/interfaces-in-ceramic-protocol-an-intro-guide/">Intro to Interfaces</a>.    Get started quickly with <code>create-ceramic-app</code><br>The&nbsp;create-ceramic-app&nbsp;CLI tool simplifies the process of starting with the Ceramic network by allowing you to quickly set up a ComposeDB example app. If you're familiar with create-react-app or create-next-app, you should be right at home. If you want to quickly test a Ceramic app locally on your system, simply run <code>npx @ceramicnetwork/create-ceramic-app</code>. This command will guide you through creating a new Ceramic-powered social app in under a minute.    Collect attendance badges at ETHDenver 2024!<br>Ceramic is partnering with <a href="https://fluence.dev/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Fluence</a>, a decentralized computing marketplace, to put forward a demo that will be in play at each of the events above. You will be able to find us at each event and tap a disc to participate! With each attendance you will claim badges represented as documents on Ceramic. Fluence will be consuming the new Ceramic Data Feed API to enable compute over incoming badges.    Deprecation of IDX, Self.ID, Glaze, DID DataStore, 3ID, TileDocuments, Caip10Link<br>3Box Labs announced the deprecation of a suite of outdated Ceramic development tools including Self.ID, Glaze, DID DataStore, 3ID, 3id-datastore, TileDocuments, and Caip10Link.

<p>Real-time data monitoring is revolutionizing maintenance and efficiency in industries such as aviation and automotive through digital twin technology.</p> <p>Richard Donaldson, host of the Supply Chain Next podcast, is a visionary in supply chain management and circular economy advocate. His&nbsp; insights on moving from linear to circular supply chains highlight the potential for substantial environmental benefits and the importance of embracing reuse, especially in the context of his work with startups promoting circularity.</p> <p>The dialogue extends beyond the digital twin to the broader digital transformation of global supply chains, drawing comparisons to the quick adoption of airplane wifi as an example of rapid technological progress. It explores the role of artificial intelligence in supply chain automation and predictive maintenance, touching upon the divide between machine learning and self-actualized thought. The conversation resonates with historical references and Richard's personal entrepreneurial experiences, including his tenure at eBay, his podcast Supply Chain Next, and his perspective on learning from failure. This episode offers a thought-provoking reflection on the future of supply chains and the role of technology in sustainable business practices.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Key takeaways:&nbsp;</p>     <p>The early days of the Internet continue to influence current work in digitizing supply chains.</p>     <p>The global supply chain still lacks full digitization and transparency, particularly in older, established processes.</p>     <p>There is a strong advocacy for shifting towards circular supply chains that are environmentally mindful and focused on sustainability.</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guest:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richarddonaldson/">Richard Donaldson on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by Hany Farid, UC Berkeley Professor, CAI Advisor</p><p>News and trends shaping our understanding of generative AI technology and its applications.</p><p>Advances in generative AI continue to stun and amaze. It seems like every month we see rapid progression in the power and realism of AI-generated images, audio, and video. At the same time, it also seems like we are also seeing rapid advances in how the resulting content is being weaponized against individuals, societies, and democracies. In this post, I will discuss trends that have emerged in the new year.</p><p>First it was Instagram ads of Tom Hanks promoting dental plans. Then it was TV personality Gayle King hawking a sketchy weight-loss plan. Next, Elon Musk was shilling for the latest crypto scam, and, most recently, Taylor Swift was announcing a giveaway of Le Creuset cookware. All ads, of course, were fake.&nbsp;</p><p>How it works</p><p>Each of these financial scams was powered by a so-called lip-sync deepfake, itself powered by two separate technologies. First, a celebrity's voice is cloned from authentic recordings. Where it used to take hours of audio to convincingly clone a person's voice, today it takes only 60 to 90 seconds of authentic recording. Once the voice is cloned, an audio file is generated from a simple text prompt in a process called text-to-speech.&nbsp;</p><p>In a variant of this voice cloning, a scammer creates a fake audio file by modifying an existing audio file to sound like someone else. This process is called speech-to-speech. This latter fake is a bit more convincing because with a human voice driving the fake, intonation and cadence tend to be more realistic.</p><p>Once the voice has been created, an original video is modified to make the celebrity’s mouth region move consistently with the new audio. Tools for both the voice cloning and video generation are now readily available online for free or for a nominal cost.</p><p>Although the resulting fakes are not (yet) perfect, they are reasonably convincing, particularly when being viewed on a small mobile screen. The genius — if you can call it that — of these types of fakes is that they can fail 99% of the time and still be highly lucrative for scam artists. More than any other nefarious use of generative AI, it is these types of frauds and scams that seem to have gained the most traction over the past few months.&nbsp;</p><p>Protecting consumers from AI-powered scams</p><p>These scams have not escaped the attention of the US government. In March of last year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/03/scammers-use-ai-enhance-their-family-emergency-schemes">warned</a> citizens about AI-enhanced scams. And more recently, the FTC announced a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/contests/ftc-voice-cloning-challenge">voice cloning challenge</a> designed to encourage "the development of multidisciplinary approaches — from products to policies to procedures — aimed at protecting consumers from AI-enabled voice cloning harms, such as fraud and the broader misuse of biometric data and creative content. The goal of the challenge is to foster breakthrough ideas on preventing, monitoring, and evaluating malicious voice cloning."</p><p>The US Congress is paying attention, too. A bipartisan bill, <a href="https://www.coons.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-coons-blackburn-klobuchar-tillis-announce-draft-of-bill-to-protect-voice-and-likeness-of-actors-singers-performers-and-individuals-from-ai-generated-replicas">the NO FAKES Act</a>, would "prevent a person from producing or distributing an unauthorized AI-generated replica of an individual to perform in an audiovisual or sound recording without the consent of the individual being replicated."&nbsp;</p><p>Acknowledging that there may be legitimate uses of AI-powered impersonations, the Act has carve-outs for protected speech: "Exclusions are provided for the representation of an individual in works that are protected by the First Amendment, such as sports broadcasts, documentaries, biographical works, or for purposes of comment, criticism, or parody, among others." While the NO FAKES Act focuses on consent, Adobe’s proposed Federal Anti-Impersonation Right (the FAIR Act) provides a new mechanism for artists to <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/09/12/fair-act-to-protect-artists-in-age-of-ai">protect their livelihoods</a> while also protecting the evolution of creative style.</p><p>Looking ahead</p><p>Voice scams will come in many forms, from celebrity-powered scams on social media to highly personalized scams on your phone. The conventional wisdom of "If it seems too good to be true, it probably is" will go a long way toward protecting you online. In addition, for now at least, the videos often have telltale signs of AI-generation because there are typically several places where the audio and video appear de-synchronized, like a badly dubbed movie. Recognizing these flaws just requires slowing down and being a little more thoughtful before clicking, sharing, and liking.</p><p>Efforts are underway to add digital provenance or verifiable Content Credentials to audio. Respeecher, a voice-cloning marketplace gaining traction among creators and Hollywood studios, <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/community-story-respeecher">is adding Content Credentials</a> to files generated with its tool.</p><p>For the more personalized attacks that will reach you on your phone in the form of a loved one saying they are in trouble and in need of cash, you and your family should agree on an easy-to-remember secret code word that can easily distinguish an authentic call from a scam.</p>

<p><a href="https://charmverse.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CharmVerse</a>, a pioneering web3 community engagement and onboarding platform, recently integrated ComposeDB on Ceramic to store user attestations for grants and rewards. CharmVerse’s decision to build on Ceramic was driven by the need to store credentials in a user-owned, decentralized manner, without relying on traditional databases.</p><p>A who’s who of well-known web3 projects leverage CharmVerse to help manage their community and grants programs. Optimism, Game7, Mantle, Safe, Green Pill, Purple DAO, Orange DAO, Taiko (and the list goes on) have all experienced the need for a unique, web3-centric platform to interact with and empower their ecosystems.</p> What Objectives Does the Integration Address? <p>The work of vetting developer teams and distributing grants demands a significant investment of time and focus to ensure responsible treasury deployment. This need-driven use case is a wonderful fit for Ceramic’s capabilities.</p><p>CharmVerse identified an opportunity to enhance grants/community managers’ capabilities by implementing a credentialing and rewards system that supports user-sovereign data. This system allows grants managers to better understand their applicants, scale the number of teams they can work with, and issue attestations representing skills and participation in grants and other community programs, creating a verifiable record of participation. However, this solution came with technical challenges in maintaining user data privacy and ownership while ensuring decentralization as this data represents significant insight into the historical activity and capabilities of individuals and teams.</p> Why did CharmVerse Choose Ceramic? <p>CharmVerse considered various options but ultimately chose Ceramic due to its unique capability to support decentralized credentials and store attestations in a way that aligned with CharmVerse's vision. Alex Poon, CEO &amp; co-founder of CharmVerse, shared:</p><p>“Ceramic's unique approach to data decentralization has been a game changer for us, allowing us to truly empower our users while respecting their privacy, allowing users the choice to keep their data private or publish it on-chain. This integration aligns perfectly with CharmVerse's success metrics, centering on community empowerment and data sovereignty.”</p> How did CharmVerse Integrate Ceramic? <p>CharmVerse's integration utilizes Ceramic's ability to store user attestations and leverages Ceramic’s work with the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) as the underlying model for supporting decentralized credentials. The integration was not only a technical milestone for CharmVerse but also achieved the strategic goal of appealing to an audience concerned with data privacy and ownership.</p><p>More specifically, CharmVerse issues off-chain signed attestations in recognition of important grant program milestones (designed to award these credentials both when users create proposals, and when their grants are accepted). Given Ceramic’s open-access design, we expect to see other teams utilize these credentials issued by CharmVerse as a strong indication of applicant reputation, track record, and ability to deliver.</p> How to See CharmVerse in Action <p>This collaboration illustrates the power of innovative solutions in advancing blockchain usability, value, and adoption while maintaining the values of the early cypherpunk vision of decentralization.

<p>What’s the state of identity and authentication in 2024?</p>



<p>That was the primary topic addressed in a day full of insightful speaker sessions and panels at the annual <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/identity-authentication-the-road-ahead/">Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead Policy Forum</a> held on January 25 in Washington D.C. The event was sponsored by the <a href="https://www.betteridentity.org/">Better Identity Coalition</a>, the FIDO Alliance, and the<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/"> ID Theft Resource Center</a> (ITRC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Topics covered included the latest data on identity theft, financial crimes involving compromised identities and the overall ongoing challenges of identity and authentication. The opportunities for phishing-resistant authentication standards and passkeys resonated throughout the event as well. In his opening remarks, Jeremy Grant of the Better Identity Coalition framed identity as both a cause and potential solution to security problems.&nbsp;</p>







 White House advances strong authentication agenda 



<p>In the opening keynote, Caitlin Clarke,&nbsp; Senior Director, White House National Security Council, detailed some of the steps the Biden-Harris administration is taking to improve digital identity and combat rising cybercrime.</p>







<p>“Money is fuelling the ecosystem of crime, but we often see that identity is either the target or the culprit of the cyber incidents that we are seeing every day,” Clarke said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a bid to help improve the state of identity and authentication, the administration is implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all federal government systems. Clarke also highlighted that the administration strongly believes in implementing phishing-resistant MFA.</p>



<p>“We need to make it harder for threat actors to gain access into systems by requiring and ensuring that a person is who they say they are beyond the username and password,” she said. “That is why authentication is also at the heart of the work we are doing to improve the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, upon which we all rely.”</p>



 The role of biometrics 



<p>Biometrics have a role to play in the authentication and identity landscape according to a panel of experts. </p>







<p>The panel included Arun Vemury, Biometrics Expert and ITRC Advisory Board Member; James Lee, COO of the Identity Theft Resource Center; Dr. Stephanie Schuckers, Director, Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR), Clarkson University; and John Breyault VP, Public Policy, Telecom and Fraud, at National Consumers League.</p>



<p>Panelists generally agreed that properly implemented biometrics combined with other security practices could help devalue stolen identity data and strengthen security overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Biometrics has the potential to affect fraud numbers,” Breyault said. “It’s not a silver bullet, it’s not going to stop everyone and, it may not be useful in every context, but it is something different than what we’re doing now.”</p>



 Better Identity at 5 years 



<p>Five years ago, the Better Identity Coalition published Better Identity in America: A Blueprint for Policymakers in response to significant questions from both government and industry about the future of how the United States should address challenges in remote identity proofing and other key issues impacting identity and authentication.</p>







<p>Jeremy Grant, Coordinator at the Better Identity Coalition, detailed the progress made in the past five years and also<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a7b7a8490bade8a77c07789/t/65b00995dd1af8633cbce40c/1706035608068/Better_Identity_Coalition24.pdf"> detailed new guidance</a> for 2024.</p>



<p>The report assessed that while some progress has been made in certain areas like promoting strong authentication, overall the government receives poor grades for failing to prioritize the development of modern remote identity proofing systems or establish a national digital identity strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The revised blueprint outlines 21 new recommendations and action items for policymakers to help close gaps in America’s digital identity infrastructure and get ahead of growing security and privacy challenges posed by issues like synthetic identity fraud and deep fakes.</p>



<p>“Our message today is the same as it was back in 2018, which is that if you take this as a package, if this policy blueprint is enacted and funded by government, it’s going to address some very critical challenges in digital identity and as the name of our coalition would suggest, make things better,” Grant said.</p>



 The year of passkeys 



<p>While there is much to lament about the state of identity and authentication, there is also cause for optimism too.</p>



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance detailed the progress that has been made in the past year with the rollout and adoption of passkey deployments.</p>







<p>“Passkeys are simpler, stronger authentication, they are a password replacement,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar noted that there are now hundreds of companies enabling consumers to use passkeys, which is helping to dramatically improve the overall authentication landscape. Not only is a passkey more secure, he also emphasized that it’s easier for organizations to use, than traditional passwords and MFA approaches.</p>



<p>“If you’re in the business of selling things, or providing content, or anything like that you want people to get on your site as quickly as possible –&nbsp; passkeys are doing that,” he said.</p>



<p>Shikiar noted that the FIDO Alliance understands that user authentication is just one piece of the identity value chain. To that end the FIDO Alliance has multiple efforts beyond passkeys, including certification programs for biometrics and document authenticity certification programs among other efforts.</p>



 Don’t want to get breached? Use strong, phishing-resistant authentication 



<p>The primary importance of strong authentication was highlighted by Chris DeRusha, Federal Chief Information Security Officer in the&nbsp; Office of Management and Budget (OMB), who detailed a recent report on a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapsus$"> Lapsus cybersecurity gang</a> that was released by the Cyber Safety Review Board.&nbsp;</p>







<p>DeRusha noted that Lapsus hackers were able to beat MFA prompts using a variety of techniques, including social engineering and even just mass spamming employees with prompts to get someone to act.</p>



<p>A key recommendation from the report is to move away from phishable forms of MFA, including SMS and instead embrace FIDO based authentication with passkeys.</p>



 The view from FinCEN 



<p>The U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, more commonly known by the acronym FinCEN, is a critical element of the U.S financial system.</p>



<p>FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki spoke at the event about the agency’s recent progress on beneficial ownership reporting and the FinCEN Identity Project. The FinCEN Identity Project refers to FinCEN’s ongoing work related to analyzing how criminals exploit identity-related processes to perpetuate financial crimes. As part of this, FinCEN published a financial trends analysis earlier this month that looked at 2021 Bank Secrecy Act data to quantify how bad actors take advantage of identity processes during account openings, access, and transactions.</p>







<p>“Robust customer identity processes are the foundation of a secure and trusted U.S. financial system and are fundamental to the effectiveness of every financial institution,” Gacki said.</p>



<p>Sean Evans, lead cyber analyst at FinCEN noted that the recent report examined over 3.8 million suspicious activity reports filed in 2021 and found that approximately 1.6 million reports, representing $212 billion in activity, involved some form of identity exploitation.. Evans explained that cybercriminals are finding ways to circumvent or exploit weaknesses in identity validation, verification, and authentication processes to conduct illicit activities like fraud.</p>



<p>Kay Turner, chief digital identity adviser at FinCEN, emphasized that strengthening identity verification is critical for security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have to get identity right, it is vital to building trust in the system,” Turner stated.</p>



 CISA praises the push towards passkeys 



<p>Closing out the event was a keynote from Eric Goldstein, Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, (CISA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p>







<p>Goldstein emphasized that it’s important to note that while there are challenges, there has also been progress. Passkeys are now used by consumers everyday and increasing numbers of enterprises are moving toward passwordless deployments.</p>



<p>“It’s worth starting out just with some reflection on how far we have come in moving towards a passwordless future,” Goldstein said.”We are seeing more and more enterprises moving to passwordless for their enterprise privileges, their admin, their their employee authentication solutions and that’s a remarkable shift.”</p>

<p><a href="https://walletconnect.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect</a> offers Web3 developers powerful tools to make building secure, interactive, and delightful decentralized applications easier. This tooling incorporates best-in-class UX and UI with a modular approach to a suite of SDKs and APIs. For many teams looking to accelerate their development cadence without sacrificing security or quality, WalletConnect's various SDKs are an obvious choice.</p><p>One of our favorites is <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/web3modal/about?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3Modal</a> - a toolset that provides an intuitive interface for dApps to authenticate users and request actions such as signing transactions. Web3Modal supports multiple browser wallets (such as MetaMask and Trust Wallet) and offers thorough instruction in their documentation to help developers get up and running across multiple frameworks (React, Next, Vue, etc). For this tutorial, we will show how to use WalletConnect's Web3Modal for user authentication and the creation of user sessions.</p><p>Ready? Awesome! Let's get started</p> What Will We Build? <p>For this tutorial, we will build an application to track event attendance. The use case here is somewhat basic - imagine a conference that wants to keep track of which participants went to which event. They might allow participants to scan a QR code that takes them to this application where they can sign in (with their wallet), optionally opt into sharing their location, and generate a badge showing that they attended.</p><p>Here's a simple visual of the user flow:</p><p>Based on the summary above, it might be obvious where Web3Modal fits in. That's right - we will be using this SDK to authenticate users and keep track of who attended what event based on their wallet address.</p><p>We've made up two imaginary events to align with this use case:</p>  Encryption Event  Wallet Event  <p>Below is a sneak peek at our app's UI:</p> What's Included in Our Technical Stack? <p>To power this simple application, we will need a few things:</p>  A frontend framework that runs in the attendee's browser and a backend to handle any internal API calls we'll need - we will use NextJS   Wallet tooling so we don't have to build authentication logic from scratch - Web3Modal  React hooks that work with our browser wallet so we don't have to build these either - we'll use <a href="https://wagmi.sh/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Wagmi</a>  Decentralized data storage - we'll use <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB</a> (graph database built on <a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>)   Why ComposeDB? <p>If dealing with potentially thousands (or more) attendees to these imaginary events (as is often the case with large conferences), storing these records on-chain would be both costly and inefficient. Each record would incur gas fees, and querying the blockchain across tens of thousands of records would be arduous.</p><p>Nonetheless, we want our application to give data control to the users who attend the events. And, in our imaginary use case, other conferences must have access to this data (not just our application) so they can determine who should receive admission priority. We will therefore require some sort of decentralized data network. </p><p>In Ceramic (which is what ComposeDB is built on), user data is organized into verifiable <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/streams/event-log?ref=blog.ceramic.network">event streams</a> that are controlled exclusively by the user account that created each stream. Since Ceramic is a permissionless open data network, any application can easily join and access preexisting user data (which meets one of the requirements listed above). </p><p>Applications that build on Ceramic/ComposeDB <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-client/user-sessions?ref=blog.ceramic.network">authenticate users</a> (using sign-in with Ethereum), creating tightly-scoped permission for the application to write data to the network on the user's behalf. This is important for us because our application's server will need to cryptographically sign the badge (to prove the badge was indeed generated through our application) before saving the output in Ceramic on the user's behalf.</p><p>Finally, ComposeDB adds a graph database interface on top of Ceramic, making it easy to query, filter, order, and more (using GraphQL) across high document volumes - an ideal fit for any teams who want to consume these badges and perform computation over them in an efficient manner.</p><p>We will go into more detail throughout this tutorial.</p> Getting Started <p>We have set up a special repository for you to help guide you through - keep in mind that we will need to add to it using the below steps for it to work.</p><p>Start by cloning the demo application repository and install your dependencies:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/walletconnect-tutorial
cd walletconnect-tutorial
npm install</code> <p>Go ahead and open the directory in your code editor of choice. If you take a look at your package.json file, you'll see our<code>@web3modal/wagmi</code> and <code>wagmi</code> packages mentioned above, as well as several <code>@ceramicnetwork</code> and <code>@composedb</code> packages to meet our storage needs.</p> Obtain a WalletConnect Project ID <p>While your dependencies are downloading, you can create a WalletConnect project ID (which we'll need to configure our Web3Modal - more information on <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/web3modal/nextjs/about?ref=blog.ceramic.network">their docs</a>). You can do so for free by visiting their <a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect Cloud</a> site, creating a new project (with the "App" type selected), and a name of your choosing:</p><p>After you click "Create" you will be directed to the settings page for the project you just set up. Go ahead and copy the alphanumeric value you see next to "Project ID."</p><p>Back in your text editor, navigate to your <code>/src/pages/_app.tsx</code> file and enter the ID you just copied into the blank field next to the <code>projectId</code> constant. Notice how we use this ID and a mainnet chain setting when defining our <code>wagmiConfig</code> (later used to create our Web3Modal). Just as the <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/web3modal/nextjs/about?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3Modal docs</a> instructed, we are setting up these functions outside our React components, and wrapping all child components with our <code>WagmiConfig</code> wrapper:</p> <code>const projectId = '&lt;your project ID&gt;'

const chains = [mainnet]
const wagmiConfig = defaultWagmiConfig({ chains, projectId })

createWeb3Modal({ wagmiConfig, projectId, chains })


const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;WagmiConfig config={wagmiConfig}&gt;
    &lt;ComposeDB&gt;
      &lt;Component {...pageProps} ceramic /&gt;
      &lt;/ComposeDB&gt;
    &lt;/WagmiConfig&gt;
  );
}

export default MyApp</code> <p>We can now make our Web3Modal button accessible to child components of our application to allow our users to sign in. If you take a look at <code>/src/components/nav.tsx</code>, you'll see that we placed our <code>&lt;w3m-button /&gt;</code> component directly into our navigation to allow users to sign in/out on any page of our application (at the moment our application only has 1 page). </p><p>Notice how we make use of the <code>size</code> and <code>balance</code> properties - these are two of several settings developers can use to further customize the modal's appearance. These two in particular are fairly simple to understand - one alters the size of the button, while the other hides the user's balance when the user is authenticated.</p><p>Finally, you probably noticed in your <code>/src/pages/_app.tsx</code> file that we're also utilizing a <code>&lt;ComposeDB&gt;</code> context wrapper. This is what we will explain next.</p> Create a ComposeDB Configuration <p>Now that we've created our Wagmi configuration, we will need to set up our ComposeDB data storage. There are several steps involved (all of which have been taken care of for you). These include:</p>  Designing the data models our application will need  Creating a local node/server configuration for this demo (in production)  Deploying our data models onto our node  Defining the logic our application will use to read from + write to our ComposeDB node  <p>Data Models</p><p>If you take a look at your <code>/composites</code> folder, you'll see an <code>/attendance.graphql</code> file where we've already defined the models our application will use. In ComposeDB, <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling?ref=blog.ceramic.network">data models</a> are GraphQL schema that contain the requirements for a single piece of data (a social post, for example), in addition to its relations to other models and accounts. Since Ceramic is an open data network, developers can build on preexisting data models (you can explore tools like <a href="https://scan.s3.xyz/models?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">S3</a> to observe existing schema), or define brand new ones for your app.</p><p>In our case, our application will leverage a general event interface that our two event types will implement:</p> <code>interface GeneralAttendance
  @createModel(description: "An interface to query general attendance") {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: String! @string(minLength: 42, maxLength: 42)
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
  timestamp: DateTime!
  jwt: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}

type EncryptionEvent implements GeneralAttendance
  @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "An encryption event attendance") {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: String! @string(minLength: 42, maxLength: 42)
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
  timestamp: DateTime!
  jwt: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}

type WalletEvent implements GeneralAttendance
  @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "A wallet event attendance") {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: String! @string(minLength: 42, maxLength: 42)
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
  timestamp: DateTime!
  jwt: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}</code> <p>Notice how we've set the <code>accountRelation</code> field for both types to "SINGLE" - what this means is that 1 user can only ever have 1 model instance of that type, thus creating a 1:1 account relationship. This is contrasted with "LIST" <code>accountRelation</code> which would indicate a 1:many relationship.</p><p>You'll also notice that our <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> fields do not use a <code>!</code> next to their scalar definition - what this means is that they are optional, so a model instance can be created with or without these fields defined.</p><p>Finally, we will use our <code>jwt</code> field to record the signed badge payload our server will create for the user. Since the user will ultimately be in control of their data, a potentially deceptive could try to change the values of their model instance outside the confines of our application. Seeing as our architecture requires a way for both our application and other conferences to read and verify this data, the <code>jwt</code> field will create tamper-evident proof against the values by tying the cryptographic signature of our application's DID together with the data.</p><p>Create a Local Server Configuration</p><p>Seeing as this is just a demo application and we don't have a cloud-hosted node endpoint to access, we will define a <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server?ref=blog.ceramic.network">server configuration</a> to run locally on our computer. While there are multiple <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server/server-configurations?ref=blog.ceramic.network">server settings</a> an application can leverage, the key items to know for this demo are the following:</p>  Our app will run <code>inmemory</code> whereas a production application will use <code>mainnet</code> for their network setting  Our server will define <code>sqlite</code> as our SQL index, whereas a production application would use <code>PostgreSQL</code>  Our IPFS will run in <code>bundled</code> mode (ideal for early prototyping), whereas a production application will run in <code>remote</code>  <p>Finally, each Ceramic node is configured with an admin DID used to authenticate with the node and perform tasks like deploying models. This is different from the DIDs end users will use when authenticating themselves using their wallet and writing data to the network.</p><p>Fortunately for you, we've taken care of this for you by creating a command. Simply run the following in your terminal once your dependencies are installed:</p> <code>npm run generate</code> <p>If you take a look at your <code>admin_seed.txt</code> file you will see the admin seed your Ceramic node will use. Your <code>composedb.config.json</code> file is where you'll find the server configuration you just created.</p><p>Deploying the Models onto Our Node</p><p>Seeing as we're not using a preexisting node endpoint that's already set up to index the data models we care about, we'll need a way to deploy our definitions onto our node. If you look at <code>/scripts/composites.mjs</code> you'll find a <code>writeComposite</code> method we've created for you that reads from our GraphQL file, creates an encoded runtime definition and deploys the composite onto our local node running on port 7007.</p><p>The important thing to take note of here is how the <code>writeEncodedCompositeRuntime</code> method generates a definition in our definition.js file. We will explain in the next step how this is used by our client-side library to allow our application to interact with these data models and our Ceramic node.</p><p>Don't take any action yet - we will explain how to use this script in the coming steps.</p><p>Integrating ComposeDB with Our Application</p><p>Finally, as mentioned above, we will need a way for our application to read from and write to our ComposeDB node. We will also need a way to combine our Web3Modal authentication logic with the need to authenticate users onto our node.</p><p>If you take a look at <code>/src/fragments/index.tsx</code> you'll find a <code>ComposeDB</code> component that allows us to utilize React's <code>createContext</code> hook and create a wrapper of our own. Since we know Web3Modal will make use of our wallet client, we can leverage the wallet client to request a Ceramic user session authentication from our user.</p><p>Observe the following:</p> <code>const CERAMIC_URL = process.env.URL ?? "http://localhost:7007";

/**
 * Configure ceramic Client &amp; create context.
 */
const ceramic = new CeramicClient(CERAMIC_URL);

const compose = new ComposeClient({
  ceramic,
  definition: definition as RuntimeCompositeDefinition,
});

let isAuthenticated = false;

const Context = createContext({ compose, isAuthenticated });

export const ComposeDB = ({ children }: ComposeDBProps) =&gt; {
  function StartAuth() {
    const { data: walletClient } = useWalletClient();
    const [isAuth, setAuth] = useState(false);

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
      async function authenticate(
        walletClient: GetWalletClientResult | undefined,
      ) {
        if (walletClient) {
          const accountId = await getAccountId(
            walletClient,
            walletClient.account.address,
          );
          const authMethod = await EthereumWebAuth.getAuthMethod(
            walletClient,
            accountId,
          );
          const session = await DIDSession.get(accountId, authMethod, {
            resources: compose.resources,
          });

          await ceramic.setDID(session.did as unknown as DID);
          console.log("Auth'd:", session.did.parent);
          localStorage.setItem("did", session.did.parent);
          setAuth(true);
        }
      }
      void authenticate(walletClient);
    }, [walletClient]);

    return isAuth;
  }

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    isAuthenticated = StartAuth();
  }

  return (
    &lt;Context.Provider value={{ compose, isAuthenticated }}&gt;
      {children}
    &lt;/Context.Provider&gt;
  );
};</code> <p>Notice how we're using the wallet client's account address to initiate a DID session that asks for specific resources from <code>compose</code>. If you track deeper, you'll see that <code>compose</code> was instantiated using the <code>definition</code> imported from the file our deployment script wrote into. This allows us to access a limited scope to write data on the user's behalf specifically for the data models our application uses (these sessions auto-expire after 24 hours).</p><p>Finally, to bring this full circle, back to our <code>/src/pages/_app.tsx</code> file, you should now understand how we're able to use <code>ComposeDB</code> as a contextual wrapper, enabling us to access both the ComposeDB client libraries and our model definitions from within any child component. For example, if you take a look at <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> you'll see how we're now able to utilize our <code>useComposeDB</code> hook that allows us to run queries against our node's client. </p> Create a Seed for our Application's Server DID <p>We mentioned above that we'll want our application to sign each badge payload before handing document control back to the end user. While this flow will not always be the case (read this blog on common <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/data-control-patterns-in-decentralized-storage/">data control patterns</a> in Ceramic for more), we'll want to implement this to ensure the verifiability of the data.</p><p>In <code>/src/pages/api/create.ts</code> we've created an API our application's server will expose that does exactly this - it intakes the data relevant to the event, uses a <code>SECRET_KEY</code> environment variable to instantiate a static DID, and returns a Base64 string-encoded JSON web signature containing the signed data.</p><p>We will therefore need to create a separate static seed to store in a .env file that we'll create:</p> <code>touch .env</code> <p>For this tutorial, enter the following key-value pair into your new file:</p><p><code>SECRET_KEY="11b574d316903ced6cc3f4787bbcc3047d9c72d1da4d83e36fe714ef785d10c1"</code></p><p>When you use the above seed to instantiate a DID, this will yield the following predictable did:</p><p><code>did:key:z6MkqusKQfvJm7CPiSRkPsGkdrVhTy8EVcQ65uB5H2wWzMMQ</code></p><p>If you look back into <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> you'll see how our lengthy <code>getParams</code> the method performs a quick check against any existing <code>EncryptionEvent</code> or <code>WalletEvent</code> badges the user already holds to test whether the <code>jwt</code> value was indeed signed by our application (a more thorough version of this could include verifying that the signed data matches the same values from the other fields, but we'll leave that up to you to add).</p><p>That's it! We are finally ready to run our application!</p> Running the Application <p>Now that we've set up everything we need for our app to run locally, we can start it up in developer mode. Be sure to select the correct node version first:</p> <code>nvm use 20
npm run dev</code> <p>Once you see the following in your terminal, your application is ready to view in your browser:</p><p>In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000 - you should see the following:</p> Signing in with Web3Modal <p>As mentioned above, we've made our Web3Modal accessible from our navigation which is where our "Connect Wallet" button is coming from. Go ahead and give this button a click and select your wallet of choice.</p><p>During the sign-in cadence, you will notice an additional authorization message appear in your wallet that looks something like this:</p><p>If you recall what we covered in the "Integrating ComposeDB with Our Application" section above, you'll remember that we discussed how we created a <code>DIDSession</code> by requesting authorization over the specific resources (data models) our application will be using. These are the 3 items listed under the "Resources" section of the sign-in request you should see. </p><p>Finally, after you've signed in, your Web3Modal will now show a truncated version of your address:</p> Creating Badges <p>As you can see, our application does not allow the user to input which event they have attended - this will be determined based on the URL the QR code sends the user with the following format:</p><p><a href="http://localhost:3000/?event=%7Bevent+id%7D&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000/?event={event id}</a></p><p>Take a look at your browser console - you should see logs that look similar to this:</p><p>We've preset these logs for you by reading from our runtime composite definition that we've imported into the <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> component. Go ahead and copy one of those fields and construct your URL to look something like this:</p><p><a href="http://localhost:3000/?event=kjzl6hvfrbw6c8njv24a3g4e3w2jsm5dojwpayf4pobuasbpvskv21vwztal9l2&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000/?event=kjzl6hvfrbw6c8njv24a3g4e3w2jsm5dojwpayf4pobuasbpvskv21vwztal9l2</a></p><p>If you've copied the stream ID corresponding to the <code>EncryptionEvent</code> model, your UI should now look something like this:</p><p>You can optionally select to share your coordinates. Finally, go ahead and create a badge for whichever event you entered into your URL:</p><p>If you navigate back to your <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> file you can observe what's happening in <code>createBadge</code>. After calling our <code>/api/create</code> route (which uses our application server's static DID to sign the event data), we're performing a mutation query that creates an instance of whichever event aligns with the identifier you used in your URL parameter. Since our user is the account currently authenticated on our node (from the creation of our DID session), the resulting document is placed into the control of the end user (with our tamper-evident signed data entered into the <code>jwt</code> field). </p><p>If you take a look at our <code>getParams</code> method in our <code>/src/components/index.tsx</code> file, you'll notice that we've created a query against our ComposeDB node that runs both within our <code>useEffect</code> React hook as well as after every badge creation event. Notice how we're querying based on the user's did:pkh: <code>did:pkh:eip155:${chainId}:${address?.toLowerCase()}</code></p><p>If you take a look at our <code>chainId</code> and <code>address</code> assignments, you'll realize these are coming from our Wagmi hooks we mentioned we'd need (specifically <code>useAccount</code> and <code>useChainId</code>). </p> What's Next? <p>We hope you've enjoyed this fairly straightforward walk-through of how to use WalletConnect's Web3Modal toolkit for authenticating users, creating user sessions in Ceramic, and querying ComposeDB based on the authenticated user!

<p>In today’s fast-moving business world, it’s important for different systems to work well together, and having standard data formats helps a lot with this. This article investigates how the EmployeeID is used, which is a key part of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). The adoption group from DIDAS has worked on making sure this EmployeeID follows a set standard. Thanks to their work, we can now see how the EmployeeID can be used in real situations and think about how it can be used more in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demonstrating Real-World Applications&nbsp;</p>
<p>The practicality of the EmployeeID VC was tested in real-world scenarios by organizations SBB, AXA, Orell Füssli, and Swisscom. Together they showed the power of an interoperable eco system based on the credential “EmployeeID”. These demos showcased varied applications:&nbsp;</p>
 
 SBB: Used the VC for external partners to access internal IT systems, replacing traditional username/password methods.&nbsp; 
 AXA: Employed the VC to verify employment status for online insurance offerings.&nbsp; 
 Orell Füssli &amp; Swisscom: Utilized the VC to offer employee discounts in online shopping.&nbsp; 
 
<p>More information here: <a href="https://digitaltrust.swisscom.ch/en/das-potenzial-von-digitalen-nachweisen-aus-dem-privatsektor-erfolgreich-getestet/">Successfully testing the potential of digital evidence from the private sector</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Collaboration: The Key to Adoption&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the primary goals was to ensure that the EmployeeID could seamlessly integrate into various ecosystems. This required a standardized approach that would allow different systems and organizations to interact without compatibility issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process was not an isolated endeavor. It involved a collaborative effort from experts and stakeholders across different industries. By pooling their knowledge and insights, the group could identify and agree on the most relevant and sustainable attributes. This collaborative approach was instrumental in developing a schema that was not only effective for the present but also robust enough to stand the test of time and technological evolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The outcome of these pre-implementation discussions was a well-thought-out, standardized EmployeeID schema. This schema serves as a testament to the importance of foresight and collaboration in the digital age. By addressing the need for standardization and futureproofing at the initial stages, the EmployeeID schema was positioned to be an enduring and versatile tool, capable of adapting to the ever-changing business and technological landscapes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EmployeeID Schema&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EmployeeID schema incorporates various attributes, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Employee Core: A blend of personal and employer data.&nbsp; 
 Employment Contract: Key contractual information like contract type and working hours.&nbsp; 
 Role: The employee’s role and organizational unit.&nbsp; 
 Office Address: The physical office location.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Authorization: Specific access rights issued as separate VCs.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While many attributes are initially represented as free text in the logical schema, they should ideally be derived from predefined lists or tables for specific implementations. This becomes especially critical when exchanging information with other organizations, necessitating mutually agreed-upon value sets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detailed Schema: <a href="https://didasswiss.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/DIDASMembers/EcxwlWwuKbFCqu09DvSGd2QBK8cscFfDHJA3zP9WUzMxeQ?e=e3Ltup">Detailed Schema of EmployeID</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion&nbsp;</p>
<p>For organizations exploring use cases with SSI or sandbox environments, it’s crucial to engage with the DIDAS adoption group. This collaboration will help define a standard for your verifiable credentials, ensuring a unified approach and compatibility across different ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, the adoption of a standardized EmployeeID schema, as illustrated by DIDAS adoption group, is not just a technical necessity but a strategic move towards interoperability and efficiency in the digital age.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Yet to date, there is no known scheme considered truly interoperable across borders. SIDI Hub was was conceived as a community to accelerate the path to cross-border interoperability.</p><p>SIDI Hub held its first summit at TRUSTECH 2023. DIF was one of the event organizers, alongside our liaison partners including the Open ID Foundation, Open Identity Exchange, FIDO and Open Wallet Foundation. </p><p>120+ digital identity experts from governments, multilaterals, standards organizations, and non-profits representing 22 countries attended. Over 90% of participants agreed that the work started at the summit must continue in 2024. In response, the SIDI Hub community has defined the following work plan:</p>  Identifying champion use cases for cross-border interoperability that serve as baseline for all workstreams  Defining minimum interoperability requirements for priority use cases  Mapping trust frameworks across jurisdictions  Defining metrics of success  <p>The group is organizing a series of virtual and in-person meetings this year to progress the roadmap, and invites all organizations involved in the development, adoption and implementation of digital identity solutions to add their voice to this important work.

The project was established in 2018 at the International Institute for Information Technology in Bangalore. Today, over 100 million citizens in 11 countries are registered on MOSIP-based systems. </p><p>The&nbsp;inaugural MOSIP Connect promises to bring together technologists, policy makers and civil society groups for in-depth discussions and collaboration on inclusive digital identity systems. Participants will learn how digital identity empowers citizens and promotes inclusion, explore how MOSIP addresses concerns around data protection, privacy, and consent, and benefit from networking opportunities.</p> 🗓️ ️Community Events <p>Digital Switzerland</p><p>DIF’s Executive Director, Kim Hamilton Duffy, participated in a panel discussion on the importance of digital identity wallets alongside Beat Jans, the new Head of Switzerland’s Federal Ministry of Justice, who is responsible for the country’s digital identity policy, Stephan Wolf, the outgoing CEO of GLEIF and Daniel Goldscheider, founder of DIF's liaison partner, the Open Wallet Foundation.</p><p>The panel was convened after Mr Jans decided to visit the host event, Digital Switzerland, which took place in Davos recently, at short notice.</p><p>A Swiss E-ID was proposed to voters but rejected in 2021 due to fears that citizens could be tracked during verification, and that private companies would collect and store their data in centralized databases. Subsequent revisions focused on addressing these issues, with Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles taking center stage.&nbsp;</p><p>During the panel discussion, Kim pointed out that much of the unnecessary personal data sharing that typically accompanies customer onboarding is due to the lack of a strong digital identity. Conversely, digital identity based on open standards and SSI principles avoids data oversharing by design. It also offers powerful new economic opportunities, by providing the means to share a wide range of identity data in a privacy-preserving way.&nbsp;</p><p>Kim highlighted the opportunity for “reusable identity”, tying it to improved onboarding enabled by decentralized identity standards, and described how Verifiable Credentials (VCs) provide an ‘envelope’ that can store messages ranging from government-backed Identity data to competencies or skills certifications.&nbsp;</p><p>“Once relying parties trust that the envelope securely wraps and conveys one type of message, it opens the door for others, which offer some of the most exciting, potentially transformative signifiers of trust," she said after the event.</p><p>“Risks of AI were also an urgent topic of discussion. Indeed the waves of disinformation are getting bigger and coming faster as it becomes easier and cheaper to exploit the possibilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and deepfakes. Decentralized identity architectures enable harnessing the benefits of AI but with a stronger, more trustworthy foundation. The standards were designed to apply to Non Person Entities (NPEs) as well as natural persons. So for example, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VC) can establish a chain of trust demonstrating an AI agent is acting on behalf of a natural person.” </p><p>DIF Hackathon Winners share their insights and experiences </p><p>DIF caught up with Ken Watanbe, whose team's submission for the DIF Hackathon scooped first place in the TBD (Block) and Trinsic sponsor challenges, as well as winning second place in the main DIF prize pool.  </p><p>You can read about the team's innovative use of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs) to enable a real-world use case within their university premises <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/guest-blog-ken-watanabe-anonymous-door-unlocking-project/">here</a>. </p><p>We also spoke to Harsh Tyagi, whose team developed HealthX Protocol, winning third place in the DIF Hackathon main prize pool, as well as third place in the TBD (Block) sponsored challenge.</p><p>Read the interview with Harsh <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/heatlhx-protocol/">here</a>. </p><p>Finally, Edward Curran told us about his path to the Hackathon, how he found developing TrustBox using Veramo and his experience of participating in the DIF community.

 Innovating Energy: Digital Identities at the Core of Transformation <p>ZUG, Switzerland — January 31, 2024, The German Energy Agency Deutsche Energy Agentur (DENA), has announced a partnership with Energy Web, Forschungsstelle für Energiewirtschaft e.V. Oli Systems, KILT Protocol, Fieldfisher, and Fraunhofer FIT to launch DIVE — “Digital Identities as Trust Anchors in the Energy System.” DIVE is set to redefine the energy sector in Germany, leveraging the potential of digital identities to integrate and manage renewable energies in a decentralized landscape.</p><p>The Energy System Transformation<br>As part of the urgent effort to achieve climate neutrality, Germany is embracing a massive expansion of renewable energies. This shift is leading to a decentralized energy system with an increasing number of small scale renewable energy facilities prolifterating including wind turbines, solar parks, batteries, electric vehicles, and distributed rooftop solar installations. In this new landscape, consumer choice and seamless integration to various use cases like tracing renewable energy, using customer-owned assets for grid services or selecting a different supplier is vital for efficient energy management.</p><p>Introducing Digital Identities for Trust and Efficiency<br>At the heart of the DIVE project lies a critical objective — establishing secure and reliable digital identities for devices and systems within the energy sector. These digital identities act as trust anchors, verifying the existence and capabilities of each system in real time. By automating verification processes, DIVE allows device owners to choose and change the electricity use cases that their devices are participating in almost no time and little effort, ensuring grid stability and cost savings for energy consumers.</p><p>Energy Web plays a central role in the DIVE project, contributing expertise and technology to two working packages:</p><p>Digital Applications in Proof Management Energy Web is taking the lead in developing and implementing use cases related to electricity labeling and verification. This includes the use of digital identities in conjunction with the registry and exploring energy industry use cases and their links to the identity register. Additionally, Energy Web’s contribution involves extending its existing open-source Green Proofs solution to connect to the digital trust anchors of DIVE and leveraging the substrate-based Energy Web X chain&nbsp;(EWX).</p><p>Energy Web’s Green Proofs solution enables trustworthy device identities to connect with different registers for guarantees of origin. This empowers devices to freely choose and switch between standards and marketplaces without encountering compliance issues like double spending. Energy Web aims to support existing standards and platforms, such as EnergyTag, Energy Track&amp;Trace (an Elia Group platform in collaboration with energinet and Elering), GO, REC, I-REC, and the German guarantees of origin register (Herkunftsnachweisregister — HKNR).</p><p>Furthermore, Energy Web continues to advance the development of its “Fast Change of Supplier for EV Charging Stations” solution (<a href="https://innovation.eliagroup.eu/en/projects/rebeam">ReBeam</a>). Initially tested with Elia Group &amp; 50Hertz Transmission in Berlin during the summer of 2022, the project now integrates with DIVE to enhance security and confidence in the entire process. This integration ultimately allows the consumption of self-generated PV power at public charging stations.</p><p>Smart Contract Library In addition, Energy Web will develop standardized representation and description forms for smart contracts under DIVE. This includes classification within the energy industry context, ensuring implementation-independent descriptions of inputs, outputs, conditions, and logic of smart contracts. The establishment of a “Smart Contract Register” as an “App Store” for decentralized applications and logic devices, along with the provision of smart contracts under free licenses, will set the groundwork for an independent technology library.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>What led you to start working with Decentralized Identity?&nbsp;</p><p>I studied computer science at university and wrote my dissertation on Bitcoin, as well as developing using Hyperledger Fabric, so I’ve been in the Web3 world for a while.</p><p>After uni I got involved in a research project looking into how the mortgage application process could be improved, as part of a knowledge transfer partnership between a university and a bank.</p><p>Applying for a mortgage is slow and painful, so streamlining it should make it better for customers and cheaper for the bank. The number of parties — including buyer and seller, lenders, conveyancers, estate agents, credit reference agencies and the Land Registry — made us think “This seems like a problem blockchain can help to solve”.&nbsp;</p><p>However when we spoke to the parties involved, it became clear the core challenge is a data problem. There’s a need to securely exchange data about the property and the participants. That’s not easy, as a lot of the information is private.</p><p>All the guidance was, “Don’t put personal information on the blockchain”. So we searched around and learned about SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). We visited the Rebuilding the Web of Trust (RWOT) conference and got excited. We thought, “This seems like the right way to do it”.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point I realised I wanted to work in decentralized identity, so I moved to Berlin and worked at Jolocom.&nbsp;</p><p>Tell us about TrustBox, please &nbsp;</p><p>I’m not the only one who’s seen these problems with the property buying process. After I returned to the UK I got involved with the Property Data Trust Framework, which is a group of financial institutions, conveyancers and other industry participants working together to standardise data schemas.&nbsp;</p><p>I came in to try to find a way to standardise the data exchange using VCs. To do that, you need to know who’s allowed to issue and verify certain things, so I started looking into the DIF Trust Establishment specification, which is when I saw the publicity for the DIF Hackathon.&nbsp;</p><p>I thought “I can build something using Trust Establishment”. Initially I was looking at the organizational side. If each organization has a DID, they can recognize each other. I was less clear how it would work for buyers and sellers. DIDs are quite an abstract concept for people to get their heads around.&nbsp;</p><p>People do most of their research on the web, and I liked the idea of mimicking the SSL padlock (the icon displayed by browsers when visiting a secure website) so it verifies a site is part of the Property Data Trust Framework. So we developed a browser extension called TrustSight, building on existing work around DID configurations (used to cryptographically link a DID to a domain).</p><p>We also built a tool for deploying trust frameworks, and a tool to visualize trust relationships.</p><p>Why did you choose to develop using Veramo?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s tricky maintaining all these DIDs and DID configurations. There's a package by Sphereon around DID configurations, but it doesn’t provide any tooling around issuing or verifying credentials.</p><p>I was struggling to get the browser extension to work with JSON LD libraries, so I decided to use Veramo for DID and VC related operations and connect to the Sphereon resolver.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s made my life much easier, particularly if I want to use a new DID method or different VC formats.</p><p>What user benefits are you targeting?&nbsp;</p><p>As a buyer, ideally you’d apply to a hundred different lenders in order to get the best deal. However, it’s currently too expensive for lenders to do the checks. As a result, each buyer can really only apply for one mortgage, so people are very conservative about what they are looking for, to ensure they secure a mortgage. </p><p>We’re aiming to make the mortgage application process quicker and easier, and to ensure people get the right product for them.&nbsp;</p><p>How was your experience of participating in the Hackathon?&nbsp;</p><p>It was very well-organised. The criteria and timelines were all clear. I really enjoyed the Discord server. Some people were very active there, which made it feel like a community. I also liked the talks that were put on.</p><p>It was great to get to the end and see everyone’s submissions, and to feel connected and part of the community.&nbsp;</p><p>What next for TrustBox?&nbsp;</p><p>There is some tooling on the Trust Framework side that doesn’t yet exist, so I’d like to work with DIF on that.&nbsp;</p><p>Downloading a browser extension is still quite a big piece of user friction, ultimately you want to get into the browser itself. That’s one to discuss with the browser companies! </p>
